There was no call for breakfast from her father or her brother, no sound of them moving about. For now she just thought they had something special planned, but she didn't realise just how special it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon going downstairs and into the kitchen she habitually said. \"Morn...\" She was stunned to see nobody there but her breakfast had already been served and steam was still coming off. She sat down to start, wondering what was going on, as she ate she looked down to see a formation on the tabletop spelling 'Happy Birthday' in her native Japanese. She found a sweet thought until she took a closer look. This was certainly a surprise and a shock. There was a whole team of maids one-fiftieth normal size on the tabletop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday, Empress Sakura!\" They cried out.</span></div></div>",

She knew what she had to do and she was determined to make her rule as moral as she could fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" She finished, \"Thank you very much, father.\" She then set him back down on the tabletop and continued with her breakfast.

She reached for the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you please, great Empress.\" One of the maids announced. \"Allow us to attend to the dishes.\" Sakura looked at them and at her empty breakfast plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how can you manage dishes this big?\" She asked with concern.

Each of the edges was marked out by a key feature; in the North high hills gave way to a great river, in the East a tall mountain range rose up, in the South another great river flowed along the edge of a forest and, in the West, open sea was in evidence. This was her kingdom. Sakura quickly found her home marked out as 'The Imperial Palace', which was about seven miles North-East of the capital, which in turn sat beside a long winding river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took out the book next before she had a look at the other map. It seemed a standard explanatory work but there were lines that had names written over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Miss Kinomoto Sakura,</i> The words read, <i>Thank you for your patronage of the new Twin Bells Giantess Government Service. This book will help you work out how your nation works and what principles both you and your subjects are recommended to adhere to for best results. Every nation that acquires a giantess as their ruler will have many perks from this in terms of national security and stability of government. However you may find some under your rule who won't settle down and may attempt to drive you out of authority or worse; in these cases you are at liberty to punish them however you see fit. If you can't work out how far somewhere is in your kingdom just take the distance on the map and divide by fifty, don't worry if this doesn't take roads and rivers into account as most of these you can easily step over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nation over which you rule shall take on whatever name you choose to give it. The names of the various towns and villages within your lands are marked out on the map of your nation as provided but you are entitled to change these names at any time. Please do not expand your borders as those lands will either be under the rule of another giantess, have the potential to become so or may overstretch your distance of travel.</i> Sakura paused and double-checked the map. It seemed that her home was almost slap-bang in the centre of this nation. <i>The political authority of your mortal subjects will follow the setup they've been using before your arrival but you can change it and its overall structure at any time. Most countries selected for giantess-rule have sufficient resources to be self-sustaining but it's recommended that you seek trading partners as soon as you are comfortable with diplomacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you wish to return to your hometown at any time, please step through the extra door provided and you'll return to our reception area.</i> This continued for a while, detailing her authority to choose what system of currency her subjects could use, what systems of measurement they'd have and what title she could have; apparently 'Empress' was the default. Once she had finished the instructions she found that most of the book was a set of forms that she could fill out to constitutionalise her every decision in ruling this land.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It started off as another normal day at the Constant Magick Academy, and the students were once again out on the the field to conduct another lesson in mana control. As usual, Akuto Sai and Junko Hattori were paired up for the exercise. Junko began charging a ball of magical energy between her hands and prepared to toss it to Akuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sai, I'm gonna pass you the ball now... You had better not blow me up again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkuto simply sighed and rubbed the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's not my fault that I can't control my powers completely yet... I bet that you would have trouble keeping your power under control too if you were the demon king!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please! I bet I could <i>at least</i> avoid turning a little ball of mana like this into a nuclear bomb!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it <i>were</i> a nuclear bomb, then you would never have survived the blast...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Hattori, I get it... But isn't that the whole point of this lesson? To learn how to control mana properly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever... But if you start to lose control again, then could you <i>please</i> aim the ball somewhere else this time?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkuto simply nodded and allowed Junko to toss the ball of magic energy to him. As usual, he caught the ball with ease; and as usual, his overwhelming mana began to make the ball go out of control. Seeing this, Junko quickly ducked for cover. Unfortunately for her, Akuto wasn't able to redirect the blast in time, and she ended up being hit by the ball of mana as it exploded violently on contact. However, unlike usual, the explosion was rather small this time and Junko was able to remain conscious. She immediately got to her feet again and angrily drew her katana. She swiftly swung it right under Akuto's chin, the cold steel mere inches from his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I just say to you! You were supposed to aim the ball <i>away</i> from me if you lost control again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkuto nervously pushed the blade away from his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to, but I just couldn't do it in time. Hey, at least the blast was a lot smaller this time... Maybe I'm getting a little bit better at controlling my powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired maiden quickly sheathed her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I <i>am</i> still conscious this time... I guess I'll forgive you for it just this once-Ugh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Junko fell to her knees, clutching her head in pain. Akuto panicked and ran up next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Junko, are you okay?! What's wrong?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached out to place his hand on Junko's shoulder, but she quickly slapped it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akuto... Get away from me... NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkuto was very worried now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Junko?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no time... I can feel something happening to my body... Please, just get to somewhere far away from me... Someplace safe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkuto didn't know what was going on, but he understood that Junko was worried about his well-being. Giving her a quick nod, Akuto began to run in the opposite direction. By now, all of the other students and teachers had retreated as well, and were nervously watching their class rep from inside the building. What happened next frightened even Akuto himself: The young Junko Hattori was beginning to grow! Everyone watched in awe as the blue-haired girl began to increase in size before their very eyes. Junko was growing at an incredible speed. She quickly reached 10 feet tall, then 25, then 50, and then 100! It seemed for a moment as if she was going to keep growing forever, but her growth soon began to slow down. 125 feet, 135, 140, 145... When she stopped growing at last, Junko Hattori was standing at an unbelievable 150 feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his closest friend now towering over the entire school building itself, Akuto was visibly nervous. Yet, he knew Junko better than anyone else, and he knew that she would never hurt anyone. Slowly he walked up to her massive form and stared up at her. Junko knelt down and grinned at the small demon king before plucking him between her thumb and index finger. She then placed him in the palm of her hand and looked down on him with a mischievous smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well... What do I have here? A naughty little demon king trying to get a quick peek up my skirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkuto blushed at this comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, Junko! I was just worried about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, that's sweet... But don't worry, I think I really like this new size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that I'm gonna be the new queen of this academy from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! But Junko-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkuto was cut off by Junko placing her finger over his mouth to silence him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little Akuto, I'm not going to hurt you... _______________.\"</span></div></div>",

She'd been jogging some time before, looking over her citizens; each gave a bow as she came across, as directed. They always had to be in top condition, on guard in case of an invasion- or, in case Prussia tried to become an independent nation again, and went around crushing random buildings. Germany was determined to set an example to her people, and thus, set up a strict exercise routine. Besides, a ruler had to keep appearances- a shapely ruler would be both intimidating to other women, and able to gain diplomatic advantages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jacket wrapped across her waist, she'd worked up a bit of a sweat, and was about to consider taking a 7-second beer break. When, in an instant, a familiar, irritating screech sounded out across the German land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Germany! Hey, GERMANY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding of booted feet crashed through the quiet countryside. The land of great poets and thinkers, ruined by this woman's careless treading... From afar, Germany couldn't help but sigh, rubbing the bridge of her nose. Italy, her southern neighbor. With her casual smile, messy hair, and relaxed slouch, it was hard to believe she could be the queen of anything- much less the granddaughter of Rome, the great conqueror. Germany wondered: was there a single nation in Europe who hadn't occupied Italy at one time or another? Even that sissy France had taken her over once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuildings that her people had worked so hard to build, turned to ashes... As the queens were finally close enough, she called out again. \"Ciao, salve, buongiorno, Germany! I decided to come over for a visit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her arms, the blonde queen stared directly at her. \"Italy... You're standing on the marketplace, you dummkopf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked, Italy looked down at the debris by her boots. She took a step back, panicking, struggling to apologize to the people- before tripping over a building behind her. Her backside made a mighty rumbling as it hit the ground, destroying the homes of dozens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Germany marched over to reach for her. If it wasn't one thing with this girl, it was another... Yet, there was some odd charm about her. As she propped the visiting queen up, dusting her off, she stared directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Italy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahaha, it's a funny story- I'm in a biiiit of a financial crisis. It's nothing big, but I thought, hey, maybe I'd take this as an opportunity to have some fun with my best sis, and get some trades going while I'm at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Germany's shock, she reached into her clothes- and pulled out a bunch of noblemen, shivering, dazed from the journey. Some had even traveled in her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I even brought a whole bunch of friends! So, whaddya say, huh, Germany? We can have siestas together, eat pasta- it'll be a party!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wanda was once again caught indulging the stupidity of Cosmo and Timmy. Granted their shenanigans weren't nearly as inexcusable as Timmy's Parents were. She rather despised how wrongfully they mistreated Timmy. Not to mention she did hold a grudge against them - in the past, Timmy requested that she and Cosmo pose as new friends for them...and needless to say, their rude and otherwise life-threatening behavior towards the two of them was...undesirable. She remembered combing through Da Rule Book to see if there was a Rule against Eliminating the God-Child's parents...She begrudgingly found one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she didn't deny that she cared for Timmy - he gave her the greatest gift anyone could ever get her. He wished for her and Cosmo to have a Fairy-Baby - Poof. It was a remarkable wish that Wanda remembered fondly as one of her favorites that Timmy ever made. Unfortunately, such a wish would never be made again, as immediately after, Jorgen made wishing for a Fairy Baby to be Against Da Rules...She often wondered how he was able to do that.<br>\r\nBut undoubtedly she loved Timmy - and if the way she and Cosmo were able to take care of Poof was any indication, than they would certainly make better guardians for Timmy. If only the parents weren't in the way of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Wanda?\" Wanda suddenly snapped out of her thinking when Timmy called to her. She saw that he and Cosmo had stopped playing their game. \"What time is it?\" Timmy asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda lightly bounced Poof in her arms while she pulled out her wand. With a wave, she made a clock magically appear. \"It's 11 o'clock, Sport,\" she answered using her pet-name for Timmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, that was quite a work-out Timmy,\" Cosmo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pleased that you guys are actually playing outside instead of inside playing Videogames,\" Wanda commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Timmy said with a frown. His stomach betrayed a growl. \"I'm pretty hungry. But it's past 10:30 and I can't make any breakfast wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, sorry Timmy but those are the Rules,\" Wanda said. \"How about a nice Sandwich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES PLEASE!\" Cosmo suddenly said bouncing over Timmy's head. He raised his own wand and pooffed himself up a large hero sandwich and proceeded to eat it all in one bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda - what is it with Da Rules anyway?\" Timmy asked. \"I understand that some are meant to protect the world from stupid wishes. But why have something as frivolous as 'No Breakfast Wishes before 10:30 AM?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't make Da Rules, Sport; I just have to follow them,\" Wanda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...Who does make Da Rules?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo burped after finishing his sandwich, making Poof laugh. \"That would be Jorgen, Timmy. He makes all the Rules AND Enforces them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I get that Jorgen is 'The Most Powerful Fairy in the Universe' but I just don't get how he can just write Da Rules. If he could, then he would potentially be able to do anything he wants. Sometimes it seems like Da Rules keep him in check just as much as any other fairy. I don't buy it. Maybe there's something else that determines what goes into Da Rules; something that's even stronger than Jorgen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh - Maybe it's Wanda's cooking; few things are more powerful than that!\" Cosmo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda sneered at Cosmo for that comment at her expense. But then she noticed that Timmy actually looked like he was thinking something over. Whenever Timmy started getting curious about something like this, it meant that things would soon be headed for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - can we take a field trip to Fairy World to find out where Da Rules come from?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw Sport - I was planning to take Poof for a walk in the Park,\" Wanda whined, trying to get out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Wish we were in Fairy World!\" Timmy said excitedly with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda sighed and raised her wand. She had a feeling that this was going to lead to trouble.</span></div></div>",

I can be very persuasive. I'm sure Jorgen will see it my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!\" Jorgen suddenly shouted - his booming voice shaking the foundations of his Bunker. He suddenly pointed the index finger of his large masculine arm toward Timmy's scared and intimidated face. \"You will NEVER know the secret inner-workings of Da Rule Book, Turner! Some things are not meant for the eyes of a Human God-Child! And besides, knowing you, you'd probably screw everything up! Why would I possibly tell you anything?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" Cosmo said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Because we asked nicely?\" Timmy answered timidly. \"We just want to know if you really do decide what goes in Da Rule Book. Because if you do, why haven't you taken advantage of it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TURNER!!!\" Jorgen shouted. \"The Von Strangle Family Secret is a tradition that I have upheld for Millennia. Do you honestly think that I would be irresponsible enough to abuse my authority for my own benefit?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always used to do it when I first met you,\" Timmy said matter-of-factly. \"In fact you used to abuse and bully your God-Children, once kidnapped and drained all the magic from the Fairies in the world to your own Wand, AND for the first few months I met you, you seemed to be obsessed with making me loose my Godparents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Well yes,\" Jorgen began to say knowing that he'd been caught. \"I was far more strict back then. But I think I've more than mellowed out since I married the Tooth Fairy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which - how Is Mrs. Von Strangle now a days?\" Timmy asked. \"I think I have some information regarding your previous God-Children that she'd be VERY interested in.\" Timmy suddenly revealed photographs of Jorgen with a small and timid child who appeared with him at the Fairy-Awards. The child looked like he was missing a few teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DYAAAAAH! HOW DID YOU GET THOSE TURNER! HAND THEM OVER, NOW!!!\" Jorgen shouted, now in near panic at the vulnerable position that Timmy had caught him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have them; destroy them if you like - I have copies...At home...Under a Butterfly Net,\" Timmy said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on Jorgen's face was a mixture of straining rage and fearful panic. He suddenly leaned down toward Timmy and pointed at him and said, \"Turner...you have been a pain in my butt since you first got Cosmo and Wanda...And I look forward to the day where you finally grow up and loose them...And I never have to deal with you again...Forever...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it we have a deal,\" Timmy said with that same grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Turner...I will reveal to you the Von Strangle Family Secret!\" Jorgen said leaning upright again. He raised his large Wand and slammed it on the ground before them. Suddenly his copy of Da Rule Book appeared before him. He took it in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jorgen took his Da Rule Book and brought it over to a portrait of himself that he kept on the wall at the far-side of his bunker. He moved it on its hinges to reveal a rectangle shaped hole behind it. He brought up his hand and put the book inside. Once inside, the magic from the book flowed into the wall. Suddenly creases on the concrete wall were revealed and the large slab suddenly slid open revealing a staircase behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorgen tapped his wand on the ground again, and the star began to glow red. He turned toward the group behind him and said, \"Wands on; Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo and Wanda lit up their wands in the similar fashion as Jorgen as he began to lead them down the stairs. The staircase was long and winding and seemed to lead into some kind of dark underground cavern. Jorgen began to explain what all of this meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eons ago, before the Time of the Darkness, the Elder Fairies knew to guard - above all other things - the most sacred artifact from the Dawn of Fairy History; The Sacred Text of Da Rule Maker...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da Rule Maker?\" Timmy asked behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is said that at the Dawn of Time, there was a Guardian of All Creation who created Fairy World and all of the Fairies in it, as a means of watching over Mankind. He is the one who gave us all our Magical Powers. But he understood, that without a way to properly Check and Balance the Fairies Magic, that some fairies would use it irresponsibly and use it to conquer all of the Universe. So he passed down a Sacred Document with a series of Rules to prevent Fairies from using their magic improperly so that Fairies would learn to use their Magic Responsibly. And from that moment on, he was known as Da Rule Maker...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's the one where all of Da Rules come from?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and No,\" Jorgen answered as they continued down the steps. \"You see - he created the first sacred doctrine of Magical Law and set it upon the Fairies, basically making the foundations for Fairy Law; why we take care of Godchildren, or why we cannot use magic to kill. But after leaving the first generation of Fairies the sacred document, he vanished. They say he now exists beyond Time itself. And when he did leave, the Elder Fairies were put in charge of guarding the text. When the Darkness and the Eliminators first invaded, the Elder Fairies had to relinquish the task to another. And ever since, the Von Strangle family have held the responsibility....Here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group finally came to the bottom of the staircase. The chamber was dark until suddenly a large light in the center came on. It revealed that the ground they stood on was a circle with a large pit in the center. And levitating in the pit was the largest copy of Da Rule Book they had ever laid eyes on. It was large enough that they could stand upon the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the original copy of Da Rules - the Sacred Document that Da Rule Maker passed down to our people. The Original Book from which all copies come - to be held by each individual fairy in Fairy World,\" Jorgen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Timmy said slowly stepping toward the edge to the pit to get a closer look at the large purple book. \"So wait...if this is the original volume of Da Rules, then how is it that you can add rules to it - like the \"No Wishing for Christmas Everyday\" or \"No Wishing for Fairy Babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah - that is the Most important part. You see, when Da Rule Maker gave us the Sacred Text, he left us with a way to Amend and Add to Da Rules...\" Jorgen said. Suddenly he looked up above the book, prompting the group to do the same. Up above was were two magically sealed glass cylinders, inside the smaller of which was a beautiful artifact. Hovering in the center was a Wand with a long red handle, ending in a golden star. Beneath the star was a kind of hilt made of blue wings. It was a wand like no other.<br>\r\n\"Da Rule Maker's Wand,\" Jorgen continued. \"The only tool in Existence that can edit the pages of Da Rules. Watch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJorgen waved his wand. Suddenly, the inner most glass cylinder began to slide downward and the outer most cylinder began to rise, leaving the wand hovering in air. Jorgen reached up his hand and took the wand. It appeared so tiny in comparison to his enormous hands. He waved the wand and the large Rule Book opened up. It's pages began to roll back until the page with the final rule added to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cosmo, Wanda - take out your copy of Da Rules,\" Jorgen ordered. The two fairies did as he said - their copy appearing before them open to that page. Jorgan began to slowly pass Da Rule Keeper's Wand over the blank page. And suddenly, words marked in dark ink began to print themselves across the blank space remaining on the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let it be Decreed that Blackmail of a Fairy by a Godchild is a Crime punishable by the Loss and/or Dismissal of a Fairy Godparent(s).</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Cosmo and Wanda's copy, they viewed that the words suddenly appeared, letter by letter in their book too. Timmy read the entire thing.<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon Jorgen!\" Timmy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA-HA! You tempted me to use Da Rules for my own gain Turner. Perhaps you should've known better. You see - NO one controls Jorgen Von Strangle. Now hand over those photographs, or loose your fairies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft - Fine Jorgen,\" Timmy said handing over his incriminating photographs. \"I'll destroy the copies I have when I get back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good - now all is as it should be,\" Jorgen said taking the photos and burning them with the light from his own wand. He raised his hand giving Da Rule Maker's Wand a push back up toward the case. The cylinders closed shut around it. \"Now - I hope you all are satisfied, and now it is time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well - thanks for showing us this place Jorgen; it actually was kind of fun,\" Timmy said turning toward the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this goes without saying, Turner; but NO one can know about this. If anyone knew the location of Da Rule Maker's Wand and the Original Text, then the fate of the whole universe would be in Grave Danger,\" Jorgen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - I've kept a lid on my secret of having fairies for more than Fifty years, I'm sure I can keep this hidden,\" Timmy said walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey-Hey-Hey!\" Jorgen began snapping. \"You're lucky you still have your fairies after that little Secret-Wish Stunt, Turner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo and Poof flew above Timmy as he proceeded up the staircase. Jorgen was about to follow, however, Wanda stayed behind, thinking about some things. She suddenly beckoned to Jorgen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jorgen...you sure have joked about Timmy loosing us a lot today,\" Wanda said. \"You don't...really want him to be without Fairies, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda...he is responsible for more amendments to Da Rules than any Godchild in the History of Fairy World,\" Jorgen said. \"The day he is finally ready to no longer have fairies, will mean less headaches for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about all the good Timmy has done? Sure he has caused a lot of trouble, but he's saved Earth AND Fairy World countless times. He's the Chosen One who defeated the Darkness and the Eliminators.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm - you have a point,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also...Jorgen. It's...commonplace to know that when a child looses their Fairy Godparents,\" Wanda began. \"Then...all of the magic that they've influenced...all of the things they've done...all the things they've wished for...They're undone and the memory of them is erased as if it never was. Would that mean that...Lighting the Darkness would never happen? Or that...Poof...would disappear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" Jorgen began to think. \"Well...there would be a few minor setbacks. But yes. Everything that Turner has ever wished for or accomplished will be erased from existence. The only thing that will remain in tact are Da Rules that he has caused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda was absolutely taken aback by this. Jorgen basically told her that should Timmy ever loose her or Cosmo...then Poof would vanish from existence. She would not only loose her godchild but her own baby too! She looked forward and saw Timmy now carrying Poof up the stairs, playing with his nose. Poof absolutely adored Timmy, and Timmy loved Poof like a true brother. She absolutely couldn't let either of them go now...Regardless of what Da Rules might say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And that's when the realization struck her. The entire text for the Unbreakable Rules laid behind her. And the Wand for editing said document...above her. She slowly looked up at the display case holding Da Rule Maker's Wand. The case was sealed...undoubtedly unable to be opened by none other than Jorgen's Wand. And said wand...was right in front of her, just feet from her.</span></div></div>",

The sound was the hammer striking Jorgen over the head - now stars were floating around his head over his head as a large bump grew from his scalp. He groaned and slowly fell to his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda - what are you doing?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's necessary, Sport,\" Wanda answered quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda - you attacked Jorgen Von Strangle! When he wakes up, he'll rip our wings off!\" Cosmo suddenly shouted in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jorgen fell, the grip on his wand loosened and he released it. Wanda son saw the opportunity and seized it from him. The her hand was so small compared to Jorgen's Wand Staff that she needed both hands to take hold of it...For the moment. But that all changed when she summoned all her might and lifted it off the ground. It is known that all Fairy Magic is held directly in the Magic Wand; Jorgen may be physically fit to superhuman levels...But without his wand, Jorgen would be utterly powerless. His wand is the conduit to all his near-unlimited power. And now in Wanda's hands, the reaction was quite unique. Due to the great influx of power, the magic rebounded into Wanda herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands began to grow until one could hold Jorgen's wand. Her fairy body suddenly began to change into a tall, humanoid form. Her beauty seemed to be heightened by the power she'd gained. Her face was now without any previous flaw or wrinkle, and was absolutely beyond any equal. Her previously miniscule breasts had now grown to a full D cup. Her previous clothes were still in tact - her modest yellow shirt now served as little more than belly exposing tank-top. Her blank pants hugged the curves of her buttocks and long legs tightly. She had figure that any mortal woman would kill for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCosmo stared in awe at his wife; she was drop-dead gorgeous. Timmy was completely taken aback by this turn of events that his Godmother had taken. Poof sat confused in Timmy's arms, not knowing what to make of these events. Wanda had finally snapped back to reality after her transformation was done. She looked down at herself and was so surprised. She hadn't intended this, nor would she if she expected it. But she did feel powerful; so much so that she felt like she wouldn't be pushed around anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook the thought away. She could feel herself becoming more enamored with her powerful and sexy new body that she could feel it clouding her judgement. It was going to her head. But she couldn't allow that to happen. She had a job to do now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since never having to loose Timmy or Poof was her main objective, she decided that is where she should start. She turned the pages to the sections regarding the loosing or dismissal of the Fairy God Parents from the God Child. She didn't exactly know how to word it, but she knew she had to do something; she couldn't just change it to allow all children to keep their Fairies or else Fairy World would be put in danger...So she decided to add in a new clause regarding Timmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>For his repeated services in protecting Fairy World and Planet Earth - we hereby award Timothy Tiberius Turner of Dimsdale the privilege to keep his Fairies indefinitely beyond the usual age limit or need. Timmy is hereby immune from Fairy Tribunal, Magical Duels and otherwise noted Fairy Dismissal Actions on the part of anyone from Fairy World, Earth, or any known parallel dimension.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda smiled seeing the Clause written in Permanent Magical Ink in the original Rule Book. Now in this book - it was law...and she wrote it. It gave her a bit of a buzz; it was so cool that she was able to change Da Rules to fit her purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanda - what are you doing?!\" Timmy asked rushing toward the book holding Poof in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Sport,\" Wanda said in a calming voice. \"I'm simply making an edit to Da Rules so that you never have to loose Cosmo and Me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You mean - I get to keep you guys forever?!\" Timmy asked suddenly perking up with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Wanda said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YAHOO! I knew coming here was a good idea,\" Timmy said jumping up into the air. Wanda suddenly felt him seize her right leg in a hug. It was cute seeing how small Timmy was to her new form now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Wanda - every kid has to loose his Fairies. Timmy won't need us one day,\" Cosmo began to chime in. \"Why did you change Da Rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Cosmo - I know it's wrong but...We need Timmy,\" she said. \"When Timmy looses us, all of the magic that influenced his life is removed and all wishes he made are erased. If that happens, we'll loose Poof.\" The two suddenly realized what she said was true. Wanda suddenly reached down and took Poof from Timmy, gently holding him in her large arms and began to play with his nose. \"And I just couldn't let that happen - Poof is one of the best things that's ever happened to us; and it's all because of Timmy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Wanda, that's a good point,\" Timmy said. \"I knew I'd loose you guys, but I didn't think about how much you guys would loose. Well, we better put everything back the way it was and get out of here before Jorgen wakes up and finds out what we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WRONG!!!\" they suddenly heard a booming voice from behind. It shook the chamber. They turned and saw Jorgen standing up from the ground, nursing a large comical bump on his head. \"Wanda! I am very disappointed in you! You have just violated Eons of Magical Tradition and Order! And worst of all; You took my wand and left this large and unsightly bump on my head!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda listened to Jorgen scold her. She suddenly got flashbacks to all the time she was blamed for Cosmo and Timmy's mess-ups. She really couldn't stand listening to this; it was making her very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will return my wand - IMMEDIATELY! So that I may fix the damage you caused!\" Jorgen ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Jar-head - she hasn't done any damage; she's just trying to protect her child,\" Timmy barked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've said enough, Turner! And as soon as I fix Da Rules - your Fairies are as good as Gone! Cosmo and Wanda will be going to Fairy Jail for the next ten thousand years! And then back to the Fairy Academy for another thousand years of rehabilitation training! And their baby will be returned to the Magic from whence you wished for it! Now Hand over the Wand - NOW!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimmy and Cosmo were cowering next to each other. All of Jorgen's yelling had upset Poof and he was on the verge of crying. Wanda on the other hand was very mad. But soon her mind became very clear for a moment when she looked over at Jorgen's wand in her other hand. She realized that Jorgen made a serious mistake. He was making demands when at the moment, he was utterly powerless. She was the one who had all the power here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly snapped her arm forward, pointing the wand at Jorgen. A blast of golden light shot from it and struck Jorgen in the chest, knocking him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOF!\" Jorgen grunted when he was struck. He smacked against a wall. \"But...but how?!\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you know Jorgen?\" Wanda said. \"If your wand is stolen from you, there's no magical bond that would force your wand to return. Your wand is mine now!\" She slammed the pole of the wand on the ground to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGH - Even without my Magic; I'm still strong enough to rip you apart - limb from limb!\" Jorgen said standing up and quickly rushing toward them. But Wanda simply snapped her fingers, causing a banana peel to appear in Jorgen's path. He stepped on it, causing him to slip and fall on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Jorgen made a fool of like this really amused Wanda. She couldn't help but betray a little laugh. To Timmy and Cosmo it almost sounded like she was laughing a little maniacally.<br>\r\n\"MWHAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!\" she laughed hardly paying attention to them as they cowered beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh - Cosmo...Doesn't it seem like all of this power is going to Wanda's head a little?\" Timmy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm - I don't know Timmy,\" Cosmo said with his usual oblivious tone. \"On the one hand, Wanda does have a tendency to get a little overzealous with whatever authority she gains. And yet...\" Cosmo's sentence began to trail off when he began oogling her new, sexy and powerful body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanda was busy amusing herself - and Poof for that matter - by tossing Jorgen about. However she began to realize that despite how much fun she was having now, she might eventually slip up and Jorgen would retrieve his wand. If he did, she'd be in trouble; he'd undo the new rule she added to the book...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when it struck her - she had the solution to that problem in her other hand. She looked at Da Rule Maker's Wand...</span></div></div>",

She waved her wand and opened it up to the very first page that began listing rules and guidelines to the use of Fairy Magic. She waved Da Rule Maker's wand across the top of the page. And there, in big bold letters appeared a new rule...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Only Wanda may use Da Rule Maker's Wand to edit Da Rules...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it is written, so shall it be decreed,\" Wanda said with a rather malicious and power-mad smile. She suddenly felt an influx of power from Da Rule Maker's wand flow into her, increasing her already incredible power; it was bonding with her. It was HER wand now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOOOOOOoooooo,\" Jorgen shouted seeing the magic infuse within her. \"Wanda, what have you done?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what I've done, Jorgen,\" she said, her eyes now glowing white with power. \"I've just secured my place as the most powerful fairy in the Universe! The wand is mine, Da Rules are mine, the Power is MINE! And now, there's gonna be some changes around here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Timmy - I see what you're saying,\" Cosmo said snapping out of his lust-fueled daze. He hovered up toward Wanda's head and tried to reach her. \"Uh Honey - don't you think you're taking this a bit too far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you see Cosmo - I HAVE To do this,\" Wanda said back to him. \"There's no going back now; if I give up the power, we'll loose Timmy and Poof. And we'll be locked up in a fairy dungeon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, we're both too pretty for prison,\" Cosmo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what exactly are you going to do?\" Timmy asked looking up at Wanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to do all within my power to ensure that no one takes my boys away from me,\" she said. \"I'm going to fix everything that is wrong with the universe. And best of all -\" during her pause, Cosmo and Timmy suddenly felt themselves surrounded by magical aura and lifted off the ground. Wanda's large arms then swung around both their necks, hugging them close. \"I'm going to make sure that my favorite guys remain happy - no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh - great,\" Timmy said as Wanda hugged him. He didn't no how to describe this sensation, but something told him that there was going to be trouble up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember guys - no matter what happens, all that matters is that we stick together,\" Wanda said. \"Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Cosmo and Timmy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right - it's gonna be so much fun,\" Wanda said with glee. \"But the question now is...what shall we do first?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Zelda sat by the Vanity in her room. She wrote in her diary, taking the occasional glance out her bedroom window into the night sky. She felt trapped in her palace. Her room was in the tallest tower of the castle. She was hardly ever allowed to leave it. Her father - King Leo, kept her hidden away like a treasure, ever since she reached the age of 13. She wasn't able to go to the Courtyard - her most favorite place in the castle, not even if Impa was with her. And worst of all, her chastity belt was a heavy and annoying burden on her waist. Why did her father make her wear it? It was a rare occasion when she was allowed to remove it, only to have it replaced with another. At this point, it was like her father tried to control everything she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entry in her Diary consisted of the Hylian customs. Ever since it was established, a man has always served as primary monarch, where as queens hardly had any power, and served only as figureheads. Therefore, Zelda learned that her father did not plan to pass the throne onto her. She wouldn't be allowed to rule when her time came. Instead - she was lavished and surrounded by jewels, and servants, and luxurious comforts, to passify her into compliance. She wasn't her father's heir...She was just his jewel. And he kept her clean and polished, and hidden away from the rest of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not that she was hungry for the powers of the throne, its just that, she did believe that she could be a more than capable leader. But instead, if she wanted the Throne, she'd have to settle for taking the Back-seat to someone else. Yes - now that she was 18, her father was bringing in Suitors. From many other kingdoms near Hyrule, he brought in young Nobles and Princes to try and win her hand. But all of them were boring and were only obsessed with becoming King of Hyrule. And worst off, none of them had a Spine between them. So Zelda rejected them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to - she had to somehow hold her Father's Will off long enough for SOMETHING to happen - something that would change her fate to marry one of those boring, spineless, blue-bloods. Because someone else had already captured her heart - someone strong, and brave, and truly Noble. The Boy from the Forest that she met so many years ago - Link, the boy who became her Hero. She remembered, on her birthday, he convinced her to sneak out of the castle and accompany him to the Market Place, where they played together. The summer she'd spent with him, was the best of her life. He taught her about the life outside of the castle. But then one day, as the summer began to close, he had to leave. He said there was someone he needed to find - so to wish him luck, she gave him her Family's Sacred Treasure, The Ocarina of Time. An instrument that he was already familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when he left, she felt an emptiness that she had not felt before. Her heart ached for him to one day return. Even though she was very young, she knew that this feeling was Love. And why wouldn't she be in love with him? She owed everything to him; Hyrule owned everything to him. He told her a fantastic story - that while it was bewildering, something deep inside her knew it was true. Link traveled into the future where Ganondorf had succeeded in stealing the Triforce of Power and then took over Hyrule and ushered in Seven Years of Darkness. Luckily, Link and Zelda teamed up together and took Hyrule back from the Evil King, and cast him into the pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as a reward for all Link had done, Zelda sent him back in Time using the very same Ocarina so that Link could regain his childhood, and prevent the awful future from happening. But Zelda was now a completely different person that who she was from the future that Link saved. She thought it over - and realized that sending him back in time was the worst strategy she could've employed. It basically negated everything that Link had worked so hard for. What was the point of sending him back in Time, when her plans as a child inadvertently allowed Hyrule's downfall? If it wasn't for Link retaining his memory, it was almost certain that history would play out and nothing would change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she didn't like most of all was the fact that she treated Hyrule like a Do-Over. Why wouldn't she let Link stay in the future with her? Together, they could've rebuilt Hyrule and had a new beginning - lead Hyrule into a better future. Sending him back and time made Zelda think that her future counterpart was a coward and that she was too afraid of the responsibilities of ruling. So she erased it all from happening. Sure it seemed like a good idea to spare the people of Hyrule of a rather grim Dictatorship. But there was however one major flaw in the plan; Ganondorf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Zelda's suspicions about the man were true. But even if Link prevented him from ever getting the Triforce of Power, he was still a Wizard. He could somehow find a way to take Hyrule by force - threaten her father, or kidnap her. In the future, he was locked away and could no longer do harm. But going back into the past, where he remained free. The only one who could prevent the future was Link. He told Zelda the story, but still, they were only children. She had told her father her fears of Ganondorf before. And as expected, he didn't believe her. So when she and Link went before him, not only did he not believe her, but he was furious that a peasant boy was in his castle. He ordered Link thrown out of the castle or into the dungeon. So Ganondorf continued to walk free. But since Zelda had given the Ocarina of Time to Link, he could never open the door of time. He never laid siege to the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he kept up the charade for the past seven years. Zelda grew up into a beautiful young woman. And then one day, Link returned, now the handsome young man that had saved all of Hyrule. Zelda suddenly stopped writing in her diary. She looked out the window and saw that the moon was high in the sky - it had to be after midnight. She finally closed her book. She moved to her wardrobe and brought out a pair of boots. She slipped off her heals and put them on. She also brought out a length of Rope hidden inside one of her dresses. She'd done this several times before, ever since Link came back to Hyrule. She tied one end of the rope around the desk attached to her Vanity. She threw the rope out the window that slithered down the tower of her castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe donned a black cloak and slipped out the window. She began to slide down the rope. She landed in the courtyard, near the garden where she spent her childhood days. Using methods taught to her by Link, she managed to slip past the guards. She then came to the part she hated most of all - the drain in the small pool near the far side of the castle. Its how Link first slipped into the castle to meet her. She used to sneak out with him through this way - it was no problem for children to do it. But ever since she had come of age, it got tighter and tighter. Her large bosom and wide hips would make for a rather tight squeeze. But regardless she did manage to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the moat to the side of the castle where it slipped into an underground cave, guarded by a steel gate. She managed to move some loosen bars out of the way and slip through. The cave led to outside of Castle town, allowing the water to serve as an outer moat before joining the river. She pulled herself out of the moat; the hard part was over. She quickly fled to the side of the outer wall of Castle Town Market. Now, she would<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Loretta was a brunette in her mid-twenties with hazel eyes and her hair was cut into a bob. She always dressed smart; on workdays she would always wear a knee-length businesslike black dress with the sleeves rolled back to halfway between the wrists and elbows and an open collar revealing a short-sleeved white blouse with black single-strapped (with a buckle) high-heels and a pair of simple mother-of-pearl earrings. It was seldom anyone saw her without her glasses, which she wore purely to correct her ocular stigma and she never went anywhere without a single silver ring on both of her third fingers. She was 5'7\" out of high-heels, which would put on another two inches, and her attitude was very mild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoretta's home was a charming bungalow with an L-shaped hallway leading from the front door. Once past the porch the first door was on the right, leading into the living room and dining room; directly opposite the front door was the kitchen, which had another door leading into the dining room. Once the turn to the left in the hallway was made the next door on the left led into her bedroom with the door at the end of the hallway being the entrance to the bathroom. Access to the garden was made via the dining room. The front and back gardens were little more than lawns bordered by flower beds with an empty drive on the front, which led round to the back garden by way of a gate that would bring the visitor onto the patio. The only other distinguishing feature was a shed that bordered the fence that separated the back garden from the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoretta was an only child and all her cousins lived no less than 90 minutes away while her parents dwelled on the other side of Jaxby. They were fairly close but Loretta's status as a single woman was something that would cause friction as they hoped she'd find a husband and bear them grandchildren but didn't raise voices over the matter. She was more in touch with her friends and colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of thing leads to Loretta Slater becoming a giant monarch?</span></div></div>",

Got a few new books, think I'm going to be tied down studying for a while,\" Jessica said, not looking up from a large slab of leather and paper set in front of her. The book was a transcription of a much older volume, and each page was split between the original language and a rough English translation. It covered most of the small desk it lay on, and under the light from the room's window small discoloration could be seen on its pages. Tori really disliked books like this, and unfortunately they came home all too often. Her own interest in chemistry did not require odd, foreboding tomes tha screamed occult knowledge. Jessica's own history education meant she had to do much more work with primary sources. And so, piles of cursed books living in their tiny apartment. She could not wait to find a new place. The quiet girl she'd roomed with as a freshman was still quiet, but had become downright scary. Tori eyed her hunched shoulders and face almost pressing against the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're staring.\" Jessica said. Her head had turned slightly, the corner of one eye visible behind a lock of dark hair. \"Weren't you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right. Sorry. And nothing for you? I'll get a coffee or something, especially if you're going to be up late,\" Tori returned, hastily pulling the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Tori knew Jessica talked like this all the time, and didn't mean to be rude or creepy. It still got to her though. Quietly she shut the door on her roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocused on the book, Jessica smiled. She knew how scared she made her friend. At first, this made her a little upset and tried to be more friendly with Tori. This only seemed to worsen things, and soon she found herself playing up the role of spooky flatmate. However intimidated she felt by the six foot tall, stunningly gorgeous genius she lived with, Tori had become far more scared of her. Eventually, Jessica came to see some justice in this. At least it left her plenty of time for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer current book was a transcription of an older Mesopotamian text. The translation had been poor to begin with, and going through several different \"refinements\" had not improved it. What had sold itself as a manifest of trade within the city of Ur seemed to be more focused on the ritual significance of the products coming in to the city. Jessica was impressed by the amount of herbs burned, but not at all interested by the details. But before she lost all hope in the book, a short translator's note about the ritual in question grabbed her attention. The ceremony was for the appointment of the city-state's new ruler, a monarch who would rule in the name of the gods and share in their power. Her left hand, the one not holding down the page, fidgeted. Whenever things like this came up, she got excited. A lifelong fascination with horror movies and forbidden knowledge drove her to the more bizarre ancient rituals. And an ancient ritual to give someone godlike powers? Jessica grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed more information on the process in question, not just an ingredients list. Just in case, she copied down all the materials used. She did get bored every now and again, and liked to have ways to blow of steam. Besides, who hadn't tried to summon demons or talk with the dead? The surprisingly small amount of materials copied down, she walked to her room and grabbed a hoodie from her bed. Throwing it over her T-shirt, she went back to her desk to pick up her wallet and keys. Yes, she had Internet, but it wasn't the same reading about knowledge of the elders online. She much preferred to hold the aging paper in her hands, rather than displayed on a screen. Jessica walked to the apartment's entrance just as the door swung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori saw Jessica just standing inside the doorway and jumped back with a yelp. Was it her imagination or did she smirk for a second?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, startled me there,\" Tori said, laughing nervously. \"You look sick, are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. Been reading a while. I need another book, so I'm going to the library,\" Jessica said. She looked up at Tori, who stared back uncomfortably. \"I was just heading out. Not waiting to startle you.\" Jessica tried to clarify, smiling slightly. Tori smiled tightly in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries. You want me to go with? It's gonna be dark soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine. I put the last person who tried something in the river,\" Jessica said. She walked past Tori, who looked unsure about whether Jessica had just tried to make a joke, and outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When did it get dark?' She wondered. Her reading had begun at 10 AM, as it usually did. 'When did it turn to spring?' Jessica asked, even more incredulously. Quickly pulling her hoodie off, she grabbed a bus and went down to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori was just getting dressed for bed when Jessica got home. At least, she hoped it was her roommate. The door slammed and a small figure padded into her room, so Tori assumed it was her. Jessica usually didn't start conversations and she was tired. Yawning, Tori turned her back and walked towards her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tori.\" Tori turned and almost screamed when she saw Jessica right behind her. The poor girl looked exhausted, but at the same time had a frenzied light in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jess. What's up?\" Tori said. Jessica held forth a small book. It looked new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to try something cool?\" Jessica said. Tori almost dropped her lower jaw in awe. Never, had she heard Jessica describe something as \"cool\". And she had NEVER been invited to do something with this girl. After the initial shock, she got just a little suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Tori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the powers of ancient gods.\" Tori eyed her warily. Jessica was not one to make jokes. Her invitation and new vocabulary were out of character, but a joke was beyond belief. She didn't know if she was religious or not, but she also had not mentioned gods before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to that's fine. I'll be up for a while though. Did you get coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry, thought you didn't want any.\" Tori paused. Jessica looked slightly disappointed, which was another first. After a moment, the shorter girl turned to walk away. \"Wait a minute,\" Tori grinned down, \"Let's give it a try!\"</span></div></div>",

Now Tori had seen everything. \"Come on, I already set everything up.\" Jessica walked into her room and Tori followed. Normally, their bedrooms were cramped at best. Jessica had a young library crammed into hers, in addition to clothes, a table, a computer, and a mini fridge. Tori didn't think she'd be able to fit inside, but Jessica had a meticulously clean square right at the foot of the bed, a roughly three by three foot square. In the middle was a book that made the one she'd been reading earlier look fresh off the presses. It was open, but Tori was lost as to what any of the writing might mean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a second. Need to finish one last thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Jess, take your time. Do I need to wear some ceremonial robes or something?\" Tori asked. Jessica stood in a corner slowly stirring something in a clay cup with her pinky. After a minute of silence she pulled the finger from the cup and stuck it in her mouth. Her lips puckered and her eyes sprang open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you should be fine in what you're wearing. Drink a sip of this.\" Jessica tilted the cup back and drank deeply. Coughing, she took it from her lips and held it out to her friend. Tori took the cup and eyed the murky brew inside. Raising an eyebrow she looked at Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drink they gave the royalty before the ceremony. Come on, drink. We should start soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much of this do you want me to drink?\" Tori asked. She was half-considering backing out, and maybe calling the campus police. She hadn't been date raped yet, and aimed to keep it that way. She'd never seen the reclusive girl so excited before, though, and really wanted to see what she thought would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as you want. More you drink, the more you'll gain. Careful, strong stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you know all about drinking Jess,\" Tori said before bringing the pottery to her lips. The mix smelled awful, almost enough to make her gag. But then the liquid touched her tongue and tasted...good. It was warm, like a nice cup of tea, but tasted spicy and alcoholic. All at once she was scared Jess actually had put something in the drink. She flung it against the wall and turned on her smaller friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" Tori demanded. Jessica looked concerned, but she was too angry to care all that much. Jessica started to move towards the cup, draining the liquid into the carpet. Tori angrily seized her by the shoulders and hauled her in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer me! What did I just drink? No fucking 'ritual' mumbo jumbo, just do I need to call a doctor or no?\" Tori yelled into the petrified girl's face. \"I swear to God Jess, if you don't talk I'm going to break your fingers.\" Tori was seething with rage. She could barely feel the tiny girl in her grip, and the blood roared in her ears. The wind had picked up, and pages fluttered around them. Still, Jessica said nothing. \"Time's up!\" She snarled, reaching for her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook herself free, tossing Tori's hand off without a thought. Her right hand seized Tori's arm in a grip that made her gasp in pain. She still looked scared, and now Tori was starting to feel uneasy. Her mindless rage was gone, and she was slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, when did you get a window in here?\" Tori asked, bewildered. The lights were out and everything seemed to be spinning. Jessica had released her arm, and now crouched over her book. The square around it was still immaculate which was odd. \"What did we do, Jessica?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I don't know Tori,\" she said. She tore through the pages, eyes frantically scanning indecipherable characters. A low moaning filled the room, and the darkness started to congeal into solid forms. Jessica saw them, and then looked at Tori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to come over here and touch the book Tori,\" Jessica said. Tori thought slowly, but started to move that way regardless. She had lost control of her feet, and tumbled to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your room got so much bigger\" Tori said. Her hands were miles from the book, and she could feel something tearing at her feet. \"I think this is the last time we do this Jess, this is weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch the goddamned book Tori!\" Jessica screamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can reach it, Jessica.\" Eyes wide with panic, Jessica lifted her hand from the book slowly, muscles straining. With a cry she pushed herself bodily towards Tori, exertion making her skinny arms bulge. Tori's arm suddenly grew cold, and saw her friend's fingers wrapped around her wrist. Then she was moving towards the square, although her vision was fading. Jessica gave one more heave, left hand still anchored to the book, and brought Tori's torso into the square. Her hand slapped against the rough papyrus of the book. Tori could see clearly now, but her thoughts were still swimming through concrete. It looked like they were surrounded on all sides by legions of dark figures clutching staffs. They chanted in a vaguely eastern language, and Jessica sounded like she was trying to answer them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to see a doctor Jess, I think someone drugged me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tori was lying on the floor of their \"main\" room, the medium-sized room connecting their small bedrooms. Everything was sore, her head was pounding, and the light coming through the windows sent an ice pick into her brain. She squeezed her eyes shut and tried to ignore the discomfort. A minute or so passed, and her eyes felt like they might stay in her head of she opened her eyelids. A fraction of an inch at a time, Tori lifted them. The daylight was painful, but bearable. She took quick stock of her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was a mess. Books scattered the floor, their TV lay facedown surrounded by a fine dusting of broken glass. The wooden floorboards had horrific stains, the fan was in pieces, and the couch was shredded. Jessica's room, from what she could see, looked like someone had set off a bomb. Jessica herself was...hunched over Tori's legs muttering incoherently. Tori tried to say something, but her mouth was gummy and her throat sore. The hoarse rasp broke her roommate'so trance, though, and she shuffled over to Tori's head. She looked closely into her eyes and placed a cool palm against Tori's forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel?\" Jessica asked. It sounded like she was speaking through water. Tori took a moment to process before responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I've been boxing with Mohammed Ali,\" Tori said. Every word hurt. She tried to raise herself up but Jessica's hands were suddenly on her chest, forcing her back to the floor. Tori fought weakly. Jessica looked at he friend with a scary intensity, and Tori struggled harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to stay still. I got most of you through safely, but they took you legs.\" Tori looked along her body at her pink feet. She wiggled each toe in sequence, from left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, my toes are fine. What are you talking about?\" The other girl seemed frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you didn't stay in the square I couldn't do what I needed to. Also, you threw my damn drink away so I was trying to make do with what I had available.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feet are fine, look!\" Tori said, still not seeing what Jessica's problem was. This kind of thing was why she was moving out. \"Our apartment though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I don't need anything here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jess, all my shit's here. This is everything I fucking own, and it's trashed. What the hell happened?\" Tori was slowly dissolving the fog in her mind. She remembered drinking something Jessica handed her, and falling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You drugged me!\" Tori tried again to stand up. This time Jessica sat back on her legs and watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gave me that drink, and then I must have passed out. Jessica, what did you do to me? I'm calling the fucking police, and I'm getting out of this place!\" Tori was sitting up, getting angrier as she got closer to upright. She tried to tuck a leg beneath her and stand, but her legs were unresponsive. They twitched a bit, but neither moved very far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They need a few more minutes for the nerves to attach,\" Jessica said, leaning forward and gently touching Tori's left leg. For the first time she saw the torn and singed remains of her underwear, just managing to cover her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You raped me,\" she said softly, taking it in. Louder, she repeated it. Finally she yelled it at the top of her lungs and lunged for the woman gently kneading her thighs. She almost reached, but without any help from he lower half she flopped impotently against the floor. Quietly, Tori cried to herself. Jessica continued working her way down her left leg, and repeated the process on the right. After ten minutes, she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can walk now.\" Jessica said. Tori looked up at the girl, tears blurring her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you?\" Tori asked, voice flat. Jessica stared down, her face inscrutable. Tori couldn't take it, and looked down at herself. Her pajama top was mostly fine, fraying a little below the navel. Her hands looked slightly burned, but otherwise okay. The left arm was fine, but the right arm had a bizarre black pattern woven on it, like the intricate fibers of a reed basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did I get this tattoo?\" Tori asked. Jessica held her right arm out, rolling back the sleeve of an oversized hoodie. An identical pattern was inscribed in her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're married.\" She stated. And walked off into her room, out of which smoke was now wafting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" Tori began. \"No, we are not, Jessica. We are roommates. I am moving out. And you are going to jail for assaulting-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica strode out of the room carrying a large book and threw it on the ground besides Tori. A recollection of the previous night came flooding back all at once. The ghosts, the hurricane, Jessica knelt over the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the only way they would let the both of us go. This was not supposed to be a ritual for two people.\" Jessica stood over her, hands sunk into the hoodie's pickets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We.\" Jessica opened the door to the hallway and stepped out. \"Are married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slammed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jessica left at sun-up and was still wandering when the sun went down. She muttered to herself as she walked around downtown. People who looked at the haggard college girl got a vicious stare for their trouble. Jessica visited the library, but couldn't stand the people whispering. No matter where she read, no matter how deep in the stacks she lurked, she was chased by these inane conversations. There was no peace. Same thing at any museum or coffee shop. She fidgeted anxiously and chewed her lip constantly. Eventually she resorted to wandering the cavernous alleys between skyscrapers. It was still noisy, but the sounds of generators, elevators, and A/C units were better than other people. For hours, she walked. Jessica wanted to think about the infinite power she controlled, but the second her mind drifted that way her tattoo began to burn. And so she simmered, the memory of what she had committed to always fresh in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica almost started for home at about dusk, but the thought of Tori curled on the floor kept her out. On the one hand, she had saved her...wife...from painful spiritual torment for eternity. On the other hand, they were now bound by a bond not even her power could dissolve without damning the both of them. It was an uneasy truce, the one concession the gods she had robbed had been able to force on her. Jessica sighed. It was a shame both she and Tori were straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, gotta light?\" Someone asked from a doorway. Jessica snapped back to reality. The guy, taller and rounder than her and dressed like a professional, leaned against a recessed door to an office block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" she replied, stepping to the side and pulling out her lighter. He held out a cigarette and she flicked the wheel. She heard a soft parting of air behind her and then felt a sudden red blossom of pain on her neck. She dropped like ton of cod onto a trawler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, I think you broke her neck Jim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just enough to put her out for a bit. She'll be up in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn to go first, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right son.\" Both laugh. Jessica heard a metallic scrape, belt buckle coming undone. She pulled her arm under her chest and pushed herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nevermind Jimmy, looks like she's still kicking. Been skipping workout recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mick, that would've put a bull out cold. Want me to try again?\" Metal bat against fleshy palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I like a little bit of a fight. Not too much though.\" A zipper went down. Jessica was scared. Her arms wobbled and her vision swam. Breathing heavily, she let her head ring for a second. When it slowed just a bit she lunged to her feet. Unsteadily, she looked around. Two men were in front of her, behind her was a door. Her eyes wouldn't focus and her stomach was trying to crawl out of her mouth. But she was less scared now, by all rules that hit should have killed her. Now, she was angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, take one more hit. She's givin me the crazy eye,\" Mick said. Jim stepped forward, hefting the bat. He swung straight for the side of Jessica's head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat smacked against her hand, stopping dead. Jim stared, wide-eyed. Jessica closed her fingers around it, and felt him try to jerk it away. She smiled, and he let go of the bat to back away. She squeezed and the aluminum flattened easily. Jesica let it drop, and stepped towards her attackers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuc-\" Mick stammered out, but then Jessica was on top of him. She breezed past him, stepping sideway on his knee as she passed. He screamed like a banshee, and toppled sideways. Jim was quicker, and swung for the tiny girl. She saw the fist coming, and easily got inside his reach. Almost before she could react his other hand was there, and she had to swat it away or take a nasty knock. Jim's other hand had time to pull back and strike again, but this time Jessica grabbed just behind his wrist and pulled him forward. His eyes were wide and mouth open a little wider than usual as she stared up into them. Then her right hand pressed against his neck and they focused on that. She tightened her grip just a little, trying not to crush his throat like the bat. Regardless, he started to turn a deep shade of red and fell to his knees. Jessica's breath caught in her throat and her fingers dug in a little deeper. Rivulets of blood dripped from her fingertips and Jim's mouth worked like a beached fish. She let go of his other hand, clutching his neck with both hands now. She could feel the blood flowing through his aorta beneath her fingertips. His hands smacked at hers and tried to pry them off, but Jessica had no problem holding on. He was purple now, and gasping much less. Her hands squeezed tighter, her breathing faster now. Her stomach fluttered in time with the muscles in his neck. Something crunched but she still held on. Her fingers were drenched in blood and she could hear his desperate gagging like jet engines in her ears. Finally, with a yell, she pressed down as hard as she could. With a spray of blood, Jessica's hands easily tore through muscle, tissue, and spine. Jim's head fell off his body and she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at her hands. Stained with blood and gore, with bits of bone fragment stuck on for good measure. Intoxicated, she looked from her bloody digits to the lifeless body in front of her. And then someone behind her moaned. Mick! Jessica whirled around to find her other attacker. He was lying in the doorway, staring at her. Slowly, her hands still held in front of her, she walked over to him. He tried to back farther into the corner, murmuring something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My hands,\" Jessica said, smiling wildly. She pressed their backs against his face, and he wriggled like a worm on a hook. Slowly, she flipped them over until her fingers were wrapped in fistfuls of his short, dark hair. He tried to say something, but Jessica wasn't listening. She lifted him up by the roots of his hair, making him yell. Soundlessly, she slammed his skull against the door. He coughed once and died. But she didn't stop for a while. Finally, the pain in her arm made her drop the mess of a man and cry out. She grabbed the mark, smearing her arm with the mess she'd made. Grimacing in pain, she made her way back to her apartment. Someone might have seen her, but no one stopped her. Well past midnight, she opened the door to the apartment. Everything was dark, but she could hear Tori moving somewhere inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victoria. I'm home.\"</span></div></div>",

She looked at herself, her hoodie flecked with bits of dried blood. Her hands had scalp, hair, and various gristle. She rotated them, taking it all in. Her cheek felt just a little bit colder and her eye stung. Her world went blurry and her body shook slightly. A tear dripped off her chin and splashed on her hand. Tori stepped out of her room, dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. Some logo was stamped on the front, but Jessica couldn't see well enough to make it out. A choked, painful sound forced its way out of her throat. A soft sob followed it out and Jessica was crying. Tori stood and watched for a moment. Abruptly, she walked to Jessica in three strides and enveloped her in a hug. The smaller girl collapsed, but Tori gently lowered her to the floor. Her chest heaved, but the sobbing was silent now. Her wet face glistened in the moonlight, and snot ran from her nose. Carefully, Tori took Jessica in her arms and walked to the bathroom. The room was cramped, but the two of them could just fit together. Once again placing her roommate on the floor Tori turned on the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up,\" Tori said, turning back to Jessica. With her hands under her arms, she lifted Jessica to her feet like a toddler. She stayed upright, swaying only a little bit. Gently, Tori pulled the hoodie over her head. Tossing it back into the main room she lifted off the shirt, also stained with blood. Finally, trying not to think that this was her spouse, she unclasped Jessica's bra. Off came the pants and underwear, and all that was left was Jessica. In a daze, she walked under the steaming water and sat down heavily on the tile. Tori ran a washcloth under the shower head, then rubbed soap on it. Gently, she dabbed at the stains and pulled strands of hair from her friend's fingers. The shower ran red as she worked her way down Jessica's arms and washed the rest of her. When she finally washed the last clumps of gore from Jessica's raven hair, Tori stood up. Jessica looked up at her, but made no motion to stand. After a moment she looked back down, and Tori stepped out. She managed to find a fresh set of clothes in the wreckage of Jessica's room, and placed them in the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori sat on the couch for an hour while the water ran in the bathroom. She was working her way through some trashy novel she'd picked up weeks ago, but entirely unable to concentrate. When the water finally cut off, she stopped worrying that Jessica had drowned or something. Minutes later, Jessica emerged in a cloud of steam, wearing the pajamas Tori had brought her. Her eyes were swollen and red, but she looked much better than the shriveled child that had come home. Jessica stared into Tori for a moment, then shuffled off to her room. Tori checked in on her twenty minutes later. She was asleep, snoring softly. Satisfied, Tori went back to her room and lay down on her bed. It was a long time before she went to sleep.</span></div></div>",
