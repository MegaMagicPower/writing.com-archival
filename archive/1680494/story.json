            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>1) The SS Pacific, named after the massive ocean from the home world, is the largest ship controlled by humans. Over a million passengers are on board, most of them civilians trying to go about their normal lives. The ship is governed by a democratically elected council that rotates membership every eighteen months (a unit of time that is still measured precisely to coincide with the phases of the moon back on Earth). Each ship passenger has their choice to do what they want with their lives, though the government strongly controls the education system in order to influence students to specialize in what would best benefit the ship at large. The large interior spaces in the ship affords the opportunities for agriculture, proper waste recycling, and simulated open-air environments. Living on this ship is as close to pre-destruction Earth as any human ship has yet gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story will focus on a group of five friends at one of the educational centers in the ship. These friends are all in the same class, and though they are all only fourteen, due to the needs of the ship they are in their last year of accelerated schooling before being utilized in the workforce. Our characters are the three boys Kai, Ravi, and Reizo, and the two girls Kat and Zina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) The SS Vanguard is a very military-centric ship of about 15,000 inhabitants. Each citizen, no matter what their role, is considered a member of the military, and their assignments are controlled by the General and the Admiral, the two shadowy leaders of the ship. The Vanguard has had a history of bloody coups, but no matter who ends up ruling, a strict tradition of protocol is followed, and every action is made for the strengthening of the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story will focus on three boys who are in the military academy of the ship and have been selected to be trained for the elite unit of the ship, the Shadows. Shadows answer directly to the General and the Admiral, and to no one else, and are in charge of enforcing the leaders' will and control both in the ship and in any special planetary mission. There are only a small number of Shadows at any given time, and the training for it starts at age 12 and is very secret, those selected having to be taken away from their families and friends, effectively starting a new life. Our characters are Jules, the oldest in the group at 17; Aiken, the fifteen year old borderline-psychotic; and Ian, the 12 year old who has just been selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) The SS Winnipeg is one of the hundreds of tiny ships out there, only hosting four families and, currently, a total of twelve people, eight adults and four kids. They were a group that had gotten banished from another, larger ship due to eccentric ideas and nonconformity, and have been one of the few outcast ships who have actually been able to survive on their own, largely in thanks to the ingenuity of the de facto \"Captain\", Gregory Kensington. Gregory is a technological and mechanical genius, and has customized and repaired the bucket of bolts that is the Winnipeg into being a machine that, though not much to look at, can actually explore the galaxy just as well as a much larger ship. Gregory and the other adults are all very scientific minded and love to explore new places. It was this kind of curiosity that led Gregory to falling in love with Lar-thaza, a female Thazazoid, which is an alien race of nine feet tall, crimson-skinned humanoids. Their joining is one of the reasons that led him to be expelled from his previous ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story doesn't focus on Gregory or Lar-thaza, however, but on the children of the ship. Ken-thaza is Gregory and Lar-thaza's offspring, a ten-year-old that, due to being half-Thazazoid, is already six feet tall. Deanna is the fourteen-year-old daughter of one of the other scientists, and Dyson is her eleven-year-old brother. Liang is the fifteen year-old son of the third couple, and is the smartest of the group, even outsmarting the adults sometimes. Finally, the fourth couple is barren, but the mother is an expert in robotics and has created an android son, whom she has just introduced to the other children, called Dimitri. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Create your own ship! Go ahead and write your own ship full of kids and/or teens in this choice. You can put a short description at the beginning of the chapter and I will transfer it over here, or if you don't leave a description, I will write my description based on your chapter for it!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ian was being led down a long corridor, blindfolded. It had all happened so quickly. It was only yesterday that he had been pulled out of class and met a tall, mysterious man who told him that he had been selected. Of course, he knew immediately what it was for; every kid on the Vanguard knew the stories of the few classmates who suddenly disappeared one day, being called for duty in the Shadows. But knowing about the legend didn't come close to preparing him to experience it firsthand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, he had his final meal with his parents and sister in the small apartment his family shared. It was a quiet meal, everyone at the table holding back tears and emotions, not wanting to appear in any way ungrateful for the truly awesome opportunity that Ian was receiving. But he knew that this would probably be the last time he saw any of them, and so did they.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was woken up early the next morning by a group of men dressed in black, their faces obscured. They quickly pulled him out of bed, told him to quickly get dressed, and then immediately blindfolded him and tied his hands, taking him out of the apartment and into a lift. All the while, the men escorting him said nothing. Ian had never felt more alone at any point in his life. He knew that he was incredibly fortunate to be selected for this position, but all he felt was a sense of homesickness and desire to go back to his family. And then, a few minutes later, he was here, in a hallway with a steel floor that seemed to go on forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he was turned into a room, his blindfold was yanked off, and he heard a door swoosh shut behind him. As his eyes adjusted, he could make out that he was in a small classroom, dimly lit by a flickering source of light on the ceiling. The room had a table in the middle and looked sort of like a conference room. There was nothing on the walls, no windows or ports or decoration of any kind, just the door behind him and one other door on the opposite side of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking to either side, Ian realized that the escorts were no longer with him; they must have led him in here, yanked the blindfold off then quickly left the room. There were only three people in the room: the mysterious man he had met yesterday; an older teenaged boy with short dark hair, brown skin, and a muscled form, who had a determined but calm demeanor; and another boy, younger than the first but older than Ian, who was tall with pale skin, had red hair at a length that Ian knew was prohibited at the academy, a slender build, and fiery red eyes that had a crazed look to them. The three of them were all standing, staring straight at Ian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Ian, to the rest of your life,\" the mysterious man said, slightly bowing towards him. \"We met briefly yesterday; I am Markus, the Commandant of the Shadows. I will be the one leading your education from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan was unsure of how he should respond. He slowly stepped forward, turned towards Markus, and said, \"Thank you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus nodded, then motioned with his hand towards the younger boy. \"I am Aiken,\" the boy said. He spoke quickly and seemed to have a slight twitch in his eye, but Ian tried to ignore that. \"I am in my third year of initiation. My specialty is Explosive Weaponry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan walked up to Ian and stuck out his hands, which were still tied at the wrists. \"It is nice to meet you,\" he said. Aiken looked at his hands uneasily, then quickly grabbed one, gave it one shake, and turned back to face the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older boy then walked towards Ian, sticking out his hand and shook Ian's, saying, \"And my name is Jules. I am a fifth-year Shadow Initiate. I am an Expert in Hand-to-Hand combat -- Martial Arts, if you will. Which means I'm responsible for teaching you a lesson if you step out of line.\" Ian wasn't sure how to take this, so he just stared straight at Jules, his breathing starting to accelerate. After a few seconds, Jules's mouth broadened into a grin and he started laughing. \"Don't look at me like that, rookie! I'm not gonna hurt you... too bad,\" he added, with a knowing wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the introductions completed, Markus came up to Ian and put his hand on Ian's shoulder. \"And that's it. The three of you represent the only current Shadow Initiates on this vessel. Of course, I can't tell you how many actual Shadows there are on this ship until you have completed your Initiation, but rest assured, it's a very exclusive group. You should feel proud, Ian. You have been selected from over two hundred possible candidates in your age group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan gulped, and nodded. \"Yes, sir. I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Markus said, \"now it's time to get you prepared for the first day of the rest of your life. Jules and Aiken, you stay here for a little while. Ian, follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarkus walked towards the door opposite the one Ian entered, which silently slid open, revealing an unlit room beyond. Markus entered the room, quickly disappearing into the shadows. Ian took a deep breath, then followed him in.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Ian entered into the dark room, the door slid shut behind him, leaving him entirely in the dark. As far as he could tell, there was no light coming from anywhere. He had never been in a part of the ship that was this dark before, and he started to feel a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIan, can you hear me?\u201d he heard the voice of Markus in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-yes, I can,\u201d Ian responded. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStep forward two steps,\u201d Markus said, and Ian did as he was instructed. As he did so, he felt an icy cold breeze suddenly flowing past him; he started to shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIan,\u201d Markus continued, \u201cwhat is about to happen will probably be unpleasant. It is a rite that all those who are chosen for the Shadows have to go through, and you are no exception. We have chosen you because we feel confident that you will be able to survive this, both mentally and physically. If, however, you fail to survive, we apologize for the error.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan gulped. If he failed to survive? This wasn\u2019t sounding good, and he began to sweat, despite the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the room he was in changed from pitch darkness to being filled with a completely bright white light. The change was too fast for his eyes, and he had to shield them to adjust. As he did so, he noticed that the bright light seemed to have an intense heat to it, and that it filled the air with a strange weight. It became more difficult for him to breath, and he started gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, he felt himself being lifted in the air. His eyes had finally adjusted, and he looked down to see there was no ground beneath his feet at all, nor, when he looked up or to his side, any wall or ceiling. He seemed to be suspended in the middle of a bright white nothingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic began to overwhelm him, but he knew he had to get through this. He thought about the last time he felt such panic, a year ago during a spacewalking training outside the ship. He had become untethered, and started to float away into the dark void of deep space. His mind became overwhelmed with panic and fear of eminent death, but he managed to block out his emotions, and focus solely on how to recover, activating the emergency jet pack, changing his angle towards the ship, and propelling his way back. He knew he had to do the same now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath and looked forward. Not seeing anything that he could do, he calmly stretched out his arms and legs, flexing his chest, arm, and leg muscles and attempting to maintain stability. As he did this, he could feel the warmth in the air seep into his body. His skin began to feel tingly all over, and his clothes started to disintegrate. Within a few seconds, he was left naked, and his hair was standing straight out, as if he was being electrocuted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of letting the strange feeling he was experiencing take control over him, he realized he had to be master over it. Ian started to focus, and he could feel a control over his skin that he never had felt before. It was as if he could control what was happening with the air around him. As he increased his focus, the electricity - or whatever it was - in the air suddenly began to flow at a much faster rate into his body, filling his organs with some sort of incredible power. As it flowed into him, the room started to dim again, and within ten seconds, he had absorbed all of the energy and the room was dark, save for Ian\u2019s body, which was glowing like an X-Ray image. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan smiled. He had not only managed to deal with the light, he seemed to be able to control it. This feeling surging through his veins was like nothing he had ever experienced before. It was -- orgasmic, almost, maybe even better. He never wanted it to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ian was reveling in the ecstatic feeling, he heard Markus\u2019s voice coming through again. \u201cFantastic, Ian. You have survived the rite, and have absorbed the Shadows\u2019 Pulse. Now you can choose what power you want to apply that to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen large spherical shapes suddenly appeared out of thin air around Ian, looking almost like bubbles. Each one had images inside of a faceless figure, varying from electricity shooting out of the figure's fingers, to it unleashing a barrage of lasers and bullets from a series of weapons, to the figure being able to hover and fly around the corridors of the ship at breathtaking speeds. Ian titled his head to the side as he looked at all of the options, unsure of what they meant exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the powers that the Shadows need currently and are able to bestow upon you,\" Markus continued. \"Whatever you chose, you will have seemingly superhuman abilities with, but your power can only take you so far. You have to put the hard work into developing it into a weapon. So, what will you choose, my son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan thought for a moment. Power? Weapon? This seemed too good to be true. He thought for a moment, then finally decided on a bubble that showed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bubble that caught Ian's eye the most was one of the figure inside bent over in a thinker's position, waves emanating from its head. Ian floated over to this bubble and gingerly reached out for it, his hands passing through it like a hologram, though he felt a mild shock from it as they did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" the still-disembodied voice of Markus said, \"that spheroid represents psychic power. It is a truly remarkable power, but one that can be overwhelming, possibly even debilitating at times. If you choose that one, you will need discipline and lots of practice and time to be able to control it. Are you sure you want to proceed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan hesitated, considering Markus's words. Finally, he nodded. \"Yes, Commandant, I accept the risks. I choose this power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then.\" As soon as Markus said this, the other bubbles disappeared, and the one Ian had chosen started to grow larger and larger. Within seconds, it had become bigger than Ian's entire body, and Ian felt himself being sucked into the bubble, a force that he couldn't resist. The whole process frightened Ian a bit, but he took a deep breath and let it happen, knowing that he didn't have a choice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his entire body had been enveloped, the bubble started spinning around, slowly at first but gradually picking up steam, Ian remaining stationary inside it. Within seconds, the edges of the bubble were a blur, and they slowly started to contract. Ian's eyes went wide, unsure of what was to come next. The bubble suddenly collapsed into his chest, much like the overwhelming light had a few minutes prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of incredible energy surged through Ian's entire body, his heart starting to race and his blood boiling. His skin started to tingle, the tiny hairs on it, along with the hair on his head, standing out in all directions, moving in a seemingly organized pattern. He closed his eyes to try to block everything else out, but when he did so he could see a staggering array of abstract shapes and colors, a seemingly random mishmash of information that he had no clue what it meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his mind, Ian felt his brain starting to race, thoughts running through it in an uncontrolled rate. He tried to focus on some of them, but the thoughts multiplied exponentially, becoming louder and louder in his head, more and more frequent and intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ideas held in the thoughts were entirely foreign to him; they didn't seem like ones he'd ever experienced before. Some of them were mundane, like the steps of a recipe for quick-fried faux-chicken, but others were incredibly dark and violent. One particularly gruesome one that stood out to Ian dealt with the overwhelming desire to murder his son. \"These can't be my thoughts,\" Ian said aloud, \"I don't have a son! What's going on?\" He tried to shake off the thoughts, but they seemed so inherit, so much a part of his brain, that he couldn't let them go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan started to feel like his head was going to explode. He brought his hands up to his temples, which were physically pounding, pulsating at Ian's touch. Ian opened his mouth to let out a loud scream, then blacked out.</span></div></div>",

He was having a nice, peaceful sleep, and then suddenly jolted awake by... something, he wasn't sure what. He just knew that it didn't sound good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly grabbed his glasses off the small table at the foot of his bed and slipped them on, waiting a second for his eyes to adjust. He quickly looked around the room he shared with the two other boys on the ship. They were both asleep: Dyson very still and tucked in to his blankets; and Ken, whose reddish-pink, six-foot-tall body was restless, having kicked the covers of the bed during his tossing and turning through the night. Ken's height still seemed out of place to Liang, seeing that Ken was ten years old, five years younger than himself, and yet was a good four inches taller. That's the upside of being a half-Thazazoid, Liang figured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, he knew that he needed to check out what was going on. The Winnipeg was a small ship with only a total of twelve crew members, and as the oldest of the children on board, he felt a need to protect the others. He slid his feet off the bed and stood up, the shock of the cold metal floor sending a shiver up his spine. He didn't want to wake up the other two boys, so he snuck out quietly, the sliding door of their room opening and closing for him without a sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked along the hallway, he looked around, trying to find any sign of invaders. He was looking to his left when he suddenly bumped into somebody, who let out a short, soft scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me!\" he heard a girl's voice yell. He whirled around to see that it was, in fact, Deanna coming out of her room. Deanna was the only girl on the ship, and the closest to Liang's age. Though she could be somewhat bossy at times, Liang couldn't deny that he found her attractive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Deanna, it's me!\" Liang hissed. Deanna started to calm down, her breathing rate still heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ, Liang, you scared me,\" Deanna whispered. \"Are you awake because of that banging noise a few minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it woke me up, and I thought I'd investigate,\" Liang said as he rubbed the back of his neck. He then noticed that Deanna was only wearing a bra and a pair of red shorts. Liang blushed a little, and said, \"You didn't have time to get dressed, I take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna stared at him coldly. \"Well, neither did you,\" she said, pointing out that Liang was only wearing a black pair of boxer briefs and black sleeveless tee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang looked down at himself, then shrugged. \"If it doesn't bother you, then it doesn't bother me,\" he said. \"Maybe we should dress like this all the time,\" he added, with a wry smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, pervert, and let's see what that noise was,\" Deanna said as she turned towards the front of the ship. \"It sounded like it came from up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang followed behind as Deanna led the way. As they got to the cockpit, they saw that all seemed to be as normal: the ship was on autopilot, and none of the readouts seemed out of the ordinary. They had just turned around and were ready to head back to their rooms when they saw... </span></div></div>",

The boy was wearing the same standard-issue clothing that the children of the Winnipeg usually wore during the daytime. Startled by his discovery, Liang let out a loud gasp, which caused Deanna to turn around and let out a scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deanna, don't--\" Liang was cut off when the boy they were facing started to scream as well. The way his face looked when he opened his mouth was just slightly off, but Liang didn't have time to consider why. Finally, Liang reached over and put his hand over Deanna's mouth, stopping the scream. The boy looked at them, then put his hand over his own mouth, also stopping screaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deanna, calm down,\" Liang said. \"Everything's going to be okay. Now,\" he turned his attention towards the boy, \"who are you, and what are you doing on our ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Dimitri,\" the boy said, \"and this is my ship, the SS Winnipeg.\" His voice seemed to be adjusting ever so slightly as he talked, as if he was trying to find the right balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ship?!\" Deanna exclaimed. \"But this is our ship!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I should explain,\" said a voice from the darkness behind Dimitri. A woman stepped out from the shadows, and Liang and Deanna recognized it as Harriet Reyes, one of the adults on the ship, who was the only childless woman aboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Reyes?\" Liang said, surprised. \"Do you know about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I know about him,\" she said, as she put her hands on Dimitri's shoulders. \"He's my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna stared at her, mouth agape. \"B-but that's impossible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in the slightest,\" Harriet said, smiling. \"The simple fact is that Dimitri is an android I and my husband have been working on for the last three years. We were both so devastated when we learned that I was unable to have children, so we looked at the alternatives, and the only one that really made sense was creating one this way. In a way, it's just like making a child, but the process takes longer, and we had to put more of our heart and soul into it. We have been keeping him in our quarters until he was ready to be introduced to all of you, but I guess he found out how to sneak out in the middle of the night.\" Dimitri smiled as Harriet talked, looking up at her with a sense of admiration and longing. \"Dimitri, say hello to Liang and Deanna,\" Harriet said as she gestured towards the two human children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Deanna,\" Dimitri said as he bowed slightly, offering out his hand. Deanna hesitated a little before she finally took his hand and gave it a quick shake. Dimitri then straightened up and then stuck out his hand towards Liang, saying \"and Hello, Liang.\" Amazed, Liang stuck out his hand and squeezed Dimitri's, who had a firm, tight grip, causing Liang's hand to hurt, if only slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you,\" Liang said, as he pulled his hand back, rubbing it with his other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now, Dimitri,\" Harriet said, \"we need to get back to your room so we can all have a restful night. We'll introduce you to the other children tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" Dimitri said, as he turned around and headed back to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you get some sleep, too,\" Harriet said to Liang and Deanna. \"I have a feeling tomorrow's going to be a big day for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harriet disappeared back into their room, Liang turned to Deanna. \"Okay, how weird is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Deanna said. \"I think I'm still in shock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, regardless, we need to tell Ken and Dyson now, so as they don't freak out about it tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to wake them up in the middle of the night?\" Deanna asked. \"Why don't we just let them sleep? It's not like anyone can do anything tonight anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Liang said as he thought it over...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow!\" Liang heard Ken's voice coming from the bedroom, at what appeared to be an attempt at a whisper but was clearly audible from the main area of the cabin. \"Is that really a boy robot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssh!\" Ken's voice, not much softer, called out. \"Do you want them to hear us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang and Deanna both rolled their eyes. Deanna swiftly but quietly walked over to the door, sliding it open, revealing the two other boys crouching on the other side, looking up at her sheepishly. \"I think we already did, guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen gave Dyson a soft punch in the shoulder. \"Way to blow our cover, Dyson,\" he said with a slight bit of anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it,\" Liang said, coming over. \"You guys were gonna find out sooner or later.\" He stepped in the door, Deanna following behind him, and then slid the door shut. Sitting down on his bed, he motioned for the others to do likewise. \"So,\" he finally said after taking a deep breath, \"we have a new crew-mate. Dimitri Reyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would hardly call him that,\" Deanna snorted. \"He's an android.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Dyson asked. \"What's that mean? He's still able to talk and interact with us and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Deanna,\" Liang continued, \"he's an independent intelligence. It's not like we just got another navigation program or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna turned to look at Liang, a slight sense of irritation in her eyes. \"An independent intelligence? Give me five minutes with his base code and I'll be predicting his every move. Give me another five, and I'll be able to have him do and say anything I want him to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deanna,\" Liang started, \"that's not exactly--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me ask you this,\" she interrupted. \"There are dozens, if not hundreds, of androids amongst all the other starships out there. How many of them consider these machines part of the crew, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang's eyes went up in thought as he tried to think of an answer. \"Ummm\u2026\" he said, not coming up with one as his voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the opposite side of the room, Ken, who had been uncharacteristically quiet, spoke up. \"The answer is zero.\" His voice seemed a little depressed, and he didn't make eye contact with anyone as he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" Deanna nodded in Ken's direction, then turned back to look at Liang. \"Zero ships give androids any rights of representation on their ships. Why should we be any different?\" She looked around the room with a determined glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Dyson said, his voice cracking as he talked, \"he certainly seems nice enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Androids aren't nice,\" Deanna countered, standing up and beginning to pace the room. \"They do what they're told, what they're programmed to do. That's all they know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang stood up, placing his hand on her shoulder. \"But, Deanna, don't you think we need all the help we can get on this ship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly,\" she answered, \"but that doesn't mean I have to treat him as a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence once again filled their bedroom, and Liang turned away, looking out the porthole onto the vast void of space that lay beyond. As much as he liked Deanna personally, what she was saying here wasn't right, and he knew it. He just didn't know how to get her to see that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he heard Ken's voice start to say, and he turned around to face the six-foot tall crimson-skinned ten-year-old. \"You don't have to treat me as human, either. But you do. Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna seemed to be taken aback for a moment, but quickly regained her composure. \"That's different,\" she said. \"After all, you <b>are</b> half-human, at least. And besides, Thazazoids are an intelligent life form, and have a long history. Your mom's certainly proved that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen didn't answer right away, instead taking the time to choose the right words. \"True. But there are plenty of other human ships that don't choose to see it that way, and don't consider us part of the crew, as much as we might want to join. How is that any different than what you're doing here? After all, Dimitri could very well end up being much more intelligent than any human or Thazazoid, and maybe even write his own history for his race. Why don't you give him that same chance to prove himself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna seemed to take these words to heart, at least a little. \"Well\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter for now,\" Liang interjected. \"We're going to have to get used to living and working with Dimitri, whether you think he's part of our crew or not, Deanna. Let's just all get some sleep on it for now; we'll feel better about it in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three seemed to be agreeable to this, so they each crawled in bed. \"Good night, everyone,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night,\" they each responded, and they drifted off to sleep. Or so Liang thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality, everyone was kept awake, each staring at the ceiling to their room. Dyson couldn't help but be excited at the prospect of having someone new to meet and play with and get to know. He imagined all sorts of conversations he and Dimitri would share and all the fun they could have together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was more curious than excited about the new android boy, but he also couldn't help but think about Deanna's words. He had always felt that she treated him different than the other two boys because of his mixed heritage, and now he his suspicions were heightened. The Thazazoid traditions his mother had taught him said that in order to function together as a unit, whether that unit was of two people or of two thousand, you had to put aside all doubts and trust each and every man and woman in that group. He kept trying to do that with the doubts creeping in about Deanna, but they wouldn't seem to go away. Sighing, he turned over, facing the wall, hoping that exhaustion would eventually carry him off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeanna knew that she had hurt Ken's feelings a little, but she couldn't help but feel worried about their new crew member. Androids were machines; they were here to serve humans-- well, not just humans, she realized, but intelligent, sentient life in general-- and treating them like anything more than that was not only foolish, it could end up dangerous. Just like it had been for\u2026 no, she didn't want to think about that. Not tonight. Not if she wanted to sleep soundly without any nightmares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang's thoughts were perhaps the most peaceful of the group. He had always felt that his role as the eldest was to keep the peace and to protect the others, and now he had a new person to add to that mix. Yes, perhaps everything would end up mixing and gelling peacefully, but after the way Deanna had been talking tonight, that wasn't a safe assumption to make. He just hoped that she would learn to accept everyone on the ship, that he could make her see the error of her ways-- before it became a critical issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with only around four hours left before First Duties were to start being performed, the four children ended up falling asleep, one by one. Luckily, they each had a restful, recharging sleep, ready to face the new challenges of the next day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liang was surprised to see a young boy, about Ken's age, but undeniably human. At least that's how he looked; four-feet and five inches tall, tousled blond hair, and blue eyes. He wasn't wearing much, just a pair of dark blue boxer-briefs. He was lean, and extremely athletic looking, with fairly toned looking young muscles showing across his body, even a slight four-pack showed as he breathed. But there was something strange about him, Liang couldn't figure out what. The boy seemed to have a great complexion, almost too perfect. There wasn't a single blemish, birth mark or mole on him. And his breathing, it didn't seem right. The boy's face was also strangely emotionless and he just stared at the two of them blankly. \"Who is this kid?\" Deanna asked \"I've never seen him before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never seen him before either,\" Liang replied. \"Um... who are you kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Model-SC synthetic human child. I am named Dimitry,\" the boy responded emotionlessly, and in a robotic tone, \"What are your names young humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a robot?\" Liang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the correct colloquial term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are,\" said a female voice as a woman in her middle thirties came rushing into view, her short blond hair looking rather frazzled and wearing a labcoat over her nightgown. She was slim, and healthy, but not really athletic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang knew who this was; Joyce Albrecht, the only woman on the ship who didn't have children, and also a very talented engineer and roboticist. Almost immediately Liang made the connection, but he still couldn't believe it. \"Mrs. Albrecht...\" he began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell Liang, Deanna, did my son wake you up?\" Joyce asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son? What do you mean? I thought you couldn't have kids,\" Deanna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can't. He's a robot son, she made him,\" Liang explained in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right as usual Liang,\" Joyce exclaimed excitedly, \"Well, almost; just like any child Dimitry is a joint project. Xavier and I worked together on creating him. I did most of the hardware, while he developed the artificial intelligence. I wanted to wait a little before introducing him to everyone. We only just activated him a couple days ago and we were teaching him how to walk, but I guess he just walked off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He looks so... real,\" Liang muttered, \"Why didn't you activate him with the knowledge already present?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't want to overload him, and to fully utilize the new form of AI that my husband created. Dimitry's AI is designed to allow him to learn from every experience in the same fashion as a human, and develop emotions and use reasoning without the restriction of programming codes. He truly is an artificial human. Go on Dimitry, say hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Liang and Deanna, it is very pleasant to meet you,\" Dimitry said, offering his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiang shook his hand, and was surprised to find that, while Dimitry definitely had a strong and firm grip, he still shook his hand in a natural, human way. Deanna looked surprised too when he shook her hand, though she was looking... not quite as chipper as she had before. \"Incredible craftsmanship,\" Liang said, \"He still seems very robotic though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said he was only very recently activated. And in the same way humans begin life very emotionally driven and impulsive and become more logical and reasoning as they grow, so too does Dimitry, a robot, begin life very logical and emotionless, and gains emotion as he grows. Believe me he's already made significant progress; he didn't see any purpose to shaking hands when he first activated, now he does it without being prompted. And we only just got him to pretend to breathe too, just to help him seem less unnatural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, I believe we should allow Liang and Deanna to return to sleep mode,\" Dimitry said, and Liang caught a look of delight on Joyce's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes you're right. Start heading for home, I'll catch up in a minute,\" Joyce replied, at which Dimitry turned and walked away, still looking a little stiff. \"So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's amazing,\" Liang said, always willing to admire the latest technology, and Dimitry went above and beyond anything he'd ever seen. \"He still seems off, but I've never seen such a human-like robot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Deanna said, \"We should get back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Please keep this a secret for a couple more days okay?\" Joyce asked, \"I really want this to be a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Mrs. Albrecht,\" Liang said, and with that Joyce ran off after her son while Liang and Deanna head back towards their homes. \"So what do you think D?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure what I think,\" Deanna replied, \"It's so... weird. He's a robot, I know it's normal for creators to get attached to their creations, but doesn't that seem obsessive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was made to be a son, he's a kid like the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not like the rest of us. He's a mechanical weirdo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me you're actually going to discriminate against him just because he's a robot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not discrimination, it's true... look I'm too tired to talk about this, if you want to argue about it then let's sleep first,\" Deanna said, and with that she opened the door to her family's quarters and vanished inside. Liang walked a short distance further and went inside his own home and eventually back to bed. He couldn't help but be excited by what Dimitry could do, but eventually he was able to let sleep claim him.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The year is 2240.  Mankind, having abandoned Earth as an over-utilized, destroyed shell of the planet it once was, now roams the galaxy as a nomadic race, searching for any knowledge or resource they can find.  The overall known human population has dwindled down from its peak of 23 billion in the late twenty-first century to now approximately 80 million living among around 2500 starships.  These ships range in size from small, two or three family vessels to the largest, a floating city of more than a million passengers.  Some ships have grouped together to form fleets; others travel on their own, aloof and detached from the rest of their species.  Some are controlled through a rigid government, others are more anarchical. They all have one goal, though: survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith ships that can explore more and more of the galaxy, intelligence was bound to be discovered eventually, though this did not always end up being a good thing.  Other civilizations range from being either weary of humanity and what they\u2019ve heard of its past, to downright hostile, trying to eliminate the \u201cHuman Scourge of the Galaxy.\u201d  Only a few species have proven amicable to humans and choose to help them in their struggles.  Though rare, some aliens even live on larger human vessels, contributing their knowledge in a hope to better humankind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even with the thousands of ships exploring different sections of the galaxy, the vast majority of the universe remains uncharted.  Any ship out there can face death and destruction right around the corner, but they also could come across exotic and beautiful locations, or sources of unusual and amazing phenomenon.  In the deep reaches of outer space, anything can and will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you will choose a ship (or create your own), and will meet the young passengers aboard that ship.  Your story should focus on characters younger than twenty, since you usually don\u2019t get to see them doing anything interesting in science-fiction.  Each group can be all male, all female, or a mix of the two (and, of course, if you throw in alien species, who knows what you\u2019ll end up with).  Their adventures might be on their ship, landing on a planet, or anything else you can think of, and could include realistic, fantastic, and surrealistic elements, as well as a level of violence, sexuality, or language. It's okay to get incorporate certain elements like furry, shrinking, growing, muscle development, transformation, or other things like that, but make sure that they're not the focus of the story, and that they make sense in the context of the previous chapters and the overall story.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s about it!  I hope that this story piques your interest and that you will be encouraged to add on your own ideas.
