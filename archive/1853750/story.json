Essentially, hyper-pregnancy is the fantasy of someone having an excessive amount of babies in a single pregnancy.  (Six or above.)  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMainly female characters will be the focus, but because I'm understanding, male pregnancy will be allowed.  (Plz tag in the title, it's not everybody's thing.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway!  To start things off, let's start with what type of media you'd like to focus on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And you have certain responsibilities as a husband,\" Ayeka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi just looked at them.  \"And you two have responsibilities as a wife,\" he said.  \"No more fighting.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRyoko and Ayeka cast glares at each other... but relented.  \"Of course, dearest,\" Ayeka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Just pranks from now on, I promise,\" Ryoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNearby, Tenchi's other wives, Sasami, Washu, Mihoshi and Noike sat in the steamy hot water, chuckling to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Those two won't ever quit, will they?\" Noike asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWashu snorted.  \"Ryoko just said she'd keep to pranks.  That's something of a miracle in itself,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMihoshi was in bliss.  \"I'mma princess now!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSasami, Ryo-Ohki resting on her head, just smiled.  This really was peaceful.  But still...  \"Miss Kiyone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a squeak from behind one of the rocks.  \"Princess Sasami?\" said a voice.  A woman in a Juraian guard uniform came out, her long green hair held out of her face by a headband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMihoshi smiled.  \"Kiyone, come on and join us!  I've missed you!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKiyone Makibi sighed.  Ever since she had nearly died on one of Washu's old bases, she had wanted revenge on Mihoshi for her blithering idiocy.  But now she didn't dare touch her.  For one thing, her new partner was favored by the scary and powerful politician Seto Kamiki.  Secondly, she was now married to Prince Tenchi, heir to the throne, who apparently was absurdly powerful as well.  She had been recovered by the Galaxy Police, but as soon as she was, she was assigned as bodyguard for the royal family.  Meaning she had to be around Mihoshi constantly.  She had given up her plans for revenge and just prayed nothing weird happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Princess, it's not appropriate for me to...\" Kiyone started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Kiyone,\" Tenchi said.  \"Save the titles for when we're in public.  If you live here, you're part of the family.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, c'mon copper!\" Ryoko said, pouring herself some sake.  \"Join us!  You need to melt that stick up your ass!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKiyone fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka giggled.  \"While I disagree with Ryoko's phrasing, you do seem overly tense.  Join us.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm your guard!\" Kiyone protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So bring your sidearm,\" Noike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"This isn't proper procedure...\" Kiyone protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMihoshi got out of the water and hugged her.  \"We aren't all proper princesses,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I am!\" Ayeka said.  Ryoko splashed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKiyone sighed, giving up.  \"Okay, okay... Just let me get to the shower area to clean up...\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce she was done, she came out to join the others in the bathing pool, wrapped in a towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nope, no towels,\" Ryoko said, levitating Kiyone's towel away.  The police officer turned bodyguard squeaked and blushed, covering herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Kiyone dear, you have nothing to be ashamed of,\" Ayeka said, her cheeks red from the sake she was drinking.  \"Now come.  I want Master Tenchi surrounded by beautiful naked women.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRyoko snickered.  \"All this time protesting me throwing myself at Tenchi and now you want MORE gorgeous women around him.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi just blushed, a little drunk himself, which was why he hadn't apologized to Kiyone yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka grinned.  \"This is a happy time,\" she said.  \"Master Tenchi saved the universe more than once, and is now married.  If I say I want him surrounded by the seven most beautiful women in the galaxy, then he'll be surrounded by the seven most beautiful women in the galaxy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"She's including you in the seven, by the way,\" Noike said.  Kiyone blushed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So come on!\" Ryoko said to Kiyone.  \"Uncover yourself and come in the water.  I promise you that we'll keep Tenchi from molesting you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Indeed,\" Ayeka said. \"I want him molesting US.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKiyone blushed.  \"Well... I suppose it couldn't hurt,\" she said.  She still had her weapon, so she could defend them if need be.  Plus, it felt nice to be called one of the most beautiful women in the galaxy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWashu smiled as Kiyone joined them in the water.  After a few drinks, she and Noike were sharing Mihoshi stories, the blonde oblivious to the fact that they were basically insulting her.  She sighed, content.  Her sister Tokimi was inhabiting the shrine, and her other sister Tsunami was sharing a body with young Sasami.  Life was good... although she couldn't help but think that she was forgetting something very important...</span></div></div>",

Around him, his seven monstergirl companions looked rather interested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKuroko Smith nodded.  \"Yeah, this is actually something I took initiative on.  I tracked down and talked to each of your families...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Wait,\" Rachnee said, the arachne visibly confused.  \"How do you know where my family lives?  I've never mentioned them before.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuu spoke up next, the slime looking confused.  \"Also, Suu technically doesn't have parents...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith sipped her coffee.  \"When you registered for the hosting program, we did it from your original home, remember?\" she asked, amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRachnee facepalmed, annoyed with herself for not realizing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith smiled.  \"As for you, Suu...\" She sighed.  \"We don't know much about slimes yet.  So right now we're counting this group here as your family.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuu beamed happily, Papi hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMiia, however, was pouting, the lamia's tail flicking back and forth.  \"Can we get back to the point?\" the redheaded beauty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith nodded.  \"Anyway.  Because Kimihito's been such a sweetheart, he's become sort of a poster boy for the hosting program.  Especially for hosting less humanoid liminals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blushed as all the monstergirls in the room shot him adoring looks.  \"I'm... It's just being nice, is all.  Being a good host.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith gave him a serious look.  \"Kimihito, you've inspired people to take in less humanoid breeds of liminal.  Hosting for lamias, centaurs, and arachne-types has gone up just from people HEARING about how well you're getting along with your girls here.  And on top of that...\" She sipped her coffee.  \"You're clearly in love with all seven of them, you're just too scared of hurting anyone's feelings to focus on one or the other.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Yeah, you're right,\" Kimihito admitted, startling everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Darling?\" Miia said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito chuckled, leaning back in his chair.  \"Ever since you girls have come into my life, I've never had a dull moment.  Even despite all the accidental injuries and near-death experiences that everyone except Rachnee has inflicted on me...\" he said.  Rachnee smirked at this, while the other girls flinched.  Kimihito continued.  \"I can't imagine my life without ANY of you now.  Miia's vivaciousness and honest affection, Papi's innocence, Cerea's sense of honor, Suu's simple joy of life, Mero's nobility, Rachnee's cleverness and cunning, Lala's patience...\"  He blushed, and added.  \"Plus, you think with all the accidental flashing I get around here that I'd get desensitized to all the sexy.  Thankfully, that hasn't happened!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone giggled at that, the monstergirls all feeling their affection for Kimihito growing after his admission.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito sighed.  \"I just... I didn't want to ruin all the friendships you all had,\" he said, grimacing and adding, \"You girls are scary when you get angry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls all flinched again.  Mero looked thoughtful for a moment, and said, \"Ms. Smith.  You said you had talked to our families... Was it about all of us marrying Kimihito at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone stared.  Ms. Smith reached into her pocket and pulled out a folded up paper.  She unfolded it and put it down on the table.  \"Like I said, Kimihito, you've been a godsend to the hosting program.  The LEAST I can do after dumping so much on you is ease one of the burdens on you.\"  She smiled.  \"I had to get this made special, and do some major fast-talking with the judges involved... All you eight have to do is sign it and you'll be legally married.  Any ceremonies you want can be held later, and I personally will foot the bill.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blinked.  \"Wow, really?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRachnee frowned.  \"How?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith grinned.  \"I got a big promotion AND I won a crapton of cash in the lottery!  Recognition of my work at last!  I'm in a good mood so I feel like doing nice things for people I like!\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRachnee nodded, smirking.  That made more sense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone stared at the paper.  The monstergirls all wanted Kimihito for themselves, but...  All of them, even simple-minded Papi and Suu, realized that this was the best, if not only option.  Anything else would end up with someone hurt.  They'd all come to love each other too much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito, startling them all, was the first to sign.  The monstergirls all looked at each other again... and slowly smiled, coming to a decision.  One by one, each one of them signed the marriage license. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey would become a family for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Excellent!\" Ms. Smith said.  \"Incidentally, this means that the restriction against having sex with ya girls here has been lifted.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKimihito blushed, his nose bleeding a little.  \"That has occurred to me, yes,\" he said.  Miia and Rachnee traded wicked looks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith chuckled, pocketing the marriage license.  \"Plus, as you're all still technically part of the hosting program, all future food and medical expenses will be covered by us as per usual.  I'll just go get this filed.  Incidentally,\" she said, \"Any marriage ceremonies are gonna have to wait at least a month.  Me and the rest of MON have a mission in the Hokkaido area that will keep us busy for that whole time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Anything serious?\" Cerea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith shrugged, finishing her coffee.  \"Possibly.  We're investigating a pharmecutical company which may have been putting drugs in people's food and water,\" she said.  \"We should be fine, though.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Be careful,\" Kimihito said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith smiled as she left, returning the coffee cup.  \"Thanks,\" she said.  \"See you lovelies later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/////////<br>\r\nA month later...<br>\r\nHokkaido...<br>\r\n/////////<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTio, in her massive mech-suit, broke down the door, charging through the gunfire of the guards shooting at her.  Zombina, who had been riding on her back, leaped into the air and attacked, doing impressive spins and cackling madly as she fired her machine guns.  Behind them, Ms. Smith, Manako, and Doppel charged in, along with a heavily armed crew.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey seized the building, shooting any guards they found dead, and capturing any scientists.  Ms. Smith looked furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Bastards,\" she muttered.  \"Did you think we wouldn't find out!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe scientists all cowered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What were they doing, anyway?\" asked one of the combat crew. \"All I knew about them is that they made an antigen that made zombie-types like Zombina here non-contagious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why do you think I'm so damn pissed at them?\" Zombina muttered.  \"They made it so I can be intimate with someone without killing them, made it so I don't have to be scared of myself, and then they pull this shit...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"They were secretly infecting female liminals with fertility drugs,\" Doppel said, kicking one of the captured scientists.  \"Ones that made them pregnant with dozens of babies at once.  They were planning on using the babies for their sick medical experiments, kidnapping the mothers...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Science cannot advance without sacrifice!\" insisted once of the scientists.  Doppel looked at him, showing him what her eyes really looked like.  The man fainted, foaming at the mouth as his brain shattered from the impossible sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Doppel, quit mind-raping them,\" Ms. Smith said, \"We need some of them sane for trial.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fine...\" Doppel said in almost a whiny tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTio came up to the others, removing her helmet to reveal the adorable Oni within.  \"That's everyone, Ms. Smith,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Good...\" Smith said.  \"Now.  How do I access your list of victims?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe scientists milled about, looking wary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tManako sighed, closing her eye... and without opening it, shot one of the scientists in the head.  She smiled sadly.  \"We only need some of you for trial.  I really don't want to have to kill anyone more than I have to.  So... please?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA scientist with a dark spot on his trousers from where he had pissed himself in fear pointed to a computer, stammering out how to access it.  \"T-The drug should wear off in a month or two so long as they haven't had sex.  It was designed for a temporary effect.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMs. Smith nodded, and went over to the computer, accessing the list.  \"Okay,\" she said.  \"All of these are in the hosting program, so we should be... beee... beeeeeeeeee....\" Ms. Smith whimpered.  \"Eeeeeeee....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCurious, Doppel, Zombina, Tio, and Manako came over to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh!\" Tio said upon seeing what made Ms. Smith's brain break.  \"Oh my!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDoppel and Zombina began laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tManako eeped.  \"Didn't you just help those seven get married to their host last month?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So much paperwork...\" Ms. Smith moaned, fainting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe names on the list?  Miia, Papi, Centorea Shianus, Suu, Princess Meroune Lorelei, Rachnera Arachnera, and Lala.</span></div></div>",

It was the Thousand Sunny, home of the Straw Hat Pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"To adventure!\" Luffy said, the hyperactive would-be Pirate King standing on top of the crows nest.  Monkey D. Luffy was happy.  Things were going great for his crew.  They'd been having great adventures lately, and his friends had recently worked out some long-standing personal issues, so they were happy too.  Supplies were high, the ship was in great condition... Life was good.  All he needed was a new adventure to have now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBelow him, his crew milled about, preparing for their duties.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The sea wind is perfect today,\" Nami said, the buxom, red-headed navigator smiling as she felt the breeze wash over her trim body.  \"Plus, it's looking like strong winds and clear skies for the next week.\"  She had learned to read the weather from a society living in the sky.  Clad only in a pair of tight fitting jeans and a top that was more like a bra than anything else, she smiled, looking over her maps, charting their next course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeaning over the bow was the ship's marksman, the long-nosed Usopp.  He chuckled to himself, watching the horizon.  He reflected idly on his old days, and how much he lied about his prowess... He flexed a muscle, kissing it.  He was becoming a bad liar.  Ever since joining the Straw Hat Pirates, he had become so strong he could actually do some of the things he lied about before!  And he wouldn't have it any other wa.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe heavily scarred swordsman, Roronoa Zoro just chuckled, running a hand through his green hair as he cleaned and sharpened his three swords.  \"Had some good fighting lately.  Challenging enough to be interesting without being a near disaster like one of the Yonkou,\" he said, referring to the super-powerful pirates who ruled the seas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the kitchens, Sanji Vinsmoke, former assassin turned master chef, was busy preparing breakfast.  They'd had windfall both in supplies and money recently, and Sanji was making good use of it.  Besides, in a kitchen serving food is where he felt he belonged.  (Well, either that or in the arms of a beautiful woman, but he'd learned that Robin and Nami wouldn't be returning his advances.  Never stopped him from flirting with them, though.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the medbay, the anthropomorphic reindeer and master physician Tony Tony Chopper was looking at his short, adorable self in the mirror.  \"I really do look like a plush toy,\" he said, finally accepting it.  \"Oh well...\"  It didn't matter that much.  He was with people who loved him and respected his talents.  He was content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the ship's innards, cybernetic shipwright Franky was checking the hull.  He knew everything was all right, but it never hurt to check.  Once he was certain everything was all right, he post, thrusting his arms upward and leaning to the side, touching his thick forearms together to make a star out of the tattoos there.  \"SUPER!\" he crowed.  \"Okay!  Things are good NOW.  Time to see if they can be IMPROVED!\" He pressed his metal nose, his bright blue hair switching from its usual pompadour to a mad scientist frizz.  \"Gotta look the part when I'm inventing!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn her private quarters, Nico Robin was busy.  And loving it.  The archaelogist was using her Devil Fruit powers to create several arms and hands to take notes as she went over the Poneglyph rubbings she had gotten recently.  She adored history, and was so very close to finding out the secrets behind the Poneglyphs, one of her lifelong dreams... She looked up towards the main deck, and smiled.  She owed the Straw Hat Crew so much.  She couldn't imagine her life without them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe final member of the crew, the ship's musician, Brook, danced around happily.  The undead skeleton, respendent in suit and afro, was simply enjoying his unlife, playing his violin and filling the air with beautiful, happy music.  He had gotten a second chance after his Devil Fruit allowed him to retake his body (although it had rotted to a skeleton by then), and had nothing but inspiration through every battle and hardship.  He loved being a part of this crew, and would protect them with his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey were the Straw Hat Pirates.  And they were the best.</span></div></div>",

And saved Robin from twenty years of hated solitude and gave her a reason to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey truly loved him, and their hearts shattered when they saw his anguished face in the paper and then him sending the message to wait two years before they could all meet up. The affection only grew over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami hasn't said anything as of yet because she assumes Luffy wouldn't even know what she was talking about seeing how dense he acts, while Robin sees it wrong due to the ten year age difference between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut soon both would find the moment to confess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat they didn't know was that other women had similar thoughts, or that they noticed each other. While some others were about to be affected regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(SEVERAL MINUTES LATER)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew had come ashore, and as per usual, Luffy had jumped off to go exploring immediately. Some chuckled, some groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper and Ussop had gone off together to see if they can't find some near medical herbs or rare insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro went to train in a more open space where he can't cause damage to the ship. Brook tagged along to make sure he didn't somehow get to the Sky Islands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was going so she could map the island with Robin as company. Of course Sanji wanted to tag along, but was quickly put down. The food supplies were topped off, so he didn't have to go. So he had to stay on the ship with Franky. Super...<br>\r\n/////////<br>\r\nThe women of the crew were now walking down a path through a forested area in a comfortable silence, while in their minds they were thinking of ways to profess to Luffy in a way he'd understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Robin had noticed that Nami had a look on her face that showed she was thinking. So she inquired,\" Something on your mind Miss Navigator?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid redhead was broken from her thoughts,\" Eh? No I'm fine. Just thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired women let out a smile, \"About a certain rubber-man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami visibly reacted to this, she knew what she was thinking. So she countered,\" Like you too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was one of the few times Robin's stoic facade was broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing else was said for a while, now confirming that they shared affection for the same man seemed... almost unreal to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all current thoughts ended as they left the wooded area, and several feet in front of them was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the center of the chamber, surrounded by small canals they assumed led outside, was a stone statue, partially damaged due to the passage of time. Even without the arms or a head, it was easy to tell it depicted a woman due to certain... \"features\". Namely, the gigantic breasts and stomach that were attached to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real attention grabber, was what laid in the center of that, where the navel would be located.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful, nearly transparent gem. Even in the low light of the chamber it shined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly, Nami's eyes turned into Beri signs and she rushed over to claim it. She wrapped her hands around it and pulled. Although, it must have been wedged in there good because she had a bit of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was handling that, Robin had noticed more carvings in the nearby walls. This time there were images with the hieroglyphs.<br>\r\nWhat drew her attention was that there was a female shape with a gem in its center, and the following images depicted her stomach getting steadily bigger over time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a male figure was seen kneeling with its arm on her. And he was surrounded by other similarly drawn females. And if you looked closely, the male was kneeling with its arms on her stomach. She then noticed that he wore something that looked like a crown, with what looked like a 'D' on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin believes she has deciphered the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Nami managed to pull the gem mostly out of the statue, but she lost her footing due to a loose stone and fell backwards, yanking the gem out and sending it flying..... in Robin's direction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that exact moment, Robin had turned around,\" Ms. Navigator, I believe I-\" her explanation was cut off. Because against all preconceived odds, the gem Nami had found, landed perfectly in Robin's exposed navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami was fairly mortified. \" I am SO sorry!\" She cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was only fairly surprised, not expecting it, but moving past it. \" It's fine Nami.\" She calmly replied back, actually using her name. \"At least you still have it. As I was trying to say, I believe this temple was made to revere and worship some sort of fertility idol. This gem,\" she said unknowingly gesturing towards it, and unaware that the white bauble had begun to turn purple, \"was the object of their praise and supposedly the source of the idol's power. What confuses me now is this male figure over here, the writing never mentioned this island previously having a king of any kind.\" She explained, moving her hand along the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami stopped paying attention after the second sentence. The reason was quite shocking, and Robin noticed the surprised look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" She asked confusedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-ou're younger!\" The redhead stuttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's eyes widened, and then she looked down towards the canals to view the reflective water. And Nami was right! While she didn't look too different, she saw that she was slightly shorter and had a more youthful air about her. She estimated herself to be Nami's age at least! But deep down, she was subconsciously elated, if this was permanent this made her closer to Luffy's age as well, and her previous thoughts about the age difference were vanishing. 'Luffy...' her thoughts went back to the rubber boy who had done more for her than she can ever hope to repay, wishing for their friendship to be more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an ominous rumble echoed through the chamber. Nami looked towards the ceiling, thinking the place was unstable. But Robin blushed, she felt where it came from: her stomach. Suddenly, she felt a great heat emanate from within her, some how it made her feel sick and pleasant at the same time. She clutched at her stomach with a slight groan, the feeling growing more intense. Then she felt her hands being pushed out, causing her to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the sight of her belly steadily growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a silent gasp, showing honest surprise one of the few times in her adult life. How this was happening, she had an idea now but before she could say anything, her belly swelled further outward eating up the surrounding space, and making her jacket rise upward and her sarong go downward, both feeling increasingly smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nami...,\" she manages to groan out, a blush started to spread on her face. The navigator looked towards her, and instantly her face turned red and her jaw hit the floor, \"Oh my...!\" She couldn't help but stare at her, the jewel looking back like an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Robin felt the weight and grew to where she had to sit down. And then, to her increasing surprise, she could feel her already large breast grow as well as her prodigious backside and widening hips, somehow making her sitting position feel better. Robin was growing all over, and to add to her also growing shock, she felt a flurry of movement in the great swell protruding from her middle. She was pregnant. VERY pregnant. Adding to the sensations, she felt a twinge behind her navel that was just out of reach with her normal hands. Then with a loud 'POP', her navel became an outie and the jewel came out with it, flying past Nami but she paid it no heed. And like magic, the growth finally stopped, and Robin sat there on the cold floor, gravid and aroused like nothing else, cradling and rubbing what parts of her belly she could reach and using her powers to sprout arms to rub other spots. She could feel 5 new lives within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami still gaped at her. How could she not? She just witnessed her friend bloat up to enormous sizes! Her already large breast had grown to true melons, her ass was like a pair of basket balls had been stuffed into her sarong, and her belly alone was a beachball at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"How the hell...?\" She asked stupified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What happens next?)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luffy had been exploring the jungle area of the island for some time now. Then he noticed the same cave the girls entered earlier. \"Ooh, that looks interesting!\" And then he entered as well, his footsteps not echoing through the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as he approached the girls in the chamber, he froze. His gaze completely locked on the fecund, gravid swell that was the now younger Robin's belly. Subtly watching as five of her arms stroked and rubbed what they could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flashed back to his childhood, before he had to move in with the Dadan family. He was leaving the bar one day when he bumped into a fisherman walking home with his pregnant wife. Out of pure childish curiosity, he was allowed to feel her bump. When he did, something just clicked in his mind. Even after he moved to the mountain, the image just stayed with him, though he never showed it when others where there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped out of his triage when Nami noticed him. \"Luffy!\" Snapping back to his senses, he rushed over to the archeologist, \"Robin, are you ok?! What happened?!\" The now gravid woman was barely able to look at him, a blush dusting her cheeks. While she enjoyed the concern he showed, it would be better at ANY other situation, this one was too embarrassing for her. Nami looked on in slight jealousy, wishing his attention was on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy then focused on her belly again, enjoying the appearance of it, but pushing that back, until he tentatively reached a hand out towards it. The moment his hand came in contact with the warm, rounded flesh, that click in his mind from 12 years ago came back, and for Robin? She let out a gasp and then a throaty moan as her bodies new residents all kicked towards his hand. They were reacting to 'daddy'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd suddenly, it was like they both knew where to go from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNami could only look on in her continually growing surprise as HER captain leaned down and placed the side of his head on top of Robin's large belly, eyes closed and a content smile on his face, while his left hand rubbed the massive orb, and his right was on the opposing side, held by Robin's while she stroked his head. Luffy has NEVER shown any sort of 'attraction' towards women in the time she has known him. 'Is THIS what he's into?!' she thought, somewhat misreading the situation. Then remembering what Robin was saying earlier, and noticed the gem on the floor behind her, and began weighing her options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in front of her, she heard the two talking. \"Are you pleased Luffy?\" Robin asked endearingly, as she guided his hand to where she felt kicks.<br>\r\n\"I love it Robin. And I love you as well.\" He spoke in a mature and serious tone rarely heard from him. He punctuated his declaration with a kiss on Robin's large, outie navel, which made her gasp lightly, and then another on her lips, which she moaned into. Then she continued to for another reason. The heat she felt came back, albeit less intense, she still felt it. Then she felt her belly almost vibrate somewhat, and then it expanded slightly more. Robin and Luffy welcomed the change with more rubbing and kisses. The captain then used his observation haki to sense her brood. He counted six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first two intimate actions, Nami stopped paying attention again, and picked up the gem, inserting it into her navel, exposed from wearing nothing but a bikini top and low-riding skinny jeans, saying in her head 'screw the consequences!' When it was in, she closed her eyes and started thinking about everything Luffy had done for her, defeating Arlong and saving her home, trudging through snow and giant, carnivorous rabbits to get her to a doctor, rescuing her from a madman who thought he was God, and every other act he had done for her that lead to her infatuation. While doing that, the color of the gem turned a bright orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes came fast, her body already perfect for what was to come.Then she felt the same heat Robin felt within her, then her belly gurgled loud enough for her to hear it. She felt ill but she was determined to see this through. She wanted what they had, she NEEDED Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then watched with a brave face as she changed. The soft, pale flesh of her stomach began to push out, steadily growing and rounding into a solid mass. Then she felt her already large breasts start to grow with it, starting to strain her bikini top. She could feel her rear growing as well, along with her hips to bear the new lives, with thighs to match. As she felt her pants tighten, she quickly reached and undid her Beri sign belt before it could snap off. While that relieved the strain, she couldn't stop as the button on her jeans popped off and the zipper rushed down. Surprisingly, she kept herself standing the whole process, but as it slowed to a stop, she took a kneeling position, and took a relieved breath. She looked over herself, her now larger breast strained her top, her jeans ready to burst as they contained her expanded lower half, the tops of each cheek peeking out the top, and gone was the flat stomach she worked to maintain, her belly was now the same size as Robin's, though miraculously, the gem was still in her navel as it had not popped out yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the kicking came, causing her gut to wiggle slightly, and her to moan whilst rubbing it. Looking back to the two raven hairs, she saw they had been watching her with understanding smiles on their faces. Luffy then approached her and squatted by her side, she couldn't help but blush at his closeness to her new form. \"L-Luffy I--\" she tried to explain herself, but Luffy raised a hand to stop her. \"I understand Nami. And I truly appreciate the length you went. Know that I love you as well.\" Nami was shocked at how he could say that to her after telling that to Robin. But she was cut off as said archaeologist waddled over to them, breast jiggling, ass bouncing, and her massive belly swaying. With it in front of Nami's face, she looked down at her, \"We are pirates Miss, or 'Mrs. Navigator,\" she let out a giggle at her new nickname, though it wasn't far from the truth. \"Since when do rules matter to us?\" She asked rhetorically. Not waiting for an answer, both Luffy and Robin gently pushed the redhead onto her back, her own belly hanging above her, looking even bigger from her perspective. Luffy then put both hands on the sides of her belly, and like with Robin, the life inside began to kick at his hands. She tried to reach her own upwards to rub it, but a pair of arms sprouted by Robin's ability held them down. They were going to handle it. Nami moaned pathetically as she felt her pleasure growing. Then more phantom arms appeared, two at Nami's sides began to rub them, and two more came from her shoulders, and proceeded to massage her breast. Nami felt like she was in heaven right now, the pleasure she felt was more intense than anything. Then it increased to pure euphoria as Luffy left a slow, deliberate trail of kisses, from right next to her still bejeweld navel, to atop her belly, to her now lactating breast, then stopped at her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it all came at once. The heat she felt came back, not as strong as before, but enough. Her already massive belly started to grow even more. She moaned loudly as it swelled further. Her now released arms held her sides as she saw her great stomach rise like a mountain in front of her. Then, she felt the pressure build up in the front, and then like with Robin, the jewel had been forced out by her now popped out navel. The rock soared overhead, and landed in the canals on the edges of the chamber, apparently sinking under the water. But Nami didn't care, treasure was the farthest thing from her mind. She was in complete bliss, she had the man of her dreams with her, and a belly full of his children. And she was perfectly fine with sharing him with Robin, who was also beginning to moan as her belly stretched and grew even further until it matched Nami's. Their breast where the size of watermelons, rears the size of basketballs, and bellies where bigger than yoga balls. Any more and what scraps remained of their clothing would burst off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy smiled at this sight, pleased to see how his women were more than willing to carry his children. After all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of king doesn't have any heirs? And wanted plenty...</span></div></div>",

After escaping imprisonment from the marines, she had gathered a new, bigger ship, a new larger crew, and revived her pirate crew. She even got a new set of her favorite clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had gotten good for the female captain, and she celebrated with her favorite activity: eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo currently she was on her bed in her personal quarters, feasting on all matters of food her men brought to her. Lucky her that most of her crew just happened to be excellent chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry *gobble* and bring me *swallow* more!\" She commanded while cramming a slice of pizza and a chicken leg into her mouth. Throwing the bone onto a pile of empty dishes and inedible parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as if he was waiting outside, a member strolled in with a giant cart of freshly prepared meals, more pizza, whole chickens, fried fish, and many more. There was also the recent newspaper. After bringing it in, he quickly took the discarded plates back out with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the paper and one of the fish. Looking at the former, she didn't notice the fish had a bulge in its abdomen, before she swallowed it whole and pulled out the skeleton. While reading, she saw that on the front page was an article of the Strawhats beating a pirate crew on some island and making a mockery of the marines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrawhat Luffy, just looking at him brought back the memory of when he troubled her and the other supernovas when he punched a celestial dragon and made the marines rain hell onto the archipelago. THAT certainly put a crimp in her plans, and forced her to move ahead of schedule, resulting in her capture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swore that when she finds him, she was gonna make him pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she put the paper down, she felt her belly rumble and put her hand to it. It wasn't a hungry rumble, she knew how those were. In fact, the only thing she ate from her current course was that fish, but now she wasn't hungry anymore. Then an uncomfortable warmth began to spread through her, before also settling in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she saw her belly begin to push against her hand, already exposed from her small tank top that progressively got smaller. Her plump breast began to grow somewhat as well, making her shirt feel even smaller. And her shorts were small already, so with her growing rear, hips, and thighs, it's a miracle they weren't shredded yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to push down her body parts in a futile attempt to get them back to normal, but everything was so incredibly sensitive she moaned with just a touch. The process ended with her looking like she swallowed a basketball. It was firm but still had some give to it. Her innie navel now seemed like a deep cavern. She was in a panic, thinking how this could happen to her. She never gained any weight from food, even with her eating habits, so how--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped thinking when she saw and felt a bulge come from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pregnant. And judging from the two other separate spots she felt kicks, it was triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonney let out a breathless scream as her body's new occupants swam around, getting acquainted with their new home, creating bulges on her tight belly skin. Just a few minutes ago, she was her thin, sexy self, and now she sat there, full term with triplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now all she wanted was to rush to her ships infirmary and do SOMETHING about them, but then her belly let out its telltale hungry gurgle, only stronger than she ever felt before. She was STARVING. Normally she eats enough for 10 people, now it's 13.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the cart right there, still packed with the rest of the food she didn't touch, she knew what comes first. Feeding her children...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have time to ponder that last thought as she dove in, tearing everything apart. Noodles were slurped, pizza was swallowed and drinks were guzzled down. Nothing was being left, not even bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued thinking about her situation in between mouthfuls. She couldn't talk at the rate she was going or she would choke. 'I'm gonna find whoever did this to me, and they're gonna regret turning me into this... picture of beauty- no! What?! Why am I not feeling angry?! They blesse- VIOLATED me! With these gifts of perfectio- NO!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer self-conflicting thoughts just made her angry and confused, leading her to chow down more aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen in the span of a few minutes, beating previous records, the cart was clear of foods, no scraps remained and all plates had been literally licked clean. Normally she'd be hungry for even more, but her stomach told her she was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down and taking a breather, she gazed at her belly, and from her position it seemed even bigger, but like always, the food had no effect on her appearance. Putting her hands on it and rubbing the stretched skin, it proved to still be as sensitive as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why. Why can't I hate this?\" She asked herself. It's true, she wanted to be furious, upset, even slightly irritated about her new feature, but she just couldn't bring herself to feel any sort of negativity towards it.<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;<br>\r\nLittle did she know, The Gem was altering her mind set to do so. It makes women perfect mothers to the master's progeny, and that's the first step, should they not already hold some affection towards him. Now to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne could say it had a sense of humor. It liked using its power in conjunction with the mother's quirks, personality, and even what abilities they may have. And this one had quite the appetite.<br>\r\n&gt;&gt;<br>\r\nSuddenly, Bonney's belly began gurgling again, and the heat within her resonated, and her gut began to expand again. Seeing this, she hurriedly sat up, not wanting to be pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shirt rolled up to her larger breasts, and while to button to her shorts had popped off, the clothing itself was somehow stretching with her body. Overall, now nothing obscured her belly as it grew, taking half the bed with its sheer size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why... does this feel... so GOOD?!' She thought. All she could do was moan and rub what was still in reach. As more and more children were added to her brood. Kicking so fast and hard you'd think they were frantic to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was finally over, she could feel kicks from 12 different spots. It was so massive, and surprisingly , her navel only deepened. It looked as if you could get lost in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gem finally succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set a hazy gaze upon the newspaper from before, and seeing Luffy's face, her mind snapped back into focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking it up, she took one more close look...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore kissing Luffy's picture, leaving a lipstick mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pressed the paper to her belly while simultaneously rubbing the side. \"Look at our children Luffy~,\" she said in a dazed yet gleeful voice, \"See how I care for and nurture them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting the newsprint down, she leaned forward and wrapped her arms around her gigantic stomach, cradling, stroking and petting the vast orb. \"Our precious little angels~\" she muttered, before kissing the top of her own belly.<br>\r\n&gt;<br>\r\nThe Gem's work was done. Time to move on.<br>\r\n&gt;<br>\r\nBonney began to feel pressure on the front of her belly, where she couldn't reach. She knew it was pointless to try, so she sat there moaning in ecstasy. She thought it was another barrage of kicks from her children, and simply reveled in the new feeling of motherhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile out of her sight, the skin around her navel began to distort, and with a loud 'pop', The Gem emerged, as pink as her hair, before sailing out of her open window, and turning what was once a deep, cavernous innie, into a fat, marshmallow sized outie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in a mix of relief and disappointment as the feeling ended, she sat there, content with her new life, and gazing at Luffy's picture lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil her now enormous middle roared with hunger yet again, causing her children to start kicking all at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoking down the moans and adopting her previous, somewhat bratty persona, she yelled out, \"Bring me more, idiots! Triple what this was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps receding from her door, she turned back to her glorious stomach and softly stroked it, trying to calm the life inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh, don't worry my darlings,\" she whispered in a motherly tone, \"Mommy will keep you all nice and fed, and make sure you grow big and strong for when we see Daddy again. And who knows, there may be even more of you by then.\" Her words sweeter than any sugar or honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the kicking continued, one reached out and pushed against her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still hungry, and who knows just when her cooks will be done. But with another gaze to her room, she saw that the furniture looked really appetizing...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's too quiet.  Something usually happens by now...\" he said.  \"At the very least, I should be a woman at this point.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAkane blinked.  \"Yeah, that is kinda weird...\" she said.  Ranma was cursed by an ancient Chinese spring to turn into a woman whenever struck by cold water.  Hot water changed him back.  And of all the martial artists in Nerima cursed by the springs, his was easiest to deal with.  As for their normal routine, normally there was an old woman who was out watering her garden, who somehow managed to get Ranma wet every time they passed by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's never quiet,\" he said.  \"Usually the old perv is trying to steal panties by now, or Shampoo jumps me, or that asshole father of the Kunos tries something...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAkane grimaced.  \"And now I'm thinking about how weird our lives are that an evil old martial arts master, a lovesick Chinese amazon, and an insane principal are common occurances...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma shook his head.  \"I'm telling you, Akane, something's up!  It's the quiet before the storm, and we...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma suddenly shrank about a foot, becoming Akane's height.  His hair became red and his chest suddenly sprouted round, perky boobs as his curse triggered, turning him into a her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma sighed, relaxing a little as she turned to the old woman who somehow always 'accidentally' turned him female on the way to school everyday.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old woman grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You've been deliberately turning me into a girl everyday, haven't you?\" Ranma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old woman nodded.  \"Sorry.  I overslept today... and yeah, I have.  It's just so funny to see a manly man like you turn into such a pretty girl!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAkane frowned, worried that Ranma would retaliate.  Ever since the botched wedding attempt, he'd been especially short-tempered around the Chinese Amazons and around his friend Ukyo.  Akane herself had been making efforts not to get angry with Ranma so much, not to accuse him of being a pervert so often, feeling guilty about going along with her idiot father's scheme...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRanma, however, just sighed.  \"Screw it.  Boobs all day today,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You don't want a kettle?\" Akane asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Too much hassle at this point,\" Ranma said.  \"I'll change back in the showers at gym.  Besides, I look freakin' hot as a girl.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAkane couldn't argue with that, much to her annoyance.  \"You really want to let boys ogle you in the shower?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm the toughest guy at Nerima,\" Ranma said as they walked on.  \"They wanna try something, I'll cave in their faces.  Plus, I'll just go in first.  The coaches know about the curse and will let me do it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I think everyone knows at this point.  Except Kuno,\" Akane said, referring to the super rich, hyper melodramatic Tatewaki Kuno, swordsman and general lovesick nuisance to the two of them.  He never seemed to acknowledge the reality of the fact that everyone thought of him as a joke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Still, I'm kinda glad this happened,\" Ranma said, looking down at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why's that?\" Akane asked.  Ranma was usually so annoyed when her curse triggered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"We ARE having a normal day today,\" Ranma said, smiling.  \"It was just on delay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLittle did Ranma know that things were NOT normal...</span></div></div>",

There was the whole 'frequently been killed' thing, but that didn't outweigh the pros in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was one of the two most powerful humans alive, matched and possibly seconded only by the three-eyed monk Tienshinhan. (Tien to his friends.) He could fire lasers out of his hands, he could fly, and some of his best friends were impossibly powerful aliens. Granted, compared to them, he was nothing, but still. He was a very strong fighter and could take punishment that would splatter most. The part he was happiest about, though? Was his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLazuli, also known as #18, was a powerful cyborg made by the madman Dr. Gero. Her power let her fight on near even ground with his alien allies. Plus she had a built-in endless energy generator that gave her endless stamina. She was beautiful, she was lovely... she was also, and this was her words, not his, addicted to his cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n18 loved her husband dearly. Back when she was evil, he had fallen for her and stood up for her against the monstrous Cell. What started as a promise to 'rock his four foot world' had turned into something more when she had found out that this four foot cutie had a THREE FOOT DICK. (Well, no, not really, but it always felt like it when she was riding it.) On top of that, his stamina had outlasted hers every damn time, and she was supposed to have endless stamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard sometimes to STOP having sex. They had a daughter now, and Krillin had a good job as a policeman. On top of that, 18 had taken the fall for the ridiculously rich Mr. Satan one time, forcing him to give her a substantial bribe, and had invested their money so well that she and Krillin technically didn't need to work ever again. She liked the homemaker life, because it gave her time to spend with her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut oh, how she adored having sex with Krillin. And more, she loved being pregnant with Marron. She wanted to have more babies, over and over again. She could afford it. She wanted to have her belly swell out, to feel the kicking inside her as they made love, to have Krillin milk her bloated tits like she was a cow. She had to talk Krillin into knocking her up again.

Iago had went along only because Jasmine had insisted on it.  Aladdin, Abu, Genie and Iago all flew around the city on Carpet while Jasmine stayed at the palace because she had more important things to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I bet Jasmine is relaxing in her chambers doing nothing,\" said Iago. \"Just waiting to be served hand and foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbu chittrred at Iago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I won't let it go!\" snapped Iago.  \"Here we are slaving away in the hot sun while Jasmine is relaxing in a lap of luxury\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Iago, be quiet\" said Aladdin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wish that Jasmine was here to enjoy this lovely desert weather,\" said Iago, eyeing Genie. Before the blue Genie could respond, there was a poof of purplish smoke and Jasmine was there right beside Aladdin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hey, I didn't do that,\" said Genie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Huh?\" asked Jasmine.  \"How did I get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll eyes turned to Genie. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\t\"I didn't do it,\" said Genie. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\"I did,\" said a melodic female voice.  The voice came from in front of Carpet.  There floating along in the air was what clearly looked like a female genie with olive skin and bright red hair done in an impossibly long ponytail.  The female genie was wearing what other genies wore: baggy pants and shear clothing.  The female genie sported a rather huge pregnant belly, and also had rings on each finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hi there\" said the new genie, grinning at them all.  Carpet stopped in mid-air.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hello there\" said Aladdin.  \"What's your name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ruby\" came the reply.  \"I'm a genie\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's obvious,\" muttered Iago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"My master is a little boy that's off somewhere,\" said Ruby.  \"Well... technically he's not my master... but for the purposes of convenience, he is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why did you grant Iago's wish then?\" Asked Aladdin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh I didn't\" said Ruby, examining her nails carelessly.  \"I just thought it was funny\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"How did you get out of...?\" started Genie.  A young boy--ten years old at most--came running up to Ruby carrying a lamp.  The boy was dressed in rags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There you are, Ruby\" said the boy.  \"I've been looking everywhere for you.  You need to grant my wishes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're down by one, Aziz\" said Ruby.  \"You DID wish for us to return here, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah, I remember\" sighed Aziz.  Then the boy turned to Aladdin and the others.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAziz told them about how he found a lamp in a remote cave and found Ruby.  The cave was a long way off so Aziz wished for him to return to Agrabah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Why is she pregnant?\" wondered Jasmine aloud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well....when a he-genie and a she-genie love each other very much...\" said Ruby.  She grinned at the way that Aziz blushed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Celestia, who moved the sun, and Luna, who moved the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOver time, Luna, the younger, became jealous of her sister and the worship she gained.  Her day was loved, while Luna's night was feared, no one staying up to witness her beautiful starscapes.  She was corrupted by a dark entity, becoming the dreaded Nightmare Moon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCelestia, filled with regret, was forced to use the holy magic of the Elements of Harmony, artifacts representing the six virtues of Magic, Honesty, Generosity, Loyalty, Laughter, and Kindness, sealing her sister in the moon for a thousand years.  This act also stripped Celestia of the ability to use them.  She has yet to forgive herself for what she did to Luna, despite the necessity of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA thousand years passed.  Nightmare Moon returned, but young magic student Twilight Sparkle, a unicorn, was ready for her.  She and her friends reignited the long dormant power of the Elements of Harmony, purging the corruption from Luna's mind.  Sisters were reunited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSince then, Twilight Sparkle and her friends, the young dragon Spike, the honest earth pony Applejack, the regal unicorn Rarity, the daring pegasus Rainbow Dash, the joyful earth pony Pinkie Pie, and the meek, kind-hearted pegasus Fluttershy have all gone on many adventures.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey bested the reality warping draconequus Discord, and eventually befriended him, kind Fluttershy showing the once cruel creature the value of friendship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe wicked Queen Chrysalis, leader of the shape-shifting emotion-eaters known as the changelings, was bested as well, her attempt to use the wedding of Twilight's brother Shining Armor to his childhood friend Princess Cadance to empower herself thwarted.  Later on, with the help of a changeling who didn't want to be evil and several antagonists who had reformed, Chrysalis was dethroned, the changelings switching sides.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the legendary Crystal Empire returned, bringing with it the dreaded King Sombra, it was Twilight Sparkle and Spike who defeated him, allowing Shining Armor and Cadance to take over as the much more benevolent rulers of the Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTwilight Sparkle herself managed to ascend to become an alicorn.  One of her first heroic acts was to track down a former student of Celestia's, Sunset Shimmer, and help reform her, Sunset becoming a heroine in her own right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen dread Tirek, freshly escaped from Tartarus, made his move, Twilight Sparkle and her friends, with the aid of the Discord, who finally accepted the truth of Friendship, gained an even greater power than the Elements of Harmony, putting Tirek back in his cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLater on, they encountered the mad cult leader known as Starlight Glimmer, who had formed a society based on stealing the Cutie Marks of ponies, the very signs of their destiny, and replacing them with a twisted, warped Equality that reduced all their abilities to the lowest common denomenator.  Her cult was broken up when Fluttershy revealed Starlight had kept her Cutie Mark, Starlight fleeing after being bested.  She later tried to destroy time in an attempt to get revenge on Twilight Sparkle, preventing her and her friends from ever meeting.  But when shown exactly what her actions would bring, Starlight's will broke.  She herself is now Twilight Sparkle's student in the art of Friendship.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBecause in Equestria, friendship is magic.  It requires honesty, loyalty, laughter, kindness, and generosity, and isn't always easy.  But it's oh, so worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll that being said, let's get all of them knocked up!  Whoo!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStory 1.) (anthropomorphic ponies) Another draconequus shows up, a spirit of fertility.  Discord is alarmed by her presence and tries to stop her, but he can't.  Soon bellies are going to bulge with foals...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStory 2.) (normal ponies) Due to a decreasing amount of stallions, the princesses come to the uneasy conclusion that they have to increase their number somehow.  With the help of King Thorax, they end up bringing in deposed Queen Chrysalis, giving her parole in exchange for her helping 'encourage' breeding between stallions and multiple mares.  Chrysalis agrees, but she has her own chaos in mind, releasing a drug she uses to up her own fertility to extreme levels into the atmosphere...</span></div></div>",

Nicole, for her part, was a little nervous.  This new body would allow for more intimate action with her teammates, and be more durable in battle than her usual holograms while still allowing all her powers, but it would also carry organic weaknesses.  She could dismiss them by turning back into data, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Okay, done,\" Rotor said, he and Tails finishing their work.  Tails pressed a button, and Nicole felt a tingle go through her, her body feeling heavier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Try using some of your powers, Nicole,\" Tails said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole nodded, and summoned up a data barrier, levitating herself into the air.  She put out a hand, projecting an energy burst.  She took a step closer to the nearby red ring in storage, and felt it start to empower her.  \"All my abilities function as normal,\" she said.  Her ears flicked.  \"Oh...  Was that... my voice?\"  She giggled a little.  \"It sounds weird.\" <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tRotor looked curious.  \"Define 'weird,'\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It took me a moment to process it, but...\"  She smiled.  \"Yes.  Normally, I hear, see, and feel things with an electronic static around them.  It's very faint, but I notice it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Like your talking through a communicator,\" Rotor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole nodded.  \"In this new body, though,\" she said, \"everything feels more... realistic.\"  She began running her fingers over various surfaces.  \"Like I'm more sensitive.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer stomach grumbled.  \"What in the world...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRotor and Tails grinned.  \"You're hungry,\" Rotor said.  \"That's a normal reaction when someone hasn't eaten in a while.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole's stomach rumbled again.  \"I've always wondered about eating...\" she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails chuckled.  \"Well, it seems your body works normally,\" he said.  \"You are lacking one biological function that I think you won't miss.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What's that?\" Nicole asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Let's just say that the only thing you'll ever need to use a bathroom for is bathing,\" Rotor said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole blinked, and nodded.  \"Ah.  Thank you, I'd rather not have to do that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails smiled.  \"Your digestive system is more efficient than a normal Mobians.  You can still get fat, though, and get stomachaches, so don't overeat,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole nodded, looking at herself.  \"And all my other bodily functions are the same as a normal Mobian's otherwise?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nervous system, reproductive system, vascular system, all of it,\" Rotor said.  \"We wanted your new body to be as close to normal as possible.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole smiled.  \"Then let's get some food,\" she said.  \"I always wanted to try a chilidog...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails and Rotor traded triumphant looks.  The three went out to join the others, Sally, Antoine, Sonic, Bunnie, Amy Rose, Big, and Cream, who were more than happy for Nicole now that she had her more realistic body.  Nicole was served a chilidog... and promptly fell in love with her sense of taste, attempting to eat everything in the kitchen that was edible and promptly getting a stomachache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I warned you,\" Tails said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So much pain...\" Nicole said, belching.  \"Yet taste... so wonderful...\" She rubbed her bloated stomach and groaned, licking the remnants of chili and cupcake frosting off of her lips.  Sally giggled, hugging her gently.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ah, ze perils of first time experiences,\" Antoine said.  \"You must be slow, not lose yourself in the pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic snorted.  \"Eh.  Slow isn't my thing,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe couldn't resist.  The setup was just too PERFECT.  \"Is zat why you and Sally broke up?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic's eyes narrowed.  Sally headdesked, snickering.  Everyone else, save for the oblivious Big the Cat and the confused Cream the Rabbit began to laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Burn.  BURN!\" Rotor crowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Point to you, Frenchie, but the game will be mine,\" Sonic muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAntoine just smirked, Bunnie giving him a kiss on the cheek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't get it,\" Cream the Rabbit said, her chao, Cheese, playing with a ball nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ask your mother,\" everyone else save for Big said in unison.  Cream huffed grumpily.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So Rote,\" Sonic said, deliberately changing the subject.  \"How's things going with your boyfriend?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRotor sighed.  \"EX-boyfriend,\" he said.  \"Caught him cheating.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone winced.  \"Sorry Rotor...\" Amy said, patting him on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRotor chuckled wearily.  \"Thanks... but it's okay, really.  Things were going bad for us anyway, and I was thinking of calling it quits anyway.  This just gave me the excuse.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSally hugged him.  \"Still, we're there for you if you need us,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRotor smiled.  \"Thanks.  Seriously, all of you, thanks for everything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the hidden place, the figure watched as the Freedom Fighters all chatted over various things.  \"Negative on Rotor for candidacy.  Target is homosexual.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn,\" muttered the voice.  \"First Big proves asexual, and now... One less variable... Okay, but the others?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"In addition to Shadow the Hedgehog and Knuckles the Echidna, I believe we have viable candidates in Sonic the Hedgehog, Antoine D'Coolette, and Miles Prower, callsign Tails.  Good news, though.  If I read it right, then Nicole's got a body with a functioning reproductive system now,\" the voice said.  \"Over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"The computer entity?  That should be interesting... Copy that,\" the other voice said.  \"Tag the boys with the drug.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Roger,\" the voice said.  \"I know we haven't got Knuckles yet... How's the op with Shadow?  Over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Almost didn't make it,\" the other voice said.  \"Guy suspected something was up instead of just thinking it was a bug.  The behavior modifiers took hold, though, and spread to Rouge just as planned.  Now?  They STILL haven't stopped fucking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Damn,\" the voice said, taking aim.  \"Batgirl's gonna barely be able to walk once they stop.\" The voice fired.  Once, twice, three times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic slapped his face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You okay?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Bug or something must have gotten in,\" Sonic said.  \"Felt like a bug bite...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTails flinched, scratching at his shoulder.  \"Yeah, I think we let something in with us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAntoine just grumbled, scratching at his hip where he was 'bitten.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRotor shook his head.  \"Sorry guys,\" he said. \"I can run the filters, that should get rid of any mosquitos or anything like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSonic shrugged.  \"No rush,\" he said.  \"It's just annoying more than anything.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBunnie smiled, snuggling up to Antoine.  \"Besides, we still got things ta do, right?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSally nodded, glancing over to Sonic.  \"Right.  We need to run checks on all the Egg Bosses.  They've been quiet lately...  Quiet bad guys makes me nervous...\" she said.  Although, as she looked over Sonic, she was beginning to wonder if it was nervous she felt.  They'd only dated for a while, but it was a good time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBunnie, for her part, was feeling suddenly frisky.  She just couldn't get over how happy she was with Antoine.  She hugged the handsome coyote and kissed him, a sudden, silly urge to find a quiet place and fuck him silly coming over her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAmy, meanwhile, was finding her attention drawn to Sonic more than usual.  She noticed Sally looking at him, and for some reason didn't feel a sting of jealousy.  After all, it was only right that a stud like Sonic have a lot of women attracted to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNicole was starting to squirm, feeling a warmth between her legs as she looked at Tails.  He really was a handsome young man.  And her body felt so good now.  All these new sensations... She wanted to experience more of them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Aaand confirmed,\" the voice said from its hiding place.  \"All three males are producing the behavior modifying, libido-enhancing pheromones.  The women are already showing signs of attraction.  Over.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Good work,\" the other voice said.  \"We'll arrange things so that they, along with our other test subjects, get even more women to fertilize.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Stirring up the female Egg Bosses?\" the voice asked as it retreated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And Phage,\" said the other voice.  \"I've downloaded the files on how Nicole was given her current body.  With some tweaking, I can convince Dr. Eggman that it's his idea to give Phage the ability to interact in the real world.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Risky,\" said the voice.  \"Eggy gets apocalyptic if he thinks someone's wronged him.  I don't want you killed, Commander.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know.  But for the Experiment to work, we need as many females impregnated as possible,\" said the other voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Godspeed,\" the first voice said.  \"I'm disembarking.  I just tapped they're readouts - we're over Angel Island.  I'm gonna use this chance to tag Knuckles.\"</span></div></div>",

The two-tailed Fox himself wasn't completely concentrated on what seemed to be in an chemistry set up, complete with more advanced lab equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I'm trying to make my first artificial cell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool... why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I've been meaning to expand myself beyond engineering. I'd like to see if I can make solutions that could help us.\" He says as he mixed chemicals together and other solutions, changing colors as it went from bottle to bottes. Sonic grins ax he looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know a thing that can help ypu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting laid.\" The fox screeched an halt as he mixed two solutions into a single bottle, gaining a bluish, glowing color and began to evaporate, letting fumes and smokes come out of it, leaving nothing inside later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue hedgehog chuckled \"Tails, I just messing with you but I certainly don't think we need this, you're good as you're! Who needs magic potions when we have each other.\" He says in a encouraging tone but it was mostly to keep the fox from further glaring at him as he blush himself before sighing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also... do you think that Rouge would show her boobs if we give her an emerald?\" Tails frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And make Amy mad?\" Tails retort \"Besides, if you really want her to show her boobs, you need more than just an emerald.\" Sonic smirks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! What is fun in no living dangerously?\" Tails frowned again but sighed as he took all the safetly equipment off and onto the table. Then they left the room... Unaware that in micro level, Tails created an airborne  bateria that flew off the bottle and went to their bodies, getting throught their nose and mouth and into their lungs and stomach and entering their bloodstream, while their white cells proved more than enough to march intruder, the new cell went to their intended destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Testicles. In Sonic ' and Tails's, they settle quickly into their pulsin, swaying balls, going to the tubules of both reprpductive orbs, among his hyperactive swimmers before borrowing itself into the flesh. It took few minutes before the walls started to pulse wildly and rapidly, making even more active and bigger swimmers, much more active and productive, filling up the ball, making them pulse and grow and grow..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNewly improved sperm is not the only thing being made, but also more the virus which began to work on their bodies as they went back to the Bloodstream which began to make words on their muscles and bones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sonic... don't you feel.. hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails asked to the hedgehog, who was feeling a bit hot himself, he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. uff! This summer is really hot one, uh?\" He wiped some sweat from his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. maybe is that.\"  He says unknowingly that they were sick on a highly contagious Verility/Fertility virus or the V/F-Virus. The first symptoms? Low fever and increased virility and libido for males<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then ran out, leaving Tails on his lonesome, but both were feeling hot and tight, down there...</span></div></div>",

You're late to the party playing the game but that's the way it goes sometimes.   You like that the game so far although the story is pretty weak in your opinion.  But, the story isn't very important.  It's the gameplay that makes the game.....and the gameplay isn't that good to be HONEST...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Anyway you're playing Tomb Raider because you liked the first game of the reboot. And you like Lara.  Of course who doesn't like Lara Croft?   She's practically a goddess.  You don't care if this current Lara doesn't have big breasts like she did in the first games.  You like Lara cause she's tough and doesn't give up.....especially in this game when she's hellbent on proving that her dad wasn't crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You've just reached that Lost City and are exploring the valley before moving on with the story.  You also like to explore the virtual world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    You come upon a cave which leads into a series of caverns...that eventually leads to a door that's marked as \"The Pregnancy Room\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What's this?\" You and Lara ask in unison.....that catches you off-guard, the way you and Lara just said the same thing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    There's an audio entry near the mysterious door that goes on to say that this room was discovered here long ago.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Thinking that this room is just another tomb, you enter it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The room is the size of a cathedral.  On the very far end of the room there's a massive door. The massive door is locked of course.  The game shows you that the massive door can be opened with eight locks....none of which are near the door as per usual in games these days.  There are eight puzzles to each lock.  The first lock is easy.  All the locks are switches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As you pull the first lock, a strange unearthly glow surrounds Lara and....quite suddenly she's now sporting a pregnant belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What the?!\" exclaims a very startled Lara.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As you keep unlocking the locks, Lara gets a little more pregnant.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Some of the more advanced puzzles involve climbing.....Which is hard due to Lara's sudden pregnancy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an intriguing tomb.....\" You say quietly as you keep solving the (mostly) easy puzzles to unlock the locks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   By the sixth lock, Lara is considerably huge with a pregnant belly that can easily hold seven babies.   Lara is effected by severe back aches which slows her down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you try to leave this room you can't.  Seems the only way out is by solving the remaining 2 locks which involve climbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What a sadistic tomb\" you say, now regretting your decision on entering this room.  It's gotten to the point where it's not fun anymore; Lara is visibly huffing and puffing and she looks to be in genuine pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Lara\" you say.  \"If only I can help you better.....\"  </span></div></div>",

When the bright light fades you find yourself in the room of the game right next to Lara!   You look around wildly greatly confused as to how you got in the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Who are you?\" asked Lara.  \"You're not with Trinity are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Do I look like one of those yahoos?\" You reply.  \"I....really don't know how I got here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"I'm Lara\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You introduce yourself noticing just how beautiful Lara is in person.   When your eyes shift to Lara's huge pregnant belly you feel a great sense of...servitude towards Lara.  Like you <i>must</i> help her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Well, can you possibly help me get out of here?' asked Lara \"I just need you to unlock these doors and there's only two locks left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'll see what I can do\" you say.  You're on the verge on adding the word 'goddess' to the end of that sentence for some reason.  You quickly solve the last two puzzles and the doors open up to reveal a long dark tunnel.  You and Lara exit the room.  Lara produces a lighted torch seemingly out of nowhere to light the way for the long tunnel has no natural light.    While you walk down the tunnel Lara tells you of her adventures so far.  <br>\r\n          You're both freaking out over being in the game suddenly and worried that you're not going to return to the real world.   How can you return to the real world?  Just reach the end of the game.....or are you really stuck in this video game world?  <br>\r\n          The tunnel twists and turns and eventually ends into what looks like a mountain valley.  Once you two exit the tunnel a door suddenly closes off the tunnel.<br>\r\n              \"Where are we?' asked Lara. \"We gotta find a way back to the lost city\"<br>\r\n                Before you could respond you spot a number of vans and trucks below.   You see at least ten people all armed with machine guns and other weapons of all kinds. <br>\r\n             \"Trinity!\" You and Lara say.   You two rush to the nearest bush where you're completely hidden from Trinity.   <br>\r\n             \"Wait here\" whispered Lara as she walked away and vanished from sight.  You don't move a muscle not wanting to attract the attention of those gun wielding nuts of Trinity.<br>\r\n                 Suddenly you see Lara lunge out of her hiding place and stab a man in the back with her axe.  Then she.....<br>\r\n                  You blink as you see something that's impossible and just a tad unnerving.  Lara eats the unfortunate man quickly leaving behind only his weapon.   Lara picked up the machine gun, emptied the gun of its ammo and moved on.  <br>\r\n               Over the next few minutes Lara takes care of the members of Trinity.  She didn't eat all of them; she ate a total of three other men.  When she was done her belly had become truly huge and it was incredible that Lara could still move.  Lara comes over to you.  You can't help but stare at her belly.  Her clothes rode up on her belly nearly exposing her breasts that seemed to have swelled slightly.  <br>\r\n         \"You ate those men\" you say.<br>\r\n         \"It just came over me\" said Lara.  \"I was just hungry....\"<br>\r\n       \"Just don't eat me\" you say.<br>\r\n       \"Don't worry\" said Lara.  \"You're not on the menu\" <br>\r\n             </span></div></div>",

Your instincts tell you to rub the great swollen belly of Lara but you're not sure how she would react.  Lara seems amused by this. <br>\r\n          \"Let's explore this valley\" said Lara.  <br>\r\n           There's nothing better to do so you agree.   The two of you start to explore the valley together.  The valley is a medium-sized hollow between three mountains.  The valley is overgrown with a forest.  In the middle of the valley is the crumbling ruins of a city much like the lost city that Lara had been exploring earlier.  The lost city reminds you of something you've seen in the Uncharted games for some reason.  The city looks deserted as does the rest of the valley.  <br>\r\n           Near the city is a temple overgrown with vines and ivy.  The two of you enter the temple.   There's no telling which God the temple is devoted to due to the decay.    There's nothing much of interest in the temple until you come upon a huge room with a statue in it.  The statue is that of a pregnant woman. The statue is draped in robes save for her immense breasts and belly.  The statue stands six feet tall. <br>\r\n          \"A fertility goddess....\" said Lara in a quiet voice.  <br>\r\n          \"Yeah\" you say.   <br>\r\n          There's a gold bracelet at the feet of the statue.  You pick it up and examine it. The bracelet is golden and covered with jewels of all kinds.  <br>\r\n               \"This looks brand new\" <br>\r\n               \"That's gold for you\" said Lara.  She then spots that the statue is wearing a rather fabulous necklace.  Lara seems mesmerized as she reaches out to grab it.  You let her grab it as you spot what looks like a mural on the wall immediately behind the statue.  The mural is faded and cracked.  Looks like the mural is depicting a goddesses being worshipped.  The goddess is wearing the same necklace that Lara had just grabbed from the statue.  Before you can say anything Lara puts on the necklace.......and.......nothing happens. <br>\r\n                 \"I feel this necklace is meant for me\" said Lara.<br>\r\n                \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n               \"I'm not sure\" said Lara.  \"It felt like the necklace called out to me as ridiculous as that sounds\"<br>\r\n                  You and Lara split up to explore the rest of the temple.  You're still carrying the golden bracelet as it feels like it was meant for you much like the necklace was meant for Lara. Did you two just found mystical artifacts?  You'd like to say that magical artifacts are impossible......but then you're in a Tomb Raider game.  You shouldn't be here at all.   <br>\r\n              The rest of the temple is empty so you go to meet Lara outside of the temple.   Lara was sitting on the ground against a tree.  As you approach her, Lara's belly seems to swell up even more slightly. <br>\r\n             \"Are you okay?\" You ask.  <br>\r\n            \"I'm not sure\" said Lara.  \"Since I put this necklace on.....I've been feeling.......frisky\" <br>\r\n          \"Frisky?\" You ask.  <br>\r\n          Lara looks at you with pure lust in her eyes.  She has such a feral look that you back away a step or two.  Before you know what happens Lara lunges at you and gives you a deep kiss.  The kiss seems to melt away your rational thoughts.  You return the kiss with passion. You start to grope Lara's belly and breasts while Lara starts to remove your clothing.  The kiss lasts for what feels like an eternity until Lara suddenly breaks it off and forcefully pushes you to the ground.  You're not hurt by the short fall. You fully expect Lara to glare down at you but she doesn't.  She removes what remains of her clothes.  You try to get up but Lara pushes you back down with her foot. <br>\r\n             \"Stay where you are\" said Lara.  She then sits down straddling you. <br>\r\n            \"Beg for it\" said Lara in a voice that wasn't hers.  Lara's eyes are different.  They're glowing with an ethereal light.  Eyes that you could get lost in. <br>\r\n              \"Lara....what on Earth is happening?\" You ask. <br>\r\n             Lara shushed you by placing her fingers to your mouth.  \"Don't speak.  Just enjoy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      <br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Did more members of Trinity show up?   <br>\r\n                \"I see you're awake\" said Lara's voice.  You can't even turn your head to see her.  You try to speak but it comes out as a croak.  <br>\r\n           \"Poor baby is exhausted\" said Lara as she comes into your view.  All that you see is that Lara must have at least forty more babies in her womb.  Her breasts rests atop of a belly that must be one hundred feet around!  You're almost crushed by Lara's great big belly but she makes great care not to squash you.

This necklace also seems to make me pretty much invincible as far as I can tell\"<br>\r\n       \"Convenient\" you say.  You shrug and started to climb Lara's belly.

She continued to hug her stomach tightly, feeling some kind of knot form inside her till all of a sudden, it exploded. Her stomach just suddenly expanded on its own accord. Like a bomb went off inside her but was contained in her. She kept her hands on her stomach even when it grew, amazed by how big she just grown. <br>\r\nIf she had to take a guess, she say that she was at least in the last month of bearing one child if she can bring an image into her head. She waited a little more and realized nothing happened, momentarily relaxing thinking that this was it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that wasn't so--\u201d Lara began to say before another growth spurt hit her. It was almost as if another...baby  had just pooped into existence in her womb and now made her pregnant with twins. And it did not stop there. Soon more spontaneous expansions occurred and after the fifth Lara was on the floor. Her legs could not handle such rapid and random growth and gave out on her. Lara herself had just reside to closing her eyes and riding out growth spurts and hoping that each one after the next would be the last. It wasn't until the last one hit and she waited for two minutes that she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she saw nothing but flesh. Her belly had grown massively, it would not be wrong to say that she looked to be more of a ball of flesh with an attached body next to hit. Then she felt the kicks popping off. Each one coming from a different side of her womb. And while she gasped and rapidly breathing, she was making mental notes of how many there were. It was when the movement stopped that she was finally able to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10! 10 babies are now in my womb! I'm pretty sure that I can literally be put in the history books for being so large.\" She said while rubbing her belly. She was shocked to see that there were nothing wrong wi her belly besides being so big. No stretch marks or veins were present and she oddly not feeling any tightening at all. Just bloated if you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least that's it for now right?\" She joked.</span></div></div>",

And... well... sometimes more than talking...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I... wow, okay, that's a lot to take in,\" Peter said.  \"...You said both at once, so you're obviously not planning on leaving me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Never,\" Mary-Jane said firmly.  \"But... I think I love Felicia as much as I love you.  And we both love you dearly, Peter.  So we were wondering if you wouldn't mind having Felicia as a live-in mistress...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPeter's eyes practically bugged out of his head.  \"...Not gonna lie, I've had sexual fantasies like that,\" he said, blushing brightly.  \"Wow.  I... two beautiful women, and both of them wanting to jump my bones.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"She promises that she can pay part of the rent, and that she'll contribute to the household,\" Mary-Jane said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You aren't concerned about what this will look like?\" Peter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Tiger, I want the world to know that you're fucking us both,\" Mary-Jane said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hoooooly shit,\" Peter said, laughing nervously.  \"I...\"  He grimaced, rubbing his temples as a stab of pain spiked through his head.  \"Friggin' headache...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMary-Jane kissed him.  \"So... what do you think of the idea?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPeter stared at Mary-Jane a long moment, and finally said, \"Felicia's waiting just outside the window and that's why you're being so insistent on getting an answer now.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMary-Jane blinked, and blushed, chuckling.  \"Yeah, hang on,\" she said.  Not bothering to put on clothes, she went over to the window and opened it up, letting in the black-clad thief and sometimes vigilante.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nothing gets by you, does it, Spider?\" Felicia said, chuckling.  \"It was cold out there anyway.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So how about it?\" Mary-Jane said, hugging Felicia from behind and unzipping her top, letting her breasts pop out.  \"Feel like breeding your kitty as hard as you bred me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPeter goggled at the saucy grin on both women.  Instinctively, he wanted to question this.  His ongoing horrible luck made him afraid whenever anything good happened.  But for some reason, he couldn't focus on that.  His wife, his adoring wife whom he loved dearly, was giving him permission to fuck one of his female best friends.  And if he was reading the situation right, many threesomes or sexy girl-on-girl shows were in his future.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe tossed aside the covers, patting the bed beside him.  \"Hell.  We've got room for three in here,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlack Cat and Mary-Jane grinned happily, Black Cat eagerly sliding off her bodysuit.  \"Face it, Spider.  You just hit the jackpot,\" Felicia teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMary-Jane smacked her on the ass, making her yelp.  \"Hey, that's my line!\" she admonished.  Peter just laughed.  Tonight was a good night, it seemed.  For the women as well, as everything was proceeding according to plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReed Richards, the elastic Mister Fantastic was busy at work in his lap, when he felt something invisible hug him from behind, and two very soft 'somethings' come to rest on his head.  \"Well well,\" Reed said.  \"Not that I'm displeased, but what brought this on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You ever think about having another child?\" Susan Richards, the Invisible Woman asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReed quirked an eyebrow.  \"Give Franklin and Valeria a little sister?\" he asked.  \"Well, we're financially stable enough to support another child, certainly.  And goodness knows I enjoy the process of making a child...\" He smiled.  \"Feeling the motherly urge, dear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah,\" Susan admitted.  \"With Franklin and Valeria growing up, I miss the feeling of having someone be completely dependant on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Isn't that what Johnny is for?\" Reed said, grinning cheekily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSusan had to laugh at that one.  \"Cute, but little brothers don't count,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReed chuckled.  \"Well, I'm not against the idea,\" he said.  \"Victor's been behaving himself lately, and Annihilus and Blastaar are at each other's throats, plus President Luthor's not demanding anything unreasonable from us...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Good,\" Susan said, turning visible.  \"Then let's make a baby.  Tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReed blinked as he saw Sue's reflection in the computer screen he was working at.  His pants became very tight in the crotch as he realized that his wife was nude, apparently horny, and wanting love now.  \"...Give me ten minutes to shut everything down,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSusan just smiled, pleased that the plan was going so well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Bruce,\" Catwoman said, perched on the rooftop with Batman as he and his feline-costumed lover watched the docks, waiting for some drug dealers they had gotten wind of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hm,\" Batman said, keeping his eye on the docks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Bruce, what would you say if I told you I wanted to take... say, nine months off from being Catwoman?\" she asked, biting her lip.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...Why nine months?\" Batman asked, frowning, turning slightly towards her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well... because I want to have your baby,\" Catwoman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTHAT managed to get Batman's full attention.  \"...Selina?\" he said softly, taking her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"There's a lot of reasons,\" Catwoman said.  \"One of them is because I want to.  Another is... look Damien's great, but he's also an over-entitled little snot.  I want you to have a child that was raised by someone who isn't a murderous psycho...\"  She frowned.  \"And don't tell me Talia isn't.  She's the head of an 'assassin's guild' for pete's sake.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBatman sighed.  He knew full well Talia's 'personality' problems, and that some of Damian's issues stemmed from how she raised him.  \"I know, I know... But are you sure?  This is a big step...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know you can be a good father, Bruce,\" Catwoman said, looking into his eyes.  \"You've done a damn good job in turning Damian into a hero, even if he still is a little jackass.\"  Batman actually chuckled at that.  Catwoman grinned.  He really needs to laugh more, she thought.  \"But I just thought it'd be nice if you could have a chance to raise a child from the beginning...  You deserve a chance to be a father without \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBatman closed his eyes.  It would be nice... and seeing the look on Damian's face at the arrival of a little brother promised much amusement.  Wow, he thought.  I'm making jokes?  I must be changing... \"...Okay,\" he said.  A smile, an actual warm smile, crossed his face.  \"Okay... Let's make a baby...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCatwoman grinned, blushing happily.  The plan was working.  And while she wanted to jump his bones right there, she noticed something out of the corner of her eye.  \"...After we take down those drug dealers.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"RIGHT,\" Batman said, coughing and recomposing himself, getting back into character.  \"Work first, then pleasure.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Lois?\" Superman asked as he strode into the arctic Fortress of Solitude.  \"Lois, how did you get here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"One of your robots was looking for you,\" said Lois from in the far lab, knowing her husband could hear her.  \"I asked him to take me back here.  I had an idea, but I needed the Fortress' tech to help me with it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuperman frowned, and zipped over to the lab.  He found his lovely, brown-haired wife standing next to a cadre of robots working on something.  He hugged Lois, and asked, \"You know I'm more than willing to take you here any time you want.  But what couldn't have waited until I got back?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I wanted to make it a surprise,\" Lois said.  \"I've done the math, and we can afford to have another kid.  But considering how careful you were with me last time, I wanted to make this time... a bit more interesting for you.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuperman blinked.  \"How so?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It's a double-purpose, really,\" Lois said.  \"Ever since you went public, you've admitted you worry about your enemies coming after me.  So, in the name of both fulfilling my need to be a mommy again, and to help you not worry about me, I've asked the robots to make a formula that would turn me into... well, into something that's part Amazo, part Super-Adaptoid, basically.  I'll still look like me, though, so don't worry.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuperman blinked.  \"Wait, what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It'll give me the power to copy the powers and talents of any superhuman or costumed adventurer, good or bad, I'm within twenty feet of.  And if I'm as strong as you when we make love...\" Lois said, deliberately trailing off and smirking.  \"...Well, let's just say you BETTER be going full out on me or I'll be very disappointed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuperman blinked, a growing blush on his face.  He normally had to be very careful with Lois when they made love.  It made lovemaking take longer, as he had to take things slow for them both to get off.  But if he could use his full strength while making love to Lois...  and have those powers as an early warning system for villains... \"So, how much longer for this formula to be completed?\" he asked, feigning casualness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLois grinned.  All according to plan...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steam flowed off of the water, the thin mist catching the light coming through the tall narrow window. The young bovine woman hung low in the water, her nose just above the surface, while her long and wavy blood-red hair floated out around her. The water was almost scalding, but Sarah was barely aware of it, much more lost in her own thoughts. She was yet again trying to wrap her head around everything that had happened to her, as well as that was very soon to be happening. Just last week she had been working hard on her parents\u2019 farm, helping to prepare for the coming summer months. It was raining \u2013 a light drizzle that still made the ground soft \u2013 when two women and their escorts came up the path to the farmhouse. The guards were covered from head to toe in plated mail armor, while the women were dressed in much less defensive \u2013 yet just as impressive \u2013 robes made especially to accentuate their rounded bellies. All six wore the emblem of Verena, marking them as two of the Daughters of Verena and their Templar guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s mother called her in from the fields, so when the young woman showed up before the group her hands were dirty and there was mud clinging to her legs up to her knees. Despite that and the simple functional clothing she wore, the Daughters had no trouble seeing that Sarah was indeed the one they were seeking. While her parents were of average appearance, Sarah could be summed up as ravishing. Her hair cascaded down around a body that attracted attention everywhere she went: large plush breasts strained all but the baggiest of tops, while her hips were wide and blended into a round rump that made almost any seat very comfortable. And this was in spite of a young life spent in strenuous labor on a small farmstead. Sarah\u2019s appearance alone wasn\u2019t evidence enough however, but the daughters were able to sense the divine spark within they had followed the signs to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that came a whirlwind of activity as explanations were given, and arrangements were made. Soon enough, Sarah had joined the group for the journey back to the Holy Sanctum, leaving her previous life behind. Her parents were understandably upset to see her go, but they were equally joyful about their daughter going to a better life than they could provide, as well as proud to have played a part in restoring Verena\u2019s blessing. Sarah on the other hand was inquisitive about what her new life would entail and curious about traveling so far from home. She had only left the small farming community a few times and those trips were only to the village further up the river to help sell the family produce. Now she had traveled much, much further and she was to be at the center of a ritual to awaken the spark within her, and the Daughters were still being extremely tight lipped about what the ritual would involve. Even Elizabeth \u2013 the young woman assigned to be Sarah\u2019s handmaiden \u2013 wouldn\u2019t give up the secret, though she had gotten close a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of Elizabeth finally stirred Sarah out of her whirling thoughts. Rising up slightly, the cow could see the husky standing patiently along the far wall, her glittering clothes standing out amongst the steam clouds hanging in the air. Over the past days at the Sanctum, Elizabeth had followed Sarah wherever she went, assisting her with anything and everything. No matter how much Sarah resisted and said that she didn\u2019t need help with it all, Elizabeth persisted nonetheless. She wouldn\u2019t even let Sarah bathe alone, though she at least gave a partial compromise and waited for the cow to finish soaking before lathering Sarah\u2019s fur. With a muted sigh, Sarah started reaching for the soap and was unsurprised when the other quickly stepped over and took over. Stifling another sigh, Sarah leaned forward from the tub wall allowing Elizabeth access to her back. Elizabeth moaned slightly as she reached around her protruding middle, but she certainly would never even think of anything against her pregnancy. As with any of the Daughters that rose above initiate, they loved the feeling of their fruitful bodies and the life within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have another bad night, my Lady?\u201d Elizabeth asked, her dexterous fingers kneading Sarah\u2019s shoulders. Sarah did have to admit that those fingers knew just where to touch to help relieve the tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah hummed confirmation. \u201cUnfamiliar place, unfamiliar bed,\u201d which was the truth, but not the whole truth. She could practically see the husky nodding her head in understanding. Sarah opened her mouth to speak, but the words hung in her throat for a moment before she forced herself to go on, \u201cPlus there is the bit that I\u2019m going to be undergoing a ceremony today and I have only the barest idea about it.\u201d Sarah pulled away from the husky, spinning in the water to face her. \u201cWill you please give me some clue about it, please Elizabeth. It\u2019s supposed to be happening in just a short time, so it can\u2019t hurt for me to know something about what is coming\u2026right?\u201d She hoped the pleading look in her eyes was enough to convince the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElizabeth looked torn, tucking one of the long locks of blue hair behind her pointed ear, she looked around as if expecting someone to overhear even though it was only the two of them. This gave Sarah a little hope; this might have been the closest yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nibbling on her lip for a few more moments, Elizabeth gave a little groan, \u201cYou are correct, my lady, since it is so close to the time, I suppose I can give you a little bit of information about the ritual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah tried to not look too enthusiastic about finally getting something more than the stories when she was growing up, especially since it was now going to be part of her life.</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll be brought before us to the altar below the statue of Verena and Her fountain. Then the Matriarch will present you with a chalice of the divine spring.

Somewhat reassured, Sarah relented and let Elizabeth finish washing her. The husky then helped the cow out of the bath, before drying and putting the finishing touches on. Cleaned with her hair braided and a light fragrance applied, Sarah stepped out in her bed chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost fainted the first time she saw it. That single room had more space in it than her entire family home, and each furnishing had to be worth more than her family made in a year. The bed alone was enormous, and so soft it felt like she sank into a cloud each time she touched it. And the clothes\u2026! Styles she had only heard of and in materials she had never known. She almost felt guilty wearing any of it, as if her touch sullied the beauty of them forever. It wasn\u2019t as if she had a choice though, any of her old clothing were deemed unbecoming of one blessed by Verena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she shoved her unease aside as her handmaiden pulled out a loose and flowing gown. As with the rest, it seemed to be tailored to perfection for Sarah\u2019s shape. There was also a more than generous split down the middle of the gown that would allow her belly through, if she had one. If things worked out as she was expecting though, that would be happening soon enough. The finishing touch was an amulet adorned with a much more ornate version of the symbol worn by the Daughters and Templars. The variety of metals that made up the necklace gave it a shimmering quality that seemed magical to Sarah\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, Elizabeth led Sarah through the vast Hall up to the immense form of Verena. The husky then retreated, leaving Sarah the focus of every eye in the chamber. Sarah gulped loud enough that she thought everyone in the room would have been able to hear it. She had no idea what she was supposed to do now, was she supposed to say something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRescue from the worry came from the Matriarch of the Dawn herself. \u201cOver here, my dear. Take your place on the altar,\u201d she called in her usual subdued and soothing tones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah moved stiff legged over to the altar and slid onto the warm stone. She was now staring up at the enormous swell of Verena\u2019s stomach. The Goddess\u2019s face was just visible over the curve. As usual as the relative dimensions of Verena was how her face seemed to flow and change as anyone looked at it. It seemed to be ever shifting between races and species as a reflection of Verena being the Mother of All.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm yourself, my dear, this will not hurt you at all,\u201d the Matriarch said, leaning into view and running a hand tenderly across the top of Sarah\u2019s head. She then turned her gaze out over the hall, raising her voice a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah paid only half a mind to the words being spoken over her. She caught bits about a new age of bounty, and restoring Verena\u2019s blessing. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see many faces staring up at the altar\u2026as well as her. Despite herself, Sarah felt more than a little self conscious to be the center of attention. The thin diaphanous material of her gown made her feel even more exposed than she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a yelp and almost leapt from the stone as a hand came to rest on her shoulder. It was the Matriarch holding a thin metal cup up for Sarah. It had to be the chalice that Elizabeth had mentioned. She hadn\u2019t realized that it was going to be happening right now. The Matriarch seemed unfazed by Sarah\u2019s reaction, and proceeded to put a supporting hand behind the cow\u2019s head so that she could lean up a bit to drink. The water was cool and refreshing, and unless it was just her mind playing tricks on her, there was a tingle in her throat as she gulped the water down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last drops of water slid down her throat and the Matriarch let her lay flat again. She then raised her arms up high, the small gems hanging from her long ears twinkling in the subdued lighting. A chorus of voices rose up, the words pleasant yet unfamiliar to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBreathe slow and deep now,\u201d the Matriarch whispered before adding her own voice to the melodious chant filling the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah did so, her gaze settling on the floating crystals that drifted through the air between the golden pillars. They looked so much like stars hanging in the night sky. They even started to look a little like the ones that she had spent nights lying beside the field staring up at the twinkling display. A brief frown crossed her face as the Matriarch\u2019s porcelain skin drifted away like a cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you are the latest to bare my gift,\u201d an unfamiliar voice said from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. It was also familiar in some odd way, despite never hearing it before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah craned her head up to see if anyone else had seen it, but saw no sign of that. There was no sign of anyone in fact, or even the Great Hall she had been in. Instead, she was now drifting in a body of water that stretched as far as she could see in all directions. The lights above were indeed stars now as well, their thin light casting a glow over the mirror smooth and warm water around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Sarah asked, regretting it at once for sounding almost childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA soft breeze accompanied a soft laugh. \u201cYou know my name even though you have never met me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre\u2026are you\u2026Verena?\u201d No, it couldn\u2019t be. It was absurd to think that the Goddess would really speak to a lowly mortal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, the voice responded, \u201cThat I am, my daughter. And it is time for you to carry the gift you have been waiting your life for. You shall bring my blessings to your world anew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah\u2019s mouth went dry. She had to be going insane; there was no way this was happening. But there was no way she could explain what was happening around her either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPrepare yourself, Sarah, to receive my gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could react, the water around her started to glow before she sank beneath the surface. With a start, she realized that she could breathe fine even if it did feel a little odd. The glow continued to intensify till she had to close her eyes. The tingle from the back of her throat spread out in a flash, reaching her extremities in a moment. Unbidden, she curled into a ball, the glow and tingling growing and growing with no end in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth vanished so quickly that she almost didn\u2019t realize it. She was lying flat again, with her back against the textured stone of the altar, that much she could tell with her eyes still shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPraise Verena for her blessing,\u201d came the Matriarch\u2019s voice beside her again, ringing off of the high ceiling above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of \u201cPraise Verena,\u201d came from the other direction. The noise rose to almost be a cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome back, my dear,\u201d the Matriarch whispered into Sarah\u2019s ear. \u201cGo ahead and open your eyes, and take in Verena\u2019s gift to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah opened her eyes, everything spinning around before her for a moment. When it settled, she looked down at herself, a gasp escaping her throat.</span></div></div>",
