The only other bathroom in your somewhat large house that still works at the moment is all the way in the basement, two floors downstairs.

With another hard tug, the pan comes off with a loud \"CHINK\" and flies off, grazing your arm on its way off, burning you pretty bad and landing on the floor melted side up. You groan and turn off the stove frantically before putting your arm under a nice stream of cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emergency passed, adrenaline starts to leave your body and your arm begins  to throb and burn worse than most other burns you've had in the past.

You desperately don't want to tell your wife about your blunder, but you also know she's fairly skilled with first aid and probably know how to fix you up best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in your mind you pick up the pan quickly, the lack of cold on your burn sending waves of heat up your arm and you toss it carelessly into the sink to let it cool off with your damaged arm.

However, because your Mom didn't manage to wake you up soon enough this morning because you stayed up late the night before - you had to hurry to get to school and in your sleepy rush, you forgot to wear a bra and panties under your dark blue skirt and your white shirt with your school emblem on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour realisation came a minute too late as the test papers were already being passed around. You decided to close your legs shut and focus at the more immediate problem, that being the test itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you took a look at the test itself, you found that if you focused and thought hard on some of those questions and then guessed the rest, you might've been able to get a passing grade, which is all you hoped for with your track record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got to the last few questions, you found yourself struggle more than ever, and it was minutes before you had to stop and give out your tests. As you rushed your hands to write your answer, your pen fell out of your hands to the floor in front of you desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsidering your underwear predicament, you hoped to avoid any extreme movements. However, you'll need that pen to finish your answers.<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",
