I\u2019ve got numbers for Bridget, I\u2019ve kept records, old numbers. We can track her down, you and I!\u201d Victor said hopelessly, trying to make any excuse possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like the old team spirit\u201d Skinner said finally. Upon saying that Victor\u2019s posture was visibly relaxed and he made a deep sultry exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two members of the now much smaller LINDA looked back at him with respect in their eyes. They knew how much Skinner cared about Bridget and they hoped him and Victor could find her so Skinner could be close to his love finally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe hope you find her\u201d Ursula said. Skinner gestured back at them thankingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked away Victor beckoned Skinner closer to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust come a little closer. A bit more that's it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you got Bridget\u2019s phone number, her email address, anything we can contact her with.\u201d Skinner asked. Kennedy paused before he spoke and when he did it came out in a slow and sly manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, yes I do as a matter of fact. Just follow me into the back room, that's where I keep the records.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinner nodded and followed Victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and Bridget have a thing going on between you don\u2019t you\u201d Victor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy yes, uh how did you know\u201d Skinner responded with a mixture of concern and joy on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d Victor laughed. \u201cShe told me\u2026 well I say she told me. Lets just say I\u2019m good at figuring out these kinds of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well okay\u201d Skinner replied awkwardly. \u201cWell do you know where she could be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a low rumble came from Victor's stomach which caused him to clutch it tightly and make a strong sharp exhale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright Victor?\u201d Skinner asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u201d Victor replied \u201cJust hungry, oh so very hungry, which is strange since it was only recently I\u2019ve had some very large meals\u201d. Skinner knew Victor was a strange man but as soon as he was alone with him he became even stranger; Victor also seemed like he was excited, there was a kind of skip to his step. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing,\u201d he thought. \u201cAll I want to do is find out where Bridget has gone then I\u2019ll be straight off to go and find her. And tell her how very much I want to spend the rest of my life with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them entered a side room from the main basement area. The room was basic and small, it had a filing cabinet on the far wall, a dusty table, some leather bags, some suits and a bed. A bed?? It looked used. Skinner considered asking Victor why this room looked lived in but he decided it was best to just get the contact details for Bridget then leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I looking Victor?\u201d Skinner asked briskly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh just look in that filing cabinet over there, I can\u2019t remember which drawer they\u2019re in so you\u2019ll have to check each of them\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm okay then I guess\u201d Skinner walked over and started opening the top drawer and searching through it for anything which looked like it could be contact details. All the files looked incredibly old, was this thing used?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor was staring at Skinner whe whole time, his gaze not leaving Skinner's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GURGLE* *MOAN*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry about that Colin, any luck\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone yet... are you sure... \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Victor replied intently<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinner was now searching the third drawer and he was starting to lose hope before he had time to think Victor started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait for you to find Bridget. *grunt* I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see her very soon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinner heard the door lock, his heart started to race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s here\u201d Skinner said shakily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep looking forward\u201d Victor said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*PHHRRRTTT* Actually I think I might know where she is\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the room was bathed in a bright green light, a cacophony of moans and wet slick noises and a strange foul stench. Skinner looked over to Kennedy and saw him change, his suit was on the floor and his near naked body only covered with a loin cloth was changing in front of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT IS GOING ON!?\u201d Skinner shouted in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud squelch the light died down to reveal Victor, now a hideous thing with rolls of fat and twisted faces covering his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me Skinner *FART* aren\u2019t I the most exquisite being you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d Victor exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-What are you\u201d Skinner tried to be strong but his sentence came out a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it matter\u201d Victor replied \u201cI am your end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*MMMPPHHRRRTTTTTTT* followed by a moan and a whimper echoed around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to see where your dear Bridget is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Skinner had time to reply Victor walked towards him and turned round to reveal 2 sad faces grotesquely stretching out of his upper right back and his arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Colin\u201d the first face said. It was Bridget. Colin fell to his knees, kneeling in front of this disgusting monster. Face to face with the other face, Bliss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Colin, we tried to warn you, but there is nothing we can do\u201d Bliss admitted solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinner heard a rumble from deep inside Victor\u2019s body, it got louder and louder until a long wet fart came out of his arse. Both Bliss and Skinner recoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cColin you are so special, I\u2019ve never met anyone like you\u201d Before Bridget could finish her monologue Victor butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Skinner appreciates these kind words girls but quite frankly I\u2019m ready for him to enter me and join you, make some space for him in there. Oh and Bridget I think you should thank me. You\u2019ve always wanted to be close to Skinner and spend the rest of your life with him. Your wish is granted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the three had time to react Victor bent his knees and sat down onto Skinner squashing his legs with his bum and pushing his face adjacent to his back. Skinner felt his skin melting and merging with Victor\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOOOOO\u201d the 2 girls moaned, though Bliss\u2019s was muffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOHHH YESS *GURRGGGLE* *MMMM*\u201d Victor exclaimed in pure ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor\u2019s body continued to lower sucking more and more of Skinner into it. Each time a piece of Skinner entered the gurgles and wet noises increased in volume, as did Victor\u2019s moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours but was only a minute Skinner was completely consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wet noises got louder yet again and the sound of stretching elastic sounded as an outline of Skinner\u2019s face started to emerge onto his lower left stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women already in Victor's body continued to moan, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinner\u2019s face stretched out of Victor, it now fully formed and conscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere am I\u201d Skinner said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm you were the best meal yet\u201d Victor said. \u201cPoor Bliss is going to have to smell all of your remains as I digest you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PHHHHUURUURRP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Colin. I'm so sorry, I love you\" Bridget said, but her voice was not of love but of sadness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. We couldn't have known\" Skinner replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictor got up, walked towards his desk, sat down and started to read his paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaves of pleasure still washed over him from the sensation of having 3 victims now digesting within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he could always go for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as that thought entered his head. He heard the lift to the basement whirr into action.</span></div></div>",

Bridget and Skinner looked at each other, obvious affection in their eyes.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll, see you next week\" Skinner asked nervously. \"Alright then\" Bridget said short of breath. The two leaned in for an awkward kiss, both with beaming smiles attached to their face. <br>\r\nSkinner proceeded to walk into the lift to join Elton and Ursula the other couple in the group, they too were smiling, chuckling to themselves watching the blooming relationship of the 2 others blossom.<br>\r\n\"Bye Bye\" Bridget said her smile not faltering. She watched her friends go up into the lift, already anticipating the next time they'll meet, and hoping she'll be able to spend some personal close time with Mr Skinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at Kennedy. Kennedy also seemed to be smiling but it seemed to come out as more of a smirk.<br>\r\n\"So what did you need to talk to me about?\" Bridget said, attempting to break the silence which was growing in the room.<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing just some boring administrative stuff I need, nothing important\" he said.<br>\r\n\"Come over and take a seat at my desk I'll just go into the back and get the paperwork\" before Bridget could say anything Kennedy waddled over to a side door into the room. He looked like he was rushing, he clutched his belly and let out a quiet yet audible fart. <br>\r\nHe's acting weird. Bridget thought. She didn't think too much of it though, she knew Kennedy was strange and not quite adept at socialising, at least he offered to give her a lift to the station, that's sweet of him, though she didn't ever see him leave the basement or mention driving before. <br>\r\nAgain Bridget started to think about Skinner, oh what times they'll have together, all she wanted was to be close to him. She couldn't wait to hang out as a couple with Skinner and the other two love birds, Elton and Ursula. Though its a shame Bliss left, Bliss was lovely she'd never consider she was the kind of person to just leave without proper notice, either way wherever she is right now she hoped Bliss was okay. <br>\r\nMid thought Bridget heard incredibly loud strange  sounds coming from the other room \"MMMMMM\" \"PHHHHRRRTT\" *MOAN*<br>\r\n\"You alright Victor?\" Bridget shouted to no reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Bridget sensed how unsettled she felt, the last she saw of Bliss was when Kennedy asked to speak to her in private. \"Surely n...\" \"MMMMMM\" \"PHRARRP\" \"GURGLE\" and what sounded like muffled shouting could be heard again. Butterflies started to appear in her stomach. Something is wrong.<br>\r\nMore noises again this time louder \"MMMMPARP\" \"PPHHURRT\" \"MOAN\", each noise punctuated with wet gurgling sounds, like wet clay being mashed. Bridget stood up. \"What is going on!\" she shouted, but the only reply was a quiet muffled voice which she swear sounded like Bliss. A door swung open in the dark of the other side of the room. A shape stepped out, each step it took made a wet slapping sound. <br>\r\nBridget watched in horror as the thing came out from the dark into the light, it was Kennedy. He was near naked, fat and a kind of green and brown colour, what looked like twisted faces covered his body and the wet sound she heard before was now constantly emanating from him. <br>\r\n\"finally I can show my true form to you Bridget, I've *PHHRRT* been waiting so long\" <br>\r\n\"W-w-what are you?\" Bridget asked, fear clearly audible in her voice.<br>\r\n\"This is what I truely look like, isn't my form beautiful *PHARRP*\", After Kennedy's last disgusting wet fart he moaned. A voice which wasn't Bridget's or Kennedy's could be heard. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry Bridget there is nothing I can do. Run do something he wants to absorb you inside of him\" <br>\r\nKennedy was amused by Bliss's remark and he turned round to show Bridget what he's did to her. Bridget looked in both horror and sadness. Bliss's face could be seen plastered to the things arse, her face stretching out but slightly flattened, presumably because of when he sat down he squashed her. Kennedy let out  another humiliating fart which wafted over Bliss's face her unable to avoid it, she grimaced and shut her eyes, a slight chuckle could be heard coming from Kennedy. <br>\r\nBridget was locked in place, unable to move in shear shock of what was happening in front of her. <br>\r\n\"Move Bridget!\" Bliss said Kennedy still turned around to let the two speak \"Just do something\". <br>\r\nBridget looked around the room. The lift was at the top, she wouldn't be able to get there in time. The stairs were locked. There were no other exits. What could she do? <br>\r\n\"Nowhere to go Bridget, how about you just sit down and we'll let this happen slowly, painlessly. *MMPHRP* I'll put my hand on your hand and you'll quietly become one with me and your friend. What's even the point of fighting it anymore, you'll live the rest of your live peacefully sinking into me, none of the worries of the real world will exist anymore, just you, me your friends and ecstasy.\"<br>\r\nBridget felt faint. She collapsed onto the floor completely overwhelmed with what was going on around her. She heard wet slapping coming closer to her.<br>\r\n\"That's it Bridget *PPPHHRRP* don't struggle\" Kennedy said calmly as he walked towards her. Bliss was sobbing. <br>\r\nKennedy started to drool. \"Dissolve into me, I'll make you feel amazing\"<br>\r\nHe took her clothes off. \"You won't be needing these where you're going\". Bridget looked up for one final time at Kennedy.. He grabbed her hands and lifted her up so she was facing him stood up. As their hands touched her hands felt liquidy and started to melt, Kennedy's skin greedily sucking her hand then wrists then arms into him. <br>\r\n\"mmmmmmmm hhhhh aa\" the thing moaned quietly at first but they started to get more intense as more of the woman entered the fleshy prison. The sounds of his skin slurping and sucking were deafening to Bridget's ears. Kennedy closed his eyes and grunted. <br>\r\n\"I want all of you inside me\" Bridget was up to her elbows inside Kennedy's hands at this point but it's obvious he was enjoying the process immensely. Kennedy pulled the rest of her body onto him a loud wet slap audible as their bodies collided. Bridget felt the whole of his torso on hers. The texture was slimy and squishy but before she could think it too hungrily feasted on her body, sucking it in at immense speed. <br>\r\nBridget all of a sudden felt a wave of calm wash over her. \"Why bother fighting\" she thought and rested her tired head on Kennedy's chest. She could hear Kennedy's voice but now it was in her head \"That's it come into me and let me gorge on you\".<br>\r\nWith a deafening wet *POP* and *SLURP* the last of Bridget's body entered Kennedy. Kennedy was now shaking with pleasure *PHHHAAAARRRRRRRPPP* The loudest of his farts yet could be heard to the audible disgust of Bliss who continued to sob as she could feel Kennedy's body shift inside to make space for its new occupant. Bliss could feel Bridget's calm and Bridget could feel Bliss's unhappiness.<br>\r\nKennedy continued to shake and with a grunt and a gurgle a bulge on his upper right back started to form with the outline of Bridget's face. Kennedy was experiencing unimaginable pleasure as he felt Bridget join with him, the ecstasy of absorbing two people was incredible. He could feel everything they were feeling and everything they've ever felt, their memories, emotions, experiences, it was incredible. <br>\r\nFinally with a *SQUELCH* Bridget's face fully formed onto the things back. Stretching out. <br>\r\n\"Bridget I'm so sorry\" Bliss said but to no reply.<br>\r\n\"It often takes time for people to adjust Bliss, give her time\"<br>\r\nKennedy walked over to his seat and sat down. Bliss let out a final squeal as with a *SQUELCH* her face was squashed back onto the seat. <br>\r\n\"You tasted incredible Bridget. I can't wait to find out how your 'was to be' boyfriend will taste as soon as I can suck him into me. <br>\r\nBridget let out a single tear knowing this was it now, she would spend the rest of her life attached to this awful being. </span></div></div>",
