Maybe i can sneak through the city fast and catch a boat to America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames then started running to reach London before all of the Boats left, Little did he know that Bella was leaving London and walking right to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella: Well that was fun, destroying the city and all, but i'm really tired now so i think ill have a little rest on this hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bella sat down, she felt something  squirming under her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella: A little guy?
