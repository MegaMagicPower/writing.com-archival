Getting a better look at the person, he realizes that its a girl. He helps her to her feet and gets a better look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has long red hair, an average chest, a little on the short side, and a blue and....a red eye?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-your eye!\", he stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: !!!\", she glances at him, but before anything could happen, the bell rings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I don't have time to deal with this! Sorry, but I have to go now!\", and he takes off running, leaving the girl standing there watching him run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher: Zack! Your late!\", the homeroom teacher says, as Zack runs in, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n\"S-sorry.....\".<br>\r\nTeacher: .....It is the first day.....Take your seat. Just be more careful in the future.<br>\r\nZack: Alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack takes his seat and a few of his friends tease him about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHomeroom begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher: Before we start homeroom, we have a new student that will be joining us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in walks the girl that Zack had run into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course he was surprised, but what really shocked him was that both of her eyes were blue.<br>\r\n\".....W-was I wrong? I guess I was seeing things......?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher introduces her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeacher: Her name is Hellen.<br>\r\nHellen: Pleased to meet all of you\", she looks at Zack, who nervously shuffles in his seat.<br>\r\nTeacher: Hellen, your seat will be over there, next to Zack.<br>\r\nZack: !!!!!<br>\r\nHellen: Alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen takes her seat and homeroom ends.

He watches her from the corner of his eyes and gets up. Hellen had been watching him since the lunch break started, and he gets really nervous as she gets up, excuses herself form the people that surrounded her to ask questions, and walks towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen grabs 1 of his arms and says, \"I need to talk to you\", and drags him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack is taken to a secluded place in the nearby forest that surrounds 1 side of the school, no 1 will disturb them here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding his arm, she pushes him against a tree and glares at him.<br>\r\n\"W-what?\".<br>\r\nHellen: You saw it.<br>\r\n\"S-saw what?\".<br>\r\nHellen: You know what.<br>\r\n\"You mean y-your red eye?\".<br>\r\nHellen: Exactly! You saw it! No 1 is suppose to see it!<br>\r\n\".....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping him pinned to the tree with one hand, (man is she strong), he thinks, she puts her other hand to her face. Hellen covers her eyes, then removes her hand, with her eyes closed. Zack stares at this, and as she slowly opens her eyes, he gets a big surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of her eyes were now red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-both of them are red!?\".<br>\r\nHellen: .....Contacts. I was wearing colored contacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits him. When he collided with her, 1 of her contacts must have been knocked from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why are your eyes like that?\".<br>\r\nHellen:.....Fine. I was planning to tell you anyway. I needed to find someone who could keep this a secret to make my stay on Earth easier.<br>\r\n\"On....Earth?\".<br>\r\nHellen: I am a demon, well, 1/2 demon. My dads a demon and my moms a human. I was sent here to learn a bit a bout my human side, and your going to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn disbelief, he wasn't sure of what to do or say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen: So thats my story, your going to help me, whether you like it or not. I am a demon after all.<br>\r\n\"D-demon.....How do I know your telling the truth? Do you really expect me to believe a story like that?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning evilly, something that Zack did not expect from her based on how she looks and acted in front of everyone else, she says, \"I was hoping you'd say that. My dad is a very powerful demon, and even though I may be only 1/2, I have inherited his terrible powers. A demonstration, you ask? I will be more than happy to fulfill your request\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA male student then comes into view, and Hellen's smile gets even bigger as she begins to laugh. \"Hahaha, what perfect timing. He will do just nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointing her free hand at the unsuspecting student, Zack sees Hellen's eyes glow for a brief moment, followed by another quick laugh from her. He looks at the student just as it starts to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large pair of breasts suddenly spring from his chest, he can only look down in surprise for a second before his ass enlargens, followed shortly by his hair growing. His face then changes to a more feminine 1 and his dick quickly shrivels away. It didn't even take 10 seconds for him to become a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now female student didn't even get a moment to panic, because Hellen was not done  with her. The 1/2 demon girl's eyes glow real for a moment, then the girl is sent flying towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screams as she is sent flying through the forest. Upon seeing the grinning, red glowing eyed Hellen, her screams get even louder, but her screams are quickly silenced, as the poor girl's mouth vanishes. She reaches Hellen's outreached hand and finds herself unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen: That shut her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally releasing Zack, she then releases the girls as well, though she made her float in midair. The girl could only let out muffled noises as Hellen put 1 hand on her head, and the other below her. With 1 quick movement, she brings her hands together, and the girl vanishes between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what did you do to him um her?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen does not answer, instead, she slightly turns her head towards him, a truly wicked smile on her face, and her eyes glowing a deep red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(She really is a demon).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon turns back to her closed hands. And opens them, revealing a small sphere. But Zack could easily tell that the sphere was the girl for he could see her face, clothes, and everything else. She had simply been compressed into a small ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting the ball girl with 1 hand, she slowly licks her lips. \"What perfect timing, little snack, I had forgotten to bring lunch\". Like a true demon, she takes her time. First, she puts the girl, face first, in front of her mouth, then licks it a few times. She puts part of her into her mouth, then gently pushes her into the wet, moist, prison. She holds her there for a few seconds, then swallows. Zack watches the bulge go down the demon's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen just looks up at the sky, a look of pure joy on her face. She closes her eyes and just stands there. Then, turning to Zack. \"She was SO good~. Now, back to you. I hope that that was enough of a demonstation\", Zack nods, \"good. Then onto the contract\".</span></div></div>",

You will be forming a contract with a demon, me.<br>\r\n\"And why should I do that?\".<br>\r\nHellen: Because you don't have a choice.<br>\r\n\".....\".<br>\r\nHellen: Its what I've decided. You will help me, and by making a contract with me, you won't be able to go against what I say. Oh, and don't worry, you do get something out of it. It would go against our code if we made a deal with a human without giving them something\".<br>\r\n\"W-what will I get?\".<br>\r\nHellen: Well....Let me think.....I AM a very generous demon, when it comes to my servents.....So how about I give you something special.....Oh! I know~! How about this, your gift for making a pact with a demon as powerful as I am, will change, depending on my mood!\".<br>\r\n\".....What?.....\".<br>\r\nHellen: Its perfect! I am so smart! Every once in a while, I will give you something, and take the last thing I gave you away.<br>\r\n\"Like what?\".<br>\r\nHellen: Oh, you know, some kind of power, like super strength, speed intelligence, or maybe some magic abilities of your own, does that sound alright?<br>\r\nZack nods.<br>\r\nHellen: Good, offer accepted. The contract that we are making will be a special 1. So all that is left is for us to perform the actual ritual.<br>\r\n\"A ritual, a special 1? What kind o-\", Hellen silences him by putting a finger to his mouth, \"silence, let us enjoy this\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen pushes Zack, and he falls to the floor.<br>\r\n\"W-what was that for?\".<br>\r\nHellen: For the ritual, I told you that this is a special contract~!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over him, she begins to remove her clothes.<br>\r\n\"!!!! W-what the hell are you doing? Why are you taking your clothes off!?\"<br>\r\nAfter removing her shirt and skirt, \"because thats how the special ritual works. For us to make this rare contract, we must have sex~!\".<br>\r\nZack, just stared at her, mouth wide open, in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlipping her shoes off, she reaches back and unfastens her bra. Then, she slides her panties down with both hands, and lifts each foot up and removes her socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing one foot on either side of him, she is now standing naked, directly over him. Her demonic eyes glow again, and Zack can feel a sudden pulling sensation as his clothes pass through his body and are tossed aside. \"....Oh....It looks like your already ready to go~!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers herself on him, and glides his member inside her. She flinches, and falls forward. Her chest, not on his, they look at each other, and she kisses him. Lifting herself back up, she starts to move herself up and down along his shaft. After several minutes, and lots of moans from her, he releases inside her. Though when he does, a giant red magic circle appears beneath them, followed by countless red lights floating up from said circle. Zack can feel an odd sensation rush through him, as does Hellen, who collapses back onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights and circle vanish, and after another minute or 2, Hellen gets off of him and too her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen: Ahhhh, I can't believe how great that was! I am so glad I decided to go with that special contract. She looks at him, and smiles, which Zack can't help but think how cute she looked, \"our contract is now complete! We are going to have so much fun together!\".</span></div></div>",

From what I've seen and read about demons and contracts, that was no blood or anything like that, and I didn't have to give you anything.<br>\r\nHellen: Yeah, well, like I said, that was a special contract ritual. It is hardly ever used.<br>\r\n\"Then why did you do it? From how I saw you treat that person, I was completly surprised by that.<br>\r\nHellen: Well.....lets just say that I felt like it......<br>\r\n\"Really, with all your boasting about being a demon.....to think that you had a softer side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen actually blushes by this and was caught off guard, \"s-so what!?

Off to the side of a path in a random section of the park is a large shady man who is hiding the bushes. Holding a knife in one hand, it is more than obvious of his intentions. \"Perfect\", is all she says, slipping through the shadows and appearing some distance behind him. It was then that a young woman entered the area, heading down the path that the man was hiding by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was making her way home after staying late at a nearby college for a paper she was working on. I guess you could say it was bad luck on her part as she has taken this route numerous times before without incident, but all it takes is one unlucky moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man jumps out of the bushes and grabs her arm, she looks at his creepily smiling face and screams, but then she screams even louder when she sees something else emerge from behind the man who grabbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Hellen in full demon mode. With eyes glowing, wings extended, and an even creepier grin on her face, the girl looses it as she sees the monstrous figure grab the man who is assaulting her. The man lets out his own terrified scream as the demonic creature pulls him back into the bushes and away from the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalling to her knees, stunned, she doesn't know what to do as the man's screams and the rustling sounds get further away until the night is silent once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance away and in the middle of the woods away from anyone, the demon finally releases the man after dragging him through the park. She begins to eerily laugh as she walks up to the man who was on his back. The man was paralyzed with fear as he looks up at the nightmarish creature above him. The demon begins to circle the man still laughing and smiling while doing so, this makes the man snap out of it and ties to scoot away from her, only to back into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. Your not getting away from me\", she says, laughing. \"I've been waiting for someone like you. Someone evil and cruel. You see, it's people like you that drive our existence.

It's too late. You've hurt too many people\". Reaching a hand out, the energy leaps from her hand and strikes the man in the chest. He grunts as the energy hits and spreads throughout his body. He looks up at the demon, only to get a shock as it seems to be getting bigger. He then realizes that the creature isn't getting bigger, he is getting smaller! He tries to speak out again, but his voice comes out higher than it should. On top of that, his hair falls in his face as it gets longer and longer. It was the two mounds that grew and ballooned out that he realized what was going on. This creature from hell was turning him into a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen was laughing the entire time, as she holds her hands towards the man, watching as he helplessly pleaded with her in his new voice to stop. What she does instead is speed up the process as the glow gets even brighter. The glow and demonic magic dissipate and what is beneath the tree is now a cowering terrified girl who is huddled against the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, Hellen begins the next part. Spreading her legs apart and holding her arms in the air, she begins to chant in her demonic tongue as a red demonic circle appears at her feet. Red cracks appear in the air around them and are growing larger by the second. Clawed arms try to force their way through the rifts trying to escape before the rifts are big enough to let whatever their attached to through. The former man is freaking out as tears roll down her eyes at the sight of the demonic creatures that begin to crawl through the rift. The creatures that have already passed through the rift have not moved. They are standing in place, as if waiting for something to happen. Hellen then stops her chanting, and laughs. Pointing one hand at the girl, \"minions. Get her\". This was all they needed and they rushed her. Screams, clothes ripping, and roars, and the beasts are all over her, violating her in ever way possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter watching for a minute or so, Hellen turns and starts to walk away, \"You guys can have all the fun you want, but remember, no killing. We don't want to get into any trouble now, do we?\", some of them nod at her in reply as she takes her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen: Well, that was fun. But now what? Hmmm I could go home.....Could look for some more victims.....Oh, that's right, your still between my legs aren't you? Well, I would ask you but you can't talk right now!

At the very cent of the park is a large decorated fountain. Usually this place is bustling with many people who are passing by or relaxing in this very nice place; however, this is during the day. With it almost pitch black out, some of the park's least favorite guests have shown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were five of them, all hanging round the fountain and smoking while talking to each other. Their hair, clothes, and how they look all scream that they are bad people. Hellen looks them over and says, \"hmm....they do LOOK the part, but I should check, just to be sure....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding out a hand, palm up, a red ball of energy appears above it and disappears, leaving some kind of device in her hand. The device is long, red, and in the shape of a rectangular box. Placing her free hand on it, she opens it up lengthwise, revealing a multitude of buttons and a screen. Pressing a few buttons, the screen turns on and produces an even larger red screen that is floating in the air in front of her. Pointing the device at the possible targets, it scans them and their images appear on the screen, \"now to check on their past.....\". A progress bar appears beneath their portraits and she waits for it to finish. As the last bar finishes, \"ok, now to see just how bad.....or good....they are\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping each individuals image, they open up revealing vast information down to the last detail on each suspect. She starts to read up on them, \"In college....theft....assault....armed robbery.....drug use and selling.....multiple charges and getting away with......next one.....the same.....same.....same.....last one. Oh? High school, my high school. Only one case of shoplifting and he probably shouldn't be smoking.....maybe I could.......\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the screen, she begins to type away at the device, writing up a report and then sending to to some unknown location. She then waits in her tree, keeping an eye on them while waiting for a response. Immediately grabbing the device as it starts to vibrate, she reads the reply, \"let's see......we have checked your targets...blah blah blah....the four college students are fair game, do whatever you want to them....that's good.....yeah....yeah.....as for the high school student, your request has been granted.

She only undoes the magic when he sinks deep enough into it to hold him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting go of the terrified individual, she steps back and begins to talk to the five, \"I know what your thinking, what could such a cute little demon possibly want with us\". With her uttering the world \"demon\" the five of them stop making noise and freeze in fear. Walking towards the college students, her smile disappears, and eyes glow as she takes a more serious tone and expression. \"The four of you have been very very bad. We know all the crimes you've committed, all the people that you've hurt\", she pauses, \"but you already know all of this. No need for me to tell you of your sins.....\". Facing her back on the bound men, she holds both hands up, \"However! You should be grateful for my appearance! Despite the punishment you all are about to receive\". Turning their way again, she leans forward and points a finger at them. \"This is because after your punishments, you will be able to continue your lives and will thus be able to repent for your actions\". Straightening herself, \" Well, that's enough talk, I've explained as I'm suppose to. That means that all the boring stuff is out of the way! Time to get to the real action!\". With the hand that is still pointing at them, she snaps her fingers. This causes the chains to glow a bright red as demonic energy courses through them and into their bounded captives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as expected, the first thing that Hellen is doing to them is changing their gender. Skeletal restructuring, softening bodies, longer hair, ballooning breasts, and shrinking dicks leaves the four former men gasping and moaning in pleasure as the transformation increased their sense of arousal in the process that has left them as girls. The demon girl takes a few steps forward, she reaches out and puts a hand under the chin of one of the girls. Lifting her head, with minimal resistance from the girl, Hellen forces the girl to look her in her glowing red eyes. \"Yes. That's right. By now you've noticed that's somethings wrong. That you should just be scared, terrified of me, whats happened to you....and yet.....why is my body so hot? Why are you so turned on. The answer is simple. The magic I used to transform you four also acted as a kind of aphrodisiac. You are all in an extreme state of arousal right now. I mean, if I didn't do that, the upcoming spectacle wouldn't be as much fun to watch. You'd all resist too much and would be scared the whole time. Not that that wouldn't be fun to watch, but it does get boring rather quickly\". Letting go of the scared girl, she backs up and snapping her fingers again, \"time for the second act\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains start to shake, then the base of each chain snaps and the girls fall to the floor, still bound.They then start to enter their clothing, directly wrapping and tightening themselves around their now smooth and supple bodies. The edges of the chains suddenly extend themselves, tearing the too large male clothing to shreds, leaving them completely exposed and showing off the chain bindings on their new bodies. Hellen's hands begin to glow as she raises them in the direction of the girls who are squirming on the ground. She then begins to chant in her native demon language. The chains give off a flash of red light in response to the new spell that the demon is chanting. The ends of the change begin to vibrate then change into a new long solid shape. The girls eyes widen as they recognize the shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen: Yup. Figured just being bound and teased wouldn't be enough to satisfy the desires of your new bodies, so I thought that I would lend a hand with that. Enjoy the new pleasure you're all about to experience with all three of your holes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dildofied ends of the chains raise up into the air then make their way to the backsides of each girl. Pressing against their already lubed folds and back doors, a few of them manage to let out a plea to stop, but this is quickly silenced by a dildo chain happily taking advantage of their opened mouths. The other modified chains quickly follow suit, plunging deep into the openings at the opposite end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dildos pump back and forth in each girl and their moans fill the air, Hellen turns around and heads over to the boy form her school, \"I'll leave you \"girls\" to your fun but I'll be right back.....after I deal with this one.....personally.....\".</span></div></div>",

He has an average build with short black hair and eyes, you can still tell despite the coloring and such that is in his hair and on his face. As previously mentioned, he attends the same school as Hellen and the others. Even though he recently plays hooky a lot due to his new \"friends\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over the boy who is still embedded into the fountain, \".....now as for what I'm going to do to you.....\". She starts to reach for him, and he responds by begging for her to space him. A small smile is what he is greeted with, his pleas falling upon deaf ears. The demon places her hand on the frightened boys chest and his body jolts as she forces her demonic magic into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she touched, his body starts to get hotter and hotter, this heat then spreads to the rest of his body. He glances over to his right and sees the girls being violated by the chains, he cant help but think that hes next, that his demon is going to transform him into a girl and then force herself on him just like them. And as his body begins to shift and shrink, it looks like he is at least somewhat right with his worries. Hellen places her other hand on his chest and beneath both hands, soft mounds of flesh begin to push out from his chests. The growing breasts press against the demons hands who gives them a playful squeeze before moving her hands down the transforming boys body. As her hands glide down his body, enjoying the feeling of his body changing under her power, she begins to relieve him of his clothes. Grabbing his shirt, she rips the front open, he is still attached to the fountain after all, exposing his new breasts. His eyes widen as his new boobs bounce, freed from the shirt that had been tightly pressed against his chest when he was first trapped. His pants are next. Grabbing them, she rips/pulls them, and his boxers, off. They both look at his lower half which is in the process of slowly feminizing. Every second that passes, they become smaller, softer, more feminine. Of course this includes his manhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too much longer!\", the demon gleefully says, bending down and stroking the shrinking appendage. \"You should enjoy this while you can, your \"little\" friend won't last much longer!\". Wrapping her fingers around the dwindling dick, she strokes, rubs, and teases it. Despite the situation, and it's current size, it does stand at attention. The demoness doesn't hesitate. Leaning forward, she gives it a lick, then puts whats left of his manhood in her mouth. Sucking him off, she gives him one last bit of pleasure. He comes, giving off a little squirt before it shrivels away, getting sucked into his body and settling in above her new pussy. Hellen swallows, looks down at her newly formed womanhood and smiles. She gives it a playful kiss before getting up, \"though you are now a girl now, your body hasn't finished transforming just yet. Looks like it will still take a few more minutes for it to finish. So while your finishing up, I'm going to go play with your friends!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the four college students, the demon ponders what she'll do to them next. She already knows what she is going to do to the one she just left, but not these four. Then it hits her, she knows what to do. With an evil grin, she puts her idea into play...... </span></div></div>",

Holding out both hands, she starts to chant again as s demonic circle appears beneath three of the four girls. \"I don't need the rest of you\", saying in the middle of her casting. Red cracks appear in the floor around them and open into large dark holes. Three large hands then emerge from them and grab the girls. They let out muffled yells as they are dragged into the dark abyss, the holes closing behind them. Brushing some hair to the side, \"you'll continue your punishments in another place\". She then looks at the last girl, who now has tears in her eyes, then turns her back on the terrified girl and walks back over to Carl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen makes it back to Carl in time to see the final part of the transformation on his face. Now, where Carl is, still trapped, there is a girl with long black hair, average chest, height, and body. And yes, still naked from when Hellen ripped off her clothes. \"Now then.....I know what you want to ask. What are you going to do to me!? Well, it's quite simple. You see.....your friends there.....\", she pauses then looks behind her.....\"right. I guess \"friend\" and the others are whats known as \"Very Bad People\". The amount of crimes committed, people hurt, blah blah blah, etc etc etc is so bad that even though they will undergo extreme punishments, they probably won't be able to stop themselves from going back to their old lives after we're done with them\". Pointing at him, \"YOU on the other hand are different. Having only just started going down the wrong path, and as such, your punishment is going to be much lighter\". Carl seems to be slightly relieved by this, and the demon notices. \"But that doesn't mean you won't be punished. For you see, in order for you to pay your debt back, I came up with an interesting idea and it's already been cleared by the higher ups\". She puts a hand on the still trapped girl's shoulder, \"you get to become my servant! Lucky you!\" The girl's jaw drops. \"By serving me, you will pay off your debts and then once your time is served, you'll be changed back and go back to your normal life, hopefully a changed person!\". Tapping the fountain, it looses its shape again and she pulls the girl free from her prison. Using her super human strength, she then pushes her on the ground and sits on her to make sure she can't run. Starting to talk again, \"You will be my third servant, though I think I will use yet another contract with you as you are technically considered bad\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, she then puts a foot on him to keep him in place as she removes her clothes. Leaving her top on, she unhooks her skirt and pulls down her panties. Replacing her foot with a hand, she sits down in front of the girl. Grabbing the girls head, \"What I'm going to do is transform you one last time....and through a very unorthodox method that I find very satisfying\". Still holding the girl's head, she then spreads her legs and slowly brings Carl's head to her lower lips. Seeing her bright red face, Hellen says, \"Enjoying the view? But I'll let you in on a secret. My pussy? You see.....is actually my second servant!\". Upon hearing this Carl starts to freak out and tries to get away, but Hellen is too strong for her and forces her to stare at Sarah. \"This girl here, and yes, she is a natural born girl, unlike you, was rather rebellious and thus ended up between my legs as her punishment. Now don't go thinking that she did the same thing as you. Unlike you, my other servants are good people who became my servants. I am allowed some leniency in choosing said servants, though I can't go too far. The reason I'm telling you this is because of my plans for what kind of servant you'll be. Don't worry, you'll understand soon enough\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to the poor girl's surprise, the demon presses her head against her slit, \"That's right! You're going inside!\". Her pussy gladly accepts the offering as Carl's head is greedily swallowed by her folds. Carl panics, flailing her limbs as she tries to escape, to which Hellen responds by grabbing her arms and pinning them to her sides. Hellen then starts to pull her towards her, making her go further inside her while keeping her arms pinned. With half of her victim already inside her, Hellen has already climaxed several times from the sheer pleasure. With her open mouth, flushed face, and heavy panting, the demon has become lost in her lust. This causes her to speed up the process of taking Carl into her crotch. Carl's ass makes it to the opening, and only gives her some trouble before it too gets sucked inside the demon. Now only her legs remain on the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe will now take a pause and switch perspectives as there is still another player in this erotic game. We of course are talking about Sarah.....or Hellen's cunt, having been forced to listen to and experience everything that has happened since she was forced to be her pussy. She still can't believe that all of this is happening, just earlier this day she was a normal girl. Now, not only was she forced to be a demon's servant, she has been reduced to it's privates. Of course Hellen knew that Sarah would be used at some point so she did not overlook making sure that their senses were connected. Every act that Hellen has done this night that has turned her on also put Sarah in a state of arousal, and that means the current situation of her captor currently unbirthing the gender bent individual that's being forced inside her. She doesn't want to admit it, but she too is in the very same state as the demon, lost in a state of extreme lust. Every inch that entered her increased this, causing them to cum and release love juice all over Carl which also acted as a lube that made it easier for her to make her way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her legs that are extending outside of her pussy, she slowly begins to push them inside with the rest of her prey. Enjoying every second of it, she finally comes to the point where just a pair of feet are outside her lower entrance. With a lust filled smile, she places her hands on the wriggling end of Carl's legs and gives them one last push and they disappear with a wet slurp. Hellen gives a loud sigh as she falls on her back, her extended gut moving, showing that her victim isn't happy with her current lodging. After a brief moment of rest, she sits up, \"that was far more enjoyable than I thought it was. But all good things must come to an end, so let's get on to the next part\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, her eyes and entire body begin to glow red. Placing her hands on her stomach, she begins to concentrate. Muffled noises could be heard emanating from her gut in response as it starts to vibrate ans shrink in size. On the inside, trapped in her womb, the walls begin to close in on her. However, surprisingly, as the she gets coated in the liquids emanating from the walls as the continue to press on her body, getting tighter and tighter, she does not feel any pain....just pleasure. The liquid soaks into her body, causing her body to soften and letting the walls compress her body into a ball that is continually getting smaller and smaller. Back on the outside, Hellen suddenly stops as the glow fades away. She gasps, then starts breathing heavily, her body covered in sweat. Catching her breath, she pokes her stomach, which easily gives under the weight of her finger. Watching her finger sink into her body, \"damn. I was afraid of that\", getting to her feet, with some difficulty, \"two contracts and all of the magic I flung around today was too much. I'm exhausted. Don't have enough magic to finish the spell\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to the bound girl that she left behind, she stands over her and gives her a wicked grin, \"Which is why I left you behind.....\"</span></div></div>",

Grabbing her and lifting her off the ground, and yes, she was still bound and getting fucked by the chains the entire time, she stands the girl up and looks her over. \"Yes. I made the right choice with you\". She licks her lips, \"your voluptuous body will be the perfect fuel for my own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered something and dropped the girl, \"don't want my top to tear\", she says, removing the top and her bra. Now, only wearing her shoes and socks, she picks her back up and snaps her fingers. The chains leave the girls holes and come undone, falling to the ground. The girl is too shocked to speak as the demon opens its maw, already salivating in anticipation of the meal. Lifting the girl above her head, her mouth stretches open as she lowers the girl's head into her mouth. Getting past the shoulders and large breasts, the girl is unable to put up much resistance due to what happened to her earlier as she continues to easily slide down the demon's throat. Just the girl's ass and legs to go, Hellen grabs the girl's large backside and pushes, purposefully letting her fingers slip into the girl's already used holes. Getting past the wide hips, she quickly sucks the legs in until just the feet are outside her mouth. With one hand she pushes the feet into her mouth and closes it. With one last hard swallow, she sends the last of the girl downwards to her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStumbling and waddling her say to the fountain, she sits down, relieved to be off her feet. Letting out a burp, \"oh. Excuse me\", she says, rubbing her stomach, \"didn't think I'd get you down there for a second there. Haven't been this tired in a while. Though once my stomach is done with you, I'll get some energy back\". Her belly begins to gurgle, \"Looks like its starting. But don't worry, you won't die or feel any pain. And once I'm done with you, you'll join your fiends where you're punishment will continue. Though this situation should burn quite a bit of time off of that\". With a satisfied expression on her face, she relaxes and waits while her stomach starts to reduce in size. While it was shrinking, Hellen could feel her strength returning to her. Several minutes later, her stomach is as flat as it could be, Carl is still in there after all, Hellen continues where she left off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glow surrounds her again as she concentrates on her stomach and her body gets back to work on Carl. The lump in her gut begins to decrease in size once again as the compressed ball in her womb gets smaller and smaller. Even though her stomach is flat again, insider her, Carl is still shrinking. He gets so small that you can barely see her with the naked eye. Putting a hand on her stomach, \"So far so good. Everything seems to be working like it should. Ok. So, the next part I believe I need to....\". Shifting from her body to her hands, the red glow gets brighter as she focuses it on the lower half of her body. Closing her eyes, she concentrates all of her attention on this one spot, the spot where Carl. As she is doing this, wind starts to kick up around her, a testament to how much power she is using on this one spell. The wind dies down and the glow fades from her hands. \"I hope that worked\", she says to herself, getting to her feet. Picking up her scattered clothes, she goes to a nearby water fountain and quickly cleans herself off. Getting dressed, she then heads home, done for the night.</span></div></div>",

Don't know if it's up to your standards though. Guess you demons like staying up late, so just heat it up and it should still be good. By the way, I did decide to stay. Going to borrow one of the vacant rooms upstairs. See you in the morning I guess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just stands there, holding a letter. Her hands start to shake as she reads it again. Her eyes begin to twitch as what looks like water begins to pool in the corners of her eyes. However, she stops herself. Shaking her head, \"no....NO! Demons do NOT cry!\" Placing the note down, \"O-of course I would expect My servants to act in such a manner......\" She glances at the not, \"w-well I guess I could give him a little credit for his consideration.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing her hands, she heats up the food and eats it, \"Oh~this isn't bad! And this was just what I needed after a long day.

Need to clean myself properly after what just happened\" Getting our of her clothes, she hops into the warm water and washes the dirt of the day away, as well as a little playtime with Sarah. Exciting a few minutes later, she wraps a tower around her body after drying off and leaves the room, throwing her dirty clothes into a bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the long hallway that connects the various rooms on the second floor, she heads to her room and enters. Her room is as fancy as you would think. With red carpet, curtains, fancy desk and chairs, and a canopy bed. Throwing the towel to the side, she looks down at her stomach.

Sitting at the edge, she stretches. Standing up, she gets a change of clothes and finally gets dressed. Leaving her room, she heads back to the bathroom and takes care of morning activities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the bathroom she stops, something catches her attention. Sniffing the air, she follows this scent downstairs and into the kitchen. There she finds Zack making breakfast. He notices her and looks behind him, busy cooking, \"Oh, your awake. I got up first so I decided to make breakfast, guess you didn't mind if I used your kitchen\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen: No. It doesn't matter if one of my servants uses it.<br>\r\nZack: I see. Well its going to take a few more minutes so just wait a little longer.<br>\r\n\"Alright\", she says, heading for the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, they both sit down at a table and have a have a breakfast that surprised her. With omelets, hash browns, sausage, bacon, and other components, she stares in disbelief at the feast laid out before her. Cutting a piece of the omelet, she lifts it up to her face and gulps. Putting it in her mouth, \"MMPH!\", she moans in surprise and pleasure. Take aback at the taste, she starts to shovel down the food, each tastes just as good as the last, between this and last night, it would seem that he is a pretty good cook. \"How!? How can this be so good!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her clearly enjoying his food, he smiles, \"Guess that means you approve of my cooking\".<br>\r\nHis words causes her to jolt and freeze in place. With her face red, she composes herself, \"W-well if you couldn't at least cook this well you wouldn't be qualified to be my servant\". Though she says this, inside her head she is happily yelling over this.<br>\r\nZack: I see~\", he says, still smilint, \"By the way, what happened to Sarah?\".<br>\r\nHellen: Oh yeah. Don't worry about her. She's fine\", she says, shrugging it off.<br>\r\nZack: Well....if you say so then that's good. If I can ask another question, what were you doing last night? You were gone for quite a while\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the change in subject, Hellen quickly and proudly explain what happened last night, while leaving out a few details. She tells him about how demons punish bad people, about the lone man and then the group. \"That sound's pretty exciting. But what about that one you left for yourself? You didn't say what happened to him or her? I guess?\". She responds by saying, \"you don't need to worry about that. In fact the trouble maker just finished my part or her punishment before I came downstairs\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDone with Breakfast, Hellen must now make a critical choice. \"What should i do\", she ponders. \"With what?\", Zack asks. Looking at him, \"Whether I should go to school or stay here. I do have something from last night to finish\".<br>\r\nZack: But you can't just skip.<br>\r\nHellen: Oh I know. I have a way to actually go while staying here. I'm just trying to decide if I should stay or go and wait till after school to finish it.<br>\r\nZack: You do? But how?<br>\r\nHellen: Easy. I use a piece of hair and make a copy of myself and send that copy in my place.

The copy then heads upstairs to Hellen's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen: I know what you're going to ask. Yes that is a copy of me from my hair like I told you and as for what it's doing, it's getting what it needs to take my place in school today\", looking him in the eye, \"And I want you to go as well. Just to make sure it doesn't stop working, this is my first time trying out this spell\".<br>\r\nZack: Alright. I was planning on going anyway. I'll make sure to keep an eye on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack then gets ready himself and after saying goodbye to his mistress, leaves with the copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that one problem is taken care of, time for another. There is another reason why I made him leave. It would be weird if Sarah didn't turn up and I don't want him to know where she is right now, at least not yet. Though I did need someone to keep an eye on the copy\". Plucking another strand of hair, she starts to chant again, but concentrating harder than she did before. Throwing out this new strand, it too gets surrounded in smoke that once disperses, instead of a Hellen copy in front of her, a Sarah one is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\", she cheers, \"It worked! It was still my hair; however, because Sarah is a part of me right now, that means I could still draw on her and make a copy, though it was harder. Guess that's because there isn't much of her right now\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to tease her groin a little, she unbuttons and pulls the zipper down on her pants. Letting them fall to the floor, she begins to talk to her crotch, \"You know....Even though you can't see most of the time, I know that you can still hear everything. So how about I show you. Grabbing the sides of her panties, she pulls them down, \"Sarah, meet Sarah\". If she could scream, she would as she stares in shock at the perfect copy that's towering above her. The demon then grabs the clones head and lowers it to her nether region, allowing Sarah to get a better look. \"While your with me, your copy here is going to take over your life. But don't worry. Your time as my pussy is temporary. You'll be back to normal soon enough. Sorry, but I still want to keep you there after all\". Pulling her panties and pants back up, she finishes buttoning them as she tells the clone to get going. As it leaves and heads to her house to get ready, \"And now that only leaves you\", she says, patting her stomach. Hellen turns around and heads back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for the last and hardest part\". Taking a large book from her large decorated bookshelf, \"I believe this one had the spell\". Sitting down at her desk, she flips through it's many pages. Stopping on a certain page, \"Found it!\", she yells, then putting her face closer, \"Let's see......did that part.....yes.....I've done everything right so far.....Here we go. Next part\". She spends several minutes reading and rereading, making sure she understands the spell in full. \"Before I begin, I need to pick what type.....Something that will punish her at first, but will grow to like it. Thinking like that, there is only one option. Ok. Let's do this!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up, she walks over to her bed. She then proceeds to strip. After removing every article of clothing, she does something new. She starts to chant as her body and eyes glow, her wings come and tail come out in response as well. So much magic is being used, that it starts to appear and float around the room as a magic circle appears at her feet. As the entire room takes on an even redder hue, the demon begins to dance. Magic flowing across the room, a naked demon chanting and dancing in some kind of ritual like act, it was almost too much for Sarah to take. The glow emanating from the circle gets even brighter as Hellen finishes the ritual. With one last movement, she places both of her hands on her stomach. The room is filled with an even brighter light and as it fades, she stops chanting and dancing. As the room returns to normal, Hellen falls back onto her bed. Tired and breathing heavily, \"Uhhhh, that was even more exhausting than I thought. Guess that's what you get from such a complex spell. Wish I could take a break, but the next part should start soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling to the front of the bed, she arranges all of her pillows in the center and lays back on them. And as if on cue, the next and last, part begins. Her body twitches as a sensation deep inside her begins to pulsate. \"L-looks like it's time\", is all that escapes her lips as a sudden pulse causes her hands to grab the pillows that she's on. Her mouth opens and thrashes her body around as her stomach begins to vibrate then slowly expand. It gets bigger and bigger as her thrashing gets more and more frantic. Now ridiculously large, her stomach finally stops inflating, giving her a moments rest. Face flushed and sweating bullets, she lays there, arms and legs limp as she gasps for air. However, it really was only a moment as the pulsing energy resumes. This time it is more concentrated in her lower half. Bracing herself against the pillows, she extends and spreads her legs as whatever is in her shifts and moves south. Gasping and grunting, her pussy starts to open, something trying to escape. Pushing as hard as she can, a head suddenly pops out. Continuing to push, more and more of the figure is pushed out. Then, with the last of her strength, she gives one last push and the rest of the individual slides out of her snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a girl that came out of her, this was expected considering she unbirthed one before; however, this girl looks completely different. What exactly did she do to the high school student? Is this even the same person? Hellen, still exhausted and out of breath, is look at her, then up at the ceiling, \"Th-that was awesome\". Then the demon passes out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Waking a few hours later, she glances at her alarm clock, it was noon. She scoots to the end of the bed and stands up, but stumbles. Grabbing a bed post to catch herself, \"guess I used too much magic again\". Looking at the girl on the bed, she decides that she would be out for quite a while longer and leaves her room after grabbing her clothes. Still naked, she walks down the hallway and goes enters the bathroom where she takes a quick shower. Going back to her room, now dressed, she sees that the girl is still sleeping. With no other choice, she waits for her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that much later.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl moans as she begins to wake. Slowly opening her eyes, she lays there for a moment, dazed and confused. Lifting herself up with her arms, she finally notices where she is. Looking around the red themed room, she looks down at the very fancy bed and tries to remember how she got there. This was when the girl saw here. Sitting on a chair, one of her legs on the chair and her hands on that knee, was Hellen, smiling. Everything came back to her in an instant. In panic and fear, she backs frantically backs up until she hits the headboard of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the girl cowering against the headboard, she gets off the chair, \"oh, don't worry. I'm done playing with you.....well, at least for a while\". Slowly walking around the bed, \"You probably have a few questions, so let me guess, why am I here? Where is here? What am I going to do to you? And even though I transformed you into a girl already, why did I change your appearance again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon's last sentence caused the girl to panic. This was when the demon pointed to a mirror that she keeps bedside. She immediately grabs it and just stares at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the demon transformed her with her magic, he had a pretty average build and his hair was blond and his eyes were blue. When he became a girl, she kept her hair and eye color, she knew this from seeing her hair, which had grown longer, as well as her friends when they transformed because they became girl versions of themselves. However, the reflection in the mirror did not look like him at all. The busty blond was gone. She had a fairly petite body with barely average breasts and while she kept her blue eyes, her hair was now silver in color and still long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the silence, \"Don't misunderstand. Your new appearance has nothing to do with my tastes, though your gender is. I usually prefer to have females around me. The reason you're now a very beautiful loli has to do with you being my servant. As I told you before, I used a different contract with you than with the other two. This is because for you, this is punishment for your past deeds\". She stops pacing, then grabs and pulls the girl to the other end of the bed with one hand, holding something in the other. Leaning in close, she lifts up the girls head then puts something around her neck. The object is a black collar with a lock. Trying to pull it off, she finds that it won't even budge, like the collar is attached to her skin. Hellen than says, \"Don't even bother trying to remove it. That is the final part of our contract. As long as you wear that, you won't be able to run or defy me. In other words, a safety net, though it does have other functions as well, but that can wait\". Backing away from her, \"With that done, let me explain your punishment in full. You are to serve me as one of my servants until you've paid off your debt. You will do this by being my personal maid. To help you with that, I took a pretty extreme measure by giving you your current body\". The girl is really confused and stunned, a maid? A servant to a demon? And what did she mean about her body? She just can't wrap her head around all of this, it's too unreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see that you're confused. Let me get to the point. You're no longer human. I turned you into a demon\". The girl's eyes wide at this. \"And not just any ordinary demon, I thought I would spice things up by making you into a succubus! That's right, a demon of lust and desire. I thought it would be proper punishment as they have to satisfy their carnal desires every now and then and you won't be comfortable with that right now, but you will, in time. You'll also have to do these acts to help replenish your own power as well as to power up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking away from her and the bed and she snaps her fingers, \"follow me\", she says, and heads to the door. The girl does not want to follow, but her body does not listen. Without her consent, it stands up on it's own. To her disbelief, she starts to follow Hellen, who smirks and says, \"I told you, you can't defy you mistress\". She leads her new servant to the bathroom and opens the door, \"Go, clean yourself up. After what happened earlier, you kinda need it\". The girl unwillingly complies and walks into the room. Hellen turns on the water and puts the girl in, \"Now make sure you clean every part of your body thoroughly, and please, take your time~! I'll be right back with your new clothes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the girl to herself, the demon leaves and she is forced to do as instructed. This is the first time that the girl had some time to herself in her new body since this whole thing began. Blushing bright red, she is forced to take a shower with her new small female body as she waits for Hellen to return. With her hands going over every nook and cranny, she can't help but notice how sensitive she is. She can't help but wonder if this is what Hellen was talking about, that succubi are just like this. Hellen returns a few minutes later, holding something in her arms. Putting it to the side, she helps the succubus get out and dry off. Grabbing what she brought in, \"Now that you're all clean, time to get you into your uniform\", saying as she holds up a maid outfit. With no choice, the girl puts it on. Hellen loses it, \"Oh my god! You look so cute! I knew making you a small succubus was the right call!\", the girl's already red face gets even redder as the demon fawns over her. After regaining her composure, \"Now that your clean and prepped, time for your first task\".</span></div></div>",

Once you're done with that, meet me downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other choice, the succubus leaves and heads to Hellen's room. Hellen, on the other hand, stays in the bathroom and strips. Staring at herself in the mirror, hands on her hips, she trusts her hips forward, \"I guess I've kept you between my legs long enough\". If she could, Sarah would have jumped for joy, yelled in excitement, or sighed in relief.....but she couldn't.....she is just a pussy after all. \"However!\", she continues, \"I know I just took one, but I think I'll take a quick shower before I change ya back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the handle, the water comes out warm, still heated from her maid's use. The demon steps into the water, letting it flow down her body while a hand slides down her side and caresses the doorway at her lower valley. With the heat in her body rising, she drops to the floor, her legs spread open while a finger slides inside. After switching to using multiple fingers to pleasure herself, she stops. Pulling the fingers out, she holds that hand out, \"hah...hah....not good enough....need something better.....\". The area around her hand begins to glow a bright red and as the energy begins to warp and grow, it flashes, then a long and thick red dildo is in her outreached arm. \"Th...this will do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the head just in front of her more than ready pussy, she presses it against the entrance, \"gonna do this nice and slow, enjoy every second of this Sarah\", she says, then slowly pushes it inside her, her lower lips opening and spreading around it. She gasps and her body twitches as the long tool slowly goes deeper and deeper inside her. Almost all the way in, she pauses, letting the feeling of it inside her stay for her and Sarah's enjoyment. The dildo then gets gently pulled out, but not all the way. With only the tip in her, she starts the process again. Slowly in and out of her it goes, many times, and as she does this the speed increases until she finds herself unable to control herself and climaxes. Laying against one of the shower's walls, the dildo still inside her, she catches her breath, \".....that's more like it....but.....still not enough......need the \"real\" thing\". This terrifies Sarah, she starts to freak out....well....as much as a pussy could anyway.....then she thinks of something else that also scares her, and as if reading her groin's mind, \"now don't you worry, I know what your thinking, and I'm not going to jump Zack\". This does calm her down a little, but she is still concerned for what the demon said, and as it would turn out, rightfully so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the sex toy out of her snatch, she lets it fall to the floor as she gets to her feet. With the shower still going, she holds out a hand and starts to chant. A small red glowing sphere with red electricity around it appears in front of her and expands, opening a portal to the demon realm. On the other side of the portal stood a lone structure. The structure was fairly big and heavily ornamented with markings, flags, and decorations that sort of reminded Sarah of how royalty or someone with a lot of money would. The large fancy building was not the only thing visible. In front of the building there is a large courtyard and a figure standing there looking at them. Hellen steps through the portal and approaches the figure. The figure turned out to be a fairly tall male demon. He has black hair and eyes, light gray skin, and was very good looking. He had been practicing with a large sword that he was holding before the portal appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: I take it this isn't a business call\", the demon says, looking at the naked Hellen approach him.<br>\r\nHellen: Nope. Though I do have a problem that I want you to fix.<br>\r\n???: I see. Alright. Let me put this up before I help solve your problem\", he sheathes the sword and puts it by his front door and walks back over to Hellen.<br>\r\nHellen: Let me introduce you\", she says, slapping the part of her leg next to her crotch, \"this is Ragnar, a childhood friend of mine and of the family. That makes him the son of a very powerful demon clan here that has close ties with mine\".<br>\r\nRagnar looks at her, then at her crotch, \"tormenting some human again are we?\"<br>\r\nHellen: Yes. Well sort of. She is one of my servants after all.<br>\r\nRagnar: When you say she.....<br>\r\nHellen: She is a girl, I did not change her gender.<br>\r\nRagnar: Ah. Well that would be a first then.<br>\r\nHellen: Very funny. Anyway, the reason I'm here is to finish this one's punishment.<br>\r\nRagnar: Got it. Tell me, what did this one do?<br>\r\nThis causes her to tense up a bit,\" well......nothing really.....She kind of got in the way between me and one of my servants so I had no choice\"<br>\r\nRagnar gets a concerned look on his face, \"If that's true then you have to be really careful not to go too far....\"<br>\r\n\" I know I know!\", she responds, \"She was just putting up too much resistance so I had no other choice.....and then I decided to take advantage of this.....but don't worry. I was going to change her back after this, I promise\". Ragnar smiles, \"good. As long as you don't overdo it then every things fine\". Taking a few steps towards her, \"let's take care of your problem\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling down his pants reveals that Ragnar was packing. Hellen falls to her knees and takes his way too large penis in her hands before putting her mouth around the tip. Sucking him off and licking his staff, he releases an absurd amount of cum in her mouth. With her cheeks puffed out, she swallows it all. Lifting her up, Ragnar flips her around and grabs and lifts her hips. Her wet folds spread open as he enters her. She lets out a loud pleasured yell as she is spread open by his massive demon cock. Grabbing her hips, he then pumps in and out of her before lifting her up. Holding her in front of him, he continues thrusting, a small visible bulge appears in her stomach every time he thrusts. Pushing her down on his dick, he cums inside her, releasing an inhuman amount and causing her stomach to inflate with the shear amount that he released. Pulling her off of his member, cum stats to squirt out of her pussy and he places her on the ground. She stays there, on all fours as cum continues to flow out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRagnar leaves and comes back with some kind of green drink and hands it to her. She eagerly takes it and downs it in a flash. Getting to her feet, \"Ahhhh, that's better\", she says, handing him the cup, \"I see your still good at making recovery potions\". \"Well yeah, Ragnar replies, \"our clan has always been good at it\".<br>\r\nHellen: That is true. Well.....I would love to stay, maybe even go another round, but I need to get going\". She then heads towards the still open portal back to her place. Ragnar turns and says, \"yeah, well come back anytime. And hurry up and change that human back. The quicker the better\". The demoness raises a hand in response as she steps through the portal and back into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the shower still going, she closes the portal and cleans herself up. Stepping out of the shower, she looks in the mirror and turns around. Bending over, she faces her butt towards it, and for Sarah, everything was upside down, though she can clearly see the demon's butt. Hellen slaps her ass then spreads her checks, \"Now Sarah, hopefully you've learned your lesson from this. But let me warn you, think being my pussy was bad? Keep fight me, keep pissing me off and the next time you'll end up as my ass!' She then gets back in the shower and sits down and spreads her legs, \"time for you to leave\", she says, before placing her hands on her crotch. Her hands glow and she concentrates as her pussy starts to vibrate. Sarah, who could only see the glowing hands in front of her, suddenly feels a pulling sensation then everything goes black. Back to Hellen, her stomach starts to shake and grow. It gets larger and larger before the demon begins to push. Sarah, fully restored, is forced out of her pussy. Getting up and cleaning herself off again, she looks to Sarah, who exhaustinglylooks back, \"now that you've got your body back, clean yourself up and wait. I'll have my maid bring you some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed, Hellen leaves and heads downstairs to find her new succubus maid waiting for her, having already finished her tasks. \"All done?\", Hellen asks. The succubus nods, \"good. I have another task for you. I've changed the other back, and I want you to bring her some clothes Elith\". The maid nods before pausing and giving her a confused look and finally saying something, \".....Elith?\". \"Yes. That is your new name. While you're serving me, that is what you will be called\". Elith begrudgingly accepts it and leaves to do her mistresses task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellen than takes a seat on the sofa in the middle of the room and waits for Zack to get back from school, Sarah to get dressed and come down, and Elith to come back after giving Sarah some clothes, \"well, all I can do is wait. Got a few things to talk to them about and I need them all here to do so.....\".</span></div></div>",

Then, holding it in place with 1 hand, she begins the kneed it with the other, as her eyes begin to glow once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pillow slowly becomes malleable, and once she figures its become soft enough, she uses both hands to mold and shape it. The Sarah pillow becomes a formless mass in the demoness's hands. Through her pressing and pulling of Sarah, she has turned her into a baseball shaped sphere. She tosses the ball into the air a few times, then heads to her kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearing off a place in her kitchen, she slams the ball onto a counter, flattening it. She then starts to kneed the now dough and spread it out until she gets a nice flat circle. Next, she pulls out a pan, and cooks both sides of her. After letting her cool, she rolls her up, puts her on a plate, and drizzles some syrup on her. Getting out a fork and knife, she takes her time devouring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the living room, she sits in 1 of the chairs and lays back, rubbing her stomach. \"She was sooooo good!

What had happened to him happens a lot in this city. He was attacked by 1 of the countless gangs that have overrun the place. Brian lays there, hating himself for not being able to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Its you? How can it be you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised, he looks around the room, and no 1s there, \"what the!? Wh-whos there?\".<br>\r\n???: Over here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks to his left and almost falls off the bed as he sees a strange looking girl next to him.<br>\r\nShe has long white hair, red eyes, is tall, and has large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: What the hell! How did you!?<br>\r\n???: Don't worry about it, I have something important to tell you.<br>\r\nBrian:....Tell....me.....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out a small glowing blue orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: See this? Its reacting to you. That means that you can use it.<br>\r\nBrian: .....What are you talking about? Use it? What is that?......Who are you!?<br>\r\n???: Ah, thats right, I haven't introduced myself. I'm Silstes. Thats all I can say about myself right now. So back to my question. Since this thing is responding to you, that means that you have a certain trait.<br>\r\nBrian: A trait?<br>\r\nSilstes: Yes. So tell me if this sounds correct. You wish to fight those that hurt you and make them pay; however, the group that attacked you alone isn't enough. You want to make ALL of the bad people of this city pay. And you'll do anything to be able to. Does that sound right?<br>\r\nBrian:.....Y-yes.....It does.....<br>\r\nSilstes: Now here is where it gets tricky.....I wasn't expecting some1 like you to be able to use it.....But it will give you the power to fight them.<br>\r\nBrian: Some1 like me?<br>\r\nSilstes: Yeah....you see.....the person who was suppose to get this.....<br>\r\nBrian interrupts her, \"but it will give me power\".<br>\r\nSilstes:.....Yes.....but I think I should tell you.....<br>\r\nBrian: I don't care. If that thing will really let me get my revenge on them, then I'll do it, no matter what the condition is!<br>\r\nSilstes:.....Alright.....I see you've made up your mind. Its yours......Good Luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange girl places the blue gem on the bed. He looks at it, then up at her, but she had vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picks up the gem, and feels something pulsing deep inside him. It fades. Confused, he puts the gem next to him and lays back. \"Did all that really just happen?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors are surprised, they were sure he had a broken leg, yet there was nothing wrong with it. Dismissing it as a mistake, they release him later that day. After getting home, he goes to bed for the night......</span></div></div>",

But he suddenly stops. Then looks back at the mirror. He rubs his eyes, \"n-no, that cant be right.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was. What was staring back at him was a girl with long brown hair, brown eyes, slightly taller than a girl her age, and has average breasts. He looks at his chest, and sure enough, there are 2 mounds sticking out from his shirt. She looks back and forth from the mirror and her chest, then screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: I'm a girl!? How!?<br>\r\n???: That was the condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks to her right and once again, Silstes had appeared out of nowhere.<br>\r\nSilstes: I did try to tell you. Only girls can use the power of the gem I gave you. Since your not a girl, it turned you into 1\", she puts her face right in front of hers and looks her over, \"hmmmm.....not bad. I didn't think you would look so good as a girl!\".<br>\r\nBrian: The gem did this?<br>\r\nSistes: Yes, but don't worry. Your not stuck like that. You'll change back, eventually. The transformation from guy to girl and vice versa is random at first, and given enough time, you'll be able to do it on your own.<br>\r\nBrian:.....Ok.....I think I understand. At least I can change back.....But I thought that gem was suppose to make me strong? I don't feel any stronger.<br>\r\nSilstes: Thats because you don't have it on you. Being in contact with the gem will make your female self stronger, but to bring out all of its abilities, you have to transform.<br>\r\nBrian: T-transform.....<br>\r\nSilstes: Yeah, you know, like all of those shows that are on your TV.<br>\r\nBrian:.....great.....<br>\r\nSilstes: Oh, and a little advice, you should go shopping for some female clothes, and don't get too excited, cause that will change you as well. Oh! And you need to come up with a name for yourself as well! With that said, I have some things to take care of!

Is this how its suppose to be used?\". Touching it, she sees that there is a thin clear glass square over it, she lifts the side thats not connected to the watch, and it's screen changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA question mark was on the screen, and she knew what she had to do. Pressing the screen with 1 finger, a black light erupts from the watch and envelops the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she regains her senses, she finds herself transformed again, but not like she expected. She had shrunk a bit, her breasts were smaller, her eyes were now black and her hair was now short and black. She was wearing a tight black top with tight black shorts with a pair of gloves with her fingers through and small black shoes. Yet despite this, she felt stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: What happened this time? I've become a different girl? But....I feel like there is no way that these punks can beat me.</span></div></div>",

Next to her bag was  smaller one. It was primarily white with blue lining the outside and a large decoration in blue that looked like a wing in the center. It had one flap that covered most of the body of the bag with a strap to keep it in place and a hook in the back to connect to a belt or pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wearing her female clothes that she changed into before transforming, she tries to change back into a guy. Unlike the last time; however, she finds that she can't transform back into her male self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: Whats going on?.....Oh.....wait......Is it because of the fight right now? That strange woman did say that it was hard to transform back and forth at first. Maybe I'm still too worked up right now.....Guess I'm stuck as a girl for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she grabs her bag and the smaller one. She notices that there is something inside. Loosening the strap, she opens it and sees what looks like a card inside. She takes it and looks at it. On the back side, the card was black with gold lining and a gold colored wing in the center. Flipping it to the other side, she sees that it was a portrait of the petite girl that she had just transformed into. Though there were still question marks at the bottom of the card. \"And what is with this? Why did this bag appear and this card.....I don't get it. This is the girl that i turned into when I transformed, but....what am I supposed to do with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places the card back into the small bag, closes it, and puts it on her hip, Brian then remembers something else that Silstes had told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: .....Maybe I should come up with a name for myself now.....But....what should I call my girl form?</span></div></div>",

Now a safe distance away, she presses the picture of Raven and Heather is once again enveloped in that black light, leaving Heather in the petite body of Raven. She then sneaks back over and stays low, she looks in, to see if anything has changed as she prepares to launch her plan of attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack inside the fast food place, it looks like the robbers are finishing up, the lady behind the counter is putting the last of their money into a bag from their registers as the one holding the bag yells at her to hurry up while waving his gun in the frightened girls face. \"Bastards\", Raven thinks, \"...still, looks like its going just as planned...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thug with the bag zips it up as the cashier puts the last of the money in the bag. With their misdeed done, they head towards the entrance to the restaurant. They throw the doors open, confident that they were going to get away with their robbery, when Raven makes her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*From the viewpoint of the people still in the building*<br>\r\nRelieved that the robbers are only leaving with the money, and that no one is hurt; they watch as the robbers step through the open doorway. Suddenly, a small shadow emerges from the right of the doorway and grabs the two men. They catch a glimpse of what the shadowy figure looks like and a chill goes down every single persons spines. The figure resembled a petite girl in black with a wide creepy smile on her face, and she seemed to be laughing..... The men, and some of the people in the restaurant, screamed as the mysterious creature dragged them back under the window from which it emerged. And what would happen next would haunt their dreams for many weeks to come. Screams, thuds, crunching noises, and a bit of blood splashing the bottom of the window, then, nothing, just silence. It would be several minutes before one of them would cautiously venture over to the still open doors and window. He very slowly peeked through the door and looked to his right, what he saw was the two men, unconscious and beaten up, the money filled bag right next to them and the scary shadowy girl was nowhere to be seen.</span></div></div>",

She was tired and decided that it was time to head home and take a little break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her house, she doesn't bother transforming back to her original male self because she knows that her parents are gone, and will be gone for several more days on business and her sister, who attends college, rarely comes home during the weekdays. So she should have the entire house to herself for quite some time. Grabbing a drink, she sits down on the sofa in her living room and turns on the TV, and as she expected, what just happened at the burger place is being covered. She half pays attention, as the reporters there are interviewing the people who were held at gunpoint while they robbed the place. However, she does a spit take as she hears how they were explaining her to the press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerson 1: I don't know, didn't really get a look at it. Some kind of small girl? Maybe? It was creepy looking though.<br>\r\nPerson 2: You know, those horror movies? It was like that! Nearly scared me to death!<br>\r\nPerson 3: It wasn't human I tell ya!

Getting out of bed, she stretches before heading to her bathroom. \"Guess I should take a quick shower, \" she says to herself, \"after all that action, I could probably use one\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the bottom of her shirt, she begins to pull it off when she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and pauses. Her face turned bright red, she had forgotten that she was a girl right now. \"C-calm down....it...it's still my body.....\". She tells herself over and over again as she takes off her shirt and sets it aside, unzips her skirt and lets it fall to the floor, and then the real challenge is next. It wasn't easy for her to buy and wear girls underwear, but the clerk at the store was very forceful in her selection of clothes for her, in other words, she has a lot of skirts, so she can't exactly wear boxers, would look weird if anyone saw and would bring a lot of unwanted attention towards her. That and her breasts were of decent size, so she couldn't go bra less, too much bouncing would stand out and get in the way, among other things. Unhooking her bra, she puts it with her other clothes and finally keeps her eyes open, finally getting a good look at her own breasts. Her face gets even redder as she cautiously probes one of her bare breasts and gives it a tight squeeze, she flinches and gasps as a shock of pleasure runs through her body. \"M-man, these things are sensitive\". Even though she is enjoying feeling herself up, she pauses, and looks down at her still covered groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeather grabs the front of her panties and pulls it forward with one hand. Yup, there is nothing there, well, nothing that she was use to seeing. It was smooth, flat, and a valley was the only feature of the landscape. Her free hand slides down her body and brushes against the new feature and she received an even stronger jolt than when she fondled her breast. Quickly pulling down and stepping out of the panties, she puts it with her other clothes and looks at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a hand on her head, she starts talking to herself, \"hmm....I'm not that much smaller, am I. Breasts, pretty good size....\", she puts her hands on her hips and butt as she turns around and sticks it out, \"nice butt too\". She gives her backside several pokes and squeezes before spreading the cheeks open. Looking at her anus and pussy through the reflection causes her to blush again, \"I-I guess I do have a girl's body now, don't I\". Then something strange happens, something that she doesn't recognize or has ever happened to her before. Putting a hand between her legs, she gets another surprise, \"I'm wet....?....! Don't tell me I'm turned on right now!?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no denying the state of arousal that she was in, or had been for a while now. The rock hard nipples, the intense feeling of heat throughout her body, and now this. The burning feeling kept rising and she could no longer deny the desire that is overtaking her and her new body. Her hand heads back down south and she starts to rub her new equipment while the other hand plays with her breasts. The immense pleasure that she is feeling causes her to fall to her knees as a finger enters her vagina. This causes her to scream out she cums just from that. Falling to the floor, panting heavily, she lays there for several minutes before she recovers enough to get back up. After cleaning the floor, she turns on the shower and gets in, her head lowered and a very bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out and drying off, she throws on a new set of clothes and heads downstairs, after grabbing some food, she goes back to her room, does her homework for the next day, as it would be Monday, and then goes to bed, though it takes her a while to fall asleep as she was still embarrassed for what she had done in the bathroom and giving in to those new sensations and emotions.</span></div></div>",

The morning silence was broken by the sounds of an alarm going off. A hand suddenly reaches out from under some covers and turns it off. Slowly sitting up, Heather lazily rubs one of her eyes before getting out of bed. Grabbing a change of clothes, she starts to head to the bathroom, but stops herself. Remembering what happened yesterday, she realizes something, \"almost screwed myself over there. Need to change back into a guy, if I go into there as I am now, might not be able to change back. Can't exactly go to school as a girl....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on the edge of her bed, she closes her eyes and takes a couple deep breaths before trying to change genders. She feels the magic surge through her body and she successfully becomes Brian again. He then goes puts away the female clothes that he had planned to change into and grabbed a male set instead. After a quick shower, he gets something to eat and then makes his way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a 10 minute walk, he is now at the front of his High School, Marina High, named after the area that they live in which is near the ocean and other water landmarks. He walks into the building and heads to his first class. Needless to say, what happened at the restaurant is all anybody is talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking his seat, his friends come up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle: Short black hair and blue eyes, tall, pretty fit, and on the soccer team. Brian has known him since Middle School.<br>\r\nNathan: Light brown hair and green eyes. Average height and not in any sports clubs, though he does go to arcades and such places a lot. They became friends in High School.<br>\r\nKaren: Short red hair and green eyes. On the girls basketball team, average height, chest a little on the small side. Karen and Brian are childhood friends.<br>\r\nSarah: Long blond hair and blue eyes. Swimming team, a little above average in height, large breasts, a beauty. Karen's friend, so a friend of a friend.<br>\r\nAmy: Medium length brown hair and brown eyes. Helps at library from time to time, average height, large breasts, shy. Same as Sarah to Brian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian and Karen's connection to each other brought this group of students together as friends in High School.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren: About time you got here Brian, running a little late today, huh? Your usually on time for just about everything.<br>\r\nBrian: Yeah, guess I was just running a little slow today.<br>\r\nKyle: Never mind that, did you see what happened yesterday?<br>\r\nBrian:....Yesterday...?<br>\r\nNathan: At the restaurant, the one that was robbed, you must of heard about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe purposely hesitates for a second before answering, \"....oh, right. You must be talking about that mysterious figure that took out the robbers\".<br>\r\nKyle: Yeah, her. A lot of the rumors are saying that it was a small girl that stopped them.<br>\r\nSarah: Or some kind of monster.<br>\r\nBrian:....monster.....<br>\r\nKaren: Yeah right, monster.<br>\r\nAmy: E-everyone seems to be divided on this. Some say small girl, others monster. But monster is unlikely as they just don't exist, but a little girl couldn't have taken out two full grown men. This is why this is so heavily debated.<br>\r\nKaren: As the smart girl says, there has to be some logical reason behind this.<br>\r\nKyle: Why? Can't it be something strange or unusual!<br>\r\nKaren: Because supernatural, magic, monsters, whatever you call it is not real!<br>\r\nKyle: And that's your problem! You can't just explain everything away so easily! There are plenty of mysteries and questions still out there that can't be solved!<br>\r\nNathan: And there they go. No stopping them now.<br>\r\nBrian/Sarah/Amy: Yep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes of their arguing and talking about what happens, class starts and the school day really begins.....</span></div></div>",

PLEASE COLLECT WHAT YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU AND HEAD HOME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren:.....What?\", she says, confused, just like everyone else.<br>\r\nKyle gets up and begins to pack up the lunch he bought, \"well, guess the day's ending early, not that I'm complaining\".<br>\r\nAmy: This is strange.

Nothing about this is odd to you!?\", shes says, getting irritated, again.<br>\r\nAlso getting annoyed, again, Kyle retorts, \"OF COURSE I DO! But worrying about it won't change anything! So I'm going home, like they said!\".<br>\r\nNathan: And there they go.<br>\r\nBut Brian goes up to them, an unusual move for him, and puts a hand on both of them, \"Well, whatever the reason is, it must be important if they cancelled classes, we should probably leave\".<br>\r\nEveryone looks at him, surprised that he actually tried to stop them. Both Kyle and Karen agreed, saying that he was right and they both go back to cleaning up.<br>\r\nTaking a few steps toward Brian, Nathan says, \"wow, didn't think anyone could stop those two\".<br>\r\nSarah: Yeah, good job. So lets hurry up so we can leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey take care of whats left of their lunches then head into the building where they grab their things before making for the front of the school. They then say their goodbyes and go their separate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome distance from the school, and on his own now, Karen lives next to him so they sometimes go home together, he picks up the pace to his house. This is because he knew that only a few things could cause a school to close, and so he was worried about what it could be, and if he might be needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing open the door, he goes upstairs and puts his school stuff away, he then proceeds to turn on the TV to see if there is anything on why the school closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReporter: AND NOW AN UPDATE ON THE SITUATION HAPPENING At DOLPHIN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

AS FAR AS WE KNOW, NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT. THE REASON FOR THEIR ATTACK IS CURRENTLY UNKNOWN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns off the TV and looks at the watch, \"time to go\". He begins to glow and then some ballooning breasts, wider hips, and a slight loss of height later and Heather is back. Throwing off her male clothes, she pulls up a fresh pair of panties, covers her breasts with a new bra, zips up a skirt around her waist, and buttons up a shirt on her chest and heads out the front door towards the middle school.</span></div></div>",

As she gets closer to the school, she ducks away and makes her way to the roof of a nearby building to get a good look at whats happening. The police have surrounded the school and there is a good amount of distance between them and the school, most likely by the demands of the people inside. There are news crews all over the place covering the story and there is a large crowd of people watching. But something catches her attention. In the crowd of people she spots Karen, \"What is she doing here?\", she says, then pauses, noticing that her face is filled with fear and worry, \"no...it can't be....\". Karen has a little sister who attends Dolphin High, Katie, and she must be one of the hostages. \"Well, guess that just makes this personal then. So...how do I do this.....\", she says, trying to find someway to get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Marina High, which sits near the edge of the city she lives in, Dolphin Middle is near the heart of the city, that means a lot of tall buildings surround the school. After several minutes of stealthily staking out the school, she decides that the best course of action would be to go through the back. This is because there is a small park behind the school for the students during breaks, lunch, and other activities. But to get there, she will have to get by the news, police, and the bystanders. Secluding herself in an alleyway where no one could see, she flips open the watch and becomes Raven. Climbing up one of the walls to get to the rooftop, she then proceeds to jump from building to building until she is near the back of the school. Because the back of the school is quite a large park, there are only a few officers guarding this area, so she backs up until she hits the edge of the building that she was on and then sprints at full speed, which is quite fast, and jumps over the road, the officers, and a good ways into the park before landing. She immediately heads for some trees and jumps to the top branches and looks around, all clear. Keeping to the trees, bushes, and off the path as best she can, she gets as close as she can to the back of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she can't get any closer. The police watching the back were bad enough, one of the thugs is at the back door, watching from the inside for anyone approaching. And if that wasn't bad enough, she knew from that that they were most likely using the security cameras to watch everything inside the building. Even if she could get inside, they would spot her immediately and who knows what they would do to the hostages. Even with all her power, it looked like she was powerless, \"is there nothing I can do?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if responding to Raven's frustration, the watch begins to glow.....</span></div></div>",

Surprised by this, her finger slowly heads towards the question mark. She hesitates, then presses it. Unlike with her transformation into Raven, this light green light gives off a gentle and calm aura as it envelopes her. The light fades and she opens her eyes. At first, she looks around, confused, \"wha...did I get taller?\". Looking down at her body, her eyes get larger as she notices the two melons that are attached to her chest. She grabs them, \"my boobs got bigger!?\", she almost screams, before remembering what was happening around her. After calming herself down by taking several deep breaths, she continues to check out her new body. Putting her hands onto her hips and butt, \"large breasts, wide hips and a bigger butt. Definitely more of an hour glass figure. Taller too\", taking her hands off of her body, she looks at what she is wearing. A nearly body tight green dress that has a woodland/forest color and design to it. She was also wearing a pair of short brown pants underneath as the dress lightly parted at the lower half of her body. she had a pair of brown and green gloves and shoes on to match said dress. Wondering why she was dressed like this, it suddenly hits her and her hands move to her head. A few strands of hair gets pulled in front of her vision and she now knows that she has long blond hair, which helps to back up what she suspects as her hands reach the side of her head. And as she thought, her ears were long and pointed towards the end. Lowering her hands and blinking a few times, \"...yup. I'm an Elf\". It was then that one of her hands brushes up against something on the ground next to her. Glancing at it, she sees that a bow, with a similar design as her clothing, was laying next to her. Picking up, \"what? A bow? I guess it does sort of go with how I now look\", she looks around her some more, \"but I don't see any arrows....how am I suppose to use this thing? And I also have this\", she says reaching down to the left side of her waist and removing a dagger that was there. The dagger too had a similar design as the bow and clothes. Unsheathing it and looking at the short sharp blade, she puts it back into its sheath and on her side then grabs the bow and stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I think I sort of get what this new girl can do. Clearly meant for range. But how is she suppose to help me here? I still can't get to the school, not with the police and that guard watching\". Then something else happened, the watch released a quick flash of light green and the Elf jolts. She places a hand on her head as words begin to flood her mind, \"what is this, no, what language is this? And why do I understand it!?\". The jumbled words and letters stop entering her body and begin to form sentences. No, that's not it, these aren't normal sentences. She realizes what this strange language is and what she just learned. This must be an Elven language and she just learned some Elven magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiecing the spells together, she finds that she learned at least 5 different spells. That was when her brain went into action, coming up with a plan to get her inside, \"yes. That will work. This new Elf girl can get me inside\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter coming up with and going over the plan several times, she executes it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding straight, she takes in a deep breath and begins to chant one of the spells in the Elf language. Her beautiful, almost singing voice echoes across the nearby area as a light reddish pink glow/mist covers the area and seeps under the back door, affecting the officers and the lookout before they could do anything. They all slouch over, the lookout leaning against a wall, with dazed expressions as she steps out of cover. Taking a few quick looks around, it would seem that no alarm has been raised by her spell casting. \"Good, looks like that mass confusion spell worked. They shouldn't really remember what happened or what I look like after it wears off\". She then jumps up a tree that was next to the school and then onto the roof of the building. \"So far so good\", she says to herself, making sure she stays low, \"I've made it to the roof, but I can't just walk in. If I do, the security room will spot me. So it's time for part two of my plan.....\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking out her knife, she stabs it into the roof, and it easily goes through, \"like I thought, this is no normal knife. This thing should let me cut my way to the classroom below\". With both hands on the hilt of the blade, she pushes it and carves a hole in the room. She is very careful though, removing debris as she goes, trying not to make any noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lifts the last of the cut away section and places is beside her, she is surprised that this only took a few minutes, she was expecting it to take much longer, \"this really is a good knife\", she says, sheathing it and the getting ready to enter the hole. After getting inside, and being careful with her footing, she grabs one of the many square tiles that make up the ceiling of the classroom and slowly lifts it up, getting a quick peek inside.......and......nothing, no ones there. Pushing the panel to the side, she jumps down the opening she made and silently lands in the middle of the classroom that sits above the security room, her goal. Then, she hears something, footsteps. Looks like there are patrols roaming throughout the school, and one is passing by the room that she is in. Unfortunately for her, there is a window near the door to the room. Thinking quickly, she puts herself against the wall below the window and holds her breath. The footsteps get closer and stop right next to her. As her heartbeat skyrockets, she is relieved as the man starts to walk away, but she does not move until she can no longer hear him. With a sigh of relief, she goes back to her plan to infiltrate the security room. Picking the corner of the room opposite of where the door is, she takes out her knife once more and thrusts it into the ground, though much more carefully this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes of digging and cutting, she makes a large enough hole for her to slip through. She ends up landing on top of a solid structure, but she was expecting this, \"Good, the security room is suppose to be surrounded by concrete and should be sound proof. This is where things get a little more difficult\". Sticking to the same corner where she fell from, she puts the point of the knife on the concrete and while kneeling, buts both hands on the handle and begins to rotate it back and forth with both hands, like she was trying to start a fire. The reason for this was to make a small hole in the concrete in the corner of the room as far from the man in the security room and the screens as possible. She is hoping that the hole will not make enough light to give her away. The knife suddenly drops as the tip breaches the room. She pauses and listens, using her large ears for any sign of movement in the room below. After not hearing anything, she makes the hole a little bit bigger, about the size of a finger, and puts the knife aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down, the Elf takes a few deep breaths to calm herself and begins to chant a new spell. She focuses on the hole that she made and the magic, this time a faint blueish green glow, flows into the hole and floods the room beneath her. Finishing her chant, she listens again, and hears what sounds like someone slumping over. She takes this as a sign that her spell worked and grabs her knife, proceeding to then enlarging the hole so she can get inside. Hopping down into the room, she sees that there was indeed only one person in the room, he was in a chair, watching multiple screens, or rather, he was, until her Elven magic put him to sleep. Walking up to him, she tries to move him, but finds it difficult, \"hng....ung....ha..ha..ha...so...heavy. This Elf is no where near as strong as Raven\". After managing to scoot him far enough away form the monitors, she takes a look at them herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Looks like I'm dealing with a pretty large group here. One at the back door, one at the front. Four patrolling the hall, one outside this room and the one I put to sleep. Lets see.....Aha! Found them, looks like they are being held in the gym at the back of the school. And yeah, they have Katie, great, and about 50 others. Four more are guarding the ways into the gym from the inside, and there are two more by the hostages. It looks like that one there is the leader of this group. So, how do I do this....wait, whats that?\", the Elf says, noticing that there are a few more men around another room. \"That's the principals office! Why are they there? One is guarding the door while two more are in the room, one on his computer.....This looks important.....Though it looks like there are 17 men in total, with guns and body armor, well prepared group.....why are they here?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she must make a choice. Focus on the hostages, take them down, see what they are doing in the Principal's office, she needs to make up her mind and come up with a plan.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the security room under her control, she decides to find out why they are in the Principal's office. And that means that she has to get pass the guard on the other side of the door as well as the patrols. After spending some time typing away and watching the monitors, she comes up with a plan to get her there. \"First, the guard, no patrol is near enough to react\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First things first\", she says, \".....how do I do this?\". She opens the cover on the watch that has changed color to mach her new look, and just sees what she usually does when she has transformed, an image of her current self that if she presses, will cause her to change back into Heather. She gets an idea, putting a finger on the screen, instead of pushing it in, she slides her finger across the screen and the image moves with it. She slides the Elf picture off screen and the Raven image is now there, \"So that's how it works, good thing I don't have to go back to normal before changing between girls.....though normal is still a girl......whatever!\", she says, pressing the button and transforming into Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guesses it's because she is going from one transformed state to the other, but for whatever reason, she is more aware of her changing body. Her massive breasts deflate and shrink to a much smaller size, her butt loses padding as her overall size shrinks. Her hair turns jet black as it gets shorter, along with the rest of her body and  her dress becomes the top as the shorts don't really change much. Raven just stands there, face flushed as she says, \".....wow.....that felt amazing.....\". Recovering, she sets her plan into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding next to the door, she unlocks it and knocks. The man outside opens it and takes a few steps inside, \"what\", he says, before Raven grabs him and pulls him to the side, knocking him out with one swift blow. \"Yeah.....good thing I became Raven for this part. That was too easy\". Tossing him to the side. She closes the door and checks the monitors, no one heard anything. \"Good. So far so good\", she says, opening the watch and changing the image back to the yet to be named Elf. \"Well, I still don't have a name for you, not that its been that long.....But a name can wait! You are more stealthy than Raven so it's back to you!\", the small girl says, pressing the button and becoming the Elf again. And just like before, she stands there for a few seconds, the transformation from a petite to well endowed girl having a pleasuring effect on her body. After checking the monitors one last time, she turns off the cameras so that she isn't recorded on tape after this is over, and opens the door and heads out into the main body of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would probably be best to take out every single person here. Guess I'll start with the patrols\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what the monitors showed, the first of the four on patrol should be passing the security room soon. She immediately jumps upward and waits, hiding near the door. The man comes shortly after, and as soon as he passed underneath her, she drops, landing on his head and knocking him out. Throwing him into the security room, she continues her hunt, staying high as she head towards the next target. The next one is also easy, as he has his back to her as she approaches him. Getting right behind him, she takes out her knife, raises it, and hits his head hard with the hilt. He falls to the floor as she sheaths it, \"not going to get blood on my hands with the likes of you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little further and she is now at the center of the school, where the cafeteria is. She can see the final two men on patrol here, on opposite ends of the area. Waiting until they can't see each other, she strikes the closest target. Taking out her bow, she gets ready to use it, thinking she knows why she doesn't have any arrows. Leaping towards him, he manages to let out a surprised sound as she strikes the side of his head with the bow. Quickly, she looks towards the other man, and as she feared, he heard his cry. As he aims his rifle at her, she is already on her feat and facing him. Grabbing the string of the bow, the Elf pulls it back and an arrow appears out of thin air, \"as I thought\", she thinks as she fires the arrow at the guy. The arrow silently flies through the air and strikes his gun. It shatters on contact and falls to the ground. He looks at it in stunned silence before looking at her. She was on him in a flash as she leaps across the cafeteria and her feet were the last things he saw before everything went black. She hides both unconscious men and goes picks up her arrow, which disappears after that, \"that's a bit of a relief, the arrows will disappear if I touch them, hopefully they will also disappear on their own\". She then heads to the back door of the school. Glancing around the corner, she sees that he is still in a dazed state and leaning against the wall. \"Well, I don't have to worry about security or being spotted so....\". She simply walks over to him and drags him away from the door before knocking him out. \"Now to the front of the building\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta get him to come to me. Don't want the police, news, or anyone out there seeing me\". Carefully opening the door to a nearby classroom, she enters. \"Thankfully these people were smart enough to close the blinds to all the windows\". She transforms back into Raven and opens the door to the hallway. She knocks on the side of the wall multiple times to get his attention and draw him towards her. It works and he heads towards the room that she was in. Once he was close enough, she grabs him and drags him into the room. Exiting the room, she transforms back into the Elf and makes her way towards the principals office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One guard outside and two inside. Going to have to do this careful-wait, whats that\"?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one on the computer, someone begins to talk through the radio he has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Hows it going over there? We can't keep this up for too long!<br>\r\nThug: I know. But it's like I've said, I've gone through their files multiple times! I can't find the target!<br>\r\n???: And I'm telling you that it has to be there! This is the only Middle School for miles! It has to be here! Look again! We can't leave until we find the troublemaker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElf Girl: So they are looking for something. And they must be planning on using the hostages to get out of here. Time to see what is so important that they would attack a school.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven makes another appearance as she decides that it would probably be best to blitz them as the principals office isn't like the soundproof security room, that and she could hear them from where she is, even though the door to the room is closed. Staying low, she manages to get to the side of the guard and then rushes him. Tackling his legs, he falls with a loud thud and one swift hit to his head knocks him out. The man on the computer stands up as they both look at the door, hearing the loud thud. But Raven was too fast for them, she smashes the door and is on them in a flash, slamming their heads together. They crumple to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven sits in the chair and looks at the principal's computer and gets a shock, \"what? Their looking at the student roster. And only at the female students.....Why?\". She then remembers what She had overheard, \"so they are looking for someone.....A troublemaker. Someone who got in their way, most likely recently. And that person is a student here.....and a girl.....!!!!! THOSE BASTARDS!\". Raven suddenly looks really mad as she shouts this. It would seem that she figured out their objective. It was her. The group of people she stopped in the alleyway when she first transformed weren't arrested, she just beat them up and saved the girl. They must have reported what happened to their boss and they came here looking to find her to most likely pay her back for what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.....these assholes came for revenge. They came to this school, attacked it, took it over, and took hostages to find me for stopping one of their crimes.....Putting all these people in danger for such a petty reason. I guess this is the kind of city we live in, can't do anything without fear of repercussions. But still.....a Middle School? They thought that I was a Middle Schooler......\". Even Raven doesn't understand why this is making her so mad, but it still does and she cant wait to beat up the last few people in the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven becomes the Elf and for some reason, her anger dissipates, \"huh, being mistaken as a middle school student no longer bothers me.....strange.....\". She heads towards the gym and waits outside one of the doors, \"any second now\", she says, then the power to the entire school goes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as planned\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When the Elf turned off the cameras in the security room, she also set a timer on said system that would shut down the power to the entire school after a set amount of time. And as she expected, the sudden darkness caused panic in the gymnasium. From the other side of the door, she heard screams, bangs, and other loud noises, perfect for slipping in unnoticed. Then, taking a deep breath, she closes both eyes and starts to say words in the Elven language she had just learned and touches both of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment, she recalls what the gym looks like, she is in her first year of High School so she just left this very middle school. It was a pretty standard gym. A large area in the middle for mostly basketball and other sports and two sets of bleachers on either side with the changing rooms on either side of the floor and four doors in the corners of the large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her dagger with one hand, she puts the other on the door and slowly pulls it open. Silently sliding inside, the guard on the other side of the door turns just as the handle hits the side of the head, he falls to the floor, unconscious. Dragging the body behind the bleachers, she then jumps up and grabs the side of the bleachers and surveys the scene. What she had done outside was cast a kind of self enhancement spell that lets her see in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out that she was right about that one guy being the leader, he was shouting orders at the other guy near him and the remaining three guards while yelling over his radio at who she thinks is the sleeping guy in the security room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Answer me I said! Dammit! Why won't he respond!<br>\r\nThug: Maybe he got taken out?<br>\r\nLeader: No, not possible. He is in a sealed room with a guard outside. He would have radioed us if anything was wrong. This radio must me broken or something.<br>\r\nThug: Then why did the power go out?<br>\r\nLeader: The cops probably cut the power, we should be ready in case they try anything stupid. Hey! Everyone here! Get over here now, use the hostages as shields!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the chance the elf was waiting for. She quickly and quietly makes her way to the other side of the bleachers that she was on. Looking down, she sees the guard there making his way to the center of the gym. She attacked. All she had to do was jump from the height that she was at and land on him. Jumping back up to the bleachers, she heads for the center of them and thinks of a plan to deal with the remaining four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guards reach the leader, and he knows instantly that something is wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Where are the other guys?\". They shake their heads, \"damn. Looks like we got trouble\". He shoots his pistol in the air and orders the faculty and students to shut up or he will shoot them. \"Now that we have some peace and quiet, lets see if we can find our little party crasher\". He pulls out a flashlight and starts to scan the stadium, but our Elf was ready for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the bow from her back, a new arrow appears as she aims at the leader. Just as she was about to fire, the light finds her, but the stunned audience below only get about a second or two of seeing an Elf with a bow before an arrow hits the flashlight, making the gym pitch black once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThug: What the hell was that!?<br>\r\nLeader: I don't know and I don't care! Fire you idiots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guards from the doors aim there rifles in her direction and fire. She jumps as the bullets land at where she just was. As she is flying through the air, she quickly fires off two more arrows which hits and destroys both guns. She silently lands on the other side of the gym in the middle of the bleachers there. Panic sets in among the kidnappers as the shattered guns fall to the floor and the assailant vanishes. The leader gets pissed off, firing his gun into the air again, he demands that she show herself or he'll shoot a hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, this was what she had hoped they would do. Opening the watch, She swipes the screen until Raven appears and leans towards the last four kidnappers. Pressing the screen, she jumps at the men as she the black light envelops her. This catches them off guard and Raven lands right int he center of them. Grabbing one of them, she throws him into the bleaches and kicks another. The other thug pulls out and pistol and points it at her, but she grabs it and punches him in the gut. That leaves the leader, who had taken a few steps back. He was already pointing his gun at her and she sidesteps just as he pulls the trigger. The leader loses sight of her after this and she melds into the darkness as he freaks out, frantically pointing his gun in every direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Wh-where are you!? Show yourself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here\", Raven says, appearing behind him. He yells as she grabs him and pulls him away from the hostages who hear a loud crashing sound, followed by silence, then a flash of green. The bindings around the hands on one of the hostages gets cut off, freeing them, \"help the others\", a voice says, then they hear a door open and close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elf, who had transformed back from Raven to use her dagger to free one of the hostages, leaves the room. She heads back to the security room and breathes a sigh of relief. I can't believe that worked! I got them all and no one was hurt! Well, except for the kidnappers, but fuck them!\". Getting back on the security system, she restores the power and jumps back up through the holes she had made until she was back on the roof. Looking over the back of the school, she notices that her confusion spell is starting to wear off as the officers start to grab and shack their heads. \"Better get out of here\", she says, transforming back into Raven and jumping into the forest. She makes her way out without being spotted and makes it back to the rooftops that surround the area. Getting one last look at the school, she sees that the hostages have started to leave the school and the police were rushing inside. With a quick smile, she leaves the scene, heading back to her house.</span></div></div>",

Checking from the roof of a house, she makes sure it's clear and jumps down and walks over to her front door. Unlocking and opening the door, she enters and heads to her room upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. All of that fighting, sneaking around, and making holes has left me pretty dirty. Guess I should take a quick shower\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the room and into the other, she opens the watch to change back...but pauses. Raven gets an idea, \"...maybe I could...\". She closes the watch and  her other hand moves to the straps of the watch. Undoing the strap that holds the transforming watch to her arm, she hesitates for a moment, then removes it. Looking around the bathroom, nothing happens. Putting the watch down by the sink, she looks around again and nothing happens. \"I'm not changing back?\", she says, confused. Looking down at the watch, then at her reflection in the mirror above the double sink, she finds out that she can only transform back and forth with the watch, without it, she will be stuck as Raven until she puts it back on. \"No way.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis opens up so many possibilities. Being able to stay as one of the transformed super girls will let her do so much more, but she is also aware of the problem with that, \"damn. Too bad both of them were seen by people\". She knows that Raven could be easily recognized by some random person or the people that are after her if she wasn't careful, the Elf might be ok....if she could successfully hide the ears. But she'll worry about that later, right now, she just wants to clean herself up. Off comes the shoes and socks. Taking off the gloves and placing them by the watch, she pulls the top off of her petite body, revealing her small breasts. Pushing a few fingers into the small soft mounds, \"ahh!....they may be small, but their still very soft. Letting out a few more moans, she continues to feel herself up until she catches a look at herself in the mirror. Her face goes red again as she sees the image of her groping her breasts. This makes her stop and she quickly pulls down her tight shorts, blushing even more as she sees her exposed lower half. Checking the mirror again, she looks at the completely naked body of Raven, the girl with super strength. Even with her short stature, she still has those female curves. \"I really am pretty small right now. This body and these breasts\", putting both hands on her chest, \"though there is something there at least. I can understand why they would think I was in middle school with this body\". After she said this, she felt a sudden surge of anger, \"what? Why am I so angry again!?\". Calming herself down, she continues to check herself out, \"it's still a nice body, though it would seem that even though I have small breasts\", she turns around and looks behind her at the mirror, placing both hands on her butt, \"this backside is really nice\". Giving her ass a few squeezes, she then looks her body over a few more times before turning on the shower. As soon as she steps into the warm water, the dirt and debris form the day flow down her body and down the drain. \"Geez, I really did need a shower, didn't I?\". Grabbing a bar of soup, she washes her body then turning off the water, she grabs a tower and wraps it around herself. Taking Raven's dirty clothes, she heads to her room and places them on the floor before heading downstairs. Getting a quick drink and a snack, she heads back upstairs and stands over her bed, looking at Raven's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the top, \"now that I'm getting a good look at em, my clothes as Raven don't really cover much\". She puts it down, \"lets see how this works\". Raven puts the watch back on her wrist and switches off the transformation. After the light fades, Heather is standing there, and to her surprise, she is dressed in the clothes she had on before she left for the middle school, \"guess that answers my first question. My clothes aren't actually transforming between girls, I'm getting new clothes every time I switch\". She confirms this when she looks at the bed and Raven's clothes are still there. \"Time for my other question\", she says, opening the watch and transforming back into Raven. Yup, still in a towel. She takes that towel off and throws it away, then she opens the watch and transforms back into Heather. Almost immediately she presses the button and becomes Raven yet again. A quick glace down and she is naked, the towel is where it had landed, and the clothes that she got in that alley when she first transformed into Raven where still on the bed. \"So that answers that. All it means is that I have to be careful with what I'm wearing when I transform between them and that I can change what Raven and the Elf wears. Speaking of the Elf, she needs a name.....\".</span></div></div>",

Sliding the watch to the image of the voluptuous Elf she presses it then the green light appears and fades. Unhooking the bag from her hip, she opens it up and there are now two cards inside. Placing the Raven card on the bed, she then picks up the new card and looks it over. It was nearly identical to the other card, the only difference was that it was green instead of black, the gold lining and markings were now brown, though the wing in the center was a different shade of green. Of course the front had a portrait of the Elf, and just like with Raven, there were question marks below the picture of her, \"yeah, guess that will stay the same until I come up with a name for her. Let's see if we can't figure that out\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill holding the card, she sits on her bed and closes her eyes, \".....focus.....concentrate.....look for a name.....\". The letters and words that appeared shortly after her first transformation into this new form flow back into her mind as she searches for a suitable name for this girl in her native tongue. \"No....not that one....no....almost....not yet....that won't do.....yes....yes! That's the one!\", she yells, opening her eyes and getting off the bed. Holding the card to her face, \"If I'm understanding your language right, your name shall be Adilya. At least that's what I believe it is after translating it into English. It should mean something along the lines of what's right, justice, etc, that and it does fit with what I'm doing here and it sounds like a good name to give to an Elf\". As soon as she finished talking, the question marks at the bottom of the card glow and change into the new name, Adilya, in all caps. Placing the card next to Raven's on the bed, she looks them over, a satisfied smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Hello Hello! I thought that I would pop in and check....up....on.....you.....\". The voice belongs to Silstes, the mysterious girl who had given Brian his powers. Just like in the hospital room, she had appeared out of nowhere. As the two stare at each other, \"Who-who are you!?\", she suddenly yells while pointing a finger at the Elf, \"why is there an Elf here!? One of your kind shouldn't be on this pla.....!!!!\". She pauses when she realizes who it is, \"oh. It's you. Why do you look like that? Didn't you already transform once?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian explains everything that has happened to him since she last saw him in his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up his recollection of recent events, Silstes is now sitting on his bed, holding the cards of Raven and Adilya in her hands, dumbfounded at what she just heard. \"I can't believe it\", she says, \"to think that you would get something so powerful\".<br>\r\nAdilya: something so powerful? Your making it sound like there are more than one of that gem you gave me\".<br>\r\nSilstes sighs, \"it's a bit early, but I guess I can tell you a few things about that gem and whats going on\". Shifting her position on the bed, she continues, \"there are others like yourself that were given gems and received some kind of power form them, though there are only a handful of them. This is because those gems are very tricky to use and make. The process to create one of those gems is painstakingly long and hard. Even the process of finding a person who can pair with a gem can take years or longer. That's why there just aren't that many others like yourself\".<br>\r\nAdilya: There are others.....ok....so why are these gems being made and who is making them? Why are they just handing them out\".<br>\r\nSilstes: Your first and third question have the same answer so I'll start there. Do you remember what I told you in your hospital room?<br>\r\nAdilya: In my hospital room?\". She thinks back, recalling the events that led to her getting her power. The answer hits her, \"wanting to make bad people pay....\".<br>\r\nSilstes: Correct. Only people who have a strong sense of whats right can use a gem. That's why they are made and handed out, the people that can use them will not abuse or misuse the power they receive. As for who is making them. It's an organization that does it. They also help the people who get the gems and monitor whats going on out there. Though that's all I can tell you about them for now. You'll eventually learn more, but that will be later\".<br>\r\nAdilya:.....I see....Ok. I have one last question. Are you like me? Did you get a gem?\".<br>\r\nSilstes:.....yes....I was given my own gem. It's been a few years now. And the reason that I gave you yours was that I agreed to help find the owner of the one I gave you and would help you out from time to time\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilstes gets off the bed, looks at the cards and shakes her head, \"still, I can't believe how strong your power is\". She looks at Brian and sees the confused look on his face as he says, \"how strong my power is? You did say that before. What do you mean?\". Silstes asks for the pouch on her hip that holds the cards. As Brian hands her the bag, she starts, \"when someone is found to have a match with a gem, they are given one and only one power when they activate it. We have seen girls with powers ranging from skills with weapons, such as swords and guns to being able to wield fire or other elements. Then they work on honing their one power and go from there. You on the other hand.....\", pausing, she opens the bag and puts the cards in it and then looks at Brian. \"You did get one power as well, only one. But it doesn't look like that. Your one power is the ability to transform into many different girls that each have their own set of skills and abilities. I'm going to be honest here, your power and potential is frightening\". She hands him the bag and he looks down at it, letting her words sink in. It was then that she noticed the knife hanging from the Elf's hip. \"What's that?\", she asks. Taking it off of her hip, she responds, \"oh, this? I got it when I transformed, remember? I told you I used this to get into the security room\". \"Oh yeah, you did say that. Can I look at it?\". \"Sure\", she says, handing it to her. Silstes takes it and looks it over before unsheathing it. Upon seeing the blade, she gasps.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong!?\", Brian quickly says.<br>\r\nSilstes: Do you have any idea what this is!?<br>\r\nAdilya:.....um.....a dagger.....?......I guess......<br>\r\nSilstes: THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A DAGGER! You have no idea what this material is do you?\". Again, she catches herself, and after calming herself. \"That's right. Most wouldn't. Its suppose to be a mythical metal after all. I'm sure you heard of it. This dagger is made out of Mithril\".<br>\r\nAdilya: !!!!!!! \"What!?\", she yells.<br>\r\nSilstes: Yes. A very rare metal. Light weight, easily worked, beauty like silver, but never fades, and stronger than steel. It now makes sense how you were able to cut through that building so easily\". After she finishes admiring the blade, she sheathes it and hands it back to him, saying, \"take real good care of that dagger. It's worth a fortune\". As he takes it, he suddenly grabs the bow, having thought of something. \"Could you take a look at one last thing?\", she asks, drawing her bow and making an arrow appear. The Elf then takes the arrow and hands it to Silstes. \"I want you to check this out as well since you seem to know so much\". After looking it over, she puts a hand over her face, \"yup, the points of these arrows are made of mithril as well.....The guns breaking on contact with one of these is believable now.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow disappears and Sislstes gets up. \"I've been here for too long. I need need to head back\". Heading for a window, she looks back at him and says one last thing, \"I have given you a lot of information on whats happening. There is still a lot more to it, but for now you should continue with what you've been doing. It has only been two days since you received your powers\". And with that, she disappears into thin air once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttaching the bag and dagger to her side, she looks out the window and sees that the sun has begun to set. It looks like she has about an hour or so before it gets dark. She wonders what she should do next, take Silstes advice and head out immediately to look for more crimes, or go to bed and start fresh tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Almost an hour into the patrol, and with nothing happening, she was about to call it quits when a scream shattered the silence around her. Immediately heading toward the noise, she finds exactly what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo men mugging a woman that they had trapped in an alley behind some building. \"Looks like a simple mugging\", she says, as the two men start to leave with the woman's purse. \"Still.....\", she says, swapping the image to the Elf, \"not gonna let em go\". A quick press of the watch and Adilya is aiming her bow at the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing one eye, she lines up the shot and lets the arrow free. It silently soars through the night sky towards the two unsuspecting men who were laughing over their catch. The arrow catches the purse and rips it from their hands before embedding itself into the sidewalk. They stare at the arrow in disbelief before one of them snaps out of it and reaches for the purse; however, before his hands can get there, two more arrows land at their feet, causing them to jump back and away from the purse. Looking in the general direction they came from, they can't find who is shooting at them, even with this clear and bright night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdilya left her spot after firing those last two arrows and went to an adjacent building. A flash of black light and she jumps off the building, landing between the startled men. In seconds, they are on the floor. With a quick glance at the woman, who backs up in response, and she jumps up and back onto the buildings and disappears into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne anonymous phone call to the police later and she is back in her room. Being as late as it now is, she throws off her clothes, takes a quick shower, and goes to bed, not even bothering to change back.</span></div></div>",

Reaching for her toothbrush, she looks up at herself and jolts at the sight of her bare breasts. \".....R-right.....still not use to that.....\", she says to herself, face flushed. Wrapping up in the bathroom, she walks back into her room to find her phone vibrating. Going over to where it was plugged in, she picks it up and reads the message she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? From the School....let's see....Because of what happened yesterday school will be closed until further noticed.....sweet. Day off\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChanging back to Heather, than to Brian. Grabbing something to eat and a change of clothes, he grabs his bag and leaves for the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing the shop he got the clothes for Heather, he realizes something. He doesn't have any clothes for Raven or Adilya. \"Damn\", is all he says, knowing that he was low on cash after the spending spree he went on for his female self. Sure, he could probably make the clothes for Heather fit Adilya to an extent, though that might be a bit tight. The problem is that Raven is way to small for any of his clothes to fit her. \"Guess I'm going to have to wait until I get my next allowance\". He walks away and heads to the park behind the middle school in the middle of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the day off, the park is far more crowded than it usually is. And that also means that he sees a common sight that disgusts him. Two men were running a scam game right by the fountain in the center of the park. A classic guess which ball the cup is under and win the pot. Of course the pot comes from people who pay to play the rigged game. He wonders why people fall for this, knowing what kind of city this is. It also doesn't help that the police are so busy dealing with other incidents that they largely leave these games alone, they just don't have the manpower. Turning to leave, wanting to get as far away from them as possible, he stops then turns around. \"Those fuckers!\", he almost yells, as he heads into the trees. The reason for his anger is because he recognized those two men. They were part of the group that went after that girl when he made his debut in that alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope nope nope nope! Not letting them get away with it! Not now!\". Far enough away from anyone, he transforms into Adilya. Removing her elven clothes, she sifts though her bag until she comes up with a mix of Heather's and Brian's clothes that fit well enough. Finishing with a hat to help hide her ears, she hides her bow and bag up in a tall tree then hides her dagger on her as a just in case and heads back to the fountain area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThug 1: Come and challenge my friend here! Find the ball and win the pot! Who will finally manage to best him!?\". This was when a tall busty blond walked up to them.<br>\r\nAdilya: This looks fun! I'll give it a try!\", though she says this, inside her head, (I am going to enjoy humiliating you two scumbags!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men were awestruck for a moment, but then get back to the game, \"of course! To try and get the pot, you have to pay a fee of 10 bucks\". She pays the fee and the game begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man takes the ball and places it under a cup and starts to shuffle them around. Adilya focuses and follows what she believes the ball is, while doing this, she notices the other thug smile, but this does not bother her. The man stops shuffling the cups and puts his hands up, \"now little lady, can you find the ball?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the elf does next surprises them, she stands up and smiles. With her left hand, she grabs the left hand of the man standing behind the other and a ball falls out of his hand as he jumps in surprise. She then quickly knocks the cups away with her other, showing that the ball wasn't under any of them. \"Nice try. Nothing escapes these eyes of mine, I was onto your trick from the beginning......\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[A few minutes earlier]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she walked out from the trees, she prepared for the encounter. There was another reason she picked the elf besides the fact that the two men hadn't see her before. It was that Adilya's eyes were very sharp, she knew that they would be able to help her spot the trick to the game, she even took it a step further by casting a spell on them to further increase their already high detection ability. With this, she went to confront the scam artists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Back to the game]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdilya: Well....even though you cheated....I still found the ball, so I WIN! I'll be taking that prize money now\". She reaches for the pot, but the man grabs the arm. \"You didn't actually think we'd just let you take it, did you!?\", he practically yells at her, still holding her arm as he stands up, clearly angry. But the elf simply smiles and says, \"of course not\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the elf is not as strong as his other girl, she still packs a mean punch.....or should I say kick as one of her legs finds his third leg. The man lets go of her arm due to the pain and she reacts by grabbing his head and slamming it against the table. That was more than enough to knock him out. The second guy pulls out a knife and walks toward her. Adilya reaches behind her back and takes out her dagger, \"mine's bigger, she says, swinging it at his knife and sending the blade flying away. The man was stunned, and this was a mistake as she hits him hard upside the head with the handle. He falls the the floor and that ends it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her blade away, she picks up the bag with the money in it, \"now what should I do with you?\", she says to herself, but her pondering is interrupted as the people int he park start clapping. Surprised, she turns around to see a crowd of people behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitizen A: That was amazing!<br>\r\nCitizen B: You really showed those two who's boss!<br>\r\nCitizen C: Someone should have done that a long time ago!<br>\r\nAnd so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds out the bag and says that the people who were scammed should take their money back, but they all say that she should keep it, much to her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCitizen D: Think of it as a reward for ending their game.<br>\r\nCitizen E: Yeah, they'll think twice before pulling that stunt again.<br>\r\nCitizen F: Technically you did find the ball.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith not a single person objecting her keeping it, she starts to walk away and back into the forest, the people still clapping until she was too far away to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her bag, \"well....that was different....\", was all she said as she put the elf's clothes back on and changed all the way back to Brian. Putting his reward into the bag, he leaves the park, knowing exactly where he was going next.</span></div></div>",

I need a few sets of clothes, my old ones are a little tight.<br>\r\nEmployee: I see that. Alright. Let's see what we can find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick measuring session in the changing rooms, they go about the store and pick out a few full sets of clothes for her. Paying for them, Adilya leaves and heads behind a nearby building. Putting her new clothes into the bag, she changes into Raven and finds the smallest clothes she had on her and changes into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo not arouse suspension, she hops onto the building she was hiding behind and after taking some money from the bag, hides it up there. Jumping back down, she leaves and walks back into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same employee practically jumps her as soon as she walks in, \"Oh! And what can I help you with!?\", the woman says, her face beaming.<br>\r\n(Great), Raven thinks, (she totally thinks I'm a little girl). So she decides to play the part, thinking that it will make it easier to get in and out. Tilting her head and fidgeting, \"um...yes....I was told to come here to get some clothes....but I don't know what to do.....\". Hearing this, the woman almost falls over, \"L-leave it to me! I'll find you the best that we have!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven more measuring and some time later, Raven has her new clothes, though she made sure that what the woman helped her find weren't too \"girly\". Taking the cash from her pockets, she pays for them and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting some distance from the store, she falls to her knees, \"I can't believe I just did that.....\". Retrieving her bag, she puts the clothes and change into it and then decides to take a risk and stay as Raven, \"hopefully I don't get recognized, though the odds of that should be pretty low.....\" Getting out of her baggy clothes, she decides to stick to something simple, a black shirt and jean shorts since she isn't used to or comfortable with \"dressing up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinging the bag around her shoulder, she hops down and walks out from behind the building. Walking down the street and not too far from the clothing store and she stops, having reached her next destination. Entering the store, Raven gives it a quick glance, \"yeah, that's a lot of shoes\". She spends about half an hour picking out a few pairs for all three girls, of course doing the same thing of leaving, transforming, and going back in. Content with what she picked out, she heads for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her overstuffed bag onto the bed, she starts to go through everything she bought and what she already had in there. Separating everything by each girl, she hides the clothes and shoes deep into her closet where no one should find them, not that anyone is ever here to begin with.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her trip, she sits on the side of her bed, \"not even noon yet. What should I do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smartphone then starts to ring.</span></div></div>",

Of course he washes his hands, but as he was drying them, he hears something outside the men's room. He quickly dives back into the stall and activates the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding in a stall, a loud banging sound reaches her ears as the door to the restroom is kicked open. Raven immediately ducks down and stays low as the individual checks the stalls. When he gets to the stall she's in, she ducks under the side and into the adjacent stall to her left. The man, and at this point she knew it was one, opens the door only to see an empty stall. He proceeds to check the remainder of the stalls before walking over to the entrance. He then picks up his radio, \"Men's bathroom on this side is all clear\". A voice comes back, \"Alright, most of the building has been checked. Go into radio silence unless it's important. We couldn't take the security room so we blocked them in, be advised that the police are probably on their way\". \"Roger\", the man says, before leaving the room\". Waiting for a little bit to make sure it's all clear, Raven leaves the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't I get a moment to myself before this damn city does something crazy!?\". Looking at herself in the mirror, \"At least I remembered to change back into my fighting clothes before changing back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her arms, she leans back against the multi sinks below the mirror and assesses her situation. \"Some people have taken over the theater, hope my friends are alright. The police are on their way and the security room is secure. That's good, but that means the cameras are still up and I don't want to be seen, especially when I'm in the men's restroom.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly gets an idea, \"If Raven can't get out, maybe Adilya can\"! A quick swap from the loli to the hourglass and almost immediately she comes up with a plan. \"Most likely they've sealed the entrance of the theater, this helps me out. This will be much different from the middle school, this building is much smaller and with their barricading they've created a more airtight structure which means my aoe spells will last much longer before dissipating and wearing off\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the door, she puts her hands together and starts to sing/chant one of her elven spells. Focusing on the area outside the restroom, a bluish green smoke begins to fill the hallway between each cinema room. As the smoke builds and gets thicker and thicker, she stops casting and instead places both the eye spells that increase their sensitivity and visibility. \"Good. With this I can use my spell as a smoke screen and I'll be able to see through it better\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the smoke seeping under the door, she reaches for the handle and opens it. For a second, she is staring at a thick wall of blue green smoke before it floods the room. Finally leaving the restroom, she turns left, toward the security room. Suddenly she trips over something. Looking down, she sees the shape of an adult male on the floor, the assault rifle next to him telling her that one of the attackers fell victim to her sleeping spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she thought and heard, the security room was barricaded and of course there are guards, but they're taking a break at the moment. The elf then takes a deep breath and switches to Raven who quickly removes the debris used to block the door then breaks the knob with her super human strength before changing back to Adilya who gasps for breath, \"whew, I may be immune to my magic, but Raven isn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing herself next to the door, she pushes it open, making sure that the guards inside don't see her. Hearing them move around inside, she says, \"I'm not going to attack, but please, quick, tell me how many men attacked this place.\" At first, silence. Adilya thought that maybe this was in vain when one of them spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuard 1: I think I know who you are, so I'll tell ya.<br>\r\nGuard 2: Are you sure? This is pretty serious ya know!<br>\r\nGuard 1: I am....though it's getting hard to think....um....how many? There....were......twelve......in.....\" The guards too fall victim to her magic.<br>\r\nAdilya: That's all I needed to know.\" she says to herself, heading back into the fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick run around the smoke covered theater tells her that her magic took out half of the men. That means that the last six are in the rooms guarding the hostages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needs a plan, \"How should I do this one.....\"</span></div></div>",

Once there, she checks the security cameras and finds that the last 6 are scattered between three areas in pairs of 2. Memorizing the rooms that they are in, she cuts the power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe theater goes dark and she knows that she doesn't have much time before the cops storm the place. The elf opens the doors to the rooms that are empty so that she knows that they're safe. Of course her spell pours into the new space and Adilya notices that the fog is getting thinner. \"Guess I need to top it off\", she says to herself before recasting the sleep spell and the fog gets thicker. She keeps casting for a little longer, taking into account what will happen when she goes after the remaining men. Satisfied with the really thick wall around her, she heads to the first hostage room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling against one of the double doors that lead into the auditorium, she puts an ear to it and listens. \"Whispering, most likely from the hostages, and footsteps....more than one....the attackers....by the screen...\". Placing a hand against one side of the door, she carefully and slowly pushes it open. Thankfully the doors open to hallways with the seats going upwards in the middle, this means that unless the lights were on, no one know that a door was opened. Seeing that it was safe, she fully opens the doors and uses the doorstops behind them to keep them open, letting her magical sleeping fog seep inside. Crouched, she silently moves along the side of the hallway with the seats, stopping just before the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two men has a flashlight and he's making sure no one tries anything in the dark. Scanning the room, he suddenly stops as he notices something odd. Stunned, his partner looks at him and asks whats wrong, but he too freezes as he and the hostages notice that the sleep fog spell covering the floor and starting to rise. Panic sets in as both the thugs and hostages panic as the room fills with the mysterious fog. Adilya stays on standby, just in case things get worse, as she waits for her spell to take them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo thuds and a minute later and the auditorium is filled with the fog. After checking on the hostages, she takes the two men to the front of the theater and throws them with the others that she has taken out and placed here. She repeats the process at the second auditorium and with ten of them taken care of and sleeping at the front of the theater, she heads to the last one where the boss and her friends are......</span></div></div>",

Keep trying to radio the others!<br>\r\nUnderling: B-but boss, no ones responding! I've already tried so many times! Something must of happened to em!<br>\r\nLeader: You think! Why else would the power be out! Did you think the lights would just go out on their own!? This is just a scare tactic by the police. This is why you aren't in charge!<br>\r\nUnderling: B-but.....W-what if it wasn't the cops?\" This infuriates the leader. His face turns red with anger as he lashes out at the underling. \"Oh? And who else could it possibly be! You better not say that the small monster and elf are responsible. THEY DON\"T EXIST!<br>\r\nUnderling: B-but the others said....<br>\r\nLeader: Don't give me that! They were mistaken! Monsters, magic, whatever! It's not real! You getting all scared over it means you're falling for the trick that the police or whoever set up and wants you to believe!<br>\r\nUnderling: I-I know! B-but more than once.....B-BOSS!!!\" The underling's complaining was cut short when he sees something and points to it. The boss looks where he is pointing and it's where the flashlight was pointing to, the floor.<br>\r\nEnough of the sleep spell had poured into the room to cover almost a foot off the floor, the men too distracted to notice. Shining the flashlight across the room, he can only watch as the fog continues to rise.<br>\r\n\"I-It's them!\", the underling screams. The leader turns around and punches him in the face, \"snap out of it! This is nothing but a trick!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[While this was going on]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdilya's friends, who have been stuck in here the whole time were just enjoying the movie after Brian left when two armed men stormed into the auditorium and took them hostage. Since then they were forced to sit and wait for it to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle:Y-you don't think?<br>\r\nAmy: It can't be. It should be impossible...<br>\r\nKyle: What else could it be?<br>\r\nNathan: The police? Maybe they're about to do something and this is the start.<br>\r\nAmy: Yeah.....Turning off the power is a standard move.....<br>\r\nSarah: I just hope this ends soon and we're all alright......<br>\r\nNathan: Speaking of which, I hope Brian's ok.<br>\r\nKyle: I'm sure he's fine. Probably hiding in the bathroom.<br>\r\nSarah: I hope so too....wait, something's happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Back to the men]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader had completely lost it. With his men not responding, the power being cut, this useless person beside him (his opinion), and the strange fog that is slowly filling the room causes him to snap. Unholstering his gun, he fires into the air before yelling, \"I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND I DON'T CARE! SHOW YOURSELF RIGHT NOW OR I START SHOOTING!\", he then lowers the gun towards the hostages who are panicking and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hiding nearby, \"and this is why I'm on standby\". Taking a deep breath, she flips open the watch and is engulfed in a black light. Everyone else sees the light, of course they do there it is pitch black after all, and she knows it so she acts quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying low, she runs full speed towards the armed leader. Surprised, but not taken aback, he starts to aim at her, but it didn't matter, he's too slow. Grabbing the arm with the gun, she raises and moves it to the side as he pulls the trigger, the bullets harmlessly sent down a hallway. Clenching her free hand, she brings it up and slams it into the bottom of his jaw sending straight up and backwards. After flying for a few feet, he hits the ground and is swallowed by the rising fog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking in his boots, the underling looks at where his boss landed then back at her. Taking a step towards him, he jolts then steps back, \"S-STAY AWAY FROM ME YOU MONSTER!\". He completely forgets he has a weapon, not that it would matter as she jumps towards him and her fist embeds itself in his gut. As he falls into the fog, she leaps backwards and disappears down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main lobby, a flash of green light and Adilya gasps for breath, \"that was pushing it, but I needed speed so it couldn't be helped\". She heads back into the auditorium she just left and checks on her friends and everyone else before taking the two men to the lobby and throwing them with the others. The elf then starts to look through behind the stands and booths until she finds a piece of paper and a pen. Writing BOSS in big bold letters, she then puts it on the leader and with all twelve men taken care of, she heads to the men's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the door open, she stops and then looks behind her, \"looks like that was just in time\", she says to herself as her large ears pickup loud noises coming from the lobby she just left, \"guess the police couldn't wait any longer\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enters the bathroom and transforms back to Brian, \"now to make this look realistic\". Leaning himself against the sink, he closes his eyes and with the sleep spell surrounding him, drifts off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

They tell him not to move as they continue to look him over. Playing the victim, he asks what happened and they tell him about the attack on the theater, the \"gas\", and how they found him in the restroom and that they are now checking him out to make sure the gas didn't do anything to him. After taking a few samples for later testing, they tell him that he seems alright and that it looked like the gas was just some kind of sleeping drug so he can go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the makeshift hospital, he stretches and shakes his head, still a bit woozy from his own spell, \"Man that packs a punch! Didn't think it would be that strong\". Taking a few steps forward, someone yells at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: There he is! Over there!<br>\r\n???: Oh? You're right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns around to see his friends running towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: I'm so glad you're alright! We were so worried!<br>\r\nNathan: Yeah, we thought that they might of found you.<br>\r\nKyle: So tell us! What happened to you?<br>\r\nAmy: If Karen was here she would have gone after you for that.<br>\r\nKyle: Why?<br>\r\nNathan: Don't worry about it.<br>\r\nHe tells them what \"happened\" to him.<br>\r\nKyle: So you got out easy. Managed to avoid them in the bathroom but the sleep stuff got ya\". A big smile then crosses his face, \"you may have gotten off easy, but WE got to see the little monster girl!\" When he says this everyone, including Brian, seem hesitant to continue; however, Brian breaks the silence by saying, \"Really? You're sure?\". He immediately responds, \"Yes! Really! We watched her beat up the two that took us hostage! Man is she strong!\"<br>\r\nNathan follows up, \"Well.....we did see a small figure that looked like a girl take them out....\".<br>\r\nKyle: She didn't just take them out! She destroyed them! She sent one flying with one uppercut and took out the other with a single blow to the gut! It was awesome! Just what you'd expect from a supernatural creature!\"<br>\r\nAmy: N-now that I have to object to.....M-magic and supernatural stuff just doesn't exist.....<br>\r\nKyle: Really? Then how do you explain the gas? I don't even think it was gas!<br>\r\nAmy: Of course it was! It was some kind of sleeping gas.<br>\r\nKyle: Then how did she sneak it into the theater? They're still looking for the canisters and can't find them! And there would have to be a lot of em to fill the place up like she did!<br>\r\nAmy: I don't know....but it's a lot more reasonable than magic!<br>\r\nSarah: Wow....we usually don't see this side of Amy.<br>\r\nNathan: Well that's what happens when something \"unscientific\" is involved.<br>\r\nKyle: Jeez. You guys really are stubborn. Why can't you all just get it already?<br>\r\nAmy,Sarah,&amp;Nathan: THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SAY TO YOU!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir talking comes to an end when they see that it's starting to get late.<br>\r\nNathan: Oh. I should probably head home now, sure my parents are worried about me.<br>\r\nSarah: Same.

Heading back to the entrance, we walks up to the police who are standing guard over the entrance.<br>\r\nBrian: Yeah...um...I left a bag in one of the lockers in there....Can I go get it.....Or could someone get it for me?\", he says, showing the key to it that he still had on him. They look at each other, then one of them asks for the key then goes to retrieve the bag. Brian thanks him and then heads back. \"Good thing I got this back. Last thing I want is for someone to find my girls' clothing in here....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading home, he figures he should give his parents a call since the doctors or police most likely called them.

HOWEVER, MORE SIGHTINGS AND CASES OF HER INVOLVEMENT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE THEN, AND WE WILL TELL YOU ALL THAT WE KNOW. HER NEXT APPEARANCE HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED ON, BUT WE NOW HAVE NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE WILL GET TO. YESTERDAY WAS WHEN DOLPHIN MIDDLE SCHOOL WAS TAKEN OVER BY A GROUP OF ARMED MEN AND THEY WERE TAKEN OUT BY THE MYSTERIOUS GIRL AND A NEW ONE THAT WAS DESCRIBED AS AN \"ELF\" OF ALL THINGS. THOUGH SHE WAS ONLY SEEN FOR A SPLIT SECOND SO THIS INFORMATION IS......QUESTIONABLE......THESE TWO MANAGED TO SNEAK INTO THE SCHOOL, GETTING PAST ALL THE POLICE AND THUGS THEN SAVING THE HOSTAGES WHILE TAKING OUT ALL OF THE ATTACKERS. THEY THEN DISAPPEAR WITH THE ONLY SIGHING BEING THAT BRIEF MOMENT IN THE GYMNASIUM. NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THIS IS THAT THEY ENTERED FROM THE ROOF, MAKING A HOLE IN THE ROOM AND IN THE FLOOR OF THE CLASSROOM BELOW IT. FROM HERE THEY INFILTRATED THE SECURITY ROOM WITHOUT BEING NOTICED AND TURNED OFF THE POWER, THE REST IS AS PREVIOUSLY STATED. BUT WHY DID THESE MEN TARGET THE SCHOOL? WE NOW KNOW THE ANSWER. ONE OF THE MEN CONFESSED AND SAID THAT THEY WERE LOOKING FOR, GET THIS, THE VERY GIRL IN BLACK THAT STOPPED THEM. HE SAID THAT SHE HAD INTERFERED WITH ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR GROUPS AND THAT THEY WERE SENT TO THE MIDDLE SCHOOL TO LOOK FOR HER THINKING THAT SHE WAS A STUDENT THERE DUE TO HER SIZE. HE THEN STATED THAT THEY CHECKED MULTIPLE TIMES AND COULDN'T FIND ANYONE THAT LOOKED EVEN REMOTELY LIKE HER. IN SHORT, THEY WERE LOOKING FOR REVENGE AGAINST SOMEONE THAT WENT AGAINST THEM. IF YOU ASK ME, THAT'S PRETTY TYPICAL IN THIS CITY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOU WOULD THINK THAT THE NEXT CASE WOULD BE THE THEATER INCIDENT WHICH JUST HAPPENED A FEW HOURS AGO, BUT YOU'D BE WRONG. THEY APPEARED ONE MORE TIME YESTERDAY. IT WAS IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT WHEN TWO MEN MUGGED A WOMAN IN THE CITY. ACCORDING TO HER AND THE TWO MEN AFTER THEY WERE ARRESTED, SEVERAL ARROWS LANDED AROUND THEM AND THEN THE SMALL GIRL IN BLACK FELL FROM THE SKY AND KNOCKED THEM OUT. THE WOMAN SAID THAT THE GIRL JUMPED UP ONTO A NEARBY BUILDING AND DISAPPEARED.....REALLY? ARROWS, FALLING FROM THE SKY, AND JUMPING REALLY HIGH.....WELL IT WAS DARK OUT.....TAKE IT HOW YOU WANT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOW FOR THE LATEST STORY, THE THEATER. THE MEN ATTACKED THE PLACE LOOKING TO MAKE SOME QUICK CASH. THEIR PLAN FAILED WHEN THE GUARDS NOTICED AND LOCKED THEMSELVES IN THE SECURITY ROOM AND CONTACTED THE POLICE. THE MEN TRIED TO FLEE, BUT SOME POLICEMEN WERE NEARBY AND GOT THERE FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT THIS. WITH NO OTHER CHOICE THE MEN TOOK THE STAFF AND MOVIE GOERS HOSTAGE. THEY LOCKED THE STAFF IN A UTILITY ROOM AND PUT MEN IN THE THEATERS WITH THE OTHERS. THEIR PLAN WAS TO USE THEM TO ESCAPE; HOWEVER, THIS WAS THWARTED BY THE PAIR SHOWING UP. ONCE AGAIN, THEY SOMEHOW SLIPPED IN UNNOTICED, AND NO, NO HOLES THIS TIME. THEY THEN RELEASED THAT BLUISH GREEN GAS THAT FLOODED THE THEATER. IT WAS SO THICK THAT THE SECURITY CAMERAS COULDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING. EVERYONE THAT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE GAS WAS KNOCKED OUT, LEADING EXPERTS TO BELIEVE IT WAS A FORM OF SLEEPING GAS. WE SAY BELIEVE BECAUSE NO TRACE OF IT COULD BE FOUND. NOT INSIDE OR ON ANY OF THE HOSTAGES OR ASSAILANTS, DESPITE IT COVERING EVERYTHING NOTHING WAS FOUND, NOT EVEN THE MEANS TO WHICH IT WAS RELEASED. THIS HAS BAFFLED A LOT OF PEOPLE ONTO HOW THEY DID THIS. ON A SIDE NOTE, THE GAS WAS FOUND TO BE NON LETHAL. ALL IT DID WAS PUT PEOPLE TO SLEEP. THE GAS ENTERED THE THREE AUDITORIUMS THAT THE HOSTAGES WERE BEING HELD IN AND TWO OF THE ROOMS FELL TO THE GAS. THE LAST ROOM POSED A PROBLEM. THE LEADER OF THE MEN WAS THERE. AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT HIS PLAN FALLING APART, THE LIGHTS GOING OUT, HIS MEN GETTING TAKEN DOWN, AND THE GAS FLOODING THE ROOM MADE HIM SNAP. HE DEMANDED THAT WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE SHOW THEMSELVES OR HE WOULD SHOOT THE HOSTAGES....WELL....SHE DID, THE SMALL ONE ANYWAY. ACCORDING TO THE HOSTAGES, \"IT FLEW INTO THE ROOM AT UNNATURAL SPEED AND DEFLECTED HIS GUN LIKE IT WAS A TOY. IT THEN SENT THE MAN FLYING ACROSS THE ROOM BEFORE DEALING WITH THE OTHER IN A SINGLE PUNCH\". SHE THEN JUMPED BACK INTO THE HALL AND DISAPPEARED. THIS WAS THE ONLY SIGHTING OF THE MYSTERIOUS LITTLE GIRL IN BLACK. AS FOR THE SO CALLED ELF, THE SECURITY GUARDS THAT HAD BARRED THEMSELVES IN THE SECURITY ROOM DID SAY THAT ONE OF THE TWO TALKED TO THEM. WHICHEVER ONE IT WAS ASKED HOW MANY MEN ATTACKED THE THEATER. THEY SAID THEY ANSWERED HER QUESTION BEFORE THE GAS GOT THEM. WE BELIEVE IT WAS THE \"ELF \" THAT TALKED TO THEM BECAUSE ACCORDING THE THE GUARDS, IT SOUNDED LIKE IT BELONGED SOMEONE OLDER. AFTER ALL TWELVE MEN WERE TAKEN CARE OF, THE DISAPPEARED FROM THE THEATER AS MYSTERIOUSLY AS THEY CAME. NO ONE SAW THEM LEAVE JUST AS NO ONE SAW THEM ENTER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAND HERE WE ARE. WITH ALL THESE INCIDENTS BEHIND US NOW, WE GET TO THE REAL QUESTION, ARE THESE TWO GOOD AND SHOULD THEY BE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING, OR IN OTHER WORDS, IS THEIR HELP WANTED OR NEEDED? SOME TOP OFFICIALS ACCUSE THEM OF BEING NOTHING BUT VIGILANTES DOING A WHOLE SUPERNATURAL STICK AND THAT THEIR INTERFERENCE WILL CAUSE MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT MORE PEOPLE SEEM TO BE ON THEIR SIDE. EVERYONE FROM POLICE OFFICERS TO OFFICIALS TO CIVILIANS SEEM TO OVERWHELMINGLY AGREE THAT THEY WANT THESE TWO TO KEEP IT UP. HERE ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHAT THEY SAID.<br>\r\n\"Finally, someone is standing up to these criminals\"<br>\r\n\"We are outnumbered and outgunned. We need all the help we can get\".<br>\r\n\"With how bad this city has gotten, I don't care if some random people want to help. Someone has to do it\".<br>\r\n\"I don't trust our leaders with this. It's been years and things are only getting worse\".<br>\r\nAND SO ON. NOW THERE ARE NEGATIVE COMMENTS ON THEM, BUT THEIR IN THE MINORITY. SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR SPECIAL SEGMENT ON THE MYSTERIOUS DUO THAT HAS APPEARED AND IS FIGHTING CRIME. IT WILL ONLY BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE TRULY FIND OUT IF WE CAN RELY ON THESE TWO OR IF THEIR ACTIONS WILL CAUSE MORE HARM THAN GOOD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I expected\", Brian says, \"Some like me, some don't. I don't care though, I'm doing this for myself, my friends, and because it's whats right\". He turns off the TV and heads to his room.</span></div></div>",

About an hour in and it would seem to be a quiet night, for once, \"huh, guess the theater business might of made some second guess doing anything bad tonight\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun has long set and after another couple hours of nothing, she decides to head home for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear her house, she suddenly stops and lays down on the roof that she is currently on. On the other side of the street Raven can see two figures heading away from her house, one slightly bigger than the other. The importance of this is that he knows them very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figures are Karen and Katie. \"What are they doing out this late? I mean, I'm glad Katie is ok and we are fairly far from the city, but this place is still dangerous, especially at night!\". As a just in case, she cautiously tails them, making sure that she is not seen by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(By the way, Katie has long brown hair and blue yes. She is taller than someone her age, she is almost as tall as Karen, and her breasts are bigger than Karen's indicating that she has a far better future ahead of her than her older sister. Because of her height, she plays on the basketball team at Dolphin Middle.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Raven doesn't mean to, but because she is watching them, she can't help but overhear their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren: Let's just hurry this up so we can get back faster. Don't feel comfortable being out at this hour.<br>\r\nKatie: Yeah, I know. Especially after what just happened.<br>\r\nKaren: On that subject, are you sure you should be out? You don't have to push yourself.<br>\r\nKatie: I'm fine. And as I already told you, they didn't do anything to us. Just made us sit in the middle of the gym. I mean, it was scary, but that was it.<br>\r\nKaren: I know......it's just.....<br>\r\nKatie: And I understand and thank you for you worrying about me, but I really am fine, and besides.....I got to see those two! Well.....sort of.....Oh! We're almost there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sister's destination was a nearby gas station/convenience store. Raven just sits outside on a nearby rooftop while her friends buy what they came for then head home. Watching them walk back, she notices movement in the corner of her eye. Four men, hiding behind the store eyeing up her friends. \"Oh no you don't!\", Raven almost yells as she jumps off her building and makes her way to the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the men had circled around and walk out in front of the girls. When they see this, they immediately know that they mean trouble and back up ready to sprint back to the store only to be met by the other two. The men laugh as they close in on them, one of them pulling a pistol on them, \"You girls know the drill, give us everything you haUAGH!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sound at the end? That was caused by Raven jumping from the house next to them and onto him. Before anyone could react, she reaches up and grabs the other man by the shirt and slams him face first into the sidewalk. Her head down, she slowly stands up. Both the sisters and the men frozen in place as she takes a few steps toward them. Lifting a foot, she brings it down on the pistol near the guy she landed on, smashing it and causing them to jump in response. Out of sheer fear and panic, one of the remaining men take out another pistol; however, he doesn't even get the chance to aim at her. She dashes through the sisters and her knee finds the side of the man's face. As he crumples to the ground, she backhands the other guy, sending him onto his back and knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there, her back to her friends, she begins to walk away when Katie calls out to her. \"U-um\", she says, one of her arms reaching out. Raven stops, but doesn't turn around. \"W-what are you doing!?\", Karen says in surprise. Katie doesn't answer, instead, she continues, \"I-I just wanted to thank you for the other day....and um just now as well\". Glancing back, Raven says, \"....oh....it's you, from the school....\", beginning to walk again, \" Guess trouble likes you.....Both of you should hurry home. This town IS very dangerous\", and with that, she jumps to the rooftops and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Though secretly she still watches over them until they make it home.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her friends safe and sound, she opens the window to her room and goes inside.....</span></div></div>",

Kicking off her shoes and socks, sliding down and stepping out of her shorts, and pulling off her gloves and throwing off her shirt, she steps out of her room and into the dark hallway in the buff. to her left is the stairs to the first floor, across from her room is her older sister who is, again, gone most of the time for college, and to her right is the bathroom which is next to her sister's room and a closet which is across from it and next to her room. In between the bathroom and her sister's room is another hallway which goes to the room her parent's use as well as another bathroom and closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching the lights in the nearby bathroom on, Raven gets the water running. Reaching for her toothbrush she gets ready for bed as the tub fills up. Testing the water with one of her feet, she finds the temperature just right and gets in. Slipping into the water, she stretches and relaxes after another hard day of heroing. Time passes and raising one of her arms out of the water, she moves it to the side of the tub and stops. Hesitating for only a second before pressing a button on it's side. Jets embedded inside the tub come to life. As the water begins to churn and bubbles rise to the surface, Raven is caught off guard by the bubbles massaging her entire body. Unlike anything she felt as a man when she used it, she immediately puts it up to full throttle and her entire body twitches at the intensified rush of new sensations coursing through her body. It was as if she was melting into the water. She does eventually turn if off, after a long session of stimulation, she gets out, drains the tub and dries off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to her room, and yes she is still naked, she takes note of what time it is, \"yeah, too late. Gonna go to bed after I get a quick bite to eat\", she says to herself, her stomach reminding her that she hasn't eaten since the theater incident earlier that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stairs to the second floor are to the right of the front door, from when you walk in, the living room is to the right after a bit of wall in between. The kitchen is right ahead and to the left along the wall is a bathroom and closet. To the left of the kitchen is the garage. From the living room, head to the kitchen and that is where the dining room is located. And of course connected to the back of the kitchen is a door that leads to a fenced in backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her way to the kitchen, she opens the fridge and after pulling out a few things, makes herself a quick dinner. After cleaning up she checks the locks and turns off every light. Then heading upstairs and back to her room, she takes the bag off of the bed and places it into her closet. Collecting the clothes that she took off and laying them on top of the bag, she then closes the closet, turns off the lights, and crawls into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next Day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat wakes Raven up isn't the sound of birds chirping or the sunlight shining through the window. It was something familiar, something that she has gone through and heard countless times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren: Brian! Time to wake up! I know we don't have school, but that doesn't mean you should sleep all day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up so fast that she almost falls out of bed, she starts to panic, \"W-where is it! Where is it!\", she says over and over, looking for the watch that she took off before taking her bath, all while Karen's footsteps get closer and closer.....</span></div></div>",

She had placed it on top of Raven's clothes which were on top of the bag. Leaping for it, she grabs the watch and brief moment of relief was abruptly ended by the sound of a doorknob being turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cold sweat runs down her neck while she is frozen in place, the door knob starting to turn.....only to suddenly stop, then jiggles back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren: What? It's locked!? He never locks his door! Open up and wake up already Brian! Let me in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCollapsing onto the bag, \"T-thank god I thought to lock my door.....That was way too close......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping the watch around her wrist, she goes into the closet and closes it before transforming into Heather and then back to Brian so Karen won't see the light it gives off. Coming out of the closet, he unlocks and opens the door to an angry and upset Karen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hands on her hips, \"finally. Can't believe you actually locked the door\".<br>\r\nBrian: Yeah....Sorry about that.....Don't even remember doing it.<br>\r\nKaren: Well......Whatever.....You're up and breakfast is ready so lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they walk down the hall and the smell of eggs and bacon meet him when he reaches the stairs. This was another normal day for them. Both Karen and Katie would come over to his house quite often, they do have their own keys to his house, they would often hang out and sometimes Katie would cook for them, Karen is not the greatest cook out there. Guess you could call this a benefit of childhood friends that live next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down on a couch by the TV in the living room, she flips to one of her favorite morning shows as Brian goes to the kitchen. Walking in he asks Katie, \"need any help?\". She looks back and responds, \"yeah, could you take care of the stuff over there?\", she says while pointing to a pan on a burner. \"Alright\", he is pretty good at cooking himself, spending most of the time in an empty house with two parents whose work keeps them away most of the time and an older sister who mostly stays at college has made him pretty independent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two finish making breakfast and take it to the dinning room. Karen gets up from the couch and joins them. Brian then brings up the \"incident\" at the middle school, making it look like he barely knew anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian: So I guess that you're ok? You know.....<br>\r\nKatie: Huh? Oh! The school thing.....Yeah. They didn't do anything to us and I was already cleared by the hospital.<br>\r\nBrian: Then that's good.<br>\r\nKaren: Enough about that! It's old news, just wait till we tell you about last night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer saying this makes Brian choke on his food. A coughing fit follows as he reaches for a drink. Quickly downing the water and calming the fit, they ask if he's alright and he says, \"y-yeah. What happened last night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We saw her\", Karen says, a big smile on her face. \"W-who?\", Brian responds. \"Her! You know, the small girl in black!\". Feigning surprise,\"R-REALLY!?\". \"Yes! Really!\".<br>\r\nKatie: We did something stupid last night.<br>\r\nBrian: Something stupid?<br>\r\nKatie: Yeah.....We went to the gas station that was close by to get some stuff last night. We were attacked by some men on our way back.<br>\r\nBrian: You were attacked? Are you two alright?<br>\r\nKatie: We're fine. That girl saved us.<br>\r\nKaren: It was unreal. She was as small as everyone says, and to her, it was as if they were toys\", she then sighs, \"I hate agreeing with him, but maybe Kyle's right. That strength wasn't normal\". Still playing the fool, \"what do you mean? Not normal.....\". Her exuberant expression turns into a frown, \"she smashed a gun with her foot, moved faster than I've every seen anyone move, took down four men who were twice her size in one hit, and then jumped to the top of a house in one go.....That is what mean.....\".<br>\r\nBrian: Um....are you alright? You seemed so exited.....\".<br>\r\nKatie: It's kinda complicated.....\", saying with a slight smile. Karen then looks at her, and then back at Brian, \"no it's not.....I am really glad that I got to see one of them.....it's just that when I think of later.....\".<br>\r\nBrian: Later.....!.....Kyle.....<br>\r\nKaren: What he'll say when he finds out.....<br>\r\nKatie:....ahahaha......<br>\r\nBrian:........<br>\r\nKaren: Maybe we shouldn't tell him.....<br>\r\nKatie: That's a little.....<br>\r\nBrian: Should probably tell him.....<br>\r\nKaren:.....Yeah.....I know......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the dishes to the kitchen, Karen and Katie leave, saying they still have a few things to take care of leaving Brian to himself again. Walking upstairs and back to his room, he opens his closet and picks up the watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 days since he got his powers<br>\r\n4 days since he first used them<br>\r\nSo on this Wednesday morning, what will he do now?</span></div></div>",

Who should I go as? Can't go as myself, don't want to risk anyone noticing me and stopping my patrol. So that means I should go into town as Heather, Raven, or Adilya.....\". Mulling over this for a few minutes, he makes his choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the light that floods the room is.....black. He has decided to go around town as Raven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving her battle clothes and opening the closet, she goes through and picks out a top and skirt to wear. She steps into and pulls a pair of white and blue stripped panties up her leg, remembering what the clerk taught her, takes a matching bra and tucks her small breasts into the bra cups, zips up a black skirt around her waist, and a black and blue top is pulled on. Sitting on the edge of her bed, she puts on a pair of white socks and black shoes before getting up, putting her battle clothes into the bag, and heading out the door....not before making sure no one sees her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of sticking to the rooftops, she decides to walk to the city. Along the way, her phone goes off; however, she doesn't answer it. The reason for this is because it was Kyle calling. Out in the middle of town and as a girl, there was no way she could answer. A few seconds after the call ends, her phone vibrates, someone just sent her a message. Looking at it, and just as she thought, it was Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE CITY TODAY. GOING TO GO TO A FEW STORES, MAYBE THE PARK, MAYBE A FEW OTHER PLACES. CAN'T IMAGINE WHY, BUT WE DECIDED NOT TO SEE ANY MOVIES TODAY! LET US KNOW IF YOU CAN COME OR NOT. BY THE WAY, KAREN CAN'T MAKE IT\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplying to the message, and getting a response, she puts her phone back into her skirt pocket before saying to herself, \"Sorry, but I'm spending all day in hero mode\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of the incidents over the last few days, the center of the city is as lively as it usually is during the weekend. There are more police than usual in the area, but that's to be expected with everything that has happened. Walking through the crowded streets, she stops at one of the stalls and buys a blueberry snow cone. Enjoying her icy treat on this hot day, she looks for trouble while having fun on her patrol. She looks through alleys, plays some games from some stalls, checks the less traveled and off path sections of the park/forest, buys another snow cone, and checks abandoned buildings in the area while taking in the familiar sights in her new form. \"Nothing. There is absolutely nothing going on......There are usually multiple crimes committed each day.....and nothing! Not that that's a bad thing.....Maybe I should of went with my friends today\", and as if on cue, she spots them in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are coming out of the park, not too far in front of her. Panicking for a sec, she then remembers that they don't know who she is, \"right. Even though I saved them yesterday, they didn't see me....Very few people should know what I look like\", but to be on the safe side, she avoids them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 10 minutes later of checking behind more alleys and corners and still nothing. She doesn't even hear any police sirens in he distance, because of all of this, she was just about to give up and enjoy her day off or head home when she gets a strange feeling. Stopping in the middle of the path, she looks around, it feels like someone is watching her. It was then that she spots them. It wasn't any of the thugs that she beat up that got away and recognizer her or some assassination attempt sent by whoever shes fighting, no, for some reason, it's her friends that are tailing her. Keeping their distance, they are trying to hide themselves while following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? They shouldn't recognize me! The spell from the theater should have knocked them out and hid my appearance! So why!?\". Picking up the pace, she then cuts into an alley. Making sure no one is looking, she jumps straight up and then hides herself and waits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her perch, she watches as Kyle peeks around the corner, then with a look of surprise and shock, yells, \"WHAT!?\", as he practically leaps into the opening of the alley. Still stunned, he walks into the alley while Sarah, Nathan, and Amy appear and join him. Turning to them while pointing a finger down the alley, \"See! I told you! That girl IS one of them!\", the others weren't so quick to agree. They look at each other before Ami says, \"I-I'll admit that it's strange how she just disappeared.....but....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle: And as I said, I know what the short one looks like! I saw her face in the theater!<br>\r\nRaven: !!!!!!!<br>\r\nNathan: Yeah....Could you explain that again? I still can't believe you got a clear look at her with the fog and how fast she was moving.....<br>\r\nSarah: It's not like we don't believe you....it's just....very hard to.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighs and tells them, again, what happened, \"As you all remember, when that guy who threatened them to \"show yourself\", I was in an aisle seat right next to the hallway the small girl in black came from when she attacked them. Of course I didn't see her then, she was moving too fast. It was when she jumped back into the hallway that I got a good and clear look at her face\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi: That's what you've said a few times now...but...are you sure? I mean, that fog was affecting us by that point, are you sure you CLEARLY saw it?<br>\r\nKyle: Of course! That's why I was so surprised when we came out of the park! That girl looked exactly like her!<br>\r\nNathan: And then you made us follow her for a while.<br>\r\nKyle: Which turned out to be a good idea. C'mon! You all saw her strange behavior. Checking alleys, looking behind buildings and dark and suspicious areas. Would someone who's just hanging out in town do that?<br>\r\nSarah: That was strange.....<br>\r\nKyle: Then she just vanishes into thin air! This alley is a dead end, no way out except from where we're standing! And nowhere to hide! So tell me, where did she go? She must of used her powers to escape!<br>\r\nAmi: Powers.....Ugh, just saying the word.....And the fact that I can't explain where she went.....<br>\r\nNathan: Oh. Just thought of something. What were you going to do if you caught her Kyle?\", surprised by this, he replies, \"huh? Oh....well....I didn't think that through!\".<br>\r\nAmi Nathan &amp; Sarah: Of course.....<br>\r\nKyle: ......But I guess I just wanted to confirm if I had the right person and if she really had powers.....<br>\r\nAmi: Wow, an actual answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them then start to fight among themselves while Raven continued to listen in overhead, \"guess I got careless when I took those two out and needed to breathe. Note to self, be more careful from now on\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leaving her bewildered and arguing friends behind, Raven moves a few rooftops over before opening the bag. A quick clothing swap later and she is back in her default clothes, \"That was fun, but it's time to get serious\". Doing her best not to get seen by the crowded streets below, she leaps from building to building all over the city, looking for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of the city near her home and deciding whether to head back or not, a sudden deafening explosion rips through the air. Immediately she turns around to see a skyscraper on the other side of the city on fire. Heading towards the burning building, she stops just short and crouches down on the building she is currently on because the police and news crews have already arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, the fire isn't all that bad. Only a small section of the skyscraper is open and the flames are mostly gone. Now knowing how this happened, she then gets an idea. Backing away from the scene, she jumps into a back alley and switches to Heather. Blending in with the crowd, she gets close to the reporters to figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS JUST IN. A GROUP OF TERRORISTS HAVE TAKEN OVER AND ARE HOLDING DOZENS OF PEOPLE HOSTAGE. THE EXPLOSION EARLIER WAS A WARNING TO SHOW HOW SERIOUS THEY ARE AND FOR THE POLICE TO STAY OUTSIDE. WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY THERE ARE, WHAT THEY WANT, OR WHY THEY ARE DOING THIS\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking away, \"Building takeover, hostages, explosives, building surrounded by police and cameras.....This time....I am lost.....How did they even get all that stuff in there unnoticed?\". Now some distance, pacing in circles, she continues to ponder all of this and if there is even anything for her to do.....Until she notices something in the ground, \"A manhole?.....!.....It can't be!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding a secluded place nearby, she transforms back to Raven and heads back to said manhole. Bending over, she picks it up, jumps in, and closes the opening behind her. Thankfully the sewer system under the system is pretty big. Two walkways are on both sides while the waste water flows through the middle. Heading in the general direction of the skyscraper, she turns a corner and notices something odd. \"Lots of footprints and tracks like something was being dragged.....\", she grins, \"pretty heavy traffic we got here for a sewer\". Following the tracks and checking every corner, she eventually finds where they lead. Peeking around another corner, she discovers that a hole in the side wall of the one of the pathways of the sewer had been made, and not only that, there was an armed guard in front of it. \"I see\", she says to herself, \"That explains how they and their gear got in. They made a hole in the sewer to the lower level of that skyscraper and snuck in, then when they were ready, attacked, took hostages, and rigged the building with explosives. Now, how do I get past that guard.....Of course! This is where Adilya shines!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBacking up so the he won't notice the transformation's light, the busty elf is back and she goes back to the corner, having already thought up a plan. Chanting, a familiar red/pink mist flows across the bottom of sewer, heading for the unsuspecting guard. The guard grabs his head and stumbles, but stays on his feet. Laying against the wall of the sewer, a glazed expression covers his face. Just like how she got into the middle school, she used her confusion spell to distract the guard. Walking up to him, she waves a hand in his face to make sure he is out of it, and gets no response, \"good. This should give me a few minutes before he comes to and he won't remember that I was here\". Entering the hole they made, she finds herself in an underground parking lot with no one else nearby. While avoiding the cameras, she heads to the twin elevators that will take her up into the building, but she isn't dumb, she knows that there is a good chance that a camera is in the elevator. Unsheathing her dagger, she jams it into the doors of one of the elevators and forces it open. A vast shaft that leads to the top of the buildings is in front of her with no barrier between them. Jumping in, cause she is on the bottom, the door closes behind her, leaving her in an almost pitch black space. Knowing that it was safe here, she transforms into Raven, \"And now we climb\", she says to herself, grabbing the cables and using maintenance access ways to climb, \"All I have to do is find the leader. Taking him down should stop this whole thing\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading up, she has to hug the wall a few times to avoid the elevators, \"they sure are using the elevators a lot, I wonder what they're doing?\". She does notice a pattern, the elevators would go to various floors; however, they would almost always return to the same floor, \"guess that means I've found where I'm going\". At the floor where the elevators mostly go to, she enters the ventilation duct there and slowly, quietly crawls through. In the duct over the middle of this floor, she looks through a grate in the floor and sees several armed men standing around a large device. One of them begins talking, making her think that he is the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeader: Let's go over the plan one more time to make sure there are no fuck ups. If anyone of you goes against the plan, I'll kill you myself. First, we tunneled through the sewer to get into the building, then we took it over by going straight for the security room and blocking the exits. We blew up one of our bombs to get the attention of the cops. Now we take everything of value plus the ransom for the hostages being held in the lobby and leave, blowing this baby up\", he says placing a hand on the large device, \"as well as the smaller bombs we've distributed throughout the building. Taking a remote device off of his hip, \"And this is how we detonate it, once we're a good distance away, I use this to detonate all bombs in the building, leaving no witnesses\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is why I was given these powers. I will not let you bastards get away with this\". Raven continues crawling through the vents until she is above a room with a grate. Carefully removing it, she silently drops into the room below, \"all I have to do is get that controller away from him before the ransom gets here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passes, waiting for her chance, she listens in on several calls between the leader and the cops. The ransom was on it's way, whether the cops are planning something or are just paying, who knows? This is exactly what she was waiting for, the moment that the terrorists would drop their guard due to them thinking that their plan was going as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing back up into the vent, she left it so she would have more space while she waited, she crawls back to the middle grate above the bomb. During the time she was waiting she got the number of men on this floor, 6 and the total number, 15, scattered throughout the building. With the possible ransom on it's way, the leader ordered his men, except those near him and two by the hostages, to start evacuating back to the sewer. Hanging up, and both him and his men now cocky and off guard, she strikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmashing the grate, she lands right in front of the leader. Before they can react, she simultaneously grabs the controller and hits the side of his head. He flies back and hits the floor, dazed, but not enough that he can't order his men around, \"What are you all standing around for! Kill her! Get the controller back!\". This does snap his men out of it, and they are armed to the teeth and wearing body armor.....but lets be honest, against her superhuman speed and power, they didn't stand a chance. The body armor didn't block her attacks at all, their weapons couldn't even touch her, and they are flung all over the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get to his feet, but then falls back, the blow from earlier still affecting him, \"D-don't think you've won you damned monster!

I'd rather die than get turned over to the police!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she won't be able to force it out of him, she knocks him out and focuses on the real problem at hand.....the bomb.</span></div></div>",

She also finds that her clothes more resemble Raven's then Adilya's in style. A quick glance at a nearby window shows she is now sporting deep blue eyes and medium length hair to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short white top with an unzipped blue and white jacket, tight blue and white shorts hug her hips, and a pair of blue glove and boots on her hands and feet. Las thing she notices is that on her left breast, on the jacket, was a white wing, exactly like what is on the bag and cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe still mysterious new girl is pulled out of her trance over her new body and back to reality by a loud beep. Quickly turning towards the bomb, there is only 3 minutes left until it explodes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in a deep breath,\"Can check this new one out later, right now I need to focus on the bomb. Come on, what do you do? The watch responded to me, right? That must mean that you can solve this!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to the bomb, she trips, and as she is falling forwards, her right arm reaches out to a nearby cubicle to catch herself. Said arm goes right through it and she slams into the side of the cubicle. \"Ow\", she says, freeing her arm, \"how did that....! Could it be that....\". Grabbing one of the now scattered guns, she clenches her fist and it was like crumpling paper. The crushed gun falls to the floor and she heads over to the bomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I get it now. This girl has super strength, at least compared to the others. She is even stronger than Raven!\". Looking at the bomb, \"Guess I'm suppose to use her to move this thing. Thankfully, it seems that this thing will only go off if given a signal or the timer runs out, moving it shouldn't set it off\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her arms around the large device, which is twice as tall as her with the width of a large barrel, her suspicions are confirmed when nothing happens. \"The plan.....Get this as high as possible to minimize damage. Best that this thing doesn't go off in the middle of a building this tall\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe starts to lift the device; however, this was when something strange started happening to her. She finds that the device is getting lighter and easier to carry, at first she doesn't understand why, but her confusion didn't last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bomb lifts off the ground, her body starts to vibrate, without her noticing. While nothing seems different, a few seconds later you can clearly see what's happening to her. Her backside seems to be.....growing? Wait, it's not just that, but her whole body is getting bigger by the second! Her eyes were closed while she lifted, so she didn't notice until she decided to find out why it was getting easier to move it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a scream so loud that it cracks glass, she is now 30 feet tall with her body spread across this floor. \"WHAT!? HOW!? I'M HUGE!!!!!!\". The shock and awe that she was getting from her new giant form quickly faded when the bomb beeped again, showing that only 1 minute was left till detonation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! I can figure this out later! Need to get rid of this! But how? I could just break the glass windows on this floor and throw it away, but everyone outside will see me. I mean, I could also break through the floors and throw it straight up, but that would damage the building when I don't need to. Not much time left. What should I do!?\"</span></div></div>",

Holding the bomb in her left hand, she uses her free one to make a hole in the side of the building. The glass wall shatters and easily crumples as she enlarges the hole, making sure that none of the glass falls onto the people below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting as close as she can to the hole with her enlarged body, she thrusts her left arm through the hole, \"ok, here we go\", saying to herself as she lowers her arm as for down the side of the building that she can. With all of the strength she hurls the bomb far into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soars past the top of the building and continues far up into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive explosion then breaks the silence. The force of the blast is so strong that the shock wave from the explosion hits the city below, cracking and shattering glass around the area of the building the bomb came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the large fireball fading away and a unnatural silence below, she pulls her arm back into the building and as best as she can with what little space she has, she lays on her back and breathes a sigh of relief, \"oh thank god that worked.....\". Her heart racing, she lays there for a moment to calm herself and collect her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later she sits up, \"I need to get going. Gotta get out of here before I'm found......How do I go back to my normal size?\". This was when she remembered what Silstes had told her back when she first received her powers. \"Maybe I just have to concentrate and I'll shrink back down? Maybe?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few more minutes of concentrating before the room around her gets bigger and she returns to her normal size. Taking a few steps away from the window, she says out loud, \"now that I'm back to normal, I just have to get out of this building without being caught.....with police everywhere, cameras focused on the building, and the sewers are probably filled with the other thugs and maybe police as well by now......Great. This is going to be interesting.....\".</span></div></div>",

Closing her eyes, she raises and cups her hands around her ears. They move and twitch as she uses her superior hearing for anything in this echo chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought. With that loud explosion detonating out there, the police have stormed the building.....They are only two floors bellow me.....This sound though.....Heavy footsteps. Swat? Riot Gear? Doesn't matter. I'll be long gone gone before they get here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes, she opens the watch and changes to Raven. \"Alright! Here we go!\". Using her superior agility, and small size, she jumps down the hole using ledges, maintenance access points, and the walls themselves to work her way back to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLanding on the top of the elevator, she opens the top hatch and peeks inside, to her surprise, the camera in it was been smashed, \"guess they didn't want to be recorded\", she says out loud while dropping down. Ready for a fight, she pries the doors open and leaps forward......Only to finds that the parking garage was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, there has been some changes. The entrance in front of the other elevator has been blocked with cars and other debris. The entrance into the underground garage had also been heavily barricaded. All cameras have been destroyed and everything in the way from the hole to the sewer and the elevator that she just left had been cleared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the sewer hole, she begins to hear noises coming from it, as she gets closes, the sounds become more distinct and clear. Raven parks herself next to the hole and listens. Further down, she can hear men shouting and lots of gunshots echoing through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Guess that means that the police stopped them from leaving and now there's a firefight happening in the sewer. Question is, how do I deal with this? Should I help? Should I try to slip past?\".</span></div></div>",

In exchange for granting our partner powers and so on, the human, in return, will provide us a place to stay.<br>\r\nKaren: That doesn't sound so bad.<br>\r\nWillow: Yes, well, its not what you think. Another thing about my kind is that we like to experiment, test, and explore, I believe you call them scientists.

All finished!<br>\r\nKaren: What did you do to me?<br>\r\nWillow: I made you into my home and lab, like we agreed.<br>\r\nKaren: T-that didn't feel like that was all you did.<br>\r\nWillow: Yeah, and you'd be right about that. There wasn't enough space, never is. Though you were my first one. What I did was completely arrange how your body works.<br>\r\nKaren:.....Huh?<br>\r\nWillow: I basically hollowed out your body.<br>\r\nKaren: Hollowed.....out.....<br>\r\nWillow: Yeah, I made it so that every \"entrance\" of yours is accessible to me, shrunk, moved, changed, and enhanced all of your bodies systems, organs, and so on. For example, your organs, heart, liver, I took all of them, greatly reduced them in size, made them far more efficient than what they were, changed what they looked like, and stashed them away into a small corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren is too stunned for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWillow: Well, with that, you should rest. It will take some time for you body to adapt to it's internal changes. Take a nap, while I make myself at home inside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy walks down her stomach, and pushes lets herself back inside her new home. Karen, just lays back down. Though she is both upset, surprised, and just plain confused, she has to admit that Willow was right. She is exhausted. So she easily falls asleep.....</span></div></div>",

After she recovers, Nathan uses a wet towel to help clean her up.<br>\r\nNathan&amp;Megan:......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan: I guess we just wait for it to wear off....<br>\r\nMegan: Yeah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while they wait, Nathan keeps playing with her by petting, stroking, and massaging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, and Nathan gets an idea.<br>\r\nNathan: Hey, I just got an idea.<br>\r\nMegan: Uhhhh.....Wh-what......?<br>\r\nThose 2 spells in the beginning that are different. What if they are some kind of reversal spells?<br>\r\nMegan:.....!!!!!Of course. They are the only 1s that stand out and still look like spells!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan, still naked, stands on the table that they were using and waits for Nathan to try 1 of the spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reads it......they wait......and nothing......<br>\r\nMegan: Thats odd....try the other 1.<br>\r\nNathan: Ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reads the other spell that stood out......and......Sarah suddenly shoots back to her original height.<br>\r\nMegan: !!!! I'm back to normal! That must be a reversal spell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hugs him, then realizing what shes doing, lets go, \"uh, this whole day has been throwing me off\".<br>\r\nNathan: Yeah...but what do yo expect? We found an actual magic book and we're figuring out how it workds!<br>\r\nMegan: This is something we've only dreamed and wished of finding and being able to do!<br>\r\nNathan: But we still don't know what the other spell does, the 1 that didn't work.<br>\r\nMegan: Yeah, I though about that. Try reading it again.<br>\r\nNathan: Ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does......and.....Megan begins to shrink again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: I though so. 1 reveres the spell, and the other 1 recasts the last 1 used. Make sure you jot these 1s down too.<br>\r\nNathan: Alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe restores her, and with a clean slate. They get ready for the next spell.</span></div></div>",

I-I think its affecting me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puts a hand on the table, to help balance herself, but her hand had changed. Her hand was gone, and it it's place, a stub. She freaks out and looks at her other hand, it changes into a stub right before her eyes. Nathan goes over to her just as she shrinks a few inches. He puts his hands on her as her feet become stubs as well. She continues to shrink and Nathan notices something, it was her skin, it was starting to feel like a soft piece of cloth. Then it hits them. She was transforming into some kind of stuffed toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes another minute for the transformation to complete. Nathan is now holding a plushy version of Megan. Her clothes had shrunk with her this time as she smiles with her fixed expression on her face. She was only a foot tall. Nathan jots down what this spell did and starts to examine Megan. He rubs his hand all over her soft body, and gives her a few hugs. He then places her on the table and just looks at her. he couldn't help but marvel at how well she was made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan: Ok. Thats probably enough. Time to change you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the reversal spell, she changes back to being human and to her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: T-that was interesting\", she says, blushing.<br>\r\nNathan: I liked that 1.

He will let him stay at his Inn over the break.<br>\r\nAlex: Just don't regret it. I did try to keep you all out for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his friends coming over, Alex hurries home to prepare. He enters through the front, grabs what looks like a phone next to the door, \"In an hour or so, some of my friends will be coming over. Since they will be finding out about this place, I ask you all that you at least go easy on them for their first night here.....\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the friends coming over:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: Short brown hair and blue eyes slightly smaller than average chest.<br>\r\nJackie: Long black hair and green eyes average chest.<br>\r\nTiffany: Medium length yellow hair, brown eyes, large chest.<br>\r\nKeith: Short black hair and black eyes.<br>\r\nZack: Short light brown hair, blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts a very large Inn located just outside of town. The 5 friends of the Inn owner arrive and go into the lobby. The lobby looks like it was prepared for rich and important guests, with stairs leading up to several floors and elevators on either side of the large room. They see Alex at the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith: Wow, what a place you've got here!<br>\r\nMegan: Yeah! I had no idea that your family is loaded!<br>\r\nAlex: No. My family isn't, well, my grandfather was. My father decided not to take over, but I did. My parent's don't even live near the city.<br>\r\nThis shocked them.<br>\r\nJackie: Your living alone? And running this place all by yourself!?<br>\r\nTiffany: H-how are you able to do this and your schoolwork?<br>\r\nAlex: I manage. I am 1 of the top students in our school.<br>\r\nZack: That's true, I'm 1 of the fewer people with higher grades. Though you do seem like you'd be capable of such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Alright, enough with the pleasant chatter. We need to assign you rooms for your stay, and I also have to give you a warning.<br>\r\nMegan: A warning?<br>\r\nAlex: Yes. This place is different, so I th-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was interrupted by someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n???: Oh! Are these them? They look so delicious~!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice belongs to a girl on the floor above them, they see her looking down at them, but as they get a better look at her, they gasp as they see something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl was leaning over the side, her large breasts bobbing over the sides. She has long black hair, and glowing red eyes. She continues, opening her mouth and revealing 2 large fangs, \"I bet their blood would be amazing!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guests just stare at her, with blank expressions on their faces.<br>\r\nAlex: Now Yulia, they just got here. Please refrain from drinking their blood until they get to their rooms.<br>\r\nYulia, with a disappointed expression, \"....Fine! Only because its you! Anyone else, and I would of drained them dry!\". She leaves, heading the way she came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex: Now, lets get you guys into your rooms,\". They look at him, then swarm him. \"W-who was that? What was with her eyes? Did she say she wanted to drink our blood!? Is this really an Inn?\", and so on.<br>\r\nAlex: Sigh, I told you that I didn't want any of you to come over, but its too late for that now.....I'll tell you everthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened a few years ago. My grandfather had just retired from running this place and wanted to give control of it to my father. In short, he refused. He was too deep into his current job to drop what he was doing to run some suspicious Inn. So, I volunteered. My parents were against it, at first, but I managed to convince them and move here. Now my father was right in his suspicions about this Inn, but he knew nothing about it. He spent most of his childhood in boarding houses and stuff and doesn't remember anything about this place when he was really young.<br>\r\nJackie: T-then what is this place?<br>\r\nMegan: Yeah! And who was that lady? She seemed....different......<br>\r\nKeith: Though she was hot.<br>\r\nEvery1: Shut up Keith.<br>\r\nThis hotel, that my grandfather started and I took over.....Was not meant for \"normal\" humans. That girl you saw is 1 of the people that live here or rent a room. She is a vampire. 1 of several kinds of beings, creatures, and so on that lives here. We have beings like that vampire and werewolves, aliens, mad scientists, demons, monsters, and far too many to go into details. This Inn is a place for them to stay, sleep, and rest. A safe place for them.<br>\r\nZack: And we are going to be living with them.....I see why you didn't want us over.<br>\r\nMegan: .....This sounds really scary.....I don't know if I want to stay now......<br>\r\nAlex: I did warn you guys several times. But you have no choice but to stay over now. So lets get you guys into your rooms......</span></div></div>",
