Though she looked bored, she was really waiting for somebody, who had promised to come over that evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang, and Aki rushed downstairs, opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Lex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Aki. Sorry about being a few minutes late, but I had to pick something up from Roxanne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.....take me upstairs and I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo both Lex and Aki climbed the stairs, and Lex sat down near the PS2 she had in her entertainment unit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the ultimate PS2 hacker's tool.\" Lex pulled out a large box, which contained a large adapter with several buttons. \"It's called The Leveler. Once I snap this on the the broadband port, we can edit just about anything you put in your PS2! From games to movies, anything's possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing! Show me how it works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....\" Lex attached it to the PS2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put a disc in, ANY disc. Or if you'd prefer, you can use the slot on the adapter to insert an N64 game or other cartridge.\" Lex said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Aki did so. Lex turned on the PS2's power and \"The Leveler\" booted up instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, I can change levels, characters, text, etc....Or on this option if it's an animation, I can draw animation myself with high-tech studio level tools.\" Lex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this button mean?\" Aki had just accidently pushed a small blue button labeled \"Direct Interaction\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Lex didn't know what that button did. He looked over to check it out. But while he was, he accidently leaned on the left stick on the controller. On the screen, he was making a number go down labeled \"Scale\". It eventually stopped at 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know what that is. I think that lets you interact with the game directly. Wanna try it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Aki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, start!\" Lex said, hitting the X button. He had no idea that he had accidently set the scale to 2 inches, and in a few seconds, they were instantly warped into.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: I've made a seperate FF section since there are several Final Fantasies. Choice limitations force me to do this.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her legs descended down to the soft and smooth bare feet that flank them from either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, forgive me tiny bugs, but this garden is my life. I sell these flowers and cannot allow you to eat them. Please understand, I don't want to squish you. I have to,\" Was a gentle plea that came from the huge girl. Lex and Aki stood in surprise. Obviously this towering flower girl knew she held all the cards, yet she was telling them her story to comfort herself from the dark task she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAeris. It didn't make any sense but that's who she was. One of the girls from the video games. It didn't take Lex long to process it. Games are full of code and conditions. This option for interaction obviously gave the users just as much freedom as the programmers, and their scale was indeed \"2\" now. Two inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex scrambled back, slamming into Aki who grabed hold of his arm for support. Both stared upward as the dusty bare sole of Aeris raised up high above them, only a few extra inches to the soft spoken flower girl. Her foot drifted forward, toes arched and ready to touch down so she could quickly dab the ball of her foot down, smushing them quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn blind panic, Aki  took off running, Lex shortly following. Aeris moaned in a frusterated tone and began padding after them, but her progress was slow. Lucky for the two shrunken gamers, Aeris was very careful about her garden. Step after step she grew closer, her toes eagerly reaching out, ready to squish one of the two bugs under a giant sized big toe. Aeris had no luck though. She simply couldn't bring herself to stomp around her own garden to take care of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex rushed over and grabbed Aki, huddling to the dry ground that the flowers somehow had managed to crack through. \"She's not going to tear appart her garden to get at us, but if we stay here forever, she'll probably eventually get one of us underfoot. This church is huge though, if we run out of the garden, we'll be on a very wide open plane of wood flooring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't stay here!\" Aki shot back, \"She won't give up, will she?\" Aeris was making her way toward them, another step held high, her foot pivoting as she looked for an opening to step down into.</span></div></div>",

What makes you think she won't give up eventually?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A curious foot prod down behind Aki as she asked that, sending her swirling around to see Aeris' giant step smush the ground beneith her. Sighing Aki began to understand. This garden was this girls life, she wouldn't just give up because she couldn't find them. She would wait them out. What else did she have to do? Did she have anything else to do? Those questions were too vast to stake their lives on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Aww, don't go that wau lil' bugs! If my big soft feet catch you out there, it'll hurt a lot to get squished into that hard wood floor!\" Aeris teased as she padded over toward them with renewed speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lex gulped, \"She wouldn't have given up anyway. I dunno about this, she sure seems to be taking a lot of pleasure in this when she was uncomfortable with it to start with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Maybe she enjoys it. She seems sort of alone here in this huge church. We're probably the first living contact she's had all day,\" Aki remarked as the clump of wooden floorboards sounded under them, followed quickly by the thick thud of Aeris' right foot landing behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Dust swirled around the flower girls mighty toes as her left foot came forward, arching over the last of the flowers to stomp down next to the right. Aki couldn't help but stare back, her eues fixated at first on the giant feet, drinking in the fact that Aeris wanted her under them. Her eyes trailed up to the huge bright eyes high above, Aeris was smiling. It was a game to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Lex came to a hault. The wall would provide some cover, making it difficult for Aeris to get a good angle to squish them underfoot. Then again, the church pews would provide great cover and allow them more time to escape. That was, if they could actually reach them before Aeris steps found them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With a knowing look, he gazed into Aki's eyes.</span></div></div>",

Aeris giant toes were arching over her and quickly descended down to trap the tiny girl under the arch of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!

The ball of her foot so close and pressing tiny pebbles to the floor and making them pop into meer grains of sand. She shivered to think of what such a massive sole could do to her own body.

The smart thing to do would be to surrender,\" Aeris suggested, her toes curling more and more, the anticipation of smushing the bug under them was a fun game for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex gulped deeply. He couldn't abandon his friend. But was this giant flower girl being honest, or would they both just end up as smears on her huge bare feet?</span></div></div>",

Don't worry. I'm expirenced in medical treatment.\" he said resurringly with a smile. Aki relucntantly did as told. Ryan started from the bottem put a bit of pressure on each rib bone. Aki fought the temptation to slap him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it hurt here.\" he said. Aki shook her head. Ryan continued until he reached right below her breasts. Aki yelped in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's start healing you.\" he said. He put both hands on the spot and focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLex was staring in another direction. Aki watched in curiosity. His body let out a blue aura. Aki started to feel a lot better. A minute later he said,\"There... it's... done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ryan collasped. Aki put on her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* Ryan always pushes himself to hard. He'll proceed through very well.\" a voice said. Aki and Lex looked at the entance. There stood the guy from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... looks like you two. Used the direct affection.\" he said. He let out a laugh. \"How ironic. Welcome aboard my vessal, the Falcon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys too.\" Lex said. ??? nodded. \"So what's up with all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. It all be-\" but he was interuppted by a violent shaking. \"Looks like we stalled too long. Ryan! Wake up!\" he kneeled next to him. Ryan was still asleep. \"Thunder!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thunder spell struck him. Ryan awoke with a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your station! Come on!\" the guy said running out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you too.\" Ryan said pulling Lex. Aki follow. They got to the front of the ship. \"Strap yourselves in.\" Ryan said jumping into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! Lower weapons energy by 50% Add that to the shields.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Captain Eddie.\" Ryan said as he began pushing buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here you are.

Aki is a 20-year old Japanese college student, whose ambition is to become a programmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them are good friends who loves video games and anime. But one day when Lex brings over an underground game modification device, their lives change forever. They are shrunk to a mere 2 inches tall and transported into a video game or anime, just like in the original Jainson incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, this is a wide-open giantess story. Just about anything except for X-rated stuff is allowed. Do NOT insert extreme sexual content. No short chapters either. Detail them and use proper grammar. Last thing: Don't kill off the main characters. You can have them have near-death experiences, but don't actually kill them off. Also, you can have some bigger males present briefly, but remember this is a <b>GTS</b> story, so keep the focus on the girls.</td>",
