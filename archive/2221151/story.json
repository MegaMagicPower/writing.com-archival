He shook his head and looked up only to see trees and bushes all around. Deep within a forest the Eevee looked around confused and worried, where exactly he was he did not know but one thing was for sure, he was lost and afraid. Eevee stood up onto his feet, anxious about how he would get out of this forest with various directions to choose from. The sunlight seemed brighter just north of him, perhaps that was the edge of the forest, but there would likely be more pokemon that way... To the east was a creek that led down no doubt to a nearby lake, would the lake lead out of the forest? Just west of him, the forest became rocky similar to a mountain, maybe there was a mountain he could scale to get an overlook of the forest. South of the Eevee the forest seemed more dense and less light shined through, it might be longer, but it's less likely for him to run into other pokemon, but why risk any of that? He could simply just stay where he is and hope everything will turn out fine.</span></div></div>",

Pokemon species from all regions from Kanto to Galar reside within the forest all awaiting for him to stumble by them.
