The only thing is to leave *around* your boss, Mrs. Laney, so she won't get on to you for leaving technically early.  As you put on your coat and stand up, you realize, your clothes seem ever so slightly looser than they did in the morning, but you don't think anything of it; the important thing is to skirt the old taskmaster.  Heh, old, she's only 30, but she got to be manager fairly early by that hard-driving, take no prisoners work ethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaney is on the phone with a customer, great.  Your account logged off, you grab your bag, leave your cubicle, and walk around the other side of the cube bank.  \"See you Monday Ron\" the smoking hot receptionist Laura says on your way out.  She's another Laney-type, dark hair, brown eyes, svelte body and the instincts of a killer, but she's just a receptionist since she's only 19.  You'd talked with her a little about why she chose to go right into work instead of the more traditional route of  dicking around a few years in college, maybe learning something, but, she seemed to know what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately not everyone in the office was a shark.  On your way out you gave a wink or air five to Helen and Scott, both in their late thirties, whom you'd talked with about going to get drinks tomorrow night.  Tonight, though, it was all about a hot date with Kate.  You'd gotten reservations at a three star restaurant and were going to show her a very, very good time.  It was kind of hard with the two of you working different hours most of the week, you'd just come home, eat, welcome her in late, and go to bed, but you both had Saturdays off so Friday was the traditional date night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate, whom you'd been going out with for almost a year and living with for a couple months, was 5'5\" and curvy, with a very light complexion, and dyed blonde hair.  She worked evenings at a fashionable clothing store and so usually wore flats with whatever was current and within dress code.</span></div></div>",

Kate didn't tell you but she also saw a slight change meant in your height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had however to stop thinking of it and focus on the day coming. You parked you car and when you got out of it you faced the only person you wanted not to see , Lauren .<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ron \" she said with her too usual superior tone <br>\r\n\"Hi...\" you briefly answered with a fake smile on your face .<br>\r\nLauren was kind of the office jerk , she was competiting with you at work as your boss announced she will give a promotion to one of you. On the contrary of her you were not too much attracted by money , you just didn't want to offer this bitch a chance to boss you around as she will get higher responsibility in the enterprise . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both of you walked along heading to the office and you noticed that she was clearly slightly taller than you . You were a bit surprised by this as she usually were you size with her heels on . <br>\r\nLauren was 5'6\" tall without any heels on . You looked at her shoes and saw that it wasn't new shoes , in fact you remembered she wore it ( you sometimes stared at her dangling her shoes while working )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you were one of the first in here and you both go to work on your respective computer . <br>\r\nAfter several minutes you glance at her and seing her deep in her work made you lose willness and you yawned . <br>\r\nJust at this moment Laney came in and looked at you with a quizzical eye .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\" you thought before launching you back on your computer <br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone \" \"Good Morning \" Laurene answered cheerfully , happy this whole scene happened .<br>\r\nYou also shyly welcomed her while focusing back on your work .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the break you stayed with Scott Helen and a few other colleagues, noticing they also seemed a bit taller than usual .<br>\r\nYou asked Helen to come with you and when you only were the two of you you asked her if you looked smaller than before , she just laughed at you at first then was a bit doubting when you told her your usual height <br>\r\n\"hmm are you sure you are that height ? My husband is this size but I'm kind of sure he his taller than you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she told you puzzled you for the whole day , were you shrinking ? It was impossible !

You continued to shrink during the week almost feeling like every victory Laurene got over you made you smaller. When you saw her this morning coming in at the same time that you do you hide around the corner so because when she noticed your size about three days ago she has been doing daily size comparisons as a confidence boost. You know you were 5'3\" last time she compared to you but, you avoided her yesterday so she probably had at least 4\" on you now. When you walk in you see that Laurene went straight into Laney's office. You feel a sinking feeling in your stomach and practically feel a shrinking confidence. You get started on you work but, soon get called into Mrs. Laney's office. Laurene holds the door for you and smiles as she sees that you now 5' now a head smaller then her in today's heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Laney starts, \"Well Ron as you know the promotion was up for grabs for both of you and you really dropped the ball.\" looking directly at you. \"Laurene on the other hand has just set the company record for sales in a week. So clearly you both know who I would choose for the promotion but, the higher ups have called and offered Laurene a job upstairs. The reason your in here Ron was going to be so I can fire you but then Laurene considers you a bit of a good luck charm so you will be moved with her as a personal assistant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meeting ends with both of you being told to box up your desks to move which you spend the rest of the day doing. Towards the end of the day Laurene comes up to you and pats the top of your head. \"You excited to start work as my assistant little boy,\" She asks. You try to shrug her off but then she says. \"Hey you were going to get fired today if it wasn't for me so you better come tomorrow knowing I'm why you still work here.</span></div></div>",

The bed was in a huge bedroom of the flat ,there also was a balcony , a bathroom a kitchen and a restroom, a really beautifull full equipeped design house rented 1100$ a mounth. Unfortunately too much to you now. It was a bit difficult to undergo because if you hadn't fail to get promoted and demoted instead, you wouldn't have been this embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were used to your girlfriend taking some distances lately , you understand her as she has a lot of work and do it at home sometimes . You disliked even if she didn't introduced you to him the guy she named \"Tom\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt beginning a few weeks ago you remembered she received an invitation on facebook ,Tom\" something\"  she asked you if you knew him you said no , you even joked by saying she should accept him. she apparently did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then she began having friendly walks, then friendly dinners , then parties. She had offered you to come sleep with her at his place , this man seemed to have been in the same high school you did back in the days.Today he was the kind of rich guy you overheard. He lives with his sister  and they are trully going well together she had said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really wanted to ask more question about this Tom , but tonight you'll do it...Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate came back drunk at 2 AM , you were relieved and happy of your girlfriend she didn't spend the night with the other weirdo.

I ...I need your help to p..pay the rent\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what happend ?\"  she dumbly asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have found a new job but I have to move stuffs there so it takes time and ....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't understand why she chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow !

She rose her hand and gestured you to kiss it , and you did it and submitedly said thank you , as her presence had overcrushed you tonight. She then went to bed and  you heard her moan un her room later. She was probably having private fun session. It greatly drove you insane and you began jacking off , it seemed you'd not have sex for some time for now ....You heard as if she was speaking but could only hear mumble.You could at least have some satisfaction like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day , you shrunk again , you were 4'0, the quickest shrinking spurt you had since Lauren's promotion. You quickly stressed as you woke to late and had to rush in order to be in time.<br>\r\nYour girlfriend was on the phone with this Tom again. Her face seemed so bright , you hadn't seen her smile like that in a long time . At least she's happy to speak to him , he's probably just a friend. You forced your thoughts <br>\r\nshe had finished eating and forgot to say goodbye when she left.<br>\r\n You almost left without taking your boss , Laurene's shoes back , she promised you there was no more chances.<br>\r\nYour fear of her increased 100 times when you saw your girlfriend had locked the door before leaving , letting you no other choice than confronting her.</span></div></div>",

She even had the nerve to ask you to give her your hand so you'd look even more childish.<br>\r\nThe problem was your clothes had outgrew you and you didn't have enough money to buy new ones since you had spend the rest of your money buying Laurene's shoes because of your ex girlfriend... <br>\r\nYou were totally broke right now and wondered how will you sleep tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene brought you to a restaurant. You couldn't resist staring at her huge ass as it was eye level with you. The waitress guided both of you to a table and your face turned white when you saw the price of the plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven basic fries costed 15 bucks. It was more than expensive . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene without even consulting you called the waitress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take a Rumsteak and give him a child menu.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Madam \" Said the blonde waitress before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kinda relieved to see she had chosen a child menu , that was probably the only thing you could afford here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So tell me freak , you have a place to stay tonight ?\" Said your gigantic former rival<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm , I'm not sure , I think I'll stay in my car until I find a place to live..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I won't accept having an homeless person working for me.

Please!\" A few weeks ago you'd have enough dignity to not beg Laurene for anything but right now , she basically had your life in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm , maybe we can find out something...\" She said thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kinda scared about what she was going to say next.

She had placed his bed right at the end left side of hers. Next to her slippers. Ron felt tears forming in his eyes while he thought of his future if he stay here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so uncomfortable he couldn't find sleep. The poor man even missed sleeping on Kate's couch now. Since he was awake he evaluated his options. Staying with Laurene couldn't be good. His boss already had crushed all his will in a matter of seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis options were limited , and both would have critical consequences. First one was leaving. If he left his new place he could still live in his car until he gets too small. The problem was he didn't have any money anymore so he couldn't even pay fuel for his car, or even worst , to buy food. <br>\r\nThe second was unthinkable, Ron tried not to think too much about it. He could stay like a good dog here and try to please his former rival to be fed and housed by her. It was destroying him thinking being at her feet and so much dependant of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning the small man was woken up by Laurene's foot lightly kicking his weak body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey bitch, wake up !\" She ordered , still sitting on her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon woke up , lost until he realised the huge foot resting on his back and pushing him around.<br>\r\nHe stood up to look at his boss. Laurene was still towering over his 3'7\" puny height, she smirked while passing her hands in her long brown hair. <br>\r\nShe was kind of hot Ron thought while seeing her only dressed with a panty and a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slept well shrimp ?\" She said looking down on him, her vicious dominating smile felt heavily humiliating for the weak man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes..\" He answered frowning, she was truly despicable<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene saw his frowning face , she immediatly switched her tone to a more patronishing one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey , quite that look of yours. You should be gratefull to have a boss like me. Else you'd be living in a dumpster. Do you want to live in a dumpster bitch ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicturing that , Ron felt shiver down his spine. He immediatly lowered his head and apologized to his boss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Laurene.\" He said with a scared trembling voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"give me my slippers now.\" She just answered . Ron kneeled to put her slippers on her big feet. He saw she had black nail polish and kinda had a well curved foot with long toes. Her feet seemed to be pretty well being take care of. It had no calluses and her white sole was really soft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna take a shower now. So you'll get breakfast ready before I'm finished .\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon just had the time to shook his head in agreement that Laurene stood up, by stepping outside the bedroom she walked on his bed . She was trully not respecting him he thought. Maybe he should have been more kind with her when he was normal size. She surely wouldn't have been so mean to him if they didn't use to be rivals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a pretty decent flat for a single woman. About an hundred square meters for herself may be pretty costy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon prepared pancakes and poured orange juice for Laurene and himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat at the table waiting his boss to eat. <br>\r\nLaurene came back after ten minutes of wait. She was already dressed up for work , but kept her slippers for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene stood still looking at the little man. \"Silly silly boy. That's not where you're expecting to eat. She then took Ron's plate away and poored the food in a small cup. She then turned back to him. <br>\r\n\"You're expected to eat down on the floor , and not with your hands. Just eat like the good puppy you are.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon felt totally humiliated. He was expected to eat just next to Laurene's filthy feet ?! In a dog cup ?! The dog collar she forced him to wear was hurting so much too. Everything was for the worst. <br>\r\nThe human pet thought about all those facts for a second and ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You stepped aside to have a better look to see your former office friend Helen.  It was surprising to see how huge she was to you now. The last time you talked to her this 5'6\" woman was just a few inches taller. Now you were 4'6\" the height difference was drastic. Your forehead didn't even reach her breast now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could greet her Laurene snapped her fingers .\" Hey , wake up hurry up ! Open the suitcase !\" The dominating brunette ordered you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened it and gave Helen's file to your boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy. \" Laurene said , lifting it from your hands and handing it to her colleague. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared awkwardly into Helen's eyes, you couldn't tell if it was a pityfull look , or a disgusted one in her eyes.

Since it was your first day of work you didn't have a lot of visits , and people looked at you in a weirded out way. You basically had the whole day to think of great ideas such as keeping objects for whoever wanted to dropp something. Then writing an ad \" If you need me I'm here !\" .

That was truly embarassing. <br>\r\nOnce Laura's door reached Ron knocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall receptionnist came out almost immediately, she had been waiting his visit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hey Rony ! Glad you could make it , come in ! \" She said smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I can't stay to long I have to be home early else Kate will not be happy\" The shruken man mumbled while coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura didn't seem to care or maybe she didn't hear what he said and closed the door behind him then walking backward she said \"Go wait in the living room I've a gift to you !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon admired her living room, not too tall , but enough for a free young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura came back holding two bags of clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know they look like a lot but I need you so much to do that , I don't even have a washing machine here and have to use the shop downstairs to clean my cloth , it's such a pain in the ass you know!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly you said \"No problem , I owed you one for Laurene...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's right , she's been kinda rough on you I was thinking... But what'll do when you'll shrink too much ?\" She answered innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe simple thought of that scared you more than anything. What will happen to you when you get too small to do anything ? The doctor wasn't answering and you didn't even have time to check for others because of this whole situation... Maybe a friend wouldn't be too much to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see doctors to try and have a vacin or something.\" You said after thinking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura placed her on her laps and said \"Hm , that sucks.... I hope you'll find something soon, I have to do something can you drive back tomorrow ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then guided politely out of her place and so you went to clean her clothes at the exact place she showed you. The whole cleaning took about half an hour, you were home just in time to make dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Laura had been saving you again , Laurene asked you had helped anyone else at work and Laura came in to make you photocopy and archive files. <br>\r\nShe then had you directly ask other employees if they needed anything , there were 3 types , thoses who were embarrast , like your friend Helen. <br>\r\nThose who didn't care or acted like or those who jumped on the occasion like Rebecca , a red haired girl from the finance department. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was kind of a young smart woman, after a while of sharply downtalking to you (you were in her office bringing her cofee) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There , a nice hot cofee for a young lady\" You said , happy to have been of an help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ron for the help, I might give a word or two to the big boss \" The fact either she referred to Laney , or Laurene completely made you shiver when she call one of her \"big boss\", they were trully big to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks !\" You felt so much like shit under Laurene's command and at your size you couldn't even dare to call by her name a young woman or look at her in the eyes , the shock of what had happened at home didn't help , you were almost scared of them now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way , are the clothes clean ?\" She suddenly said while drinking her cofee, and raising an eyebrown while looking at Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised , he tried to act, \"Wh...What clothes ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ones you are cleaning for Laura, she can't hide me anything , we're like BF\" She added, coldly with a trace of irony in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...Yes , I've cleaned it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, cause I'll need you to clean mines tomorrow ok ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon wanted to yell no, but what will happen if he did ? This bitch would probably tell everyone else about him. Seeing his hesitating she offered him a deal . <br>\r\n\"Listen shorty , I'm not against you ...not with you for sure but I'll make you a deal. You come once a day for one hour to help me AND you do my laundry , in exhange , I promise not to tell anyone about your clothes cleaning fantasy ok ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't a fantasy at all , but if the rumor were spreading , what will you become ? You were so low, but was it worthy to risk falling even lower right now ? <br>\r\nYou decided to comply with her demand even if it drove you crazy doing so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18:00<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon arrived at Laura's place , he deeply hesitated arguing with her, she was the only help he had at work , yet the fact she told about you to this red haired girl was truly annoying him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura opened the door, she was truly gigantic compared to the small man,at 4'0 he is reaching her navel right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even pated his head matroningly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow , I didn't see , you have shrunken so much the last few days, you truly are a cuty boy now . Come in Rony !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed her and dropped the bags, you decided to.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe they'll even learn to appreciate him this way, he trully needed allies to help him against Laurene who truly looked like she wanted to ruin his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are I've cleaned all \" Ron said , dropping the bags in the corridor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ron , you're the best !\" Laura said happily , she bent to give a kiss on his head and added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a movie to you want to stay a little ?\" Her offer was more than welcomed as you , it was saturday so you had plenty times to chill away from Kate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Ron stayed , sat next to Laura on the couch, if he was used to compare height with Kate at home , comparing his diminushed size to the giant blond receptionnist was terifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie wasn't that bad , it was \"22 jump street\" , a comedy that the shrinking man heard of before but never seen. <br>\r\nAfter a while , Laura changed position in order to have her feet on the couch, while lying a bit more on it. The pair of gigantic feet were just inches away from him , the forced foot rubs sessions he had to do at home flashed in his head as he observed them. <br>\r\nHis embarrassement was seen by Laura, who wiggled her feet around when she saw he was fixing them. In a movement of head he looked at her smiling face. <br>\r\n\"Hey Rony, my feet are so sore from the jog I made earlier, maybe you'd ...\" She added , already moving her foot towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu...Sure...\" Ron said when they were already on his lap. At his size , they were pretty heavy , her toes almost reached his chin . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while , Laura went a bit more playfull , and sometimes poked his face with her long toes or rubed his her with her sole. <br>\r\nIt was truly embarrassing for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Rony , what do you think about my feet ?\" She added , smiling playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th..They're so long to me now...\" He answered , not wanting to fall in her game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they're beautiful ?\" She said , rising one to his face level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..Yeah sure !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell him Rony !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating , Ron decided to play her game and said ,<br>\r\n\"You are really beautiful , Laura's foot\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a little , seeing her shrunken colleague holding and speaking to her foot , then moved it close to his mouth for him to peck it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo cute ! \" She then said before continuing \"You know , you could get closer to them if you want. \"Her wink made him shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Laura, I'm not really into feet \" He shyly said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cm'on no need to try and hide that, everyone knows that you do ! It's ok , there's nothing to be scared about.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No , really I'm not !\" Ron tried to argue as trustfully as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah , yeah whatever Rony , you can still rub them \" She just answered , seeming to be bored of his pleas and went back on watching the movie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you had to rub her foot during the whole movie, you had for first time in a while appreciated the time. At home , Kate prohibited you to turn on the TV cause it was making noise and bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  When the movie stopped , both of you stood up , with you not even reaching her navel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rony , I've another favor to ask you, my sink kinda broke and I've no one else to call to help me would you....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late, already 11:15 and he was expected to go home to cook . Ron tried to call Kate to warn her he'll be late but her phone didn't hang up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Ron half an hour to take care of Laura's task. She kindly gave him another kiss on his cheek , it made him blush. \"See you soon Rony !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving back to his place , Ron knoked on the door. He had gently lent his keys to Tom so he couldn't come home if they weren't there. Unfortunately he waited for a good 2 hours before receiving Kate's message, She and Tom went on a loving week end together , they'll only be back sunday night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnraged for having missed them at midday Ron stayed in his car thinking of a thing to do, he didn't have much battery left so he couldn't even use his smartphone to spend time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Until now you didn't find a place that suited you or that accepted your conditions. There was a little crappy 200 dollar flat you have found but her owner seemed way too interrested in your shrinking condition that the whole conversation during the visiting turned around that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the flat (Eva) seemed like a tall athletic Gratuated girl. You heard she was kind of related to rich people in her family but she didn't talk too much about it.

Kate probably never told him you were her ex boyfriend , you thanked her to have done that... You fell so low for her you accepted to clean her shoe to try to get on her good side, but the more time passed the less she seemed to care.

You there ?\" Said your giant promoted rival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling you like that made her think of a joke she couldn't resist to make<br>\r\n\"Can everyone look under his shoe ?\" The worst was everyone was laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red haired girl that Ron didn't know grabbed your shoulder , maybe she was a bit tipsy but her grab hurted pretty bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's here !\" She said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene then said in a babyishing way \"Aww there you are little man , I didn't see you, come over here !\" <br>\r\nThe reduced Ron timidly stepped looking at his colleagues that smirked at him, He saw Helene laughing when a random other person made what seemed to be a joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Laura were standing face to Laurene and Mrs Laney. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene spoke. \"Laura, we already told about it so I'll make it quick, we've decided that you were to take Ron's office and replace him since he no longer suits the job. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god ! I'll Do my best thank you\" Laura was almost crying in tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ridiculous Ron looked up to his former rival, now boss with what was left of your courage. She was so gigantic now, her barely reached her navel .The saler saw her huge sluty face looking down at him and smirking.She even had to bent to have a proper sight of him. Just looking at her made the small man's stomach rumble weirdly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ron, I wanted to congratulate you for your hard working in the company.\" She said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon had heard rumors that they were planning to fire him since he did awful results, and it was getting even worst everyday. Ron looked at Laurene pleadingly. Doing so<br>\r\nhe felt a weird feeling he had preceding a shrinking spurt, the problem was it was like...Growing, bigger as he felt more humilitated. It was getting really hard to resist now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you had been someone hard worker in the past, and since I'm such a good boss, I'll annonce you we found you a new job !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused a second , the small Ron was terrified and devastated, he felt like he had to let it go and shrink as it was getting too overwhelming to resist the shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have decided to make you , Laura's official assistant !\" She said it and everyone turned their attention at the new assistant as he bent a little from a thing he couldn't hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly began to shrink unstopably. When Ron began able to go back to his feet he saw what was happening. \"N..No...\" He looked at everyone fixing him silently. Ron looked up, Laurene seemed marveled by that, she was bitting her lips from exitment probably. Laura also seemed deeply analyzing what was going on, even Laney was stepping closer to have a view. He saw their faces slowly going higher, as their whole body increased in size slowly . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts came back of the horrifying moments he was just living and he felt an enhancement even higher of the shrinking spurt.He slowly stopped at 3'6\" while Laurene had followed his shrinking making a sound for it. She pressed her finger on the small demoted man's head . \"Oh . It has stopped.... So what do you say Ron ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene really didn't let him any time for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh..What do you want me to say ? \" He tried to say defiantly while standing now as tall as one of her leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaurene took as step to him and stopped so close to him that she had to look all the way down to see him. It was trully intimidating for the small man. <br>\r\n\"And how about , Thanks ?\" She sternly looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small man let go all his proud aside and accepted the truth, it was hard keeping a rival relation with her now. It was so annoying to picture her as his boss now. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th...Thanks boss...\" He mumbled .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh , No , I'm not reaally your boss.... You know, Laura is your boss now, I'm more like the boss of your boss now. Wow , that sounds a bit downgrading , sorry about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last time you had Laurene's attention, she then went to party with her closest colleagues while Laura scolded you for being such an awkward person.<br>\r\nBoth Ron and her were at the buffet right now, eating. \"Hu... You're so awkward ! You've humiliated us !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B..But , Laura , you've been promoted and...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah , and you demoted , so try to call me by my name again and I get you right out the street got it ?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact she was his direct superior now made Ron think straight . He couldn't risk to lose the job , what would Kate think if he does. <br>\r\n\"Sure boss ! Sorry!\" He tried to be fun and bent in order to show his appologised but his hand knoked The Giantess Laura's hand and made fall a food right on her heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck ! Look at what you've done twerp !\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh!! Sorry boss !\" Ron rushed around but found nothing to clean her shoe of , he then went on his knees and rubbed with his cloth the creme off her foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust in that time Helen , his former friend came in, he was not used to see her dressed up, but she was pretty in this suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wow , you've really have fallen down Ron.\" She said when you raised up to say hi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha , yeah, I just poured something on Laur....my boss's shoes so I wanted to clean it.\" Ron tried to fake a smile and at least was satisfied to hear her laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, yeah that's normal Ron. Way to go !\" She said , before turning her attention to Laura<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulation to your promotion , I'm sure we'll work well together !\" She continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon thought if Laura was his boss now, What would that make Helen to him ? He realised it was stupid thinking about that. The post was created just to keep him around. The small man still hopped that Laura could help him and eventually tell Laurene he has improved, that it would eventually make him promoted back ? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at all the other persons, that were having fun while he followed his new boss around like a dog while she was congratulated by everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a favor since she didn't have to be up herself another couple hours, but, she'd largely taken on your burdens in addition to your own, so while clearly unhappy to have gotten so little sleep, she was also kind of used to it.  She poured two bowls of cereal for your breakfast, you getting the smaller bowl, and you sat around the table eating quietly.  As she was done, without noticing you had a couple spoonfuls left, she said \"let's get your daily measurement\" and went to the ruler you'd pasted onto the wall.  Standing next to each other you looked ahead at Kate's chin as she marked your new height off with a marker.  \"You're just barely over 4'7\" today, honey, the shrinking may be slowing down yet\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hoped so too.  Anyway, you got into your work clothes (the manliest extra-small pantsuit Kate could buy with her employee discount), got in the car, and went to work.  You were of course sitting on all your phonebooks; you hoped you really did stop shrinking soon so that you could at least keep driving if nothing else.  You were a couple minutes late, but it was easy to slip in now you were getting smaller.  You checked your email.  One message, from Mrs. Laney.  \"Be in my office at 9 sharp.\"  Damnit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over, this time waving to Laura, and gently opened the door to Laney's office.  \"Yes Mrs. Laney?\"  You asked, a little timidly.  \"Come in, shut the door behind you,\" she said.  You did so, then sat in a chair across the desk from her.  Your feet barely touched the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were late again this morning, runt, and don't think just because you're shrinking I don't expect the same results out of you.\"  What a bitch!  You were late, and it wasn't the first time, but considering, -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you understand?\"  \"Of course Mrs. Laney.\"  \"Good.  Stand up, come over to this side, I want to see something.\"  You did as told; Laney pushed out from her desk and stood up next to you.  With her heels she was over a foot taller than you, and her grin indicated that she loved it.  \"That's all I needed,\" she said, but as she sat back down she knocked a pen off her desk.  \"Will you pick that up for me?\"  You quickly got on your hands and knees to look for it, since you didn't want to invite the comparison that she was almost taller now sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaney had always been aggressive but she'd taken a special liking to lording over you; last week she was talking about making you her personal assistant, since soon your stature would make meeting with clients impractical, and she still wanted you to be \"useful.\"  When you spotted the pen under her desk, you leaned forward, grabbed it, and stopped when you felt a heeled pump shoe land deliberately on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm just seeing if you'll make a good footrest.  You have a little more shrinking to do little man.\"  Laney almost cackled.  Then there was silence; you were so embarassed that you didn't dare turn your head upward to see her domineering gaze.  For about ten seconds you just felt her leg balance on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock at the door saved you.  \"Get up,\" she said, putting her foot down right under your head.  You carefully crawled back out so as not to hit your head and handed her the pen.  \"Quarterly is due next Friday,\" Laney reminded you, \"and you have a lot of work to do to catch up to your quota.\"  Really!?  You'd been at the doctors for nearly a week trying to figure this whole shrinking thing out!  Not to mention more and more of your work time was sacrificed to head games under Laney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Mrs. Laney, I'll make it.\"  What else could you say?  She told the knocker, another manager from a different department, to come in, and the visitor looked down and smiled at you on your way out.  It seemed everyone was looking down at you by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately the rest of the day went without much more human interaction; your confidence shaken, you chose to work through a pile of paperwork you'd been building up instead of making any of the calls that you needed.  Helen noticed you were gloomy and tried to cheer you up with a cookie at lunch, but other than that, you avoided everyone until 5, and in fact stayed over a little longer to avoid having to say bye on your way out.  This meant you walked out behind Laura.  Your new height gave you a great view of her ass swaying; that actually made you pretty cheery up until you got to your car and saw the phonebooks again, a reminder of your unfortunate circumstance.</span></div></div>",

Did short people feel like this all the time?  You pondered for a bit when Dr. Marquez opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hola Ron, now I understand that you have this very unusual condition; please tell me everything you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I've been shrinking; I didn't notice until Sunday; so far I've lost about four inches.  I haven't had much of an appetite - I've barely been able to keep anything down in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much have you eaten this week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to force myself Tuesday but I threw up after I had a hamburger.  I've just had water and toast in the mornings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...when you called in and said that you were shrinking I honestly didn't believe you but your symptoms line up with a disease that we previously thought was just an old Mexican myth.  You will forgive me for being almost excited about your case, but we may learn very much about the human body from your condition.  I did make contact with a researcher at Capital Hospital.  She'll be wanting to talk to you since you have definitely verifiably shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I going to be lab rat?\"  You shuddered.  What if it never ended?  You might literally be a lab rat, in size anyway, in a matter of days.  It felt that way.  Calm down, you thought to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Marquez did her best to assuage your apprehension.  \"No no, Ron, of course not.  You'll certainly have informed consent at every stage of the process, even if you one day fit in my hand, hehe.\"  You didn't laugh.  She continued:  \"But of course we expect to reverse this long before that point.  Dr. Lisa believes you're suffering from an unknown interaction of digestive and hormonal disorders.  It should be possible for us to fix and maybe even reverse your height loss, even if it means regular injections or diet restrictions.  For a few weeks however we need to simply monitor your condition and make sure we have the problem figured out, before we start interfering in your body's process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's okay, Ron, you thought to yourself.  Only a few weeks.  Then it'll all get better.  You may even become a star!  However at the moment you didn't want to face anyone, much less the whole world.  But this won't be so bad in the meantime.  You'll be watched closely and probably only lose another couple inches.  Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see no reason for us to need to keep you under observation,\" Dr. Marquez went on, \"since you seem to be only gradually changing and not having any other difficulties.  We would like you to stick to a strict water-only diet, record your height every eight hours, and come in every Monday and Thursday for blood work.  Here's Dr. Lisa's card; she has graciously agreed to support you with a stipend for new clothes, but she wants you to continue going to work and change your routine as little as possible.  Sometimes disorders are brought on by stress and any large changes may aggravate your condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if this could possibly be unstressful.  But you couldn't complain too much.  You stood up to thank Dr. Marquez and shake her hand, and discovered that now you had to look slightly up to her.  On your way out you did manage to feel optimistic as you set up appointments for the blood tests and with Dr. Lisa.  Maybe things were going to be okay after all.  Kate, who had been in the waiting room, lit up when she saw a smile on your face for the first time in almost a week.  You hugged and walked out to her car together.</span></div></div>",
