You were still confused to how this had happened and decided to check Tiffany's phone for some clarity. You take a look at Tiff's pictures where you find many pictures you recognised but they was a crucial difference every picture that originally had Tiff innit now had you in her place and the same was the case for every picture of you now was a picture of Tiff. The most striking picture was a picture of you wearing a two piece yellow bikini with ribbons on the side, you remembered taking this picture of Tiffany in France and feeling completely aroused right now the picture didn't have the same effect.<br>\r\n'Oh that picture reminds me I need to get some new underwear we'll go get them first before we get that dress for you.' Said Rachel. You follow her to the underwear shop where you both immediently start looking for bras and panties. You didn't know what you were looking for exactly but in contrast Rachel had already found several pairs of lace panties for herself. She soon picked up a matching bra and panties combination and comes over to you. 'These would look amazing on you and I bet Kyle will really like them' The underwear where purple and had lots of frills and ribbons on them. You think to yourself and reply.<br>\r\n'Hmmmm I don't know Rachel they don't look my size' You thought this might get you out of trying them on.<br>\r\n'No worries' said Rachel 'Excuse me miss can we have a set of these in size 8 and size 22B'<br>\r\n'Certainly madam' said the shop worker, she left briefly and came back with a much larger pair of panties looking several sizes bigger than size 8 and a bra that must have been an A cup at least. She hands them to rachel who then hands them to you.<br>\r\n'Come on lets go try this stuff on' You wait in line for the female changing rooms untill it was finally your turn, Rachel entered the changing room first an turned to you  'Take a picture of yourself with your camera so we can see what we look like' You agreed and entered the booth. You remove Tiffa's strappy pink top and her short denim skirt and her white flats you were now stood there wearing your girlfriends plain white cotton panties and bra. You then removed them to reveal a completely normal looking teenage boy in the mirror there was nothing out of the oridinary except for the slight amount of make-up you were now wearing and the panties and bra you were about to try on. You first slipped the panties on you were suprised to how comfortable they were with the silk touching your skin you were also suprised how spacious they were for incorporating your man parts. You then put on the bra, again it felt good against the skin and was well fitted to your masculine figure, you imagined what Tiff would look like in these so you decided to buy them and where them out you placed your old underwear in your purse and paid in full at the desk. Rachel then shows you the picture of her in her new black silk panties and bra you told her that she looked very.<br>\r\n'Hot'<br>\r\n'Thanks Tiff I hope Jeff likes them I think I'm gonna show him tonight lets see yours' You load it up on your phone and show Rachel. 'Wow Tiff you look so feminine and beautiful, purple is definately your colour, have I got good taste or what? Do you wanna go get that dress now or grab a bit to eat?' </span></div></div>",

I bought a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you say, resigning yourself. As you hand him your purse, and take the bags from him. As he takes the purse, you see him admiring it. \"You can keep it.

Must be touching to switch, and the switch is activated by thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart: Switch body parts. Must be touching to switch, and thinking of the part you wish to switch. Must be for equivalent part. Arms for arms, legs for legs. No hands for feet and the like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLife: Switch lives with another. Body stays the same, but people now treat you as the person you've switched with, and you gain their name, family, friends, possesions,  physical abilities, etc. If switched with a person of the opposite gender, they will be treated as the gender of the person they have switched with. Clothes will change in size to fit comfortably. Does not affect personality. Power is activated by touch, and only with your hands, but goes off randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: Switch personalities. Gain the interests, mannerisms, etc. of another. Will act as they would, and would do the things they would normally want to do. Is the only power that the possessor will be aware that they have. The sudden change in personality is noticed by those who it has happened to, but they will not think much of the change. Sexuality does not change, nor does who ever that person might be interested, at least not right away. Power is activated by touch, and only with your hands, but goes off randomly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Body, Part, and Life swaps, you can choose whether the person you switch with is aware of the switch. Similarly for part, you can choose whether or not others around will notice the switch or not. However, this choice must be made upon the first switch, and will stay that way. For personality, you can also choose whether reality adjusts so that people just accept the change or stays the same question it.<br>\r\nIf you switch with someone while you have already switched, they will be left with the body/part/life/personality you previously had.<br>\r\nIf you are touching two or more people when the switch happens, it can either skip through you and happen to those you are touching, or happen to you and the others you are touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther rules:<br>\r\n1.No killing off characters.<br>\r\n2.No sex.<br>\r\n3.No other transformations and such, and no one else with powers.<br>\r\n4.No ending the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, add a chapter and have fun!</td>",
