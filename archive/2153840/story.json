His hands frantically worked to free his head and get back to helping the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBubble Punk fired a left into the woman's eye socket, then a right into her chin. She pounded the woman against the wall over and over until she slumped to the ground. Her attention turned to Magic Man and she began to stalk toward him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark couldn't seem to free himself from the immensely sticky gum substance, so he stopped and turned his attention to the approaching threat. He aimed a hand at the villainess and launched a bolt of magic at her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes widened in surprise, as the bolt slammed into her, too quickly for her to dodge. The magical energy seemed to mix with the magic that the succubus had infused into her body, and her nondescript body began to fill out in true succubus fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts surged outward, straining the limits of her black dress shirt. Her fingers grew slender and manicured as they lengthened from the ends of her fingerless gloves. Her flabby arms grew toned with feminine muscle. Her hips and ass flared outward pulling the dress shirt higher and higher on her smooth, sleek, fishnetted thighs. Her pink hair grew thick and luxurious. Her face grew seductive, eyes smoldering. Her wider hips and long, slender legs made her gait resemble that of a model walking the catwalk as she moved toward Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm...\" she moaned as her body transformed into lusciousness with the combination of succubus magic. \"I don't know what you hit me with, but it feels goooood...\" she said in a throaty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back, you fiend!\" said Mark in an attempt to mimic the words of the comic book heroes he had read as a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiend?

When he came too he was in a land of pink; the entire alley was coated in a layer of bright pink bubble gum. A muffled whimper brought his attention where the trapped victim had been. She was now completely coated in the sticky substance, Magic Man only found her because he saw where she was stuck before the boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark tried to get up and help her, but found his back was stuck to the ground.

His grin slowly turned into a frown as he heard the sound of Bubble Punk laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed me, hope you like getting my gum outta your shorts!\" Bubble Punk proclaimed in a cheeky fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" Magic Man said, right before he saw a couple of police cruisers come by him \"Double crap.\" What followed them were Channel 13 and 6's news vans. \"Triple crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe public had been enamored by Magic Man's appearance, with the police trying to get answers from him and the media looking for a juicy story. The sensation of the city trapped for their pleasure was enticing, as well as the fact he was in gum of all things. Magic Man struggled as he saw,someone a face that he had became accustomed to in the past week. Following her were three other officers and the reporters from their vans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Magic Man\" Detective Evans said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Detective.\"Magic Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be in a pickle right now and no escape is open for ya. An Ample time to take you to the jailhouse, isn't it?\"  Detective Evans told him, Magic Man knew she didn't really mean what she said. However, she couldn't necessarily support a vigilante, so she had to do what she had to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint, Detective, but that isn't going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its because of this.\" Magic Man announced and with a quick whisper under his breath, he was teleported to a closet under his college campus. Unfortunately, he was still covered with gum and various chemical bottles, brooms, and boxes attached to his gummed up form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quadruple crap.\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Damn, she was right, it was in my shorts.\" Mark said as he did he best to readjust to his body, being trapped in gum was not an experience he wanted to do again. He needed to make something to deal with that sticky stuff that Bubble Punk spat at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked towards the cafeteria, looking to for something to fill his stomach. Mark stopped as he heard a duo of people walking behind him, Mark turned around to see who they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, where were you? We were trying to call you for an hour dude.\" Damien, Mark's friend said to him. Damien was one of those \"pretty boys\" that girls seemed to like. With almost fae-like features and a dancer's build to him. His face possessed high cheekbones, and as one woman put it, \"damming eyes.\"  A long mane of hair that didn't need any styling to it flowed towards his shoulders.Although, his personalty contrasted with that image, greatly. A personality that many said reminded them of a stereotypical \"stoner.\" Not helping him was the baggy clothing and beanie on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I keep telling you Damien, he was probably on one of his little ' I need to do something' event that keeps happening more often.\" Trisha put in, Mark's other friend on campus. A small, African-American girl, although, she was more \"tan\" than \"black. She had a heart-shaped face that drew people's attention,but the rest of her wasn't anything to write home about. Though, don't let her hear that, when she spoke her voice commanded respect and fear. And her being angry at someone could most likely make that effect even greater. Her attire contrasted with Damien, with her actually showing effort in dressing herself; a beige, business casual suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, you two, I got caught up in something.\" Mark weakly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, its fine. Come on, lets go eat. Say, did you hear that Magic Boy got his behind handed to him by the \"Gum Girl\"? Man, what a dork!\" Damien said as the trio walked towards the cafteria,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am going to enjoy this</i>.\" Mark thought sarcastically.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your balls flared with pain, and it was pretty evident with your face. Your goddess just smiles, making them even more brutal. After a few fierce kicks, she kneels, balls up her fists, and started punching them. Even though it didn't hurt as much as the kicks, it was still brutal. \"Aww, look at my slut, I'm pretty sure your balls are red and swollen. Why don't you show me? Strip for me, bitch.\" You started stripping, still lying with your back on the floor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, look at them, they're pretty much the size of baseballs.\" She then landed her ass firmly on your balls, pain flaring all over your body. She then starts giving you a slow lapdance. She keeps her heeled shoes directly over your face \"Suck on my heels, slave\". You started doing it without question, sucking on the very dirt that your goddess walked upon. She then removes her heels and lands her feet on your face, ordering you to lick and kiss them. You once again get taste her seat, now being even more delicious than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she removes her feet and stops the lapdance. \"How about we make a deal.

Her lips were everything you wanted, its taste overpowering you. You felt you dick getting locked up in a cage. You couldn't kiss back.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hypnotits had proved to herself to be more than a match for Magic Man, who was reduced to a stuttering mess at the mere mention of her sexy offer. Her mind-numbing boobs really did a number on him. If his raging boner wasn\u2019t proof enough, his lousy attempts at spellcasting over the past few minutes--all botched because his brain was so boob-addled--certainly was. Case in point: he even slightly messed up his shrinking spell, failing to completely return Hypnotits to her original size. Thanks to his flubbed spell, Hypnotits--a normally average-sized woman--had a clear height advantage on Magic Man now. It wasn\u2019t drastic, but it made it even harder for him to look away from her chest, as it was practically level with his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, despite his clear distraction and arousal, Mark managed to find the strength of will to resist her offer, albeit just barely. Maybe his own magic powers gave him a resistance to the hypnosis, or maybe he just didn\u2019t want to make a fool of himself in his first-ever battle against a super villain (well, more so than he already has, at least). In any case, he couldn\u2019t let this woman have her way. Mark\u2019s hands began to glow as he charged up energy for an improvised spell, but the light quickly faded as Hypnotits coolly reached a hand down to his chin and forced him to look up at her, treating him with the sight of her gorgeous face smugly smiling at him past her enormous breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, ah, ah. Before you do anything rash, like rejecting my generosity, how\u2019s about I show you another trick?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...uh, what?\u201d Completely caught off-guard by such a question, and still struggling against both his lust and the hypnosis, Magic Man was at a loss for words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m about to make your face disappear!\u201d The female magician grabbed the back of Magic Man\u2019s head and pulled his head against her chest, instantly making his face disappear deep into the confines of her perfumed cleavage. Hypnotits cackled as Magic Man\u2019s hands flail in surprise, his weak squirmings and muffled grunts of panic against her breasts only serving to amuse her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the villainess\u2019 delight, it didn't take long for his panic to give way to compliance, the overwhelming sensation of prolonged direct contact with her massive breasts smothering his resistance. It was hard enough for him to stand up to her before, simply watching her mesmerizing breasts from a distance. With his face firmly shoved between Hypnotits\u2019 mighty, irresistible breasts, there was no hope for Magic Man. The exhilarating sensation of sweat, lotion, and pheromones--a sensation that could only come from direct skin-to-skin contact--overloaded his senses and short-circuited his rational thought, amplifying her hypnotic effect on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypnotits held Magic Man like this for another minute before shoving him away, taking a moment to admire her handiwork. His face had a deep blush, his eyes were half-open but completely glazed over, and he could hardly keep his balance on his wobbling legs. He was completely boob-drunk! To her further satisfaction, Hypnotits noticed that his erection still hadn\u2019t died down either. In fact, if she looked closely enough, she could see a small wet spot forming at the tip of it. \u201cAh, nice to see that my captive audience is still giving me a standing ovation for my performance.\u201d She gave an exaggerated bow, taking a moment to taunt Magic Man by shaking her chest left and right before standing back up, knowing full well that he couldn\u2019t look away from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt always delighted Hypnotits to dominate a man using nothing but her bewitching breasts, but the prospect of having an actual superhero under her thrall excited her in more ways than one. Not only could this so-called Magic Man and his powers be a powerful tool on her \u201cGlobal Domination Tour,\u201d but he could make for a fun boy-toy that she could never get bored with. It was too good a chance to pass up! She had to kick things up a notch to make sure her new \u201clovely assistant\u201d could never escape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you\u2019ve been such a good audience, how\u2019s about another surprise?\u201d Hypnotits winked before pulling her vest off with a flourish and revealing the bra she wore underneath. It was thin, lacy, and opened at the front. What\u2019s more, it was clearly much too small for her burgeoning breasts; one deep breath from Hypnotits was liable to burst it open. Magic Man\u2019s entranced eyes widened at the sight of this while his dick visibly throbbed within his spandex outfit. Treated to the sight of Hypnotits\u2019 almost-naked bosom, the slack-jawed hero fell deeper into her spell, much to her delight. \u201cCome here,\u201d she commanded with a sensual gesture from her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man obeyed, completely enthralled by his new mistress. When poor Mark got close enough, Hypnotits twisted her chest to the side before quickly swinging it back, smacking him in the face with a boob easily bigger than his head. The subtle motion on her part was more than enough to topple Mark over, making the villainess laugh. Too entranced to stop himself, Magic Man stood back up, eager to admire his mistresses\u2019 enormous bust. Amused, Hypnotits continued her little game: effortlessly knocking Magic Man over with one of her breasts each time he got back up again, ready for more punishment. The \u201cmighty\u201d Magic Man was reduced to being a punching bag for Hypnotits\u2019 funbags!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her fun, Hypnotits knew her job wasn't done yet. While Magic Man may have been reduced to a drooling slave by her tits in such a short time, it was still taking all of her concentration to keep her hold on him, loathe as she is to admit it. Normally she was able to entrance an entire room of men by just jiggling her fully-covered boobs a few times, but she\u2019s had to take much more drastic (albeit fun) measures in order to get Magic Man fully under her spell. She assumed his (ultimately futile) resistance must have something to do with his powers, and she worried he might break free if she ever gets too distracted. She needed a catch-all solution that'll ensure the image of her tits are forever burned into his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could she ensure Magic Man will never get free from her control?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: She orders him to take off her bra for her, unleashing the full extent of her powers on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: She titfucks him, figuring that a mind-blowing orgasm will make him dependent on her, with or without hypnotic powers<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: She orders him to cast a spell that\u2019ll enhance her powers somehow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That last slap from her breast had apparently been stronger than the others. She shot the hero a cruel, teasing look. She knew how to make him hers and hers alone. \"Magic Man?\", the villainess said in a sweet and innocent voice. \"How about you come take off my bra. Surely you can see that it's simply too small for my <i>perfect</i>, <i>round</i>, <i>bouncy</i> <b>tits</b>?\" With each word she heaved her chest, making her boobs jiggle so violently that they almost spilled out entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis display had the desired affect on her prey, she could see how Magic Man's crotch twitched in response to her every word and motion. She couldn't help but laugh at this turn of events. This hero had come here to stop her, to fight her, and was now under the spell of her boobs, and well on his way to being her little super slave. Just the thought of it made her wet and horny. The endless possibilities of it. She couldn't wait to have him completely in her thrall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was lost in a haze. He struggled to process the words he was hearing. They were coming in out of order. Words like \"tits\", \"bouncy\", and \"bra\" came before words like \"about\" and \"off\" and \"for\". Something was wrong, something was very very wrong. Deep down in him, he knew he had to do something, had to fight something, but what? His train of thought was having trouble moving forward, but his body had no such problems. Already he had stood up and moved up to within a foot of Hypnotits, his face once again level with her chest. He had to fight, he didn't know what he was fighting, but all he knew is he had to resist right now. Something told him the best way to do that was to stop moving all together, no matter how hard it was. He ground to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hold up Magic Man?\", the buxom femme fatale asked with mock concern. \"Don't tell me you changed your mind? Perhaps you don't want to see my boobs after all? What changed, hmm? Are you afraid that they'll be too much for you? Worried that you'll get lost in my <i>heavenly</i>, <i>bottomless</i>, <b>cleavage</b>? Scared that you're mind will shatter at the sight of my <i>big</i>, <i>hard</i> <b>nipples</b>?\" Again, she punctuated each word with a jerk of her chest, but this time the hero was much closer.With each motion, the seductresses breast lightly dragged across the hero's face, weakening his will further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was slipping again. That voice inside him was still there, telling him to stay strong, telling him to keep still. But there was another voice, and this one came from outside his head. This voice was a woman's voice, and it was much more pleasant to listen to. This voice was using words he liked like \"breasts\", and \"pillowy\", and \"sleep\". There were also words that frightened him like \"surrender\", and \"ensnared\", and \"slave\", but those were much more distant. Just like that he had sunk back in to trance, the super hero Magic Man's voice faded, and the boob zombie Mark could now only hear the voice of Hypnotits. He moved once more, pivoting and side stepping torwards the villainess's backside. He was so boob addled that he needed to see the clasp that held the bra in place. He needed to unhook it if he was to see those pillowy orbs that he so desired, even if it meant the undoing of that bra meant the undoing of his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Hypnotits thrashed sideways, so that her breast collided with the hero once more, the force knocking him onto his ass once again. \"Just what do you think you're doing?\", she demanded. \"Why would you want to go back there? Everything you need to see is up here in front.\" \"Only the performers are allowed backstage, and you are not a performer! You are my <i>captive</i> audience, and the audience is only allowed to see what the performer <i>wants them</i> to see. And...right now...<b>I. WANT. YOU. TO. SEE. MY. TITS</b>, so get on with it.\" She could no longer contain herself. Teasing the do-gooder was undeniably fun, but she could only wait so long. Her panties were drenched and her mind was racing with ideas on what she could do with her new toy. But she could only do that if he was fully enslaved to her, and she didn't want to miss this chance. There was no more waiting, fun was fun, but it would take far too long for the hero to undo her bra in his intoxicated state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your feet.\" she said. The hero stood up obediently. \"Come here\" ,she said, \"in front of me.\" He moved once again to within a foot of her flawless breasts. \"What do you see?\" \"Only your perfect breasts\" the hero said. \"Really?\" she asked, \"because I can see your future. If you look hard enough, you can see your future in these orbs, just like a crystal orb.\" \"...I don't...I can't see it\", came the drunken reply. \"Oh... but I can see it perfectly\" purred Hypnotits, \"I can see a nice, long future with you...here...enthralled by my tits.\" and with that she arched her back, and her bra burst open, her divine tits released for all the world to see. And right now, those we're Magic Man's entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's legs buckled beneath him, and he found himself kneeling, in front of Hypnotits, his new mistress. He looked up at her, and found that her breasts almost completely filled his vision, much like how they completely filled his mind. He could just see her face over the gigantic pink mounds. Her lips curled in a sadistic smile. His mouth was unbelievably dry, he was swallowing trying to moisten his throat with what little saliva he had left. \"...Water\" he managed to croak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypnotits looked down at her prize. \"Water?\" she asked, \"but of course.\" She gestured to one of the other hostages, now all but forgotten. \"You\" she ordered, \"bring me one of those water bottles\" and gestured to the bar at the other end of the theater. \"And be quick about it.\" She added. The theater patron was back in a flash, and handed her a cold water bottle. \"Thank you\" she said, and cast the hostage aside with a smack of her breasts. \"Crawl to me, my super-slave\". The hero came closer, on his hands and knees. Hypnotits unscrewed the cap. \"Drink\" she said, and upended the bottle over her breasts. The water fell through her cleavage and the hero put his mouth under the stream and drank greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark was in ecstasy as he drank the water. The sweet flavor of water mixed with boob-sweat and perfume only further enslaved him to her. When the water bottle was at last emptied and the stream had ceased to fall, he lapped up what drops he had missed from the floor. Lapping it up like a dog, addicted to the flavor, addicted to <i>her</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic Man\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong, who are you <i>really</i>?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark Rogers\" he said robotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Closer\" she said with a wry grin, \"but no, that is who you <i>were</i>, but you are not Magic Man or Mark Roger any more, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, you are my tit-slave. My brainwashed boob-zombie. My devoted breast-servant, are you not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" said the broken hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" said the powerful vixen. \"And who am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hypnotits\" came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong again, I am your goddess. Your mistress. Your owner. I am your whole world. My breasts are your only thought and your place is here servicing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my goddess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now suck on my breasts, and with each suck, feel yourself further submitting to me\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did as he was ordered and found himself in an ecstasy beyond the realms of most men's imagination. With each tug he found himself slipping deeper and deeper, and it only felt more right. This was his place, here, at her breast. This was where he always wanted to be, where he longed to be, where he was destined to be. He didn't care what happened next as long as he was here between his mistresses boobs.</span></div></div>",

Magic Man only groan in response to that,his mind filled with Hypnotit's jiggly assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could I ask for to keep myself in your head?\" Hypnotits grabbed onto her already sizeable bits and groped them in front of the dazed hero.Looking down at her great gifts,the wheels in her began to turn. A metaphorical light bulb appeared over her head,causing her to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already have an nice pair of tits,but what if I could grow em'?\" Hypnoits said to the disabled Magic Man. \"You already have a four bimbos with bubbly butts;you're really lacking in the <i>upper</i> department. And you do seem to like girls who are big, I just wanna spoil you with myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her hand movements,and her breasts,Hypnotits made Magic Man sit down. Curling up to him,Hypnotits laid herself on his lap. Snuggling him like a doll, Hypnotits bathed in his scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then,do you have something you can whip up for little ole' me?\" Hypnotits proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...do. It...takes...about...an...hour....to...do\" Magic Man replied,his speech pattern dumbing down somewhat. Hypnotits blinked at his response, while she did mean to grow her breasts,she only asked that question as a joke. She stared at him in silence,before a feline smile covered her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Magic Man, you naughty boy! I wonder why the straight-lace hero has something like that on him? Now,tell me,what do you need for this endeavor?\" Hypnotits questioned,pushing herself up to lend her ear to him. Magic Man began to whisper just exactly what he needed for the job.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nInside of a (what is thought to be) an abandoned building,two figures stood inside the rundown place. A busty magician,who was accompanied by a dazed magic-user. Behind the dazed man,a cavalcade of floating objects followed him in an almost dance routine. Hypnotits looked around the area,right before she stomped exactly three times.A hiss,followed by a creak, caused both figures to stumble a bit. An opening appeared,showing a dark flight of stairs;the duo crept down it before it closed behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the end, the duo arrived inside a bunker. It was a moderately sized placed, having the layout of a modern apartment. it possessed a bedroom,a loft,a kitchen,and even a latrine. Hypnotits stretched,happy she was home(or in a current home). Smiling, she motioned Magic Man into the kitchen so that he could lay down his wares onto the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,Magic Man,thanks for the help in this shopping spree. We're happy,though, the police sure aren't!\" Hypnotits' laughter filled the air.\"But in all seriousness, we got: a carton of milk, a bra,bread,a bike pump, and a few candles. Is this seriously all you need for this ritual or whatever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Magic Man replied back. \"I....just ....need...to..remember...the words...and ...gestures...to...complete it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking all they duo had acquired,Magic Man sat down and began to place all the in a pattern Hypnotits was unfamiliar with. She overlooked the scene for a few moments,before she shrugged. Walking away to her current hideout's loft,Hypnotits took a remote off from her small coffee table.Following this, Hypnotits went over to a Lazyboy chair and began to knead her breasts, her back was killing her from all the day's physical activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, HT, just wait an hour and soon Magic Man will be yours'.\" She spoke calmly to herself. Turning on a stolen TV, Hypnotits lost herself in the silver screen,only to be interrupted by a knock on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..am..done...mistress.\" Magic Man's voice trumpeted. Clapping her hands, Hypnotits walked into the kitchen,seeing none of the things she had stolen with Magic Man's help.Well,except the bread,that was still on the counter or at least a slice of it anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everything else?\" Magic Man looked at Hypnotits,pointing at the bread on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The essence.... of those items..... are inside...of that bread\" He spoke out.\"Consume it......and the power you seek will be yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHypnotits raised an eyebrow,warily did she take up the bread and chewed it slowly. Right before she stuffed the entire piece into her maw. She gulped it with a ecstatic look on her face before gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious,but when will the effects begin?\" Hypnotits spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When...one...desires..so\" Magic Man replied back. The villainess stared at him, then closed her eyes in concentration. She tapped her right foot as well, desiring for her power to show up already.</span></div></div>",

Magic-Man was a stubborn one and could come back any moment she thought but Mark's internal struggle was nearly lost he was completely at the mercy of Hypnotits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that could work. Would you like to proceed?\" Magic-Man said almost robotic like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you give me magic powers and you get the greatest titfuck and blow job in the world, honestly your getting the better deal\" Hypnotits laughed pushing Magic-Man to the floor covering his dick in her tits and put her mouth over his already erect dick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Hypnotits started moving her breasts and sucking on Magic-Man's cock.

He was now a complete slave to Hypnotits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first cum arrived inside Hypnotits mouth and she stop the blow job to ask \"so how does this magic work anyway is there like a spell book or something?\" Hypnotits asked worryingly, what if this had been for not she was now thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you just think of something and it happens I just added names sometimes for flair\" he answered calming Hypnotits down. She then tested some magic right now by making a fire ball in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I didn't know know how petty the spells where when we first met but my is very gorgeous\" Hypnotits said enjoying the moment of her first true spell.

What if Magic-Man was holding back and still fighting. Hypnotits was worrying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you've only got a small amount of magic if you want more you would need to...\" Magic-Man was speaking before Hypnotits knew what to do milk him for every drop of cum and magic question is how much<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Hypnotits milks Magic-Man until there powers are equal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2: Hypnotits milks Magic-Man to the point he barely has any power and life in him giving Hypnotits even more power than Magic-Man ever had.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't like she was secretly stealing energy from the city, powering her base located in the old subway system. Nope, she was just standing in the middle of an electric plant, like the, not in any form, unwanted felon she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Mr.Magic, whatever endeavor do you require my aid in?\" Thunder Thighs said to him.

I need a trustworthy, or at least professional, villainess to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Thunder Thighs heart fluttered in her chest, he called her trustworthy! She unconsciously absorbed some ambient electrical power, growing her bottom to eat the lower half of her one-piece.

Trying to be a respectable villainess with a really fetishistic power was difficult. The only reason she was in a one-piece was because that was one of the only thing that could easily contain her expansion. And combined with her more, \"hands off\" approach to crime, she wasn't a big spotlight in the city's community. Protecting her from being a laughingstock. On the other hand, Mr. Magic was asking her to do it! And that was almost enough for her to go through with it.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

Several  stores were being robbed by identical dark skinned brunets wearing sleeveless referee jersey and black short-shorts with white sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis looked like a job for Magic Man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark ducked into a bathroom. He cast a spell that would make it harder to recognize him, and then flew out into the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt, Villain!\" Magic Man called out as he hovered over where the identical women were piling there loot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about no!\" One of the robbers yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Force it is!\" the superhero declared as his hands began to cackle with electricity. </span></div></div>",

Electricity built up around his cape and suit of armor, crackling loudly. Finally, as Mark spread his arms open, a wave of electricity shot out all across the mall, incapacitating several robbers as they fell to the ground with a small cry, followed by various groans of discomfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark dropped to the ground, hands at his side in a gesture of pride. He was smiling widely underneath his helmet. First day on the job and he was handling himself quite well. He was sure The Succubus would be proud of him if she could see what he'd pulled off, it was certainly an exertion of energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You disappoint me, hero,\" a voice behind him joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark turned around to see a rather amused Cheersquad copy. Apparently, his blast wasn't as effective as he thought it was. At closer look of her gorgeous, smiling face, her angelic lips and seductive brown eyes, he made a shocking realization. Cheersquad was no random villain. He <i>knew</i> her (Or, should he say, knew <i>them</i>.) Her real name was Drea Lewis, an old friend and longtime crush of Mark's who he'd been in love with for the better part of 5 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Succubus spoke so highly of you.\", another chimed in from a higher level of the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely you can do better!\" added another one, positioned at the mall's Spencer's. \"...Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed deeply under his helmet, totally unsure of how to react. </span></div></div>",

His helmet had been removed, but not his cape, gauntlets and armor. As he looked around, he found himself to be in a basement somewhere. It wasn't Drea's place, it was far too organized. The walls were lined with posters of Cheersquad's numerous schemes and plots, as well as all kinds of weapons, gear and equipment to presumably use in case of emergencies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early bird catches the worm.\" the clone smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree more squad members walked down the basement stairs to meet an awakened Mark. \"It's 3am, you woke up sooner than expected.\" clarified the one in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you're really serious about this whole villainy thing, huh?\" you question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" the replicant in the back replied. \"Why should we feel bad about stealing? So much has been taken from us, we're just balancing the scales.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrea wasn't wrong. She'd lost multiple family members and friends to violent tragedies, not to mention numerous opportunities to bad fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a fair point,\" Mark admitted. \"But I can't just let you hurt and steal from people just cause I get where you're coming from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the Cheersquad laughed simultaneously. Mark blushed deeply, his rosy cheeks no longer obstructed by his helmet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way we see it, we can do whatever we want.\" assured the middle Cheersquad member. \"You're welcome to try and stop us, but good luck using your powers with your arms and hands restrained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark sighed deeply, his head laid back in embarrassment and exhaustion at his current predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you have me in your lair, what're you gonna do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cheersquad leader (Presumably the original Drea) gave Mark a seductive, alluring look as she slowly walked up to him, kneeling down to eye level. She moves her lips directly next to Mark's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna do what I wanna do.\" she whispered. \"And what I know you've been craving for a long time. So play along and I'll make sure we both have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nibbled Mark's ear and stands up, her massive, round bubble butt directly his face, bending over with hands at her sides. Before he could ask what she was doing, she ripped a massive fart right in his nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PFRRAAAAAAARP</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smelled like a rotting, festering Hell, but it was absolutely alluring and intoxicating all the same. Mark tried to feign revulsion and hide his interest, but  he found himself unable to act against impulse. Instead, he dug his nose deeper between her supple, round ass cheeks held tight against those short shorts, inhaling deeply, earning an audible gasp from the Cheersquad leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark quickly pulled his nose out from her ass, trying to play it off as some kind of accident, ashamed beyond words. All the Cheersquad members saw right past his facade, however, shining a sinister smile in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you know that we've all got terrible gas tonight, Mark.\" the Cheersquad leader told him with an evil laugh. \"All 35 of us. And you're gonna help every one of us deal with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would Cheersquad handle this?</span></div></div>",

He checked his phone, conversing with a friend about the villains of the city. Which Mark had first hand experiences in, seeing as he was Magic Man. The defender, and object of desire to all villainessess. He chuckled at his friend Damien's responses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you, Bubble Punk can take down Cheersquad with just one bubble.

Lucky guy that Magic Man, isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're giving him a lot more luck than he deserves.\" Mark texted back. While it was true that having a bunch of super villain ladies after him is fun, Mark did note the downsides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Most of the girls were either very polite to him, jumpily loving,or civil in trying to get him in the bed. Others however, were much more willing to do some terrible things to him if he got captured. Kaboom! blowing herself, and him, up. The Squisher growing into an immense titan to use him as a butt plug. Shrinker keeping him as an captured animal, in some jar somewhere. The list went on with the girls, luckily they mostly fought against each other for his body. Which Mark still felt guilty about too, were they innocent people before the succubus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0That was not even beginning with the crime spree that came with them. Each new villain giving Mark more tactics to remember against her. Was it his fault that his city was going to the dumps?It did however spark tourism for the fetish crowds. Come see the woman with the growing ass or twin sex from a multiplier! Mark still felt a tremble in him, even his joking didn't alleviate his mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He also noted the reason this began in the first place was because of himself. The succubus would've never given those girls powers, if Mark didn't save her. But, it still felt sorta right, he could never leave an innocent person to be hurt. Mark licked his ice cream more cautiously, looking at his friend's texts. Suddenly, a crash echoed in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got to go Damien, something just happened \" Mark texted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt, is Magic Man around you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,but it is happening in the distance. I don't want to be around there.\" With that Mark texted off, heading towards an ally near him.

Lucha Libre.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Lucha Libre, a well,Lucha Libre. Hailing from Mexico, Lucha Libre was disgraced from her league and never wore a mask again. Heading up north, she got her green card, and settled down in the city. But her longing for a \"Golden Fight let her be noticed by the succubus, her desire for that fight was as enticing as sugar to a fly. The Succubus granted her immense powers, which she used to attack the locals of the city. Her eyes gleamed in delight at her opponent(s), who didn't react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For some reason, everyone didn't notice her maskless face, acting as if it was masked by some force. Mark could get through that however, her features were that of a rough, but feminine, latina. Her long brown hair flew like a Valkyrie's mane. Which didn't distract from her destruction she wrought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Of course she was in the middle of a fight right now, trying to \"roid\" out. It seemed that Mark and her match would begin soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot why I did it in the first place,\" Mark said before a thunder clap shook him in response,\" Oh yeah, because she was at her peak in performance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When Lucha's longing for the \"Golden Fight\" swelled to a climax the first time, she was causing untold destruction to the city. Mark stepped up to take her down. After a stalemate in fighting, they came to a conclusion. They would go into a \"ring match\" that would determine the fate of both contestants. If Mark won, he would force her to dissipate her peak power. If Lucha won, she would not only keep her peak, but would also get Mark. Of course he won the first time, but forgot to mention in the binding contract that she couldn't do villainy again. So here he was, Lucha Libre eternally fighting him for her prize.

Put your hands behind your head and get on your knees now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucha Libre laughed. <br>\r\n\u201cYou pathetic shrimps! You\u2019re no match for me<i>El gran lucha libre</i>!\u201d <br>\r\nA swat unit began to close in on her, holding shields and batons. They crept toward the behemoth of a woman, who was double the size of any on them. <br>\r\nOne raises his baton, Lucha grabbed the baton, the man still attached, and hurled him into another officer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one they attacked, each time, Lucha Libre easily turned back their advance. One man pulled a gun and fired a round into her massive butt. Lucha yelled and crushed the man under her. Each hit she took only made her stronger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she took out the last man, she strode toward the captain, lifting him a foot off the ground to meet her eyes. <br>\r\n\u201cWell little <i>hombre</i>, it\u2019s just you and me.\u201d<br>\r\nThe man was shaking in fear. <br>\r\n\u201cListen to me. You go and tell the mayor and all your friends, including that magic fool, that Lucha Libre is taking over this city. They can try to stop me, but by this time tomorrow, I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dropped him onto the pavement. He quickly got up and scrambled away toward city hall. </span></div></div>",

The figure was thrown a good eight feet away and Magic Man could hear a distinct grunt of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on is that all you got?\" Lucha said to the form on the ground, approaching her slowly. Magic Man used a spell to get a closer look at the prone figure. He saw that it was unmistakably Thunder Thighs, the electrical pear-shaped villains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even want to do this you overgrown brute!\" Thunder Thighs yelled out, she put her hand behind her. An arc of electricity flew right into her hand and it snaked right up its length. Already was Lucha near the villain and too caught up in her own hype that she didn't see the windup of a punch.Thunder Thighs punched Lucha right in the abdomen and the wrestler went down on a knee. Thunder Thighs again reached out for more electrical power and Magic Man saw from above her rear gain its signature girth. Her thighs thicken to the point of absurdity, almost reaching the size of her torso.Thunder Thighs spread her legs apart and slammed them together, a wall of electrical power flew from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis knocked Magic Man from his position in the sky and he scrambled to get himself back together. He looked down at the site again, Lucha was no where to be seen and Thunder Thighs seemed to be fine, her rear shrunken down. Although, Magic Man did note her pride was probably shot, she never liked to get bigger than humanely possible. She could get <i>larger</i> than that, and Magic Man had seen it, but she liked her \"heiress\" persona too much. And no heiress had a power so...erotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man thought it was all over and all he had to do was apprehend Lucha, but he could hear her distinctive guffaw from the distance. He turned his head to the source and saw that Lucha had grown a foot in height. She emerged from a smashed in car or maybe she emerged from the crater under it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn,that was a <i>Hell</i> of a volt,almost knocked me out, you did. Next time sweet-cheeks, up the amp and voltage on me will ya?\" Lucha moved up, Thunder Thighs looked shocked---no pun intended--- for a moment. She quickly shook her head side to side and regained her imperial attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lucha couldn't see it, Magic Man could see Thunder Thighs lips move. He cast another spell to hear what she was saying.\"....dumb wrestler. Oh, so you want more power you buffoon? I'll give it to you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Thighs quickly put her arms downwards and shot off towards the distance. Lucha stood still for a moment, and like Thunder Thighs before her, quickly shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going <i>caballo</i>? Get back here!\" Lucha bent her knees and jumped after the fleeing villain. Magic Man gently floated in the breeze before flying after the duo.</span></div></div>",

My big booty <i>Caballo</i>.\u201d Lucha taunted. <br>\r\nThunder Thighs continued to move away, trying to hold her head high.

Thunder Thighs used a power that she didn't promote much, which was the ability to feel electrical currents around her. She was greeted by electrical lines that currently powered several cameras. Now knowing the sight of those cameras, Thunder Thighs  and went to each camera's location. One by one did she drain each of the cameras watching the scene, until finally she was done. Thunder Thighs stretched a little and while touching her hips, she was greeted by a little more meat on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, knowing that it was a price to pay for taking down the cameras,but it was worth it for Magic Man. She turned around to look at the damage, it wasn't too bad---she was a <i>little</i> bigger than J-lo at the moment. Thunder Thighs cracked her neck and went back towards the fury. She stopped herself though, maybe she could call upon someone for help? She did bump shoulders with some other villains, and she even considered some her friends. Hopefully they may be sympathetic to the battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Thighs swaggered her enlarged rear to another area of the city, looking for a new ally in this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">====</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,<i>hombre</i>.

Lucha was momentarily stunned and Magic Man flew into the opening. Unfortunately, this was a feign and the wrestler grabbed onto Magic Man and bear crushed him. Magic Man grew an opulent helmet over his head and headbutted the wrestler. She cried in pain and Magic Man released a large arcane energy blast that he formed in his hand. Almost instantaneously did the wrestler disappear from his view.The face Lucha made was hilarious, but thankfully Magic Man did his best to not damage her even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cage of blue energy formed behind the flying villain, but instead of catching her, it crumpled as she landed straight through it. Magic Man slumped as he used a sight based power to watch her from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shite, she is only going to get stronger from that. What do I do now?\" Magic Man questioned the world.

From his skyward position, Magic Man saw the duo standing in front of a wrecked van. The mask-less Lucha Libre currently had her hand stuck in the side of the van, Magic Man noted that meant she wasn't at a level where she could easily rip out of the vehicle. However, Magic Man could see the beginnings of extra mass form on the wrestler, no doubt caused by Thunder Thighs' electrical output.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Thunder Thighs was putting a bunch of gems in a burlap-sack. That felt kinda antiquated, but Magic Man didn't ask why she was doing that. Thunder Thighs bent over and grabbed the last of the gems, she got up and stared back at Lucha with the air of a annoyed school-teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucha only grinned in response and began her reply. \"I'm not after the jewels, i'm after you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" The electrical villain questioned the wrestler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the person behind you, of course you!

And the thing that you carry with you reminds me of a horse's backside!\" Lucha laughed out, knowing that Thunder Thighs powers were a sore point for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Thighs was currently at a small size, but even that jib got to her. Thankfully her mask protected her features from being revealed and after a while glared back at the still laughing Lucha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you couldn't save that for Megabutt because?\" Thunder Thighs questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh\" Lucha shrugged nonchalantly. \"Hippo fits better for her in my opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is fitting for her, got to use it next time. Well, i'll be off you nimrod and I hope not to see you again anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, were are you going <i>caballo</i>?

There were pros and cons to this form that she could exploit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Lucha Libre had already reached her max of about fifteen feet. This made her the \"smallest\" of the giantess villains. With Squisher, whoever was the Ring Bearer, (if one counted her) the Shrinker, and Astro-Cheeks at the top. So Thunder Thighs didn't have to worry about Lucha reaching building size. This was offset by Lucha Libre power that still gave strength exponentially and that gained power didn't show on her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Thighs also noted that she didn't move as fast as other giantesses, and those particular villains were considered slow. However that was offset by Lucha's ability to cause large quakes by stomping her feet or hand shock-waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Thighs then remembered that Lucha was too strong at the moment, meaning that Thunder Thighs didn't have to worry about her getting to her stronger forms.The reasons was that nothing could \"evolve\" her to that point.Then Thunder Thighs noted that this <i>wasn't </i> a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these thoughts ran in her head that she didn't see Lucha pick up a part of the road and <i>throw</i> it at her. Right before Thunder Thighs flat-lined, something whisked her away. Lucha looked momentarily confused, she looked around for her quarry. Right before she stomped off in a direction she thought Thunder Thighs went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Stop...struggling... its me.\" Magic Man coughed out, Thunder Thighs was twisted and turned in the air.

She turned to look at his face; Magic Man cradled Thunder Thighs like a babe in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MAGIC MAN, HOW WO-...I mean<i>exquisite</i>\" Thunder Thighs was happy to see her lovestuck object.

Flying after her, Mr. Magic saw Thunder Thighs stomping through the train yards  Electricity grounding itself in the metal of the trains. Weird, Thunder Thighs wouldn't normally do this, she basically found herself in the hardest place to fight. In fact, Mr. Magic could easily cast his spell on her here. Her weaknesses filling his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0TT's had two main weakness that he could exploit. One was her own body;around fifteen to twenty feet tall, her height stopped and her butt grew. Giving her a <i>very</i> prominent pair of cheeks, sizes equal to three Buick trucks and beyond. She would be hindered by both her height and her butt. Time and time again, did TT loose due to taking more than she could dissipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Magic thought that over ,TT would have shrunken down already before that would happen. After the first time she did that, she never tried to do it again. That fight was what gained her her title in the first place, a sore point for her then on. In fact, she didn't use Thunder Thighs as her moniker at all, she tended to avoid the name. Probably feeling some embarrassment from that incident, especially when she tried to cultivate a \"crime heiress\" attitude. Besides him calling her that name, no one sane would do that, especially herself.What was going on with her? Shaking that thought out, Mr. Magic thought of her second weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Two, anything that could ground her would shrink TT back to her normal, if large, five foot eleven height. Metals and water were very common, and her own ability to discharge her energy. But she didn't seem to be willing to talk right now. Which was weird, she acted almost mush-mouth around Mr. Magic. Why was it that she was so resilient right now? Did something happened to her? Questions like that were for later, her needed to do something about her now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright, Thunder Thighs, you're getting grounded!\" Mr. Magic grimaced at his pun, but he did cultivate the image of a trickster to the public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Calling on metal of the trains, they slithered like snakes towards the swaggering villain. Her loot was in her hands, her voice ringing out like a horn. Which was something she didn't do when she was escaping, when she had Mr. Magic captured that was another thing however. Then the metal snakes wrapped through an particularly embarrassing area: the back string of her one-piece. Pulling backwards and  almost revealing her privates. This was one of the many reasons Mr. Magic didn't like fighting TT; unlike other giantess, she had her growing buttocks.Which usually results in embarrassing situations, such as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But in most cases of him fighting her, she would've been screaming bloody murder at him. Right now she seemed more intent on getting away--pretty reasonable-- than her own decency. Which was more important to her than escape on most occasions. He pushed that thought aside again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Well, it was now or never, the metal touched the back of her butt. The electricity flowed from the cheeks down the snakes of metal, traveling to the trains. Slowly shrinking, Thunder Thighs seemed to be completely oblivious to the act. Her height going  lower and lower while she walked. Mr. Magic could see her large form shrink downwards. \"This seems <i>way</i> too easy right now, what could she be planning?\"</span></div></div>",

Or at least the building that would allow her into the place that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tower Central, here I come.Just..neeed...to get into...here!\" Ziggy happily announced as she felt the final lock beginning to crumble under her expertise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the final tumbler tick open, but she did need to make sure it was actually done. Stretching her head, the neck of Ziggy began to wiggle like a serpent towards the door. It traveled under cars, dumpsters,and finally around a corner. She placed her head against the iron door and slowly moved her hand to the knob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted it slightly and waited for a response. And do to no doubt her lock-picking prowess, she managed to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" She cried. Stretching her arms out, she went towards her limits in grabbing onto a nice and sturdy pole located inside of the near-dark building. Making sure she was attached, Ziggy waited for the result. A crack like a ball being rubbed ranged out, and a bolt of purple flashed through dumpsters,cars,and around a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZiggy grunted as she felt her body collide with itself and launch her forward by a few feet. Letting go of the pole, she brushed herself off from all the dust and other detriment she had been covered with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let see that vent system that I can use to get inside Tower Central. \" Ziggy happily stated.</span></div></div>",

She was about ten-percent down, right until a bright light flashed into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What are you doing?\" A voice called out. Ziggy's neck stretched out of the beam to look at her assailant.

Or so he thought....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t his house. He turned and dangled his legs off the side of the bed. Wait, dangled? He was 6\u20192 and this was a low bed, yet his feet were easily a foot off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hopped off the bed, taking a much longer fall than usual to get down. He went to the light switch and realized her was stretching to reach it. Uh oh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he flipped it on, the dark room became clear. He nearly screamed. Everything was HUGE! He was much smaller. He was a MIDGET! Oh no. He was still inside. She was still in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the pipes creaked and he heard water splashing. It then turned to pounding, and he understood that someone else was in the house. And showering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his colossal door and crept slowly down the hallway toward the bathroom. He walked up and gently opened another door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was steamy, and he couldn\u2019t see very well at this size. Suddenly, someone came up behind him. A shadow fell over his body. He spun around and looked up at an enormous (well good size for this house) villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Magic Man. Trying to catch a peek? Don\u2019t worry.

He was going to meet with Professor Grant, someone he immensely respects. And he could hopefully call a friend, not that he could, professors should never be  personal friends to students. Opening the door to the lab, Mark called out into the room. An almost child sized figure was hunched over a counter, fiddling furiously on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ms. Grant. I got your bologna--on rye-- sandwich for you!\" Mark called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Mark. You're such a kind lad.\" Grant replied. The small figure revealed itself to be a full-figured woman. She would possess extreme curves, if they weren't on such a small person. Maybe the figure was the cause of the curves to begin with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Stepping over to Mark, an outside source would see the noticeable differences in height. Grant was 4'8 compared to Mark's 5'11, it was kinda laughable in that regard. Lowering his package to her, Grant took her sandwich immediately and then went back to her meal. Curious, Mark walked over with her, wanting to ask about her work. Her not telling him to stop was a sign of goodwill for his curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, doc, what are you working on?\" Mark said to Grant as she went to work on her device. It was a ray gun done in the old pulp style of future weaponry, Grant was always a fan of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mark, I'm working on my \"growth ray and shrink additions\" or G.R.A.S.A.\" Grant said, nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's heart skipped a beat, he already had four or five growth villains, Grant brought some anxiety to him. There was<u> Thunder Thighs</u>; a woman whose height not only increased, but her posterior as well.<u> The Squisher</u>; a woman that naturally had a nice pair of butt cheeks on her, but she more focused on growth height than ass. Still, she possessed a pair that could rival Thunder Thighs in her initial expansion. There was <u>Astro-Cheeks</u>; who grew in height by temporarily absorbing other things, specific parts grew determined by which part she absorbed it through. There was whoever was unfortunate enough to be <u>The Ring Bearer </u>this week. A mystical artifact that grew the sad wearer of the ring to large heights, stopping somewhere around 60ft. And if one counted <u>Enchantress</u> among them, she too grew. Only in the dream world thankfully, she was already a handful there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Mark?\" Grant's voice pierced his mind like a nail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, i'm good. Why are you working on this so late?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrant looked at him, stopping whatever work she was on, and looked at him sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, am I too small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Professor Grant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean this: have you ever suffered the humiliation of a 13 year old holding a jar over your head?\" Grant looked at him through teary eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor, I'm. I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, its not your fault Mark, its just this big world. You're a good boy, don't you forget that. Just leave a woman be, Mark.\" Grant said, before she got back up and started fiddling with her ray gun again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark looked at her one more time, before going through the door, walking down the hallway. He needed to do some things before he left to his dorm room.</span></div></div>",

Instead, Mark saw the doctor bring a certain, confidence, that flowed through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Grant, are you feeling well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Grant looked up from her spreadsheets, she looked wildly at Mark, before her expression softened. \"Yes..yes, Mark.

He looked down at the city, doing his best to discern any crime. None of his greater villains appeared to be out. No Bubblepunk, no Thunder Thighs, no Megabutt, no Cheersquad. Magic Man's day was going well so far. Right up until his sense spell alerted him towards a commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, hah. None of you are laughing now right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does not sound like anyone I know; I guess the succubus has gotten another poor girl\" Magic Man flew down to the source of the sound, arriving at a super market. Civilians were nowhere to be seen, only their clothes indicated they were ever there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman burst out of an aisle, her face was clearly distressed. Magic Man was looked at the approaching woman, whose face became relief at the sight of him. Looking closer at her, Magic Man could clearly see she was a cashier here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help, help. Magic Ma-\" She was cut off, a beam of green energy hit her back. Magic Man gasped, was she going to die? Right before his eyes, the woman appeared to shrink downwards. From an average height to child size to doll size. Magic Man breathed in relief, at least she wasn't dead! Looking around for the culprit, Magic Man scooped up the poor woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man whispered in a low voice. \"What happened here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I was putting away some food. Suddenly some crazy ass lady appeared in some weird suit; she was tiny thing,but did have some curves though. Anyways, she started to rave about how 'you all laughed at me' and then Jeffery, our security guard, came towards her. He was trying to calm her down, but then she shot him! I thought Jeffery was going to die, but no, he started shrinking. Everybody else started to panic, and then... then I ran away. I hid in an aisle as everybody got shot. I guess she was still here.\" The woman covered her naked form with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is everybody else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I saw the woman take out some jars. They had some holes in them, so I'm guessing she wasn't trying to kill them. The people are also smaller than me right now, so they could fit in them easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,hostages. Okay, did she say anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noo- wait, yeah, she did. She called herself 'The Shrinker', but 'Crazy Bitch would be a better name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man looked at the doll sized woman, who was currently covering herself. \" What... what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Amelia. I'm going to do my best to fix you, but I need to check for clues.

Everybody is missing and you're just going to let that crazy bimbo get away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not. I just need to wait for an opportunity to present itself.\" Magic Man looked at the six-inch doll sized girl, her voice seemed to possess a fire that she didn't have a few moments ago. She was probably trying to hype herself up, most likely from the guilt of running away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll contact the police and hopefully they'll get somebody here.\" Magic Man snapped his fingers as an old fashioned rotary phone appeared in his hand. He did it mostly for show, he could easily get a newer phone, but where was the fun it that? Amelia looked up at him as he called out through the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse, their has been a recent villain attack at-yes, this is Magic Man. Anyways, its between Katie Avenue and Hollander Park and- no Detective Evans, its a new one. I'm sorry, I don't make them, I just take them in. Okay, they do come after me, but- yeah, yeah. So listen, how long will it take for you to come down here? That long? Alright, see you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Magic Man snapped the phone out of existence. Amelia watched from his coat pocket, wide eyed at his casual display with the police. Magic Man turned his head down at Amelia and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amelia, would you like to act as a witness for the police? I'm just asking and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, no one can see me now. I would die of embarrassment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wondering, keep quiet as Detective Evans and her squad come to investigate. I'll get you at of her soon enough; i'll put you down as a <i>anonymous source.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nThose was a long hour, but Amelia kept her cool as Magic Man explained what had transpired. Detective Evans, as usual, kept bashing Magic Man of his involvement with the villains of the city. With various shots of \"You horny bastard\";\" Your girlfriends are endangering the city;and  \"Perverted Fiends coming in, and around, the city.\" That last one was probably a euphemism of some sort. Finally, Magic Man flew back to his secret lair with Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made contact with the ground and moved forward, Amelia could not get a grip on the mouth of the pocket. Magic Man's jiggling was causing her to keep falling down into the cotton depths. He stopped and Amelia could see a bright flash come through the cotton sheet that protected her from the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, presto, we're here. Welcome Amelia to <i>Chateau de Magic!</i>\" Amelia heard the voice of Magic Man and many thoughts went in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm going to see where our city's protector keeps his HQ! I wished I told him to get my phone, I sure as hell can't use it right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia hurried up from the mouth pocket to look around, and was disappointed with seeing a dirty, rank, old warehouse. She could see broken bottle glasses,caved in windows, and cracks enveloping the floor.That bright flash she was greeted by through the cotton material was a broken light-bulb above Magic Man.As if to annoy her, his giant smiling face looked down at the grimacing girl, Amelia could only said a few words in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>THIS</b> is where you live? Don't tell me, you're a hobo in civilian identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man said. \"Not live, but it is where I keep my projects and where I look over the city from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia looked up at her savoir like he was a madman, Magic Man returned the look. With a laugh, he started to spin around. A thought occurred in Amelia's mind that Magic Man somehow snapped while she was traveling with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man's spinning was starting to make Amelia feel nauseous, but strangely she didn't fly out of Magic Man's coat pocket. Just as quickly as it begun, Amelia felt a sudden stop. She hurried back up to the coat's mouth and looked around, what she saw was completely different than the previous area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as if somebody repainted the entire place; a large computer was located at the back of the warehouse; the walls were colored with a soothing palette; and cases of villain weaponry were everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia could see Thunder Thigh's Thunder Thong; the villain's first defeat resulted in a humiliating ending. She saw Hypnotits Bra Of Titnosis; Magic Man took the thing off during the winter season. She saw a near car sized gum wad from Bubblepunk; that was when the villain tried to trap Magic Man in it, a weird plan, but nevertheless almost successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like? Took me a while to get this all together.\" Magic Man ran towards the computer, Amelia bobbed all the way. He reached it soon enough and took out the dizzy, tiny girl onto a table he conjured. Amelia yelped at her naked form, which wasn't as naked as it was before. It seemed that Magic Man had enough decency to make her a patient shawl for her troubles. He stared at her for a few moments and began to speak to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia, I'm going to test something out. It has to do with the Shrinker's ray and I need a test subject for my theory. Sense you're the only one who I can use as my test subject, will you agree to what i'm planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was about to reply with a large \"NO\", but something in her mind stopped her. She saw flashes as her friends and colleagues began to shrink down in front of her. One girl named Sally, fifteen at most, was begging for help. Amelia took a liking to the girl and mentored her for a few days, Amelia could remember the girl plead for Amelia as she shrank. All Amelia did was cower and hide as people were injured, a coward was what Amelia was. She closed her eyes and began to breathe in. She wouldn't be that every again, she wouldn't cower away as people were harmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man nodded and began to chant slowly, Amelia could feel something happen to her. Whatever the feeling was, it snaked its way through her body like adrenaline. It coursed like a river trying to find its way out towards the ocean. She felt as though the rush of running away was changing into something else, something more <i>noble</i>.

You-*ACHOO*\" Amelia sneezed again, which resulted in her shrinking down into a child size form. Not as small as her doll sized one,  but still unnatural for a grown woman. Amelia swiveled her head around and noticed her new surroundings. Right before she began to speak, another sneeze began. This time it resulted in her growing to a foot smaller than her normal height,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man looked at the changing girl with obvious guilt and said only one thing to answer this conundrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just as he was about to use the first one of these things, his phone ranged. Magic Man pulled it out a spells and looked at the message. He cursed and put all the weird objects away from prying eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Amelia, something has come up. You can watch T.V and move around the facility, take this stone and rub it if you need anything. Don't worry, it'll shrink with you.\" Magic Man handed Amelia a red stone with a green spiral on t for her to use. Amelia looked down at the stone as Magic Man walked off and got into a pod that Amelia swore wasn't there before. Magic Man stood in the pod for a few moments, right before a flash of light took him away to god knows where. This left Amelia alone in the facility,alone..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see whats on the tell- *ACHOO*:\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nMark hurried his way across campus as class almost began in twenty minutes. The situation of Amelia and the Shrinker still perpetuated through his mind, various ways to tackle the situation clouded his capacity to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hellooo, Mark!\" A familiar voice called out, Mark turned around to see the distinct form of Dr. Grant walking towards him. Her general aura seemed to be changed now, she had more skip to her feet than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Dr. Grant, nice to see you again.\" Mark said to her, he smiled at seeing her changed attitude. Whatever happened to her was probably a great thing, Mark thanked this event; he liked seeing Dr. Grant happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mark, I feel exalted at life now. I have acquired a few,<i>tiny</i>, things to help with my mental health.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these \"tiny things\" pray tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just some things I got at the store. They help in relieving my stress\" Dr. Grant replied coolly, she walked off towards the poly-sci building as Mark made his way to the economics facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad she got something to give herself her own happiness. She deserves what she has now,hopefully it lasts her a good while.\" Mark said aloud, he then instantly felt guilty. Somewhere in the city was a mad woman who had taken hostages.those whose own happiness were at stake. Mark needed to find those people to help,so that they can enjoy life like Dr. Grant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Alright, so how can I use this for my 'training'.\" Amelia said aloud, she had decided to test the maneuverability of her own body after trying to watch T.V resulted in her seeing the, currently relatable,movie of \"The Incredibly Shrinking Man. She was currently the size of a three-year old child and had went around the place, which was a lot bigger than the warehouse could ever be, and had acquired a variety of objects to use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nail, string, a tiny piece of cloth, and other \"small\" tools to use. Amelia looked them over, right before she felt a sneeze build in her. She climbed on top of the table and waited for the sneeze to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ACHOO* She felt herself shrink down to her pocket size and the she traveled over to her wares. Just like before, she studied what she had to use and began to combine those things together. Finally, she went and began to plan out how she wanted to reach her goal. Her goal being the bottom of  the Thunder Thighs Thunder Thong exhibit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tied a piece of string around the nail to use as grappling hook. Then she used the cloth as a makeshift gloves to use, so not to burn her hands as she slid down the string. Next she traveled forwards to the exhibit, the distance being like a great desert..Then she arrived at the raised steps of the exhibits,easily passable for a normal human, these things were like the Himalayas for Amelia. Cracks in the foundation allowed her to slowly shimmer her way upwards, before she finally made her way to the thong. She breathed outwards in pure bliss and marveled at her work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think i'm getting the hang of this.\" Amelia smiled, maybe she could help Magic Man take down the Shrinker? That was for later, for now Amelia was going to trek across the facility to hone her skills while Magic Man was away.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He grunted as he fell and  the same sound came from across him. Mark looked up---or more accurately,down--- to see the short and curvy form of Dr.Grant. He shook himself out of his stupor to come to the doctor's aid and pulled her back onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am <i>so</i> sorry, Dr. Grant, I didn't se- I mean, I was caught up in my own thing.\" Mark quickly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Mark.\" Dr. Grant smiled at him. Mark looked at Dr. Grant a little more closely. She had her hair down and her posture was more erect. She looked happier and seemed to have done her face up. In fact, she looked clean and ready for the day, unlike her usual slubby appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Grant, you look great. I..I mean...sorry.\" Mark stuttered out a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't be shy, Mark. I do look <i>GREAT</i>!\" Dr. Grant struck a pose, which on her diminutive stature, normally looked ridiculous. The way she held herself at the moment though, made her look godly. Mark was slack-jawed for a moment, before he got a hold of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark did a double-take of Dr. Grant and noticed a peculiar thing, by her side was a covered jar with a net over the top.He must've been looking very intently on it, because Dr. Grant answered him before he could say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gift for myself, Mark. Just some <i>little</i> things I got for myself\" Dr. Grant proclaimed. \"I'll be seeing you later, Mark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her thing and trotted off, leaving Mark alone in the hallways.

Oh, priceless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Mark asked. Amelia sighed and came over to him.

Mark allowed her to counsel her family;thankfully, her parents didn't file a report for her.They were most likely hoping that she would get home soon. Although, from what Mark could hear, Amelia was getting chewed out by them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Amelia walked over to Mark, or Magic Man as she still didn't know his true identity,who was sitting on a chair in his lair. Amelia motioned for him to make something to sit on, which he obliged. Summoning up a giant, mouse themed chair. She briefly glared at him, but still, she slumped onto the animal chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd it go?\" Magic Man questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Badly.

Hey, he didn't fail her yet (that depended on your definition of \"failure\", however) and nodded at his suggestion. \"Alright, their going to take me tomorrow, will this Mark be ready then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Righty-O\" Magic Man cursed himself, who says \"Righty-O\", everyone but him that is. He stood up from his chair, confidently holding himself in front of the toddler-sized Amelia with gusto.Amelia looked up at Magic Man, with a face between \"Awesome\" and \"Is this really the dork that protects the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man held himself like this for longer than he intended, when he was than thankfully interrupted by a beep from his monitor.

For a second time that night, Amelia looked at him weirdly. Magic Man noticed that and went more in-depth. \"My magic powers generally can summon up simple tools and objects, but larger things take up more time. I don't need to have intimate knowledge of the object, but I have to have a general idea of it, shape and some of its workings. Its also limited to things in the realm of 'norm.'

Like, maybe small enough to fit in my pocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man raised his hand just before Mouse could speak.\"Yeah, I know:embarrassing, but hear me out, though.

Magic Man gently lifted her up and placed her inside of his pocket. Heading towards the door, Magic Man arrived in front of the abandoned warehouse. Looking around, he muttered a spell. A light pulse burst from him, highlighting everything in the area. Magic Man watched for any movement, looking for a human glow, seeing none, he dissipated the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring upwards, Magic Man shot up into the sky and flew himself towards the disturbance.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"You look kinda adorable peeking out of my pocket.\" Magic Man jokingly stated as he stared over the skyline; Magic Man soared through the air like a bird, Mouse stared down at the skyline. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh it up all you want.\" Mouse spoke sarcastically, before she noticed something odd.\" Why can we talk with each other? You're not going plane fast, but you're still going at a respectable speed. Nothing is covering us and shouldn't I be pushed to the bottom of your pocket right now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm glad you asked that. I don't get that question often, but I also don't get partners often as well.\" Magic Man shook his head as he realized he was rambling. \"Anyways, yeah, my spells get rid of the most dangerous parts of physics. You know, like someone like little old me not getting oxygen while hundreds of feet in the air. And not getting shot down as a U.F.O or being detected by the government. Hell, if you look closely, you can see bugs getting squished against a shield.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse eyes widened, she peered in front of her to see a faint glow in front of the duo. There is was, a shield, which had a bunch of squished bugs in front of Magic Man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck! Why isn't there a giant field of green around you when you come down then?\" Mouse spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch.\" Magic Man replied, Mouse turned towards the shield again to see it flash faintly. Not too bright,but bright enough for someone paying attention. Mouse saw the bug bodies accumulating on the shield disappear, fried off like crispy critters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, and practical, right?\"Magic Man questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work on cars?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do.\" Magic Man replied,sardonically. Suddenly, he stopped and floated around an area. He slowly descended down onto the street,police cars already at the scene of the crime. The new Shrinker crime scene was a parlor of all places; \"Beau-tiques.\" was proudly stamped onto a sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" He whispered into his pocket. Mouse jumped out, growing back to her larger size. Magic Man landed on the concrete, he waved as Detective Evans walked up to the heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic Man and...\" She stared as Mouse came up beside him. She looked back at Magic Man.\"I didn't know you're working with Rat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is Mouse. She's new.\" Magic Man replied. Detective Evans raised an eyebrow at that, turning to Mouse, she pointed a finger. \"You may want to change the colors on costume, make the ears a little bigger, make it a little more charming. The original Rat wasn't a danger to anyone, but she was annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it ma'am.\" Mouse saluted her, Evans rolled her eyes, she offered her hand for a handshake which Mouse took gingerly. After finishing their introductions, Evans went back to conversing with Magic Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have on this place?\" Magic Man questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a parlor, as you obviously see, but also an antique store.\" She raised a hand as Magic Man was about to say something. \"I know, weird, but this isn't my store. We only know what happened through piece meal, so excuse me if my explanation is bare bones. About twenty minutes ago, the villianess known as Shrinker walked into the store; pointing her weird gun around, she tried to shrink a bunch of civilians. She didn't succeed, with over twelve people getting away from her, though, she did get a sizable amount of people. Important among them is Ayla Chang, known as 'Lady Quartz' to her friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupted Magic Man again with a raised hand.\" I didn't name her. Back onto topic, she proceeded to due this for over ten minutes. An anonymous eyewitness spoke that vacuumed over sixteen people into cages. She escaped, but we have a good idea that she may still be in the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, we'll do our best to help, Evans\" Magic Man proclaimed. As two walked away, Magic Man faintly heard \"I wonder what the other girls in the city will do once they find out he's taken.\" He blushed at Evan's observation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Crouching down next to the detective, the officer of the law motioned her to look closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you use your shrinking powers? I'm seeing something really weird on this glass here and I'm not quite sure if my mind is playing tricks on me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse nodded and shrunk down. She saw the lot getting larger and larger around her, before her body stopped at around 3 inches. Evans whistled, which caused Mouse to cover her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse nodded at the apology, soon walking right towards the piece of glass. Bending down to inspect the glass, she soon saw what Evans about. It was a minor indent in the glass, but what made it strange was that it appeared to be chiseled with something. As if someone had a tiny pick and carved out a piece of the glass. Mouse raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detective Evans, where did you get this glass from?\" Mouse questioned. Evans pointed to one of many broken windows and Mouse regrew to her normal height. Walking over, she saw the broken glass window. Shrinking down again, she grabbed onto the ledge to inspect the miniature scene. She jumped inside of the building,avoiding glass shards on the windowsill. She inspected the corner of  where she was at. Looking at the side, she could see miniature picks in the side of the wall. Craning her head, Mouse could see the tiny carvings going up all the way to the top of the roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse turned towards Magic Man and headed to the windowsill's edge. Growing before she hit the floor, Mouse came to Magic Man. Behind her, she could hear Evans shuffling to get to the duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse, wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse quickly tapped on his side and pointed to the corner. Raising her fingers upwards, she pointed to the roof. Magic Man stayed quiet, while Evans motioned her men to point their guns upwards. Magic Man whispered something out and a small energy arrow appeared next to his head. A sharp whistle erupted from his mouth. The arrow shot forth, followed by a miniature curse from someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your hands over yo-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvans never got the chance to finish that sentence. Ten small smoke bombs came from that corner, which soon became normal sized bombs. They exploded over the crowd and a thud inside of the was masked by a variety of curses. A bright beam shot forth, splashing against Evans chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe perp rushed out the backdoor of the boutique while everyone else was dealing with the chaos inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EVANS\" Magic Man screamed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay,<font class=\"size25\" style=\"\"> just get</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">that crook.</font>\" Her sound soon grew too tiny to hear. Magic Man quickly uttered a shield spell to cover the detective, so hopefully nobody would step on her small size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mouse, come here!\" Magic Man cried out. The junior heroine rushed forth and grabbed a hold of Magic Man's hand. She shrank down and was soon gently placed inside of his pocket. The mage stomped out of the boutique, shooting after the villainess like a bullet.</span></div></div>",

It shrunk load-bearing holds, cars, people, and all manner of things.Which gave Magic Man a considerable load to work with. He jumped forwards, snatching a woman who had shrunk while crossing the street. He laid her down onto the side and allowed Mouse to begin administering aid. Pointing upwards, he teleport towards the sky and brought down a man who was falling from his platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing him down, Magic Man then moved towards a car which was slowly shrinking and the unfortunate inhabitants who weren't under the beam's effects.

The duo saw The Shrinker run towards into an alleyway. Smiling, Magic Man ran in and saw...nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She must've shrunk!\" Mouse screamed.  Jumping out of Magic Man's pocket, she grew to her full size before impact then shrunk down again. She searched through the alleyway, every nook and cranny, but despaired at finding no source of the missing villianess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Mouse cried. Magic Man gently lifted her up and counseled her. After a few moments, the hero realized that he needed to check in on Evans and the woman.

He followed behind the oblivious villain as she she sang to the world. It wasn't loud enough to be considered yelling, but it was a noticeable thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstro-Cheeks, or Joan Kepler, was one of the rare villains that didn't originally come from the city or knew Mark personally. This thankfully made fights against her a little easier in Mark's conscious, a little. What he could gather from his notes was that she was an Inductee to the Space Program. Some accident,or something, caused her to be booted out. The Succubus came to the girl and gave her the power to \"go to the moon\" or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways, the villain traveled to the city on the needling of the Succubus and now was in conflict with Mark, just like all his other rogues. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one of his trickery foes, do to her power to absorb materials in to her body. Which resulted in a growth of mass, mostly concentrating in her lower half. But unlike two members of the \"Fanny Four\"---villains focusing on their bottoms--- she grew in height as well, but wasn't as even out as the Squished. Who was just a size changer obsessed with her bottom. The mass only temporarily affects her though, whatever she absorbed falls out of her. That had its own problems with debris and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark tailed her to see if she was trying to do anything and hopefully put a stop to whatever scheme she had in mind. It most likely relating  to her master plan in trying to grow so big she could reach the moon, an insane plan with many holes in its logic.</span></div></div>",

It was early in the morning and Mark's class started three hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I like about flying? The relative quietness of it all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CAW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man turned his head and glared at the bird who opened its mouth. Taking a sip of his coffee, Magic Man glared at the bird for a few more minutes before he lowered himself. Looking forward, Magic Man basked in the early morning glow. He could feel the south wind and north wind meet together, which made Magic Man smile calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough games; time for work. So what do we have for today?\" Magic Man opened his senses farther than his body normally could handle. His eyes scanned the streets, his nose sniffed the wind, and his ears catching the sounds of the urban jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, robbery! No, just moving, Oh, accident! And the woman appears to be fine. Oh, fire! Just a little one.\" Magic Man said as he scanned the city. It seemed to be  a slow morning, which was good, but a part of Magic Man wished for a little excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I smell.\" Magic Man gave a great snort of his nose. \"Oh...oooh. That's probably from the brothel, I just focus elsewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped before he could turn his attention elsewhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that smell is coming from...the park. And it doesn't seem to be animal musk. I need to go investigate.\" Magic Man stated. Aiming himself at the park, Magic Man shot forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreighton Park span over two city blocks and was named after one of the benefactors of the area around it. This early in the morning, it should've been filled with joggers, bums, or people shift folk heading home. And technically it was filled with those people at the moment. Except they were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. I am not ready for this.\" Magic Man said as he stared at all the writhing forms on the ground.People seemed to be in the throes of passion, moaning could be heard in all directions. Several people huffed on the grass, apparently finished with pleasuring themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man couldn't find the words to what he saw before him. It was the strangest thing he ever saw and he was given powers by a Succubus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does anyone need medical attention?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoans were his only reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think what I'm seeing is illegal.\" Magic Man stated. \"Should..should I leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man was about to leave,but a sound stopped him in his tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling it a sound was not doing what Magic Man heard justice. The voice was rapturous. It could've been the sound of Heaven. It was like eating really pleasurable food. It made Magic Man feel delight. Looking down, Magic Man could see Mister Wood poking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh darnit.\" Magic Man mumbled out something to quell his pants. Mister Wood wilted and Magic Man could see the people on the ground moan again. And Magic Man almost wanted to join in,but he quickly cast another spell to quiet down the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saving this for the early morning traffic, but hey, this can work too.\"  Magic Man joked. With the spell in place, Magic Man could actually hear words beneath the sound. It sounded like someone was singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Do,re,mi,fa,si,doe!~</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we have ourselves a siren.\" Magic Man stated. \"I guess its up to me to reel her in.\"</span></div></div>",

It wouldn't be so strange if it didn't register as the exact same voice as the mysterious singer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Magic Man floated towards that area, he did his best not to alert the villainess in case she fled,or worse, had another power up her sleeve.

A piece of art that the city commissioned, allegedly on windy days the rocks would sing, though Magic Man had yet to hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crept closer and closer, a bubble shield spell already on his lips. With a short, spell enhanced, jump the hero tried to rush the villainess before they even could even expect. There was no one behind the rocks though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Magic Man questioned. He focused on his hearing until he could once again detect the sound. He followed the tune towards his target.In his sights was a small woman in a hoodie, or at least he guessed was a small woman, the figure had a feminine outline. She was walking on a concrete path away from the park, no doubt trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll I won't have that.\" Magic Man said.

He causally waved towards the gawking folk of the fair city,like it was normal for him to do this. It was a nice day and Magic Man just decided to walk through the city streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Citizens!\" He happily stated,finger gunning two smiling kids as they walked with their parents.He smiled as he swaggered down the street until he heard something from his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh. LOOK OUT!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man say two spheres completely take his view. He suddenly felt his mouth closed by some sort of cloth. Following this, Magic Man felt his feet leave the sidewalk for a second. Air brushed his back before hard concrete replaced it. Now having a protective charm on him that protected his body most of the time made the fall not as damaging as it could've been, but it still caused him to gasp in shock.He struggled under the heavy weight of whatever was covering his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I'm so sorry. It's just that I was testing my powers and I didn't expect it to do thi..this to me!\" A young voice called out. Instantly the weight on top of Magic Man lessened and his view cleared up,allowing him to see what the weight was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at a ski-mask covered face and a tank-top covered chest. This tank-top was also currently straining from the biggest,most spherical breasts that Magic Man has ever seen. Hypnotits could never dare to compete with the size. They swung like pendulum in the tight shirt. They were a creamy white and with a deep canyon of cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was.\" This woman who possessed a monster bust finally looked down at Magic Man. \"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that,the woman disappeared as she appeared. Magic Man dumbly searched for the mysterious girl,but he didn't see any of sign of the woman. Realizing he was still on the sidewalk, and a small audience, the hero teleport himself back up to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Well. That was nothing, don't worry about this. Go on with your day folks.\" Magic Man quickly shot up to the sky and flew away.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\nA day after that weird event, Magic Man walked through the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe passed the man-made lake,smiling as he saw ducks come and go through the water. He wasn't paying that much attention to the world at the moment. The day was young and the bright rays of the sun colored the land. He just wanted to bask in the early air for a bit before superheroing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK OUT BELOW\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man remembered that same voice from yesterday. He quickly formed a better shield around himself. Looking up,a tree dropped something large and gray. It traveled downwards and Magic Man covered himself. A warm, thick pillowy mass mashed against the back of his head. He crashed into the grass with a loud \"oof\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang, I can't believe I get out of that situation!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a repeat of yesterday, and the mass disappeared from his back. Magic Man slowly got up and turned around to see who was the cause of this squashing. It was a relatively minuscule woman in a grey costume. An hourglass symbol proudly displayed between her cleavage. Her head was covered with a bunch of eyes with hourglass pupils. But the most surprising thing about the girl was her butt. It was a complete opposite of her cleavage from yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so big that Magic Man could see it even though she was standing in front of him. Her hips were wider than her shoulders. If he didn't know she was a new girl,he would've mistaken her for Thunder Thighs. He gaped at her enlarged body. She dusted her sides for a few minutes, looking up at Magic Man with an eep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm..oooh. I remember this. I'll see you tomorrow!\" The girl ran away, or waddle was more appropriate, from Magic Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" Magic Man spoke, but the girl phased away like a phantom.

So, this meant one thing, Mark sighed,<i>MegaButt</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bow down to the Big Booty Goddess!\" A voiced ranged from behind the behind. Why did she break through a building? Anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood tall, or as tall as 5'5 body type would have it. Megabutt's spandex was on tight against her rear at the moment, her crotch had a 'camel's toe' on it. Her face open to the public, although only Mark remembered who it was before. A girl who was a close friend to Mark, before the succubus came to her in a time of desperation. One of many reasons he didn't want to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwinging her rear through the wall, it collapsed. Megabutt didn't notice, more intent on causing destruction. She flew upwards, her rear still expanded and jiggly. It was about as big as a \"curled-in-fetal position\" man. Her ass went through an the brick wall like it was nothing.Another reason Mark didn't want to fight her, she was one of his stronger rouges. But Mark was a hero and sometime heroes need to do something that they hate. Mark steadied himself, he had to go stop her once again!</span></div></div>",

When the coast was clear, he ran through the open doors, just as they closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He slowly hid behind a table and watched this scene unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you certain it will work Doctor?\u201d Megabutt asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. I may have gotten my powers from a non-technical place, but I still have the equipment available. My calculations are correct.\u201d Dr. Grant answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt nodded. She was ready to execute her plan, but she was still very anxious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy beautiful curves will not be affected...will they?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Grant smiled. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of it. You\u2019re butt will be able to preform the same functions at your new size.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt was incredibly relieved. The most important thing was her behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then. Shall we proceed as planned? The machine is ready.\u201d The Shrinker asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Megabutt said \u201cI will ascend to godhood. Nobody, not even that pathetic Magic fool will stand in my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Grant grinned. She immediately went over to her machine, and began to push buttons. Magic Man saw how it worked. There was a large box, with a laser on the end. The laser blasted the subject and caused them to grow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The villainess could still be around the area, we recommend finding shelter soon.\" The police officer said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scene in question was the warehouse of the Mackillian Brothers, two of the wealthiest financiers of the northern half of the state. It wouldn't be that bad---it was just a warehouse---if not for the fact the place was in the middle of a busy highway <i>and</i> cross section of the city. Many pedestrians stopped to look at the carnage of a wrecked metal door and one particularly inquisitive pedestrian accidentally got a little <i>too</i> close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really that dangerous?\" The woman's question was filled with fear as she spoke to the officer. She wore a green sundress pattered with cute, little rabbits; a large sunhat blocked most of of her face. All in all, a perfect specimen of innocence if one ever saw one.A primal instinct stuck in the hidden recess of the arbiter came forth, he looked at the woman in one of the \"hardest\" faces he could muster. \"Yes, we don't know which assailant could have done this attack. And we don't want to put the little one in danger, do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe police officer pointed down at the obvious bulge the woman possessed, she nodded fearfully. The woman walked off and her spot was filled with more crowding citizens as she made her way from the crime scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody suspects a thing\" The woman whispered to herself, she walked through an alleyway and made her way to a wall that any pedestrian could easily miss. She made one look around, and even put her tongue out of for good measure, to see if anyone was watching her. Satisfied with the knowledge of nobody currently seeing her, she hastily used a fingernail  to tap on the wall. In almost an instant, the wall began to open and the woman checked if anyone decided to look into the alleyway at that moment for some reason. She saw no one again and made her way in, the wall slammed shut behind her, only scaring off a few rats and pigeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooo, I need a hot bath.\" The woman said, she walked down a corridor and arrived at its end.

A briefcase was on a shelf that occupied the space right of the woman. A comfy chair was the only furniture that was in the room at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman began to strip down from her dress, she appeared to be only using that for any decency. No undergarments were on her person, but her belly still bulged. The woman then began to breathe in and out, very slowly. This was followed by the woman beginning to cough, her jaw unhinged, and with a final cough, a large sphere plopped right in her hands. Instantly, her belly shrunk down to the tone abs of a gymnast. The woman patted her own stomach,as though she was a animal that did its job well. And seeing that the woman known as Cobra had animal-like behavior, her lizard brain could've been rewarding itself of its own hardship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cobra, still nude, walked towards the monitor, she still held onto the sphere. She went up to the monitor and held the sphere towards a little nodule. She walked out of view, so not to give her nude form away. She typed a few commands into the keyboard and clicked the \"OK\" for a picture. The nodule possessed a little window that shrank and grew and finished with a flash. The Cobra waited, a ding indicated she had a message. She held the sphere under her arm and typed in the chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n} COBRA, REPORTING IN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n}YOU'RE LATE BY [15] MINUTES, WHAT HAPPENED?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n}GOT DELAYED, SEEMED THAT THE BLUEPRINTS I GOT WERE OUT OF DATE BY A MONTH OR TWO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cobra waited as whoever was on the other line was no doubt looking to punish the person handling the blueprints for this mission. Their \"cred\" was on the line and giving false data to an contractor was considered grounds for mercenaries not to take those jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n}UNDERSTOOD, THE FIRST EXTRACTION WILL BE DELAYED FOR ANOTHER [30] MINUTES. YOU'LL HOPEFULLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GET THERE, IF NOT, PLAN B WILL BE READY IN CASE ANY COMPLICATIONS HAPPEN. GOOD LUCK,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cobra nodded at that and began to walk towards the briefcase, she put one hand over the top of it and the the thing opened up. Inside was her famous Cobra suit and the titular mercenary began to ease her way back into her \"skin.\"</span></div></div>",

Either he pointed those out and called the police,or he came to interrupt them if the police were too far away. He sat as he waited for the next event to occur, using a spy-glass to watch over the cityscape. Suddenly, he spotted a peculiar sight, a woman seemed to be greatly distressed about something. He looked around her area closer, and gasped in shock at what he saw. Around her area were wrecked cars, some of which were even on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man did one thing,and one thing only: he flew to her rescue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made landfall and spoke a few words, a raincloud appeared over the place he was at. The water poured down by the gallon, washing the burning wreckage. When it settled, Magic Man scanned the area, it now resembled a scrapyard of cars. He turned back towards the woman, who stared at him in awe of his might. He could see she wore a hoodie and a beanie on top of her head;besides that, she had a pretty face and raven hair flowed from some of the hoodie's gaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here citizen.\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a horrible accident here!\" The woman cried, it was pretty obvious what she was referring to.Magic Man could hear a southern drawl in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes popped almost out of his head when he heard of an accident though, he did a double take around the area. There wasn't any bodies in the wrecks, thank god, so then who was this woman? She didn't appear to be scrapped or bruised, so where did she come from? Magic Man turned back to the woman and began to ask her a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how exactly did this accident occur---and when?\" Magic Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a foppish, ma-gee-sea-and,came and got caught in a electrified net. And when it occurred,I say about---now.\" The woman smiled at Magic Man when she finished her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Magic Man could barley finish his sentence before he heard a creaking noise behind him. He turned around and was quickly greeted by a steel net hurtling towards his face, Magic Man quickly put up a shield to block the incoming projectile.The net limply fell to the ground as Magic Man breathed out in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost gat ya there,partner.\" The woman's voice called from behind Magic Man. He turned around to see the hoodie woman revealed in all her glory. Her hair was done in the style of a cow, a stenson hat covered her head, and she was decked like an old-fashioned cowgirl. Although, she did have room for cleavage she didn't possess, odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name's, Cowgirl, howdy.\" She said with a willy grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Cowgirl Howdy.\" Magic Man responded back, he summoned a mystical sword and shield to prepare himself. Cowgirl grinned in response to his jab.\" Well, my glamorous guardian, I've been seeing you in da funny papers lately. I made a decision that involves your butt and me getting dough from any of your girlfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance, Howdy, it'll take a lot more than one net to get me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, because I have several.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second time today, Magic Man could only respond with a \"Wha-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind, and around him, the wreckage of the cars revealed themselves to be various net launchers. Magic Man called upon as many shields as possible to block off the nets being launched at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCowgirl watched as Magic Man blocked the multitude of nets coming his way. She noted his response time, his reaction time, and his casting time. All these factors she considered in her head as she watched the battle unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Nice to see this one fair better than some of the other \"supers\" I bagged.</i>\" Cowgirl noted in  satisfaction, maybe this one could be a challenge?

Cowgirl quickly huffed and took out a remote, she pressed a button on it that released a beeping noise. Magic Man had only a few seconds to react as his vision was filled with smoke. He summoned a gale of wind to blow it away and saw the retreating form of Cowgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man sped after her and while he did a thought came over him. \"<i>Did her chest get bigger when she said 'moooving'?</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Between two skyscrapers was a net;not invisible,but one couldn't see it if they were hundreds of feet below. But from Magic Man's position, the light glared obviously from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm.\" Magic Man could only state dumbly. He scratched his chin. \"Is...is this meant for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew closer to it and stared at the \"trap\", if he could even call it that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless I'm a bird, this is pretty easy to see.

But come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering out a spell, Magic Man formed an energy sword to cut the net. The moment he done so, a second trap was sprung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn both roofs of the skyscrapers, a total of six armed ladies appeared,hidden by the building lips. Armed with weapons of weird design, Magic Man's eyes opened in shock. Forming a shield around himself, the hero thought himself safe, he was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA weird foam formed around the outline of his shield and Magic Man could feel it constrict.

If it was this heavy,than if he let it drop, it would probably injury many civilians below him. Besides that, the women would probably shoot him the minute he got out. And then he would also have to deal with the incoming foam ball of death, which brought him back to problem one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo instead of escaping, Magic Man allowed the foam to harden around the ball shield's surface. With great care,he allowed himself to drop down. While not being able to see, he flew by the buildings so many times, Magic Man steered the descending ball to the roof of a smaller building. He gently laid the foam ball down and dispelled his shield. The interior of the sphere was extremely hot though and Magic Man began to pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I packed an cooling spell.\" He huffed. Some intricate and essential part of the sphere allowed Magic Man the ability to breath, but not enough for cool air to blow inwards. Magic Man gulped and waited, instantly he heard a harpoon smack against the ball's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess this is the welcome wagon.\" Magic Man joked. His plan of teleporting out and flying off was still on the menu since the sphere was now on more stable land, yet he still didn't want to bank on the fact whether or not the group were fast enough to foam him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMumbles issued forth from outside the foam sphere and Magic Man lightly enhanced his hearing to listen in on the group who had captured him.</span></div></div>",

Magic Man watched, entrapped, as her cute lips plumped up like they were filling with silicon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two face lines finished their transformation upon reaching a size that reached the bottom half of her nose. She smiled with her large lips and puckered them up greatly. She \"blew\" a kiss towards his generally direction and a wave of pink lipstick flew from them.Magic Man only had a few minutes to doge,and in a few moments, a couple of potted plants behind him shrunk down to minuscule size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man kept his eyes on her, before he realized that in his confusion to escape, Shrinker had gone missing.\"Damn, where did you go, Grant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man looked around and tried to find the small villainess, while also keeping his wits about Lipsticker. The sound of creaking rubble caused him to turn around, quickly dodging Grant, who almost tackled him. Magic Man briefly saw her lips ready to give him a big ole' smooch, he shuddered a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She is pretty, but she was also my mentor and ten years my age, it would be kinda weird.\" </i>Magic Man thought internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Magic Man, don't be like that. Just let us give you a couple of kisses.\" Lipsticker spoke sedutivley, her enlarged lips seemingly did nothing to impede her speech. Shrinker had appeared on the right side of the villainess and lazily smiled at Magic Man, waiting to make his move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, how about you two kiss my rear?\" Magic Man said, beyond the two he saw a window and thought up a pretty dumb plan.Steadying himself, Magic Man readied to act it out. \"Here we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRushing forward, which surprised the two, Magic Man quickly muttered two spells. \"Invincibility; Running\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crashed out of the skyscraper and hoped that what happened next wouldn't <i>hurt</i> too bad. He hit the concrete sixty floors down and the wind in him was knocked out.

She looked down to see her tobacco stick almost crushed between her lips before shrinking them back down to a manageable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologies.\" She said to Shrinker, she lit her cigarette up. A crash came through her penthouse door and eight guards armed with rifles came rushing in. Michael, her lead bodyguard, came rushing in at the forefront. He swept his view around the room, noticing the shrunken plants and the notorious Shrinker, then placed his gaze on his employer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, are you alright?\" He questioned. Lipsticker smiled and waved her hand in a lazy fashion. \"I am, Michael, no need to worry. If the other gentlemen would please stand outside, that would be fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bodyguards filtered outside, leaving only Shrinker, Michael, and Lipsticker alone in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now to deal with our rivals.\"</i> Lipsticker thought as she went towards her desk, sitting down and relaxing for a few moments.<i>\"I wished those wild, sex crazed Magic Man, fanatics could deal with each other. Buffoons I said, and buffoons they are, only wished they could deal with each other....\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLipsticker felt a light-bulb flash in her brain before she spoke again.\"Michael, be a dear and put out a notice to every little market in this city. I'm putting six million on Magic Man's head and whom ever gets him out of the picture will be greatly rewarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"This way they'll deal with Magic Man, and be out of my hair. And for the more 'controlled' ones, well, Shrinker and I will have to deal with them ourselves.\"<br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

Mark knew he had to get back to his dorm room. He pulled himself into an alleyway to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dragged himself out of the darkness and into his college campus. He hurriedly moved across the green, trying not to wake the students at the late hour of night. When he reached his building, he pressed himself against the wall and took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, he summoned the last of his strength to fly up and into his room via an open window. He collapsed onto his bed, thoroughly exhausted. He closed his eyes and tried to rest, knowing a battle was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.... two days later......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up that morning with the sun. He rubbed his eyes and sat up. His phone rang suddenly. He picked it up and said a greeting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMark? It\u2019s me, Dave. Listen have you seen the news?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark stood up. \u201cNo. What\u2019s going on? Are you all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s the villains. You better turn on your TV.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark rushed to his TV and pushed the on button, changing it from TBS to CNN. He nearly dropped the phone. In front of him was the image of 10 villains chained up and being led to a prison that even Mark couldn\u2019t get out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to call you later Dave. Thanks.\u201d He said, hanging up. He couldn\u2019t believe it. How could all his enemies be apprehended so easily? Then it dawned on him. The Shrinker and Lipsticker we\u2019re behind this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man began to form a plan. But first, if he was to win, he\u2019d need backup. He picked up god phone once again and dialed the number of a certain girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAmelia? Get over here right now. Code red. And bring Checkmate. We\u2019re gonna need her.\u201d He said, not leaving time for a response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rushed over as fast as possible. Mark let them in, and quickly turned away as they changed into their super suits. Mark did the same, becoming Magic Man once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, now that we\u2019re here, let me brief you. As you may know, 10 of the top villains were caught and incarcerated. This sounds good, but I\u2019m here to tell you that it\u2019s not. The Shrinker and Lipsticker teamed up to form a size changing lipstick, and a partnership. They used their combined powers to force the villains into capture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure? If what you say is true, we have no chance. They will be too strong! What do we do?\u201d Asked Mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down. We don\u2019t know what they want, so let\u2019s not freak out. I say we come up with a plan. I have an idea, but it\u2019s risky. We should attack them, Checkmate and I. They are hiding in Dr. Grant\u2019s lair. While we distract them, I need you to infiltrate and steal the lipstick, or maybe use a device to enhance your powers so you grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse thought about this. Checkmate made the signal \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Should they continue with this plan?</span></div></div>",

Mark nodded, as did Checkmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hero\u2019s thought for a while, no one wanting to say their plan. After a few moments, Magic Man nearly jumped out of his seat. He had struck inspiration! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Shrinker is a lone wolf. The lipsticker is as close to a mobster as we have. They may be working together, but if we could....break them up. Then we could defeat them individually. Right?\u201d Asked Magic Man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa. But tell me Mark, how are we going to break them apart? They seem like they have a good relationship.\u201d Said Mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou May think that now, Amelia. But trust me, deep down these villains are nothing but selfish. All they want is either me, or this city. Sometimes both. We can figure out how to break them up.\u201d Mark finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Asked Amelia. Checkmate also looked at him, not fully believing in his plan. Mark smiled and revealed his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure this machine will work?\u201d Asked The Lipsticker. She was standing on her balcony, watching the Shrinker work feverishly on a computer. It was attached to a large circular device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure. Listen, you may be new to this, but I am a professional. Believe it or not.\u201d She replied, not looking up from her work. The Lipsticker casually approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd may I ask something? Why do we need this contraption if we both have powers? You have the lipstick and your regular ability. If we combine, can\u2019t we do it?\u201d Asked the Lipsticker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shrinker let out a deep sigh. She knew that her partner didn\u2019t understand the science behind their scheme. She turned and smiled at her partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, It\u2019s simple really. Think about this: every time I shrink something, there is a required amount of power, called a miniaturization pulse. That Magic Boy takes about a 3.5 magnitude pulse to shrink down. Together, we have the powers of about a 10.75 magnitude pulse. This city would take about a 5 million magnitude pulse. Hence the machine.\u201d She finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI get it. We need more power for a target this big. So are we using the machine for shrinkage or using it to boost our power?\u201d Asked The Lipsticker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will simply use it to shrink the city. There is no way we could shrink everything. Our powers are not nearly strong enough. And even if they were boosted it would drain our power for good.\u201d The Doctor explained. The Lipsticker nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, to test our machine. I have every confidence it will work. And when it does, we shall be Queens!\u201d She said. Both let out a long evil laugh for good measure. The Doctor realized her dream would finally come true as she clasped her hand on the lever. It was time. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I don't know who that is.\" Mouse whispered to Magic Man as they saw the symbol painted on the wall. Magic Man looked at Mouse and simply stated: \"Yeah, I don't know who that is either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate, meanwhile, was held by at arms length by a giant Squisher. Out of all the heroes at the moment, she was probably the most dangerous behind Magic Man. The members of the Fanny Four surrounded Magic Man. who had spent all his reserved spells to fight off the attackers. Mouse couldn't do a thing to the group either, except runaway from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack onto topic, the Fanny Four shoved the Mouse and Magic Man forward to the symbol; Checkmate still struggled against the hold of the Squisher. Megabutt and Thunder Thighs flanked the sides of the heroes. Astro-Cheeks played with the case containing the artifact behind the trio, right before she was admonished silently by Squisher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we got the thing you wanted, now how about your part of the deal?\" Megabutt stated to the symbol drawn wall. Mouse and Magic Man looked at each other weirdly as to their perspective Megabutt was speaking to a wall. Suddenly, the symbol switched around, revealing a screen of some sort. The screen showed only a dark silhouette of somebody, it steeped its fingers as it loomed down at the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Thighs quickly motioned for Astro-Cheeks to come forward with the case and the German quickly did. She held the case up to the screen and opened it up to show off the contents within it. The figure nodded and spoke out with a distorted voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. As you have fulfilled your part of the bargain, so shall I. And I see that you decided to go out and get your prize early as well.\" The silhouette pressed a button offscreen, a slow buzzing filled the air as squadron of drones flew through an opening in the warehouse. The Fanny Four seemed apprehensive at first, but quickly changed their tone as the saw each drone didn't hold any weaponry on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour drones dropped down a crate, Astro-Cheeks walked over and kicked an opening into it. A flow of cash drained out of it, Thunder Thigh stalked over to count the money. Meanwhile, Astro-Cheeks received another package from a different drone. It appeared to be a case of collars, she inspected those closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope everything is in order?\" The figure asked from the screen. Thunder Thighs yelled out. \"It appears so, yes. I believe it does,though, we do need to check out if your other product can do what you said it can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstro-Cheeks walked over to Mouse and Magic Man, before the could react, Squisher grew to a larger size to stomp her foot onto them. She made caution to grow too large, so that Checkmate could grab onto her open skin. Asto-Cheeks gently put a collar around Magic Man's neck, a little more forcefully onto Checkmate and Mouse. She stepped away to see the results of her action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Squisher, let Checkmate touch you,if you would be a dear.\" Thunder Thigh said, still counting overlooking the money. Squisher tentatively did as she was told, Instantly Checkmate jumped around to grab  a hold of Squisher. Nothing happened. The size-changer smiled and grew to a larger height to hold onto Checkmate. Mouse tried to shrink down to help her friend, but the collar grew faster than she shrunk and was nearly choked by it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Magic Man's powers?\" The figure spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehh, I saw the guy spend all his power on us already, no need to worry.I think he needs to make them somewhere, we'll have that conversation with him later. And it will be a little more....<i>intimate.</i> We're solid though, with this we can take down the rest of the competition! Not only that, but we got the prize everyone wants: Magic Man!\" Megabutt said proudly. The figure nodded and pressed another offscreen button, the drone flew lazily out the same way they came in. Now the three heroes were with the four villainess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets tie the girl's up and make Magic Man use his tongue for something more <i>productive.</i>\" Thunder Thighs said, finished with her counting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some struggling,the four completed their task. Mouse and Checkmate were bounded up tightly, and to add insult to injury, were tied to a rope attached to the ceiling, courtesy of Squisher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo could only watch helplessly as Magic Man held in a tight embrace by Squisher, heading to a undisclosed part of the warehouse. The four talking about what they'll do to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need my lingerie.\" Thunder Thighs said unhappily. \" I am simply not dressed for this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go bare;who need to hide their own body unless they're outside?\" Megabutt proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can turn into a bear?\" Astro-Cheeks said oddly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to touch him first, this is great!\" Squisher announced happily, holding onto Magic Man like a doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mouse fiddled her hands in boredom as she hung with Checkmate above the warehouse's floor. A sound rattled them, the source coming from beyond their viewpoint. This was soon followed by a shockwave that shook the entire warehouse and caused the rope the duo were bonded in slid a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone were to ask Mouse, she would say that she didn't scream a little femininely do to that. Another sound of pleasure came and another shockwave followed, the chain sliding ever so slowly downward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Checkmate.\" Mouse questioned her companion, who was at the moment, stuck with her. The two heroine's powers not responding to their control, do to the weird collars around their necks.Which currently left the duo hanging powerless above the warehouse's floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I guess poor Magic is really getting it, huh?\" Mouse joked. Checkmate seemed to ignore Mouse's call; in the normal way, not in the fact she was mute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Mouse felt a hand on her buttocks, which was responded with another \"<i>not girly</i>\" scream of surprise. \"Checkmate? What the hell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate seemed to fondle her butt cheek a little bit, before moving her hand up to the woman's hip. Mouse blushed do to this and was about to make another, more louder response, before a third moan and shockwave came across the warehouse. The rope slid down closer to the floor. Checkmate's foundling finished and she seemed to find what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what the hell was that, Checkmate?\" Mouse restated her question. Checkmate gently bumped the back of her head against Mouse, who did her best to turn around to the mute heroine. Through her peripheral view, she saw the girl's head doing it best to look up, but wasn't so complete as Mouse's head was against her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its hard to see what your trying to get across. Tap my hand once for yes, twice for no. I'm going to begin, does whatever you're doing involve the roof?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it involve whatever you took from my pocket?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it involve those screams of pleasure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne tap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse contemplated over those answers, when a fourth scream came, above one could hear the chain being stressed from the constant shockwaves. Checkmate dropped off her package, which fell to the floor. A quick burst of something echoed throughout the area they were in. Followed by the sound of rope untangling from the rebar. Mouse and Checkmate fell towards the floor, the rope still on them, and Mouse grunted in brief pain as she collided with something....fluffy? Yes, the duo were currently in a giant \"cake: shaped, pink mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! My impact-gel! Magic made this to make sure I didn't go splat when I fell at my smaller size!\" Mouse exclaimed as the gel slowly took the energy that had impacted it. Finally, the duo had reached the floor and shimmed out of their bindings. The rope dropped to their feet and Mouse stretched as she got the feeling of her body again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate looked at Mouse(at least that is what Mouse could comprehend through the mask)and tapped her foot. Mouse raised a puzzled eyebrow at her fro a few moments and then comprehended what her body language meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did remember that I had the gel. Yeah.\" Mouse rubbed the back of her head. She tugged on her collar and was reminded of the thing on it. \"Damn, we can't use our powers for this. We could've just shrunken down, unbind Magic Man, and get out of here to come back later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate shrugged and pondered about their predicament,another shockwave shook the entire warehouse as the duo briefly fell onto the behinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place must have hella' good soundproofing!\" Mouse announced The duo shakily got up, before Checkmate tapped Mouse on the shoulder. She pantomimed to the shrinking heroine the remote the Fanny Four had on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right, if it can be put on, it can hopefully be taken off!\" Mouse proclaimed. She looked towards the door where Magic Man was taken away and nodded to Checkmate. Both walked side by side to it and opened it, revealing a long corridor. Which was odd, wouldn't the Squisher object to that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lets go.\" Mouse said and took Checkmate's hand as they scurried down the corridor. They reached the end, only to see another door. They duo shrugged and opened it.They were shocked to see what was behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Inside was a <i>vast</i> looking headquarter. The duo gaped as they saw various clutter, which could only be attributed to each Fanny Four member, that reflected their preferences. Thongs and dresses for Thunder Thighs; Various rocket memorabilia for Astro-Cheeks; Megabutt DVDs and posters, no doubt for her \"fanbase\"; and \"toys\" that most likely belonged to Squisher. Not only that, but there was furniture of all shapes and sizes here. That for some reason some were crushed, maybe to test out the fours' monstrous buttocks?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse and Checkmate gaped like fishes, right before a unfiltered moan filled the air. The duo hid and slowly did their best to hide themselves among the clutter and furniture. The made their way to the source of the cries, which were coming from a miniature \"colosseum\" like structure in the middle of the place/area/room. The duo stuck their head halfway in the opening and saw two members of the Fanny Four seemingly exhausted. A naked Magic Man was dodging the embrace of the other two members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment,he was dealing with.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mouse and Checkmate watched in horrid fascination as Magic Man was being chased by a nimble bottomed Thunder Thighs. She still had her mask on, but her toned body was covered by a generally,risque nightie. Off to the side was a giant Astro-Cheeks, although not as big as Squisher. Which was due to the fact most of her mass was located in her rear.She wore a space-themed, one-piece bathing suit,which looked awfully strained near her hips and backside. Her bed sized cheeks jiggled like jello as Astro-Cheeks moved her immense body to follow Magic Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff to the side of the Colosseum were Megabutt and Squisher. The former totally naked and open to the world. Mouse caught a quick glimpse of Checkmate peering a little too intently at her form. The latter was dressed in a indecent T-shirt and yoga pants. Only Squisher had her mask still on though, Megabutt never caring for it in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more aggressive duo of the Fanny Four seemed to be in more,adjustable forms. With Megabutt only have some padding on her hips and Squisher being only a foot in height. Both villainesses seemed to be eating snacks as they watched the spectacle of Magic Man. He dodged her tackles with ease, but there was a sense of panicked fear in his aura. Though, only his close friends of Mouse and Checkmate could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you soon, darling~ Thunder Thighs sang as she chased the dodging Magic Man. He was currently in only his boxer shorts, his mask still concealed by his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing THICC THIGHS? Just give him the old \"Tushy Treatment\", so Astro-Cheeks can get her turn!\" Megabutt declared, now standing up from the seat in the Colosseum. Her naked form was even more revealed to the area,Mouse's jaw dropped and she could faintly see Checkmate almost faint in glee. She caught the poor girl before she could accidentally alert the villains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ja</i>, itz fine,Megaboot.\" Astro-Cheeks responded to the self proclaimed \"leader\" of the motley crew. Megabutt eyes rolled and she bent down to Squisher, or did her best, seeing as Squisher was still a large figure even when sitting. The bottom half of her betrayed whatever thoughts she was thinking. Mouse saw the size-changing villain get up and walk down a flight of stairs that was closest to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escapades of Magic Man and Thunder Thighs continued as he was chased like an, excuse me, <i>mouse </i>by a cat.Numerous times did Magic Man seemed to be pinned down by Thunder Thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The size-changer, who moments before left, had come back. Whatever Squisher found, she came back with it hiding it at an angle. She revealed whatever Megabutt asked for by exchanging it between hands; a weird contraption that looked to be a mixture of a handgun and a harpoon-rifle. Megabutt gleamed and pointed the weapon at Thunder Thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yahoo, Thicc Mistress.\" Megabutt teased, Thunder Thighs turned around and gasped in surprise as a suction-cup device attached to her chest. Magic Man and the hidden heroines watched as a stream of electrical power traveled down the length of tubing right into Thunder Thighs! The saw as pound upon pound piled onto the woman's behind. Her face was scrunched up, although, Mouse could see the outline of a smile. It could've been the trick of the light, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all saw her butt slowly consume the silk panties she wore,and when that was over, pushed against the bordello skirt she wore for the occasion. Thunder Thighs hands appeared to be confused;not knowing if they should touch the length of the weird gun-taser or the large globes on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a snap, her pants fall towards the floor. Magic Man clearly was doing his best not to hide a <i>special </i>friend from the others. Thunder Thigh's white cheeks came onto the scene, and yet, more power went into them. Now the electrical villain was getting unbalanced, not possessing the super strength shared by the others. With an almost comical edge, she waves her hands in the air and falls over. A very subtle shockwave escapes from the area where she lands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt's weapon putters out and the tubing delivering electricity seemed to dim down. Thunder Thighs was like a turned over turtle, doing her best to get back on her front. Megabutt giggled at the view and tapped the shoulder of Squisher, who was guffawing at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squisher, be a <i>darling</i>, and kindly put Magic Man under Thunder.\" Megabutt said in her best impression of Thunder Thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, boss.\" Squisher said, she grew to a larger height. Not to out-shadow Astro-Cheeks at the moment, but to lift up the struggling Thunder Thighs. Multiple times in this endeavor, Squisher could be heard uttering \"Damn, sparkplug\" or \"Stop that\", eventually she manages to life up Thunder Thighs. Magic Man in all of this was being watched like a hawk by Astro-Cheeks, who wasn't about to let him go away before she would have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Magic, GET UNDER THE THUNDER!\" Squisher announced like a wrestler referee. She snatched him up and laid him flat on his back, dropping Thunder Thighs ontop of him. She seemed to squirmed in pleasure, if her feet kicking  were any indication.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second time tonight---or was it day---Mouse's jaw hung open for someone to see.</span></div></div>",

If we don\u2019t save Mark soon, he could end up....\u201d she trailed of. Checkmate understood and signaled \u201cno Worry\u201d. Mouse smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey suddenly heard a scream. They both dashed to their viewing place. They looked down and saw Magic Man being absolutely manhandled. Every one of the villains was far taller and larger than he was at this point. He was tossed across the floor, landing hard and sliding a good 10 feet after his rough landing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate covered her eyes and Mouse held back tears. Now they were more determined than ever to save him. They needed to pull of a daring rescue. After all, it was 4 against 2. Mouse thought hard about their next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to remember how they had dealt with these baddies before. Last time they had to fight, Magic Man had gotten help from villains. That wasn\u2019t an option this time. Once he had enchantress put TT into a dream to defeat her, but then Enchantress wouldn\u2019t let them out. So a villains help was off the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate continued to stare in horror as Mark was lifted up and crushed beneath two villains at once. He looked terrible, and would give in at any moment. They had to act. Mouse finally struck inspiration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve got.\u201d She said to Checkmate. \u201cWe shrink down so we are undetected. Once we get close enough to them, particularly thr Squisher, you jump on and get their powers. Once you have all four, you grow. That way you can deal with big ones, and I can stay small and free Magic Man. We can handle the smaller two. Sound good to you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate thought for a moment. She looked down once more st the terrible scene unfolding below. She shook her head yes, but then quickly signaled \u201cother idea?\u201d Mouse frowned. She did, but it was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had another thought. This one is more risky. We could go over there.\u201d She pointed to a nearby door. It was solid steel and looked as if even Kaboom wouldn\u2019t be able to break it. It had a passcode as well as a camera and alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat door leads into a lab. All the inventions they\u2019ve created and all the prisoners they\u2019ve taken are in there. That\u2019s where they\u2019re keeping Apex Prisoner, and all the hero\u2019s we once had in this city. If, and it\u2019s a big if, we do make it in, and we can free the hero\u2019s on there, and take some weapons or powers, we would have an advantage in the fight.\u201d She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate thought for a second. This was a good plan, however, if she didn\u2019t copy one of the Four\u2019s powers, then the hero\u2019s would have no big gun to fight against their towering might. They had beaten these hero\u2019s before, and they could do it again. But, they would have numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse looked at her partner. She pleaded with her eyes. \u201cWell?\u201d Checkmate moves her hands and signaled. It was time to save the day. </span></div></div>",

Slowly the two shrank down, hand and hand, until they reached the limit of Mouse's size changing capabilities. Pocket-sized, the two crept down into the arena that the Fanny Four had somehow acquired. Dodging many obstacles, the two had finally made into the area, where the saw the corpulent giants crushing Magic Man at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring, Mouse and Checkmate craned their heads to see the gargantuan beings that were the Fanny Four. Realizing that they were out in the open, the two fled towards a pillar to hide themselves. Peaking out, they saw how Magic Man was only a speck compared to the four, though, Mouse did realize something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, does Thunder Thighs have size changing powers?\" Mouse spoke in Checkmate's ear, who turned to her side to give the hero a look. Only three members of the Fanny Four had any size changing talents, but only Thunder Thighs grew in the rear and not in anything else. That being stated, her trunk was far larger than any of the three, It mushed Magic Man the most,but the villainess seemed to be quite apprehensive about her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at their targets, Mouse and Checkmate silently agreed that touching one of the giants at the moment was tantamount to suicide. So, their best option was to at least lure one of the numbers away to copy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf their is a Lord, he seemed to be looking down at them this night(or day, who knows how long it been.) Thunder Thighs seemed to want to end her turn. Tapping the thigh of Astro-Cheeks, The two quickly conversed---Astro-Cheeks having to bend down towards Thunder Thighs, mind you--- while Squisher and Megabutt toyed with Magic Man unaware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her hands under the gorgeous cheeks of the electric magistrate, Astro-Cheeks stomped off with Thunder Thighs ass ontop of both of her palms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching them leave, Mouse turned her head to Checkmate. \"Follow them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate nodded and quickly set off after the two. Upon exiting the Colosseum, Checkmate made sure no one else was watching and grew back to her normal size. Astro-Cheeks to oblivious to look down and Thunder Thighs only occupied with looking forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the underground area could fit four giants in itself, it still wasn't that large. Astro-Cheeks only having to stride a few feet--giant feet that is---to he destination: a circular structure without a roof. Placing Thunder Thighs down into the place, Astro-Cheeks went back towards the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate quickly shrunk down before the villainess could see her, being thrown up into the miniature air by the passing villainess' weight.  Growing back to full size, Checkmate silently slunk into the room where Thunder Thighs was occupied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Checkmate was greeted by a wall of supple white flesh. If she could gasp in embarrassment, she would, but she couldn't. Hearing the villainess humming, Checkmate jumped a little in shock as she saw the ass wall slowly shrink. Following its lead, Checkmate activated her powers as well. Being now child-sized, Checkmate crawled on her knees to hide herself. Finally, she was face to ass with a normal, albeit still noticeably large, posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully the girls don't reveal that Magic Man is here;if half of the villains of this city knew he was with us, they would risked themselves trying to bust down our door!\" Thunder Thigh joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate watched, shrinking down even smaller, as the villain looked herself over in a mirror. Seeing a good as time as any, Checkmate grew to a larger sized and pricked Thunder Thighs in the bum. The villaines gasped, before her eyes grew lazy and she fell to the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Magic derived serum:one; crazy butt girl: zero\"</i> Checkmate sarcastically thought. Turning around,Checkmate searched through the woman's wardrobe, before finding what she was looking for:handcuffs. Checkmate blinked in surprise, only searching for the tools for the hell of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, were these here for pleasure or business?\"</i> Checkmate thought, she shrugged. Placing them around Thunder Thigh's limbs, Checkmate's next step was finding a good place to stash her. Tapping her foot, Checkmate jumped in surprise as a panel opened up beneath her. Dodging aside, Checkmate watched as the panel revealed a wardrobe of costumes. And was just the right size to stuff a 5'9 woman into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing just that, Checkmate copied the powers of Thunder Thighs, before stuffing the crook into the panel. But just before she was about to so, she stopped. Checkmate scratched her chin, lost in an idea. She peered intensely at the wardrobe, wondering if she could try out something. Above where the leotards were helmets, for when Thunder Thighs needed to go to more environmentally hazardous places. And where was a more hazardous place than the place where three giants were kicking up a bunch of dirt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, Checkmate decided to try what she was planning. Putting on the leotard and helmet, and of course putting her clothes back into the pocket dimension Magic Man made for his partners, Checkmate looked like a spitting image of Thunder Thighs.

Astro-Cheeks huffed out a bit as she became stuck in the archway and Squisher came over to help her fellow giantess out. Before she did though, she placed Magic Man out of Megabutt's reach. The royal villain grumped in anger and tapped her foot to relieve some of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse saw her chance,quickly did she scamper up to the seats. There Magic Man laid dazed on the seats, a bit of drool running down his face. Mouse scampered over to him and began to grow herself. About a foot in height, the rodent-themed heroine tried to make sense of his bindings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Magic Man, I got you.\" Mouse assured, though she did gape a little at the strange straps that bound him together. The strange cuffs were something that she never seen before, stamped with glyphs of some ancient language.

I can use Astro-Cheeks and Squisher to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're out!\" Squisher proclaimed as she pushed Astro-Cheeks out of the door.

A key tied around the waist of Megabutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate stumbled forth to get Megabutt to sit back down,but in her haste, she grabbed a squishy sphere of flesh.

Checkmate's eyes winded beneath her mask. She wondered where the four had acquired their tech from,maybe Megabutt could reveal a little about their anonymous source?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Mouse was grappling down from the stands and into the Colosseum's floor. She coughed as she landed in the surprisingly soft sand. At a inch in height, the heroine still felt too big and exposed in front of the two giantesses. She couldn't shrink any further though, if she did she wouldn't be able to drag the key's behind her effectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, Astro-cheeks and Squisher were still in the middle of the warm-up stretches. Astro-Cheek,who was more bottom heavy and smaller than Squisher, was having some difficulty reflecting her companion. Her twin spheres snuggled tightly against her skintight black suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man was still dazed out of his mind from the torment he suffered under the two. Mouse could still see he was somewhat conscious, but she didn't put much hope into him getting back up for awhile. Mouse crept slowly next to Magic Man's downed form, her body shaking from the movement of Astro-Cheeks and Squisher. Taking the keys into both of her hands, she aimed it into the keyhole of Magic Man's cuffs. Twisting the key, she waited until she heard a tell-tale pop of a lock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" She whispered out. All that was needed left was to get Magic Man out of the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing through all the options for a plan, she waved for Checkmate's assistance.It took awhile for Checkmate to see the minuscule woman, but once she did she played around with her hands. Making it look like absentminded movement on her part, she conversed with Mouse on what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to their own conclusion, the two went to enact their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're going down their to play with Magic Man?\" Megabutt questioned as she saw Checkmate---or to her Thunder Thighs--get up and move towards the two giantesses. The disguised woman put a thumbs up and moved right next to Squisher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hog him too much though! Wait, no I'm the uncontested leader now, I don't need to explain my desires!\" Fanny Four's 'leader' proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack onto Checkmate and Squisher, the giantess took note of her arriving teamate. Standing still, she peered down at Checkmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thunder Thighs, great of you to come! Megabutt, do you want to join in or-\" Squisher stopped as Checkmate placed her hands onto the ankle of the giant woman and absorbed her power. Squisher felt only a slight tingle over her body. Before she could speak out, Checkmate opened up her bag to transform back into her original costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wat?\" Astro-Cheeks cried out. Megabutt, still in the stands,shot up like a flag on a pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse took the initiative as well, growing into her full height and grabbing onto Magic Man. Checkmate, now in her original costume, took advantage of the confusion.Using Squisher's absorbed power, she swelled in height. Growing to be around sixty feet in height, she gently took a hold of Magic Man and Mouse and smashed her fist into Squisher's face. The other woman fell like a chopped down tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to knock down Astro-Cheeks into the floor. The giant  woman plopping down onto her monumental sized ass with a boom. Megabutt  temporarily flew through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrinking down into a smaller size, Checkmate dropped Mouse and Magic Man onto the floor. She mimicked with her fingers a 'compressing' motion to Mouse. Taking quick note of that, the rodent hero knew what her teammate needed of her. She shrunk and crawled into Magic Man's pocket. Checkmate then took the downed magician and shrunken cargo into her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing to around fifteen feet tall, the power copier ran with her rescued leader out through the archways of the underground Colosseum.</span></div></div>",

The trio quickly ducked behind a pile of crates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie quickly briefed the two hero\u2019s on what the situation was. \u201cAll right. I know how these girls work.

Trying to calm down the panicked civilians rushing out of the hole Squisher made. The girls felt that not alerting everybody to Magic Man's capture by the Fanny Four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently the two were on a rooftop, sitting on one of Magic Man's \"nest\". Which were hideouts that Magic Man used for respite; these \"nests\" ranged from little campfires to large tents. Magic Man used his powers to disguise them, as to not give them away. If anyone but Magic Man were to arrive there, they both couldn't see, nor touch anything. Mouse and Checkmate had to use special keys to dispel that effect. Unfortunately, Magic Man had to redo the spell and he was probably getting smothered by bums right now. So any snooping character would see the heroines pacing outside a ,weirdly, cheery tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate scratched her chin, or at least her helmet's chin, in meditation. She sighed out  \"Cheer\" and \"Team\". Mouse shook her head again in response. \"No, those two are difficult to work with. If we have to help Magic escape by ourselves, then it is what it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If its a another hero you need,sweet thing, I open to discussion.\" A voice called out, Mouse and Checkmate instantly went onto the defensive. Mouse shrank down and Checkmate pulled out a stun gun for the attacker. The heroines looked around for the owner of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey. I'm not a bad guy. In fact..\" A figure walked around the tent, Checkmate  held the stun gun in front of her. Mouse.meanwhile, made her way towards the figure. \"...I'm a new hero on the scene. The name's: APEX!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApex was an Adonis of a specimen; standing around 6'5 and carved like a Greek stature,or at least the armor he wore was. The main color scheme of it seemed to be various shades of red, barring the chest emblem. That was grey, with a sword and shield carved into it. Apex's head wasn't covered bya face concealing mask, but a visor which proudly showed his features. Which, like his body, was a thing worthy of songs. Chiseled jaw, piercing brown eyes,thin lips,and an imperial nose. Strangely, the man decided to have his mane of hair open to the air. All in all, he looked like a hero from a bygone area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate and Mouse were not impressed;probably because they hanged out with Magic Man, someone they respected and liked. Additionally, Checkmate didn't swing straight, so that piled onto the \"piss off\" angle. Apex didn't seemed to notice the contempt though and flexed in egotistical might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I overheard your troubles. And while I was thinking of breaking onto the scene in a different way, maybe take out Lucha Libre or her rivals, I decided this is <i>way</i> better.\" Apex announced. \"I get to save the 'big man' of the city, Magic Man! How cool is that? Pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse had already arrived at the blowhard's feet and was taking out a few explosives that Magic Man made for her.. Meanwhile, Checkmate was just watching Apex with pure confusion, with hints of annoyance. Still, Apex kept digging himself deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I mean he has all the action on the scene, but what about the other guys? We can't let he keep all the pretty girls to himself, can we?\" Apex said. \"Wait, I forgot to give my card out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up his forearm and Checkmate could see a slot on it, a card appeared in it. Apex handed the card to Checkmate, who tentatively took it from him. She looked it over, on it was Apex's mug, a phone number, and his name in bold lettering. Mouse had finished her job and was slowly started to back away a safe distance away from Apex's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back onto topic, we need to get Magic Boy away from the 'Badonk Baddies'. Thankfully, I managed to get a bead on their location.\" Apex said absentmindedly<br>\r\n.That caught the duo's attention;Checkmate rushed over to him, while Mouse grew back to her main size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?!?\" Mouse said as she grabbed onto Apex's shoulders fro behind. If he was surprised, the man didn't show it.\" Easy on the armor, I'm not scary. If you wanted to get close, you should've just asked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, where?\" Mouse insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, we can talk about me later. The four girl are here...\" Apex showed the two girls where the Fanny Four were based at the moment.</span></div></div>",

Checkmate make grinned at the joke and the two girls laughed at Magic Man's expense. He rolled his eyes and made his way towards the other two villainess. Checkmate stopped the still laughing Mouse and pointed back at the two villains in their mayhem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two, okay Chekmate, lets get going.\" Mouse proclaimed and began to shrink down. Checkmate quickly tapped the girl and began to shrink as well. Now only six inches tall,Mouse and Checkmate nodded at each other.They walked from their hiding place, making sure not to get squished by oncoming civilians. After a while, they had arrived at an over turned cabinet to see the two attacking villains. Mouse took off a backpack and took off the necessary components of her device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMouse began to get out a strange looking gun and began to load it. \"I'm glad I took Mar- Magic Man's advice. Hopefully this is easier than walking at my minuscule size.\" Mouse proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheckmate watched as Mouse finished putting the contraption together and the results were a grappling gun. Mouse aimed and fired her weapon at a pillar four hundred feet away, the tiny weapon managing to hit such a far target even at its microscopic size. Mouse offered her shoulder to Checkmate, who wrapped her arms around Mouse. The two heroines were together, Mouse pressed the a button to reel them in and they sped off towards their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you want to go about this?\" Mouse screamed to Checkmate as they flew through the air. They saw Squisher placed her butt on various objects or crush them between her thighs. Megabutt had entrapped various civilians, who were enamored with her mighty bottom. She laughed as they hugged her lower half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the duo had arrived at the pillar, they had to clutch to the side of it.The gauntlets of Mouse's costume had claws to clutch to the side of the pillar, while Checkmate's had suction cups on her's. Mouse held onto the pillar with one arm and had held onto her grappling gun with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got anything you want to do, Checkmate?\" Mouse said. The power copying heroine took a hand off the pillar and pointed at Squisher, who seemed to be coming closer to their position. Mouse seemed to get the idea and pointed the grappling gun at Squisher. She fired and the hook embedded itself into the bum of the villain, the sheer size of her made it barley noticeable. Checkmate motioned to have the gun and it was handed to her by Mouse. Checkmate quickly reeled herself in and collided with Squisher's posterior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" It was all that Squisher could say before a fist collided with her head. A now super-sized Checkmate stood in the open hole in the museum's front, courtesy of Squisher. Megabutt turned around to the sound of her distressed partner, not knowing that Mouse had already swung over the villainess and grew back to her normal size behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe taped Megabutt's shoulder and the villainess looked back to the arriving fist of Mouse.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Its just around the corner, Astro-Cheeks\" Thunder Thigh's voice called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man had been silently watching the two villainess as they made their way around the museum. Somewhere between the time he lost sight of them,and now, the two had their costumes on.Where they changed at and where they were keeping their clothing was an question that he pondered on for a few moments. A more important thought was their quarry and how could he stop them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We grab the artifact and get out of here, Squisher and Megabutt know where to go afterwards. And hopefully I can get some tea after all this is done.\" Thunder Thighs continued. Magic Man followed the duo to an area of the museum, the place was titled \"Objects Unknown\" and it appeared to have everything that couldn't be cataloged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two arrived at the front of a weirdly shaped object, Thunder Thighs stopped Astro-Cheeks before she could grab it. The electric villain saw something only visible to her own eyes. This made Thunder Thighs the only one able to disable whatever was around it. She put her hand in front of her, with her powers she seemed to drain something from the air. Magic Man could see the lights in the museum flicker for a moment. He also could see her butt blimp up. She grabbed the artifact, not before she shot off a lighting bolt in Magic Man's position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man cursed and turned visible, he conjured a shield to block off any more attacks.\" How did you know I was here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a hunch that you were going to come, and as to my shooting, I took a lucky guess.\" Thunder Thighs called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you take a 'lucky guess'? I only saw you take the artifact and you don't have an hunch. You have a large butt, but not at this moment, <i>ja</i>\" Astro-Cheeks said, scratching her head. Thunder Thighs sighed and kept one hand trained on Magic Man, while she spoke to Astro-Cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its a figure of speech Astro, we went over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this 'figure', is he- oh, wait. Sorry,<i>mein fuhrer</i>, must've forgotten about it.\" Astro-Cheeks replied. She bumped her bum against the the now empty pedestal and grew a foot in height. Her butt was still proportional to her body, although, it almost seemed to yearn for attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that we're at a standoff, Thunder Thighs.\" Magic Man called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is where you're wrong, Magic Man. Now, Astro-Cheeks!\" Thunder Thighs screamed. Astro-Cheeks appeared to be confused as Magic Man was, right before she snapped her fingers in understatement. She slapped her right buttcheek, and from the left, Magic Man could see her holding a bomb. Astro-Cheeks threw it and Magic Man instinctively put a magic field around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went off, but it wasn't a explosive that damaged things. It was a flashbang and Magic Man was blinded in pain. When he regained his vision, he saw the two villainess run out of the area he was in. Thunder Thighs to the right; Astro-Cheeks to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would he follow? </span></div></div>",

Astro-Cheeks bum-rushed the tiny man and smacked him with her enormous ass. Magic Man struck a wall with force and shook a little to clear his head. He got up and saw Astro-Cheeks go around the area to grow even more, she sat on various shrapnel. They were sucked into her ever growing posterior, it rippled like water as she consumed more random grim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood over twenty feet tall now, her underwear highlighted her body's curves. She bent under the roof of the exhibit to contain her sheer mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ja</i>, I got you now, Magic Man~ Astro-Cheeks sang a little. Magic Man  charged up a energy beam to knock the villainess down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beam was fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man grunted in pain and fell to the ground. Behind him, a butt shrinking Thunder Thighs lowered a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had him.\" The giant Astro-Cheeks cried out in shock. Thunder Thighs blew away the smoke on her hand as she strutted up to Magic Man. \"Maybe you could've, but we're on a tight schedule, darling. However, I think we can make a little time for this. May you sit down on our friend,dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsto-Cheeks looked at her and complied, trapping Magic Man under her mighty mounds. Thunder Thighs strutted over to the downed Magic Man and squatted down near the hero. She raised her hand to his face and slowly moved her to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna see whose the man behind the wizard. I mean think about it, Astro. If we know our object of desire, we could pay him a visit at any time.  Hell, maybe we could sell off what we know to the other villainess,for a price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to lower her hand to lift his mask off, a flash of light blinded her sight. The blinded Thunder Thighs howled in pain, around her she could hear Astro-Cheeks crash about yelling something in German. Elsewhere, Magic Man was dumped  outside the museum in a slump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"M&amp;M, hey, get up dude.\" Magic Man jolted up as he heard the voice of Mouse call to him. Groggily did he move himself up, he saw heard the sound of footsteps backpedaling. He stood up, he was steadied by bot Mouse and Checkmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wuh,happen?\" Magic Man said to the best of his ability, still disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our targets got away. We'll tell you more about it back at HQ, chief.\" Mouse said. Magic Man nodded drunkenly, he whispered a spell under his breath to transport the group away.</span></div></div>",

You literally only have scratches right now!\" Mouse, or Amelia at this moment responded. Nicole, or Checkmate, meanwhile was watching the news feed on the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio had returned back to the Magic Cave (or the Mouse Hole or the ChessBoard; it depended on the time of day) and were nursing their wounds sustained in battle. Checkmate seemed to be the worst in shape, but she allowed Mouse to check on Magic Man first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. What exactly happened to you girls?\" Mark said. Amelia finished applying medical alcohol to a nasty scratch of his and covered it with a bandage. Fin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thunder Thighs. It seemed that she circled back around and decided to help out her friends. She didn't even stay to fight us! She just zipped in blasted Nicole, shot at me, and then ran off. Which I can see, resulted in your beatup.\" Amelia replied. \"And then Megabutt smacked me with her enlarged posterior. Luckily I shrunk down to make myself less heavy and smacked into Nicole.At this time she was getting clobbered by Squisher. Thankfully I landed on her skin and she managed to copy my powers so we could get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about Squisher and Megabutt?\" Mark spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got away with Astro-Cheeks and Thunder Thighs.\" Amelia replied. Mark waved off Amelia, who then got up and lead Nicole away from the computer. Mark sat down on a random chair and watched as Amelia went to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got anything Nicole? About the museum, the four villainess, or anything noteworthy about the artifacts?\" Mark asked. Nicole began to move her hands in response. Which made Amelia's work somewhat harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"No. News say that the museum is still taking stock of what they lost. While somehow nobody saw the giant running about.\"</i> Nicole could somehow add sarcasm to sign language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darnit. Okay everybody let's name off what we got: four butt villains have decided to work together and begin their relationship by stealing something. Now normally my villains can barely stand to work with each other, barring duos, but it seems we have here a \"Legion of Doom\" on our hands.\" Mark stated. \"Now we all know what these ladies can d-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shot up a hand and began to 'speak' her thoughts. <i>\"Not me, came here only a month ago. Hero for about two weeks of said month.So can you give a quick rundown for the newb? I can see they're a bunch of booty bandits and I already know what the giant can do, but even then..\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark raised an eyebrow. Nodding his head, he conjured up miniature versions of each of the villainess. Nicole's eyes widened at the spectacle and bent her head closer for a better view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you wanna see first?\" Mark said. Nicole rubbed her chin in thought,before pointing at Squisher. Mark nodded and began to enlarge the miniature. \"Just to make sure you know these are to scale and without any powers activated.\" Mark added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquisher appeared to be a African-American woman about five-foot nine in height. Her hair was cut short, but not to a boyish extent. She had a confident grin on her face,as if the woman thought she could take on the world. Currently, she was dressed in a purple leotard with a crumbling tower on it. Her boots and gloves were also purple, but a different shade than her body. On her head was a cowl that left only her hair and mouth open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squisher, or 'The Squisher', but who wants to say 'The' every time we mention her? She's a size-changer who can reach one-hundred and ten feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about thirty-three meters.\" Amelia whispered in Nicole's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Back onto the topic. This makes her the tallest size-changer in the entire city. Not only that her strength and durability increase tenfold every time she grows five feet. She also gains regeneration, minor, but noticeable. Besides that, she always grow taller than anyone in nine square feet of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or three meters.\" Amelia whispered again. Mark ignored that. \"She only grows taller than anyone in those nine square feet of her; anyone shorter than her is ignored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squisher is also an expert wrestler, so good that she can take on Lucha Libre in a match without any help.That being stated, she would soon loose in a battle of might against Lucha as the fight dragged on. Unlike the others who will come up, Squisher can't grow her rear. She just likes to get to a size that allows her to crush people beneath her cheeks. Physically, she is the mightiest of the four, but her power  isn't that versatile in a fight.Usually one needs to trap her legs with something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing, Mark waited until Nicole pointed at the next villainess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt appeared to be a woman around five-foot five in height. Her hair was a distinctive shade of brown that almost bordered on blonde. She also wore a grin, but  her's was like a noble staring at all of her servants and castle. Dressed only in a red G-string bikini, scarlet boots, and a domino mask just as red as the rest of her, something about Megabutt gave the woman grace that shouldn't be possible in her getup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Megabutt. She's the second strongest of the group, which probably makes her angry to no end,only being able to lift about fifty-five tons. She can fly,but she isn't the fastest one in the city. She's also a size-changer, but with a cap of ten feet, like Squisher though, she can get stronger in her taller form. At this size, she can pickup about one-hundred tons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was about to say the metric form of Mark's words, Nicole waved her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're lets get onto her namesake feature.\" Mark stated. \"Yes. She can the biggest out of the four, with only Squisher beating her, but even then that's on a technicality. Her great big butt of her's is indestructible,can launch people farther than what should be possible for the rear, and like we've seen today, is able to hypnotize people temporarily. It isn't the strongest,as one only has to be on guard to ignore the effect. While formidable, Megabutt isn't that durable relatively, as one could see when Amelia punched her face in,though don't let her get her hands on you. Additionally, she is an intense megalomaniac who loves to glorify herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding,Nicole picked her next target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstro-Cheeks was about five-foot six in height. Her hair was a bright blonde and flowed near her shoulders. The expression on her face made her seem a little ditzy, what with her placid smile. She wore a completely black suit patterned with stars, the solar system was located right on her sizeable bust. A cowl left only the area around her chin and hair open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Astro-Cheeks is another size-changer,she's able to grow a total of thirty feet in height. She's strong in her base form, able to lift up a ton. Her main power though is to absorb things inside of her. Trapping anything to use in her own mass.This ability also grants her a form of indestructibility, as she can easily absorb bullets,rockets, debris, and most matter.This lady can also expel any absorbed matter and shoot that stuff out like some sort of missile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And like the other size-changers,she gets stronger the bigger she gets. But she's thankfully weaker than Megabutt or Squisher. Her additional weakness is her growth factor; Astro-Cheeks isn't able to absorb things larger than herself. If she wanted to absorb a car, she would have first get herself up to a size larger than said car by absorbing other,smaller things. She also doesn't like electricity as that causes her to go wild and shoot out her absorbed debris,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>And what's her butt gimmick</i>?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever hear the phrase ', It'll go straight to your thighs?.' Well Astro-Cheeks is that phrase personified. Her rear grows first, followed by her height. At twenty-five feet tall, her butt can touch both sides of a street. I think she can get bigger, but her butt would impend her movement way too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pointed out the last member of the four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Thighs appeared to be a woman around five foot seven. Her hair was a mixture of blue and white, but she could've been wearing a great wig. Unlike the others, her entire head was covered in a mask of some sort. And out of the all the four, she appeared to be dressed the weirdest. Her upper body was professional in presentation; with buttons, covered seams,and armored portions to it. The bottom of her was near scandalous in opposition to the top. Her short-shorts appeared to be practically in her crack. The colors used in the strange assemble were blues,whites, and light-greys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thunder Thighs is thankfully not a size-changer, like the others. She can absorb electricity,add some extra power to said electricity, and shoot it back out. Her butt is how one tells how much power she has. At her biggest, I've seen her shoot arcs that could instantly slag steel like it was nothing. That isn't the only thing she can do. She can clap her thighs together and make a shockwave,temporarily turn herself into electricity, cause EMP attacks,and fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole rubbed her arm in thought,feeling lucky she had Squisher's power when she was shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully she is physically the weakest of the bunch. Which also relates to her other problem. See with her expanding lower half comes weight, and unlike the others, she can't lift it up. And her power if she doesn't concentrate, she absorbs electricity mindlessly. Granted,she can shrink herself back down by shooting an arc out,but the distraction is noteworthy. One can also insult her butt size,it'll get her angry. I honestly don't know how her power came to be,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the girls, who seemed to be mentally jotting notes down, Mark finished his lecture off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These women are some of the most dangerous villainess in the city. They seemingly have teamed up together.We all need to keep our eyes open and make sure we're ready for their next appearance.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Elsewhere.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour ladies walked neatly together. Costumes stuffed into backpacks, the Fanny Four looked like a group of ladies out for a jog. Sunglasses,track shorts,and slim-fit tops. Megabutt led from the front,with Squisher trailing behind her. Thunder Thighs talked with Astro-Cheeks,the German woman's butt a little on the large side. She currently hid the artifact the group had acquired inside of her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a few more blocks girls.\"Thunder Thighs spoke from behind the leading duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure its this location?\" Megabutt questioned. Even though Thunder Thighs knew where the meeting place was, Megabutt wouldn't dare not lead the group forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the four arrived at an indistinguishable warehouse, its architecture resembling the others on the street. Megabutt opened the door and walked in,the others followed. A robot,with a screen for a face, stood vigilant,or laid dormant more accurately. It was larger more at its bottom than it was on the top,it would've been tear-dropped if its underside was curved.Tank treads instead of feet, its humanoid top seemed out of place compared to the rest of it.Two compartments,one near is 'stomach area' and one near its 'bosom' were easily discernible on its form. A red button was held by its metal hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do love these little doo-dads.\" Thunder Thighs cooed as she walked closer to the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wished she'd actually showed her face.\" Squisher spoke. \"It'd be nice to see what our buyer actually looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you blame her anonymity? I bet she can't bask in my glorious self.\" Megabutt stated. \"Though I do wish we can at least see something of her,well other than her silhouette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I kinda like meeting this little fellow as well.\" Astro-Cheeks cooed as she paced forward. She petted the robot with Thunder Thighs. Megabutt and Squisher didn't get their obsession,more in-tuned with the physical instead of the mechanical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's put our masks on and get this over with.\" Thunder Thighs spoke. All four ladies unzipped their backpacks and put on their masks. Some weird quirk of the Succubus magic allowed their identities to be hidden by even the smallest of facial coverings,barring some exceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinished, Megabutt pushed the button the robot carried and a flicker of life buzzed through it. A video of a silhouette showed on screen, by both bodily communication and shape, one could tell it was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening,four.\" The distorted, yet still feminine voice, called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salutations, boss.\" Thunder Thighs responded. Megabutt not wanting to defer to anyone else;everyone was either a equal,a peasant,a toy,or Magic Man.She did grudgingly accepted the orders of the group's mysterious backer though,least because she gave the four a base of operations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has my package been acquired?\" The voice intoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here,Astro?\" Thunder Thighs called. Astro-Cheeks walked beside her and grabbed a hold of her belly. It wobbled for a minute until the distinct form of the artifact they stolen appeared like a submarine out of water. Megabutt casually grabbed a hold of it and shoved it into the screen's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" She proclaimed. \"Your <i>prize.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot gingerly grabbed it with one hand.The button arm fell limply down to its side as it seized the artifact. It shoved it into its chest compartment. The four watched as the robot held stiff for a moment,until it 'stomach' opened and a small sack could be seen. Squisher was about to curse in anger until Thunder Thigh's opened the sack to see shining jewels inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your payment.You'll find at the bottom of the bag contact information for various fences around the city.\" The voice spoke. \"Anything else you ladies would like to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that will be all.\" Thunder Thighs interrupted before any of the others could speak. She quickly pressed the button and shut off the feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four argued for a bit about Thunder Thigh's action,but didn't feel the need to continue on. The ripped their masks off their faces and tided themselves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's over, lets find a cab to get ourselves outta here.\" Squisher said.</span></div></div>",

Underneath was a massive cavern with an easily seen colosseum,though minuscule compared to its more famous sibling. Scattered around was about six tiny buildings;four small homes for the group as well as a communal storage shed and a recreational center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did she carve out such a huge area underneath this place? I mean, the roof is forty feet above us and we have about two and a-half football stadiums in length.And I know we're sucking up a lot of power and water. Shouldn't the cops and various eggheads figure out where we are?\" Squisher noted as the four walked down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bos-\" Thunder Thighs began to speak before Megabutt butted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The <i>buyer.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um. The buyer has deep enough pockets to pay us in jewels, so maybe she's had this place all planned out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four ruminated on their thoughts as they reached the bottom. The four walked off to their rooms. After an hour or so, they met back at the larger---yet still somewhat compact in this cavern---building. Thunder Thighs wore a nice T-shirt and skirt, Megabutt wore a flowering red dress more covering than her usual get up, Squisher wore a tank-top and daisy dukes, and Astro-Cheeks a nice sundress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all crowded around a table, Squisher stood over the three as they sat on chairs.They spoke for a few minutes,soon after they came a conclusion. Between themselves they split the jewels somewhat evenly, though Thunder Thighs awarded both her and Astro-Cheeks two extra, much to Squisher's and Megabutt's annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll managing to find common ground, the four conversed with one another until they broke apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt said she was going \"partying\" out in the city. Thunder Thighs went away to plan the group's next plan. Squisher went towards the colosseum,while Astro-Cheeks looked towards the TV for entertainment.</span></div></div>",

About a minute of this later, Snap gave her sisters a thumbs up.Pop and Crackle nodded and quickly hid behind a smoke stack.Snap pulled her hand back;her stance was more in line with someone pulling a slingshot's string than a throw. With a loud woosh, the pipe flew across the gap and stabbed the building opposite to the trio. The pipe stake began to turn red then blue and then finally exploded into a shower of sparks. No smoke came from the explosion though,just the ruin.

She was somewhat of a ringleader for the group and he knew that if he got her, the other two would be much easier to deal with. Snap ran through the corridors of the building with a smile on her face. She figured that the hero would turn up, and hoped that he would pursue her and let her sisters get away. He'd catch up with her in no time, but that was all a part of her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap bursts into the next room and smiles as she sees the enormous ass of Megabutt, expanded and bent over waiting, just as planned. The impatient villaness complained. \"It's about time, my back is starting to get stiff you little elf, if I don't s-\" her whining was cut off by the shorter villain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh! If he hears you, this will never work. He can't know you're here!\" Snap whispers. \"And pull your pants down unless you want him fused to your tights!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt is not one to take being silenced well, but she has more important things on her mind than her ego at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----- Earlier that day -------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap meekly approached Megabutt, she knew that if this didn't work, the tall villainess could make her a pancake with ease if not worse. But she had a prize to dangle that she knew Megabutt would want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been saving that spot for Magic Man MB?\" the shorter woman asked, leading with her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller woman scoffed. \"For far too long, but he'll be mine sooner or later,\" she said caressing her ample ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know a way we can ensure that it's sooner. Are you busy this evening?\" Snap asked, knowing she had the taller more powerful woman's full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt listened to Snap's plan as her smile grew broader every second the shorter woman spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be there shorty. You just better make sure this works. Otherwise my schedule won't be the only thing I'm rearranging if you get my drift,\" the taller woman threatens. Snap swallowed hard and walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---- Present time --------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man knew he was right behind Snap and slowed his chase to avoid any potential missteps. Despite her size, Snap was a strategist. Still, he had her alone. Without her sisters, he should be able to take her down with a....snap! He smiled to himself at his little pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hero phased through the door the villain went through and paused a moment to allow for his eyes to adjust to the incredible darkness. He felt a hand on his back, but before he could deal with it, his eyesight adjusted and saw something he had never counted on. Megabutt! His eyes shot wide open as he felt his body pushed at incredible speeds toward the largest ass in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark collided with Megabutt's bare backside with a fleshy slap. Snap wasted no time, keeping her left hand pressed to the back of the hero's head and putting her right hand on the villain's thick ass. With a quick, loud, SNAP, the two were fused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmph....Nnnnnnnooooo!\" Magic Man screamed into Megabutt's backside, but his protests were only met with laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that seems to have worked quite nicely Snap. And he can't get away?\" the villain asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not without my help,\" the shorter woman crowed as she turned to leave the room. \"You two have fun!\" she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegabutt caressed her full ass and pushed Mark's face further into it with a huge smile.</span></div></div>",

A soccer team would have a goalkeeper, midfielder, and so on. A baseball player would have a pitcher, shortstop and so on. She can do this for any sport in existence. These teams can be dangerous to the toughest of opponents, Lucha Libre has been known to tangle with her wrestling team at her height of power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weakness is that she can only make one \"team\" at a time. So no basketball players with rugby players at one time. They must be defeated or dispelled by the referee, who is the original Team Player.

So no going over 25 for baseball players, no going over 11 for football players,and so on and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Almost every sport is referenced on her body. A football jersey, with a hockey helmet on her head. A baseball bat that also looks like a hockey stick. Air Jordan's on her feet with retractable ice skates.

She was the smallest on the team, and yet she was easily 5\u20198. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen! Welcome to this, the 53rd annual Girls Division 1 Football championship!\u201d The announcer said through the PA. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark took his seat. Anxiously awaiting an attack.

Let us add some more to that category<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEbony Soldier:A wounded veteran, Amory was gifted a weapon by the Succubus. What type of weapon; every weapon! From swords to even missile launchers! She can also receive any ammo for the weapon she has on hand. Her weapon will always instinctively come back to her, anywhere in existence. Combined with that; Ebony Solider may not have super strength, but she is impossible to kill. Indestructible in the truest sense of the word and willing to beat up Lucha when she messes with her turf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weakness is her weapon. It maybe able to change into any other weapon, but it can't turn into multiple things. So no chaingun-rocket launchers for her use. Her other weakness is her own Indestructibility, she doesn't have super strength to fight back against Lucha head on at her more powerful levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: She usually dresses in cheap army fatigue as she most of her clothing will be gone in most of her fights. She is a about 5'11 and a strong jawed African-American. Her eyes are usually covered by sunglassess. Her Ebony title comes from the color of her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvory Knight: A girl that legitimately wanted to be a hero, the Succubus came to grant that wish. Now she goes around the city, \"helping\" people. Whether it be breaking into bank vaults to give to the poor, beating up \"evil order keepers\" or police, or finding the \"Villianous Magician's lair\", Ivory Knight has her work cut out for her! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers: Equipped with white armor that can never break or be molded, Ivory Knight can take on Magic Man's spells. The armor can take on the pressures of the deep or outerspsce. She carries with her a sword that can \" detect\" innocence I.E anyone not attacking her. It can bypass anything she wants gone; steel, magic barriers,hardened flesh, all will come undone to the sword. It can be thrown away from her, but it will always come back to her in three days time. Her other weapons include a bow that can shoot out arrows of light and a shield that will always come back when thrown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides that, she can can pick throw tanks across city blocks. And is probably one of the handful of people who can deal with Lucha on her rampages.  She can also summon a flying horse named \"Butterscotch\" that she greatly cares  for. No one knows if its a summoned beast or an actual living thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weakness is her own fantasy that she believes in. The Enchantress particularly likes to mess with her, pretending to be a damsel to have Ivory Knight mess with another villain.On that note, she can be tricked by more craftier villainess for their own gain.Her final weakness is her weaponry which can be thrown away from her. They will comeback, but it does take awhile, unlike Ebony's instant recapturing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApperance: A white colored, heavily armored Knight. She gesticulates and exaggerates every movement she does,hamming it up for the people.</span></div></div>",

A loud bang ranged out from the distance and Mark knew it was trouble.It seemed like he had a job to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly teleported to a safe location on top one of the skyscrapers located around the city and whispered out spell. Gone was Mark the college student,replaced by the protector of the city: Magic Man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's play 'I Spy' and see where the problem is at.\" Magic Man spoke. His observation wasn't needed as he quickly saw the smoke rise off in the distance. Cracking his neck a little, Magic Man flew off towards the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nMagic Man flew towards the smoke and upon getting there saw the problem. There was fire everywhere and about five or six wrecked storefronts. Twenty cars were destroyed and their occupants were scrambling to get away from the fight scene. Craters were left in the ground, some still smoking. Undetonated artillery rounds were...wait, artillery rounds! Did an army come through this street or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hell.\" Magic Man spoke. \"Is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped as he heard gunfire and thundering cracks come a little farther down the street. Large puffs of smoke blocked his view, so Magic Man decided to fly a little closer towards the mess. Upon doing so, he could finally see the cause of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you got today?\" A distinct Latina voice yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its enough to make sure your behemoth ass is down.\" A deep, but feminine, voice responded. Another burst of gunfire echoed through the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proprietors of this situation were none other than Lucha Libre and Ebony Solider. Lucha Libre was about six feet tall at this point,but seemed to be avoiding the Ebony Solider's gunfire.Which was odd because at this size she could easily tank low-caliber bullets. Magic Man raised an eyebrow at this until he felt a stray bullet smash against his shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crud, these are fifty BMG rounds!\" Magic Man internally screamed and quickly reinforced his shield. He watched as Lucha Libre dashed into a store, causing Ebony to start firing into the establishment. The former solider watched for any signs of the wrestler, but was blindsided as Lucha Libre smashed into her. Magic Man was confused for a moment, before he noticed the wrecked storefront right next to the place that Lucha Libre initially smashed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She must've made her way into there by breaking through the wall.\"</i> Magic Man thought. He watched as Lucha Libre delivered blow after blow into Ebony Solider's face, who seemed more annoyed than in pain. But this lack of concentration didn't allow for the woman to form a new weapon, seeing as her gun at the moment was a turret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to keep these two from launching the other into the next street.\" Magic Man mumbled. He then saw Lucha Libre grow an inch and quickly added on. \"And I also need to make sure I can take down Lucha before she grows too strong.\"</span></div></div>",

Great, I'll come if I had a ticket.\" </i>Mark sarcastically noted. He craved some coffee right now or some hot coca. Heck, it was getting a lot more chill than before, was the city suffering a cold spout or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the beard of thy Lord! I greet you peasant!\" A voice yelled out. Mark grimaced a little and turned to look at his greeter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiding atop of a winged horse was a figure from a fairy tail. Covered head to shoulder in white plate metal was a knight. The figure's held a sword pointing towards the sky while the other arm was protected by a shield. The figure in white radiated truth and justice.

Mark grimaced at how much pressure she was delivering onto his body. Thankfully the woman managed to not crush him to oblivion. Dropping him, the Ivory Knight began to question her squire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where hast thou been? I've been praying to the Divine Intelligence for you safety? Why hast thou not contacted me?\" The Ivory Knight exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook Mark so hard that the boy went into a dazed confusion. She soon stopped this action of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter. I'm glad that thous is alright.\" </span></div></div>",

Why another former friend of Mark, though she didn't know Magic Man was once her friend as well. She was once known as Emma Chambers, now known as Titaness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently she was over fifteen feet tall at the moment and slowly becoming larger. She grabbed a hold of another citizen, a young man who looked to be over six feet in height. The villainess wrapped her hands around the man, who screamed in shock. Slowly the man began to shrink in her grips. Thankfully do to some in-built protection inside of her power, she soon let the man go before he shrunk out of existence. Unfortunately, he was now a three foot version of himself. His friend Damien would've called him a chibi if he was with Magic Man right now. The man looked kinda adorable, like someone was making a plush doll of a person. His cute round head and slightly smaller body was just 'daww' inspiring to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right get outta here little guy.\" Titaness spoke as she dropped him from her now eighteen foot height.

She was quite a curvy villainess, comparable to both Enchantress and Shrinker. All from good genes and not Succubus crafted powers. Seeing such a good body made Magic Man tingle in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but what's the ultimate goal this time?\" Magic Man reiterated.

He sighed, but steadied himself, thankfully he was decked out for an \"high\" threat encounter at the moment. Lucha Libre was on the prowl and he wanted to be as strong as he needed for their fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, Magic Woman.\" Magic Man said, making sure he didn't use her real name.\" I got other things to do-.\" He didn't get a chance to finish his sentence before he was launched from the roof by a tackle of Magic Woman. It seemed today she wanted to be a lot more physical in her actions, usually she would've blasted him off. The duo fell off the building, the ground coming closer and closer towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lift!\" Magic Man screamed the word and his descent slowed as he was gently lifted by unseen forces;Magic Woman laughed as she was lifted up with him. She clutched him closely as they headed towards the roof of a smaller building. Magic Man blasted Magic Woman off himself, the villainess flew for a few moments before she did a back-flip mid-air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man breathed in and out from the experience, granted, Magic Woman had done <i>way</i> worse than that. Still, falling off a building while a crazed Ex was hugging you was not an event that couldn't be ignored. Magic Woman, across from him, laughed and turned around. She wiggled her bottom at him and dashed off the side of the building. Magic Man used another spell to grant him better eyesight, he saw the villainess jump across to the fire escape and run down an alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Magic Woman, you asked for it.\" Magic Man said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe uttered a few quick phrases and shot off after the escaping mage. Lucha Libre still hadn't appeared yet, hopefully he could deal with Magic Woman by then. She seemed to be in one of her playful modes, or at least, not \"capture and make out with you\" modes. So he lowered his guard a little, not by much, but enough not to accidentally trigger her toward greater passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the alleyway floor and looked around, he saw nothing. He scratched his head in confusion and muttered out a quick \"Track.\" A faint blue line appeared in his eyesight and Magic Man followed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could she be going? I have to deal with this, when I have to deal with Lucha at the moment.\" Magic Man whined,maybe he could call in Mouse to deal with her? Hell, maybe Checkmate can come in. However, it would take the both of them to drive downtown and it was getting late. No, he had to deal with both Lucha and Magic Woman by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe followed the blue line for a few minutes, muttering phrases to himself. Right before a force collided with his back, before he could say anything, two hands shot forth to grab his pants. The garment was pulled down, leaving Magic Man pantless for a few moments. He saw his assailant, it appeared to be The Bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man fumbled to pull his pants up. \"Bully? Why aren't you in the Teeth, east of here?\" The Teeth, being the county near the coast of the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bully was currently wearing a red, leather jacket with diamond studs on it, her pants had holes and rips in it. He hair was slicked and greased backwards, making her look like a 50's delinquent. She had sunglasses on her head, who even wore sunglasses at night?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say? I was in the area and I wanted to pic' on ya punnnny selfa\" The Bully decreed, her over enunciated words grounded on Magic Man's ears. He cursed internally as he finally pulled his pants up. The Bully may not be as dangerous as Lucha or Magic Woman, but she made up for it by being a complete obnoxious boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a lolipop from her pocket and pulled down her shades. \" Are ya doing anyting right now?\" She somehow made the act of licking a lolipop annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I am.\" Magic Man announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bad!\" The Bully exclaimed and tackled Magic Man to the ground. Magic Man grunted then completely stone faced as her was pinned down by The Bully. He wasn't that afraid of her at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have super strength, but it was nothing compared to any of the higher class villainesses. Probably her most dangerous weapon were her mind powers that could change ones' mentality.Hell, her mind powers were barley comparable to a true threat even then. And yesterday, he had to deal with the Enchantress, his mind-blocking spell was still in affect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Launch\" Magic Man whispered, and he grinned in satisfaction as he saw the woman fly into a park. He got up and stretched for a little bit, sore from the tackling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, Magic Woman. Then the Bully coming after me. Okay, is there another villain group I don't know about? What a goddamn night.\" Magic Man said aloud as he dashed into park. He then focused on the Magic Woman thought, she just disappeared.Where could Magic Woman be now exactly, hopefully she calmed down and went back to wherever she lives now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at the park, he saw a knocked down tree, but no Bully. Another villainess disappearing, what was happening?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD UP, MAGIC DORK!\" Magic Man paled as he heard the voice, he looked over to the general area and saw a very distinct figure. It was KABOOM! and she seemed to be smiling devilishly at him. She started to inhale and he saw her form start to inflate, her body slowly becoming more round. He was not ready to deal with her at the moment, instead he conjured a shield that was meant for Lucha Libre's attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Magic Man cried out. He waited for the distinct explosion that Kaboom! brought to the table. He counted in his head for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3...2....1....\" Magic Man muttered and he was greeted by a loud \"KABOOM.\" Which was yelled out, instead of actually occurring. It was followed by a laugh he knew from his childhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaigic Man face scrunched up in confusion and he dispelled the shield. On the ground where Kaboom! was, a girl clothed in a dark blue jumpsuit rolled on the floor in laughter. The suit was stylized, almost being more of a theater costume than a super outfit. With various expensive looking cuts and sewing on it. The figure's head appeared to be covered in a helmet that resembled a \"comedy\" mask, but at the same time, a \"sorrow\" mask as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've seen the look on ....HAH....your face\"  The figure said, as it began to slowly push itself upwards. Magic Man knew the identity of it, and began to rub the bridge of his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here sis? I thought you were picking on Typhonic the next state over.\" Magic Man said, of all nights, she just <i>had</i> to pick this one to appear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, lover-boy over there will get what's coming to him.\" Magic Man's Big Sister said. She danced around to show off her large rear. Which was weird, both he and her mother never showed signs of it, nor their father's side of things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still doesn't explain why you're here.\" Magic Man said, he tapped his foot down in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I've been seeing that you got some new girls with large backsides. The, \"Fanny Four\", they call themselves, the land their large trunks on you. That is supposed to be my job! I have to give you a lesson, to not make you forget that Magic Man.\" Big Sis proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man gulped, he remembered how this went.\" And is this all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Sis rubbed her chin for a little bit, then followed up that question. \" You know I can never lie to you Magic;remember I was friends with Lucha? No, well I have one. Anyways, she said to distract you for a little while so she can get up to her more powerful form. And as you can see, I'm doing a hell of a job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is to stop me from just flying away right now?\" Magic Man said, he was about to do just that after his statement. He opened his mouth, before the air was knocked out of him. He was knocked onto the ground and rolled over onto his front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rear attached to a giant appeared in his view, it was thankfully not as big as the Squisher mind you. The giant, not the rear, that was bigger though. It landed onto Magic Man, smushing him gently. The act was surprisingly gently, not as aggressive as some other rear based villainess. His face and upper body weren't crushed, which wasn't a fortunate thing. A hand appeared over him and the index finer started to gently noggie his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noggie, noogie, noogie. Not as bad as that tower bitch, am I right Magic? Noogie, noogie, noogie.\" Big Sis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he hated to admit it, but she was kinda right. The very least he wasn't suffocating, or had his face crushed by Megabutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the Rodgers\u2019 home, Sophie and Mark both went about their daily routine. Their parents, who both worked long hours at a corporate office, were not home to control their eldest daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark quietly snuck downstairs. He walked with extreme care so as not to wake up his beastly sibling. Mark hadn\u2019t hit his growth spurt yet. As a scrawny, undersized 9th going into 10th grader, he had no chance against his wrestler-sized big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly and silently whipped out a bowl and filled it with cereal. He poured the last of the milk into it, and began to eat. Suddenly, he heard the sound of his sisters feet pounding on the hardwood floor. Her door swung open and she emerged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark kept his eyes on his cereal as Sophie walked by. She ignored her annoying pest of a brother and went to get some cereal. After filling her bowl, she open the refrigerator. After a moment, she slammed it shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey squirt.\u201d She called. \u201cWhere\u2019s the milk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark suddenly went white. Had he really been stupid enough to take the last of something in this house? It may seem stupid, but Mark was terrified of his sister. She may have only had 3 inches on him, but she out weighed him by at least 45 pounds. She was also twice as strong. </span></div></div>",

She was a star athlete in high school but got poor grades. She was very childish, and yet very revealing of her body (if you know what I mean). Once, in science class, she drank a vile on a dare. She got very sick and the succubus came to her, offering to save her life with one condition. She chose to live a life of crime, gaining her powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbilities: Ava has two main powers and is very powerful. She may be the most powerful villain. Her powers include: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1). She can possess people. When she touches someone for enough time, her power takes effect. She can take over someone\u2019s body and be in complete control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2). When provoked, she has a \u201chulk\u201d moment. Not really, because her looks don\u2019t change. Only her height and strength do. When in a fight, she grows much taller and has super strength. She stands around 7 feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearance: Ava is not tall when normal. She stands at 4\u201910\u201d, and is the shortest villain other than the Shrinker. She has a cute face, and an enormous moly plump butt that jiggles with the slightest movement. She wears a skin tight black spandex suit with black leggings. She has a large A on her front and a smaller A on each butt cheek. </span></div></div>",

It was deep enough to sound intimidating, but sultry to tickle the funny parts in Magic Man's pants. A woman stepped through the crowds;she was around five-six and wore nothing more than a sports bra and track-shorts. Sky-blue, they heavily contrasted with her mocha skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ms..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucha Libre.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your real name?\" Magic Man joked to lighten the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah stage name.

She grabbed a man from the crowd and threw him into the air. The crowd went into hysterics as the man went soaring. Magic Man cursed before he flew off after man.

The man sunk into it a little, as a way to cushion and bleed off the momentum he had developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Magic Man lowered himself with the man in tow. The two were soon back on the ground, Magic Man plopped the man onto his feet.

Yes, don't worry, you'll be safe I got to deal with the person who threw you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAnd with that,Magic Man flew off back towards Lucha Libre. When he got back, he was surprised the villain didn't run off, though thankfully the civilians had scattered. Magic Man hovered watching as the villain gave the him a cheeky wave. Not waiting for her to form a counterattack, Magic Man flew straight into her. She grunted as she was shot forward a ten or so feet. Magic Man did his best not break her sternum,he didn't know <i>how</i> invincible she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed on her back,and when she didn't get back up, Magic Man feared the worst. A slight groan came from the prone woman and Magic Man watched as she pushed herself back up. He stared closely and swore that the woman was a few inches taller. And after a quick jaunt into his memories,Magic Man knew for certain she was smaller. Her curves had grown a little as well, though they were nothing compared to the lean muscles she now possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good hit Magic e-mano.\" Lucha Libre joked. \"Now let's see how you like mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost like a bullet, Lucha Libre gave Magic a hit right into the stomach. The hero coughed in pain, he flew upwards like a pendulum on an axis. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty feet up he flew. Gravity soon brought him downwards,and only through the quick utterance of a spell.made sure he didn't land back onto the woman's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding.Ding.

Magic Man did a small flip to appease his sense of relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No high stress work for me today,all smooth and no crunch.\" Magic Man stated. A light flickered in his peripheral and Magic Man instinctively stopped to stare. He turned three-hundred and sixty degrees to find the cause of the light. There! Magic Man spotted where it had originated from. It came from the city's observatory,much smaller than anything on the coast,but still a tourist attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew towards the source.Unlike most observatory's,this one was made somewhat recently. Its telescope much smaller,though not downgraded in the least. The dome was much slimmer and compact compared to its counterparts. Tonight, it appeared that everything was closed. The dome snapped shut and all the lights were out. But for some reason an astronomer was standing on the roof, in one hand she held the powerful light that brought Magic Man's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the problem?\" He asked. The astronomer,a quite striking brunette, placed the light down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic Man. Thank God you're here. Someone's commandeered our telescope.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are..?\" Magic Man politely inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dr. McKenzie, I would offer some coffee if I wasn't on the roof right now.\" The two shook hands for formality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to seem rude but shouldn't you call the police? I'm not going to leave mind you it just seemed they could be much more helpful in this matter.Does this person have any hostages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Its just that...I think its one of <i>your </i>problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man sighed,realizing she meant a new super villainess was in town. He asked her how to get into the building,and with one point of her finger, Magic Man sulked inside. He moved around the place for a few moments until he found a layout for the facility pasted onto one wall. He searched for a bit before he could see the door that led into the observatory interior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cautiously walked in doing he best to see where the assailant was. It wasn't that hard though, as two firm pair of cheeks were bent upwards at his direction. He was startled for a moment until he steadied his nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever owned the pair of buttocks stood up and turned around. A blonde bombshell wrapped in a tight black bodysuit, various astrological symbols,as well as celestial objects, dotted her body. She stared at Magic Man with a perplexed smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Gutentag!</i>\" Evident German in her accent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Magic Man?\" She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well then, I can't have you interrupting me.\" She happily spoke. Magic Man was about to say something else, but stopped as he saw the woman walk over to some boxes and sit down on them. He watched as the boxes sunk into her body,like how a person would dip their finger into water.She grew a few inches in height,but more eyecatchingly, in the rear. Done with that action, the woman raced forward and knocked Magic Man onto his back before he could even realize what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on his chest and Magic Man could feel her weight on him. The woman looked down at trapped form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Astro-Cheeks and i'm also happy to meet you!\"</span></div></div>",

What can we do with a drunken sailor, early in der morning~</i> One Magic Woman sang in the dawn's early lights.The villainess flew through the air like a bullet as the wind touched her skin.She was somewhat bored today, her favorite man in the entire world hadn't been seen in over three days. Unlike the majority of the super criminal populace, all she wanted was Magic Man. Well, okay, the other women did too, but she wanted him more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now where could he be?\" </i>Magic Woman thought. <i>\"I need some more balanced land to think on.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly descended and landed in the more battered quarter of the city. Abandoned,but not entirely derelict,buildings loomed over her. She strutted down the street with barely a thought of being mugged, after-all she was Magic Woman. What she didn't account for was the incoming woman dressed in such stereotypical mailman attire that she <i>had</i>to be some sort of eccentric, possibly even a supervillainess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what's yer gimmic?\" Magic Woman inquired as the woman got closer. The woman panted for a bit until she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing I don't have powers, this is just something my boss ordered me to wear.\" The woman held a finger up as she caught her breath. She pushed herself straight up and peered at Magic Woman. \"Took me a while to catch up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye were following me?\" Magic Woman asked a little angry at the thought of someone knowing where she was and without even knowing about them in turn. The mailwoman didn't seem to notice the angry look on the Irish lass' face. Instead she took out an enclosed envelope from her bag. Magic Woman's eyes stared quizzically at the envelope, with a small utterance of a spell, she telekinetically picked it up from the other woman's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Woman looked back at the mailwoman,to her utter shock the lady seemed to have disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lying,two-faced.\" Magic Woman muttered.Opening the envelope with a constructed scissor,Magic Woman took out a piece of paper. Slowly she began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Greetings O Great Magician...\"</i><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\nThis was not the only mail being opened at the moment,all over city villainess read their monikers from the top of the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A once in a lifetime event is soon coming. Something so spectacular that one can barely fathom it.\"</i> Hypnotits read. She was currently sitting down on an enslaved man in a run-down looking room. Off to her side was another man, this one being used as a table. A coffee mug was balanced on his back, with one hand Hypnotits took a hold of the cup.The bare-chested beauty yelped in shock as she took a sip from her coffee mug. \"Uggg, you there, make this a little colder next time. I think I burnt my tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mind-addled thug walked over to his mistress to take away her mug.Off to the kitchen he went, Hypnotits tapped her foot as she waited for her coffee to be remade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I shouldn't invade a drug den for coffee, but ehh, all the stores are closed right now.\" Hypnotits spoke.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<i>\"We.</i> Alright is this royal 'we' or more than one of us 'we'.\" Thunder Thighs spoke to the rest of her group.The other three looked at Thunder Thighs in annoyance. This mysterious message had somehow gotten into Astro-Cheeks body,only through her expelling the contents of her absorbed mass did they even find this enigmatic paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it really matter?\" Squisher yelled out. \"Just read the damn thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It kinda does, we need to plan fo-hey!\" The blue hair woman yelled as Megabutt took the paper from her hand. With a hip-enhanced bump, she knocked Thunder Thighs down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We have cordially invited you to participate in this grand event. All expenses have been paid. Now,of course, you may be asking what this event even is.\"</i> She read off.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<i>\"We call it SUPER SMACKDOWN: A WRESTLING EVENT OF FANTASTICAL PROPORTIONS! </i>Hell yeah!\" Lucha Libre exclaimed in delight. She was currently in an alleyway, one hand wrapped around the letter while the other was chocking a man out. Around her three other guys were battered and bruised. They did try to assault one of the city's strongest vilainess so they got off relatively unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yes, Super Smackdown. All throughout the city every single villainess shall come and compete for a variety of prizes, as well as three grand prizes...\"</i><br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"Shall I continue sisters?\" Sister Ivanov spoke to her equals. Van Bushkirk seemed bored while Delacroix was happily making food for the others as Ivanov spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bother in this degeneracy?\" Van Bushkirk answered. \"Nothing more than defenseless women being pulled dis way and dat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hold on.\" Delacroix said as she appeared behind Ivanov. She looked closely at the paper to read off what she saw.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">====</div><br>\r\n<i>\"The first grand prize shall be the title of 'Super Mistress of the Decade', a trophy and belt shall be provided. Hey sis come over here!\"</i> Team Player yelled out to Cheersquad. The duo, or more accurately, the small horde of women were raiding a sports shop of all places. One of the clones of Cheersquad walked over to Team Player to read the section where she was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A trophy? That sounds sweet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right?\" <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">====</div><br>\r\n\"Da thecond wuv be seventeen million dolars.\" Lipsticker spat out.Her lips still somewhat huge after a job she did a little over an hour ago. \"Seveteen millio-ack. Seventeen millions is quite a pretty penny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLipsticker's lips were now smaller than before. After that she continued with the paper's message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n<i>\"The third, and to some the most tantalizing, prize is one neatly wrapped in a bowtie: Magic Man.\"</i> Mouse read as she patrolled with Checkmate. The two super heroines were doing the best they could to combat the city's villainess populace without their boss.For the past three days the two investigated where Magic Man had been taken, with the letter the duo now knew where he was at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad Amelia.\" Checkmate sighed over to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know right. Let me continue. <i>On the bottom of this paper are the coordinates where this event shall be taking place. In eight days time the games shall begin, all who are not there by then are immediately disqualified from the event. A barcode on the back of paper leads to a special site where the reader will be provided a printable ticket to be used as admission.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever was going to happen in the next eight days worried the two as they digested the information.</span></div></div>",

Her mind went over who'd she'd have to face in a week's time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll probably wipe the floor with half of the ladies in town.\" She spoke before she delivered a liver punch to the bodybag. There were only six opponents, well seven technically, that she'd care to fight. Those being Squisher,Ivory Knight, Ebony Solider, Megabutt, The Wall, and Magic Woman. Bully was more of an extreme nuisance that she didn't care for much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat now beating down her seven foot frame, Lucha stopped her training and breathed a sigh of relief. She went over to grab a hold of a water bottle, which she accidentally splattered against herself. She grumbled in annoyance, it always took awhile to control her strength once she gotten onto the higher end of her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the space, Saul.\" Lucha Libre said to a gruff looking Mexican man who gave her a small wave in response.

I better not be put into some wild ass goose chas-\" Cowgirl stopped. The soft sound of gears echoed from below her, she jumped back immediately to see the dirt and roots of the forest move downwards.

A large door, about eight feet tall and six feet wide,greeted them. It opened automatically and the quartet allowed themselves in.

There,in the screen, she could see the hero of the city trapped like a crippled bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCowgirl whooped in glee. \"The large ladies of the town will want your head for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I need <i>your </i>group to do security. I have over forty soldiers at my disposal but I know from third-person parties that your group is quite possibly the best I can get in America.\" Sensation said. She led the four to a row of seats to sit themselves down. With a snap of her fingers a butler came fast walking out to hand the four ladies a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want us to deal with any troublemakers?\" Cowgirl spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,only six ladies could ever match you in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that wrestler or that giantess, the wrassiling one, God there are so many.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I also know your group has experience with other super powered beings. They have the necessary technology to combat such strange women.\" Sensation took a sip of wine before she continued. \"I'm also offering up this little deal to sweeten our relationship. If you disavow the money from the tournament, you can keep the money <i>I'm</i> already giving you but get Magic Man and the title.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCowgirl's eyes widened in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to give up the money?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm already paying you, also instead of some of the ladies of the city getting it, I can keep it all to myself. You'll be my \"champion\" who can prune the tournament. Just think you get: the title, the money, and the hero if you win.What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be my boss' representative in that matter.\" Cheryl came in.

Marcus nodded in acknowledgement and swiped his card next to the door's scanner. He shuffled for a bit until he moved down the grey steps.

His walk downwards allowed him to think about the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this resort exists, and a few miles outside the city's limits to.\" He had learned about this place through hushed whispers between villainess, never really getting a lead until about three weeks ago. Some words were spoke between Cheersquad and Lipsticker and from there the hero went forth to find out more about this place. It took him two weeks of basic training in a sister facility to allow him to work here, and even then he had to go through hoops and hurdles for the mysterious group that financed this resort to even consider him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally reaching the end, Marcus prepared himself for some dastardly evil lair. What he instead saw was a grand vision of a place. Twenty rooms were crescent around a giant pool, maybe eighty feet wide. A bar was to the left of him,while to his side was a restaurant of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A new employee.\" A voice said to the side of Mark, or Marcus in this case.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>\"I do hope Amelia likes these donuts.\"</i> Magic Man thought as he soared through the air. Today was one of those good days, were all the villainesses seemed to be resting instead of attacking. Not counting another encounter with The Streak; she always does something to cause discord among the populace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out a donut, Magic Man happily munched on it as he flew. His attention was quickly taken up once he saw a peculiar sight. On the roof of a building sat three women--- that wasn't <i>that</i> surprising, the public did that many times before---what was surprising was the fact all three of them were dressed up as nuns. One of the women, more so, than the others. Now, normally even with the strange getup of the women, Magic Man wouldn't even think of landing. It wasn't like it was his duty to come down and investigate people in strange costumes; as long as someone didn't count his rouges gallery that is. But, the three women on the roof seemed to be trying to get his attention. With one of the women raising up her arm high in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Strange,why would they know i'm at cruising speed right now?\"</i> Magic Man mused, at this speed he could easily see someone trying to contact him. He swallowed the rest of his donut and hugged the pink box as he flew towards the girls. He landed, and placed his donut box to his side, peering greatly at each of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one making her way forward to greet Magic Man must've been the leader or at least the one who the others delegated to. Her red hair was in a bob, which Magic Man thought was odd for a nun to have. Her eyes seemed friendly and her general demeanor was that of a usually happy woman,but Magic Man could see something like....pity behind her eyes. While the rest of her body was covered like that of a nun, Magic Man's eyes were drawn intently to her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I didn't know a sister could wear something like that?\"</i> Magic Man peered at the twins pushed greatly into a corset, which was another surprising thing for a nun to have. Shaking his head he looked at the other two walking behind the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two on the woman's side seemed almost like contrasts next to the first. On her right was a <i>tall</i> brunette, with hair straighter than an arrow. Magic Man wondered if hair could be uncanny, because this woman's hair seemed to be fitting that criteria. On her height, she wasn't just big for a woman, she was that for a man! She could easily have been 6'3, or 6'4 in height;now even though he met size changers before, Magic Man still raised an eye at the woman's pure size. Like the other woman, her body was covered up modestly, with the exception of her legs. Magic Man wasn't much of a fan of legs---and who still is, this isn't the fifties---but even he marveled at her soft thighs and powerful calves. They were smooth, and silky, making Magic Man gape at them. Her face told a different story as she seemed to be on edge and about to rip Magic Man's throat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third and last woman on the left was probably the shortest, but still her curves were fantastical. She reminded Magic Man of Enchantress or Dr. Grant; though, those two beat out the her by wide margin. Her curled blonde hair bobbed gently as she walked. Out of the three, she seemed to be the most un-nun like of them all. Both a cleavage window and a slit in her skirt made her seem like she was cos-playing a nun more than she actually was one. In a middle ground between the first and the second;she seemed reversed,but at least welcoming to Magic Man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Citizens, what can I help you with?\" Magic Man spoke as the first woman came before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salutations, Magic Man. My name is Sister Ivanov\" The red hair replied, a faint Russian accent colored her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Behind me are Sisters Van Bushkirk\" She pointed to the brunette, who glared daggers at Magic Man. \"And Delacroix.\" She pointed to the blonde who smiled gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings.\" Magic Man smiled and waved, Sister Bushkrik seemed to take offense to that and only glared more at Magic Man. Delacroix, on the other hand, only smiled more at that.\" Now, as I said before, what can I help you with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not what you could do for us, its what you can do for the world.\" Ivanov said, beginning to speak again as she saw Magic Man's confused face.\" We Sisters have heard of your sins and that of your compatriots. We've seen photos of the exposed bodies and vices and discord that you all bring. Normally, we let the good of mankind work out these problems, but we know your secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My secret?\" Magic Man replied, wracking his brain to wonder if the girls knew he was Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT YOUR ILK ARE SATAN'S LAPDOGES\" Sister Bushkirk screamed, her accent being hard to place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are 'Ze Sister of Protection'\" Sister Delacroix trumpeted \" And we're here to ztop your zinning to zave your zoul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, listen, we know it wasn't your fault that you sold it, but we can help you get it back.\" Ivanov pleaded to Magic Man, who only looked at the three like they were loons. Stepping back, he picked up his dounut box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, okay. So, uhh, yeah. You do that and I'll get back to you soon enough.\" Magic Man flew slowly into the air and turned his back to the three. Right until he felt himself get choked by something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping his donut box, he struggled with whatever was holding his neck. Looking down, he saw it was a some leather thing; it was a whip, but Magic Man was being strangled at the moment, it could be forgiven that he wasn't in the best state of mind at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?\" Bushkrik exclaimed as she started to pull back on the whip. Magic Man struggled against it, before deciding to fly towards Bushkirk. The sister's eyes grew wide as she saw Magic Man fly towards her,the tension eased up on the magician hero's throat as he came closer to the nun. Upon reaching her, he pulled off the whip and tangled it up with its owner. It wasn't a solid trap, but it did make her start to curse out. Rolling after the fact, he got up to see the other two holding up a weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIvanov carried a sword and shield---from who knows where---and Delacroix was holding....marbles,what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that this was going to be a challenge.\"  Ivanov wearily said.\" But fear not, we will save you, even if you don't want, or know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we're on two different planes of existence, lady.\" Magic Man shot back, trying to fly back up. It didn't seem that any of the girls had powers, or at least, any movement ones that is. But just when he reached ten feet in the air, Magic Man yelled as he felt something hit his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty, naughty.\" Delacroix voice whistled. He looked behind him to see that she had thrown one of those marbles, it rolled on the floor for a few moments before it came rolling back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing his best to fly back up, Magic Man's eyes widened as he felt his ability to do so was gone. Quickly whispering out a spell, his eyes opened wider as he knew that was gone as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't zink about going anywhere, my beads can cancel any zpecific zet of zpells you can conjure.\" Delacroix explained calmly. He watched as Bushkrik got herself up from her entanglement and marched with the others towards him, menacingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets not make this anymore difficult.\" Ivanov gently spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man looked around for any avenue of escape and mentally cheered as he saw his escape. \"You both agree on something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDashing to his side, he oped up the skyscraper roof door, or whatever its called. He rushed down the stairs, and after thirty steps he  heard the three coming after him. He pushed forward, hearing their voices getting closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thank god, it doesn't seemed if their enhanced with invulnerability or speed.</i>\" His thoughts pushed out to help calm him down. Upon reaching the end of the stairs, he was greeted with a long corridor. Rushing forward, he saw the bright light of an elevator.He cheered, but looked behind himself as he saw the three arriving just behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed himself to the absolute limits,he needed to work out more, and slammed into the elevator. His victory was short lived however as he still saw the girls coming after him. He frantically slammed on the '1st' floor button as well as the two arrows to close it. Closer and closer they came and just when they were about to reach the door. It closed. And Magic Man waited to see if they were about to break through it; one, two, three, four, five <i>and</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and slumped down, only to realize that most elevators aren't randomly open. Looking to his side, Magic Man saw an opened janitor staring down at him. She white-knuckled her broom as she looked down on him. Magic Man smiled and got up to a standing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just another day in my life, citizen.\" He did his best to sound confident at his own speech.</span></div></div>",

He did his best to ignore the stares and whispers he got from the people in the lobby. As soon as he was outside he bolted for the nearest alley. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, out of sight, he did his best to get his magic working again. He ran through some of the simpler spells he knew, but none of them worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHICH WAY DID HE GO?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" The hero did the only thing he could think of and dove into a nearby dumpster. He curled up, held his nose shut, and tried not to gag on the smell as he heard the trio of crazy nuns run past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second he was sure they were gone, he jumped out of his hiding spot and gasped  for clean air. \"What the hell was their problem?\" He muttered as he leaned against the wall of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, he had to give them points for not committing a robbery or an act of terrorism to get his attention. That alone gave them more points then most of the women he normally dealt with.  Still, he had no idea what they were going on about with secrets and saving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was starting to get a headache from trying to make sense of this. With a groan of frustration, he hit the dumpster he hid in with a spell that teleported it to the far side of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, magic's back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thorough magical cleaning to get every last trace of garbage off of himself, Mark made his way back to the donut shop to replace the box he lost earlier. However, as soon as he got there he ducked behind a building. Peaking around the corner confirmed his fear; one of those crazy nuns was standing in front of a nearby shop as she examined things through the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out from around the corner, Mark looked around but could only see one of the sisters, who was being given a wide birth by the general populace. Cautiously, the collage student began to make his way over to her. They seemed to be civil, and he wasn't in his Magic Man disguise. He was <i>probably</i> safe right now. And maybe he could even tease some information out of her to see what they were after.</span></div></div>",

This is why I put Amelia onto reconnaissance. Anyways,i'll just spy on her for a bit and sit down in Joey's while I'll do so.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Sister Ivanov spoke to a passing citizen; she was ignored of course. If she was angry at the apathetic reaction, she didn't show it. Scratching her chin, she called out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, excuse me!\" A woman stopped to look at Ivanov. She raised an eye at the sister's costume; Ivanov didn't notice the stare at all. The sister just spoke her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there good child. I am in need of assistance. Will you help me with this endeavor?\"  Sister Ivanov said. The woman taped her foot and gave a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. What exactly do you need Sister...?\" The woman said in a tone that didn't seem quite accepting of Ivanov's occupation. I mean, why would any nun <i>not</i> have a cleavage window?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivanov, my dear. Now for my question: Do you happen to know where exactly does Magic Man congress? Any favored areas of some sort, hidden alleys,buildings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like: where he usually stays around? Is that what you mean? Like his 'go-to' places?\" The other woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yis!\" Ivanov exclaimed, her Russian accent briefly flaring up. She coughed and steadied herself. \"I mean, yes, that's what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he usually likes to go to that donut shop over there, which I have to commend Magic Man on. Joey Doughy is a great place, local, but still better than some franchises.It also advertises the hell out of Magic Man's favoritism! I mean you should try some of their Magic Man specialties..\" The woman prattled on while also pointing to the shop,just in time for Mark to walk into Joey's. The hero grimaced as heard the speech going on. He could practically feel the finger pointing at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh come on!\"</i> He thought. He was tempted to turn around and see if the sister was coming after him,but he kept his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just go up to the cashier and ask for a dozen; hear also what Ivanov asks Joey at the counter and gather some info.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark walked in with a little ding and walked up to Joey. A man in his late thirties,early forties, who seemed to have a growing gut on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark! Come In!\" Joey exclaimed. Mark immediately took Joey up on his offer. He waited for Ivanov to come barreling in after him,but she didn't<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm on edge. Calm down Mark, she doesn't know who you are.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's shaking Joey?\" Mark questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic Man came in earlier today, like he always does, and asked for a dozen.\" Joey proudly exclaimed. \"I keep telling him he can take a dozen for free for the rest of his life, but he always wants to pay me full price! And you know me Mark, I can't do that to the guy who saved my ma' and baby girl! So we haggle like always and we come down to him paying half of the price. That still didn't feel good to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark listened in on the story, knowing it because he already experienced it twenty minutes ago. \"<i>Though I wished I could've eaten those donuts</i>.\"Joey soon finished and settled down to talk with Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will it be today Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me a dozen Joey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded and began to take a pink box out. Taking out a set of tongs, he waited for Mark's orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three glazed donuts.\" Joey complied and waited for Mark's next order. \"One Thunder Thighnut.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJoey took out a donut that was skillfully placed together,giving the impression of a rump. How Joey did that without having his wife yell at him was beyond Mark's comprehension. It had a stylized lighting bolt on top of it as well some mixture that allowed it to delightfully bubble in one's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One Mouse Puckering Lemon\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey proceeded to pick up a doughy, copyright infringement from his counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic Man's favorite after his own!\" Joey exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Amelia's favorite. Lemon's don't have any right to be near sugary confections.\"</i> Mark didn't verbalize this though. He also wondered where Ivanov was and only hoped she had gone back to her companions. Letting his guard down, he turned off the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Lucha Libre Loop\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going for that extra kick?\"<br>\r\nJoey then picked up a bread loop covered in that red-orange powder that has been on the rage. Mark didn't like spicy stuff that much, but he did like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Squisher Supreme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank God for big boxes, am I right Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey picked up a giant,chocolate covered donut and placed it in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One Cheerleader Cluster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going for the a whole lot of doughy goodness?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey grabbed a hold of a weirdly deformed donut covered in pink frosting and purple sprinkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a Shyren Stick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling a little naughty today, Mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey grabbed a hold of a blue donut stick and put it into the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One Magic Woman Mayhem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey put in a chocolate covered donut styled like a suit into the box. It had strawberry filling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And two Magic Man Masters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey placed in a something that looked almost like a Magic Woman Mayhem, but a little bigger and it had blueberry in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be all Mark?\" Joey asked and Mark nodded. Joey went to the cash register with the box, but before he did so, he let out a little chuckle <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something funny Joey?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its just, this is EXACTLY what Magic Man ordered earlier. Can you even believe it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is interesting.\" A Russian voice called out behind Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" He mumbled, turning around to face the sister as she walked in.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes were open but she was waddled strangely along the building's front.She traveled across the street easily as no cars seemed to be coming at the moment,Mark took this opportunity to follow.He watched as a few folk pointed her out,but didn't do much else. They mumbled among themselves as they watched the strange nun move across the sidewalk.The nun soon went down an wide alley and the people decided that the spectacle had lost its luster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe disguised hero saw his chance in getting some info on this new trio.Mark shuffled around a bit to make him look more \"student-like\"; he ruffled his shirt, held on closer to his pink box, and took on a more dazed attitude.Walking into the alleyway, he found the sister with closed eyes. As he went forward, he groaned as he realized who he picked.It was Sister...something he forgot. Placing her under the name of \"Sister Whip\", Mark moved closer to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me..\" He quietly spoke. Instantly the woman turned around and grabbed him by the neck. Mark was about 5'9 in height,but the woman was a strapping 6'3 or 6'4. She had enough height on the man to easily do this. Mark's pink box fell to the alley floor and he made sure to angle it as to not have its content's spill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not going to pay for another box, Amelia's lemon jellies are in there!

My name is Sister Van Bushkirk of The Sister of Protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's filed the name away in his mind.And also her strange accent. Straightening himself he began to ask his questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may Sister, can I ask some questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman seemed strangely pleased at Mark's request.

At best, I get sat upon at the bottom.\"</i> Mark internally joked. Picking up his pink box, he walked with Sister Van Bushkirk as they exited the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you believe that Magic Man is a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have heard whispers of a demon from Hell. A Succubus that transforms women into perverse characters for Magic Man's pleasure. Think how many women villains there are and think about why they choose Magic Man of all people to go after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Owch.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could go after any other man in this city, but they choose Magic Man! Logically this could've been coincidence if it was one or two villains or even five. But all villains obsessed with the man? This could only being his perverted fantasy that he sold his soul for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. Yeah, that could be an explanation.\" Mark said. \" But what about his partners?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mouse girl and the Chess copier? Hhhmph. Slaves to his whims. Poor girls,we shall free them!\" Sister Van Bushkirk raised her fist to the air,before she meekly put it down. \"Apologizes,Lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you plan to take him on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With The Lord's powers of course.\" Sister Van Bushkirk stared at Mark like he was a child asking a strange question. \"His might easily overpowers any black magic the sorcerer possess. He shall fail without his infernal backing. Now child I must excuse myself from this conversation, I have to find this evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Van Bushkirk was about to walk off, but Mark chose one last question for the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,real quick. Sister, why do you wear that outfit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSister Van Bushkirk looked down at her provocative habit and stared back at Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To give Magic Man one last happy memory before we go through the process of redeeming him.\" Sister Van Bushkirk spoke ominously. She shot off, leaving Mark with his pink box of donuts. Placing it under one arm, Mark took out his cellphone and dialed Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Amelia.

As a dual theater and psychology major, she was adept when it came to acting and playing a role, since she also understood how people think and perceive their world. As the star of the debate team, she could effortlessly convince nearly anyone to see things her way. That's what made her one of the more dangerous villains in Magic Man's world. Her innate talents are complemented the powers that the Succubus granted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMementa has the power to implant false memories in someones mind, and the power to erase memories as she sees fit. All she needs to do is be within 30 feet of someone, and she can telepathically link with their mind, adding and erasing things like files on a computer. As a psychology major with an interest in hypnotherapy, her favorite use for this power is to implant post-hypnotic suggestions in someone before she's even put them into trance. She also enjoys making someone believe they lost a fight that hasn't even started yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhysically she is fiery redhead, standing at 5' 11\" with a pale, freckled complexion. Her costume consists of a pink bodysuit-like tube top that barely covers her breasts, due to the fact that the material only goes up about an inch over her nipples and has a wide, plunging break in the fabric that spans from her cleavage down to her navel. She wears lavender compression shorts that are about a size and a half too small for her, clinging to her every curve. Brimming with confidence stemming from her acting experience, as well as her natural gifts in the form of a D cup chest and a tight bubble butt, Melody delights in sensually teasing, seducing, and dominating her victims. Seeing her prey totally under her control ,and infatuated with her body is the ultimate turn on for her. Unfortunately, she has the tendency to get a bit overwhelmed by this and start to slip up in various ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weakness is the continuity of her memories. She must make sure that the memories she plants are believable. If her victims start to question her false memories, they begin to unravel. She can cover for this by arguing with the subject and convincing them that the memories are real, but if she gets flustered it all comes crashing down. Similarly, if the subject sees something or experiences a sensation that reminds them of a memory Mementa has removed, there is the possibility of it all coming flooding back to them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Magic Man was responding to a tip from one of his friends in the police force. Someone had tripped the silent alarm at the Main Street branch of Central Bank. He burst through the doors expecting to find a hostage situation, but was surprised to find a completely normal scene. People were going about their business in a plain way. People lined up for the tellers, there were staffers meeting with clients in their offices, nothing seemed out of place. Then he spotted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was leaning over the counter, in a way that made it seem like she was looking at the receipt when really more concerned with where the <i>teller</i> was looking. The teller handed her a knapsack that seemed just a <i>bit</i> too full. \"Thank you once again, I do so look forward to seeing you every month.\" This was, of course, complete bullshit. Melody had never even set foot in this bank before, and this teller had never before met her. But as far as the teller was concerned, this was a regular occurrence. He remembered Melody the instant she walked in the small downtown branch. She was the wealthy heiress who came in once a month to load up on cash for her usual shopping spree. She had carte blanche to withdraw any amount up to five hundred thousand dollars, which they kept on hand just for her. Of course, she was disappointed when he told her they only had two hundred thousand on hand, but she was more than understanding when he promised to have the other three hundred grand ready for her tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleasantries finished, Melody turned around, a spring in her step from her successful heist. Then she saw him standing there. Magic Man! She was never sure how to feel when she saw him. There was always the risk that the hero would succeed in foiling her plans, as he often did, but she never tired of toying with him. Somehow, he had seen through her jigsaw puzzle of lies and sex time and time again. She had never had enough time to completely enslave him to her will, but that was her ultimate fantasy. Melody was never without a few boy toys to entertain her, but she got bored with them <i>far</i> too quickly. Magic Man would be the gift that keeps on giving. Melody ran for the door. There were far too many people here, it would make a scene. She needed a much more <i>private</i> venue for her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark cursed himself. He hadn't expected her to bolt like that, but he should have. She already had the money, why would Mementa stay and fight him. All she had to do was get away from him to win. He <i>couldn't</i> let that happen. He bolted out the door and into the busy Main Street. It was raining hard and he could barely see through the drops. He looked every which way for the red haired ne'er-do-well and he eventually found her about 50 feet away, ducking down an alley that he knew and she <i>obviously</i> didn't. That alley was a dead end, she had nowhere left to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelody went into full actress mode as soon as the hero was within range of her powers. And so the game begins. It was a scene straight out of the pictures. She looked every which way for an exit. Panicky, almost to a fault. With three walls around her and a large awning above her she had no means of escape. But she didn't need to escape, and the awning at least protected her and her prey from the rain which was now coming down in buckets. Eventually the ruby haired beauty made a helpless motion that indicated that she realized she was trapped. She turned her tearful eyes torwards him and burst out \"Why are you chasing me? You're supposed to be a hero, aren't you?\" Magic Man was taken aback at this. \"What do you mean? I'm chasing you <i>because</i> I'm a hero! You're a villain! Of course I'm going to come after you! I can't let you get away with... with...\", he trailed off. The manipulative seductress was <i>more</i> than happy to fill in the blanks for him. With a bit of her trademark \"creativity\", of course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Was</i> a villain! <i>Was</i>!\" she interjected. \"Or did you forget? I don't see how you could. You were there after all. It was supposed to be my moment of triumph. My best heist yet. But then she came back! The Succubus.\", she said in disgust. \"She said that I had grown too powerful, that I was out of control! She took away my powers, <i>remember</i>?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagic Man thought about this. He <i>could</i> sort of remember. The packed museum, the crown jewels, the trussed up patrons, and the Succubus, her eyes red with fury. How could he be so stupid. Of course, she wasn't a villain any more. Even if she wanted to, she couldn't... couldn't...\" he couldn't even remember what her powers were. He was so shaken, so embarrassed, so flustered that he couldn't even remember what it was this villainess could supposedly do. \"I'm so sorry, I don't know how I forgot.\" came his sheepish reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Asshole</i>! You scared the shit out of me, chasing me like that! I didn't know what to do. What made you think <i>I</i> was worth chasing? What could you <i>possibly</i> want with me?\" she asked. Melody began to shift roles. The key was to make the transition from damsel to hellcat smoothly, so that her soon-to-be boy toy wouldn't get suspicious. \"<i>Ohhhhhh..</i>\", she said in a teasing voice. Making it obvious that she had come to some dramatic realization. \"It's like <i>that</i> is it?\", her lips curled into a mischievous grin. \"What do you mean?\" the hero asked, completely bewildered as to what she meant. \"I <i>always</i> thought you had a crush on me!\", Mementa said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved towards him, swinging her hips side to side with every step, like an actress in a noir picture. This was the first time she had used this particular post-hypnotic suggestion on him. She had planted it in his mind a long time ago, during the course of that yacht heist she had helped the mob with. He had foiled her that time too, but her heart wasn't really in the job anyways. The money wasn't <i>that</i> good. No, as soon as he showed up, her attention shifted. She used it as an opportunity to further fuck with the hero's head for another day. She had been <i>dying</i> to use this one ever since. It was the <i>perfect</i> thing for a rainy day such as this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every leftward motion of her hips, he would let his guard down a bit more. With every rightward motion, he found her even more attractive then he already did. By the time she reached him she had gone 15 paces. His defenses were sufficiently lowered to the point that he didn't seem worried that she was circling round him. Like a lioness circling her prey. She did this to milk the effects of her trick a bit more. Adding a large number of extra steps, and extra swings of her hips with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're out of your mind.\", came Magic Man's reply, his face now a dark shade of crimson. His costume betrayed his true feelings though. His erection was all too visible to the now properly horny temptress. Melody was just getting started and already her panties she was warm with anticipation. It had never gone this smoothly before! His defenses were almost entirely down. She should have tried this \"I'm not a villain\" thing <i>ages</i> ago. Just a bit more and then the <i>real fun</i> could begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, don't insult me! You're telling me you <i>didn't</i> find it hot? You, the strapping young hero. Me, the sexy cat burglar with the invisibility powers?\". This last bit was, of course, a complete and total lie, but she couldn't have him remembering what her real powers were. \"You used to cringe and pull away whenever I would grab your crotch without you seeing me!\", she giggled at this. \"I used to love our little game of cat and mouse but you never wanted to play!\", she pouted. \"It made a certain amount of sense. It wouldn't do to have a strapping hero falling over the big bad supervillain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was only a few feet away from him now. She was so close to him now that he backed up reflexively. Melody used this to her advantage, backing him up against the wall so that she could use yet another one of her suggestions. This was one she used on him <i>many</i> times before, but it was one of her favorites. It required her to pin him to some surface or hover over him in some sort of dominant position and simply stare into his eyes. The longer she stared, the more submissive he got, and this power grew <i>exponentially</i>. She had used this so many times with varying degrees of success. She had pinned him to the floor, handcuffed him to a chair, but they had always been interrupted. It was always fun while it lasted, but it was always cut too short. <i>Today</i> would be different though. With the rain coming down in buckets, like this, not a soul would be venturing down this dark abandoned alleyway. It was all their's. Which meant <i>he</i> was all <i>hers</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But...</i> I'm not a villainess now.\", she said, her big green eyes locked with his steely blue ones. \"I'm just a regular girl who likes the strong reserved type. If you're interested we can live out that fantasy with no risk.I still like to grab the occasional crotch from time to time. \", she grabbed his crotch to prove her point and he whimpered in a lovely mix of fear and desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\", Melody thought, her panties now more soaked with her juices. \"This is actually happening! I'm going to finally have him under my power. I just need to make him want it <i>a bit</i> more.\" She spun around, and walked away, swinging her hips again to further the suggestion. \"<b>But</b>, why should I? After all you <i>did</i> chase me down here. Maybe you're not the hero I always wanted? And maybe <i>you</i> don't want me? Even though I've changed my ways, could you <i>really</i> hook-up with a former baddie? Could you?\" she went back to pinning him to the wall, and refocused her stare once again. If this dominant act was going to work she would need him to be a good, horny, little submissive. And that meant more staring. She parted her lips. \"Well...<i>super</i>hero? Whats...it...going..to...<i>be</i>?\"</span></div></div>",

Mark was Magic Man. He couldn't just hook-up with a former villainess like this, what if it was a trap? But that was the thing, Mark had been at this for a while now, and he had been caught in more traps than he could remember. After a while he sort of developed a hero's intuition for it, a sixth sense that told him when he was in some form of danger. He couldn't sense anything right now. Normally even when he was out and about in his normal life, he could still feel that impending danger, but now he could sense absolutely nothing. It was almost like being with her was the safest he had been in a long time. If he felt this way around someone who claimed to have been reformed, doesn't that mean that she is telling the truth? That she really isn't a threat to him anymore? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought back on their history together, trying to find a single reason to keep his guard up. He found none. In fact, he couldn't recall anything about her criminal past except for how much he enjoyed their fights. How hot he had always found her in her various super outfits, and how much he had wanted to rip them off her. His train of thought was like a slideshow of sexy memories of their clandestine past. He had made his decision. \"You're right you know, I have always wanted you, but I always held back. I knew that it would be wrong, that it could never work, but now things are different. We have...options available to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, you have exactly two options.\", Melody said. She swung her hips to one side. \"Option one: You come with back to my place and I fuck your brains out, giving you the best orgasm of your life. Or...\", she swung her hips to the other side. \"Option two: I walk away and you go home and masturbate and live the rest of your life thinking about how you fucked up your one and only chance to live out ever superheroes wet dream, fucking a sexy supervillainess, or rather, ex-supervillainess.\" Magic Man went up to her. \"So which way is your place?\" he asked. Melody couldn't contain herself. She grabbed his hand and started to drag him back towards Main Street. \"This way\", she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took them twenty minutes to get to Mementa's apartment. She hadn't wasted the time, all throughout the journey she had been uploading new suggestions into Magic Man's head. Upgrading her new toy with some choice features. When they finally got there, she didn't know where to begin. She could drop him into trance right now and turn him into a mindless obedient drone. That would be the quickest, most fool-proof way to enslave the hero for all eternity, but that just simply wasn't Mementa's style. She wouldn't be truly satisfied with a simple puppet. No, she wanted him to <i>know</i>, who she was, <i>know</i> that she was in control, <i>know</i> that she had beaten him. More than that, she wanted him to know but not care. He wanted him to be so enthralled with her, so addicted to her, that he could walk away, couldn't stop her. Deep down, he would want to fight her, want to get away, but she would make it so he couldn't live without her. The only question was where to start. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melody was tired of the act, tired of the deceit. It was necessary of course, a crucial part of her plan, but it was meant to get the hero here. Now that she had him all to herself, she didn't need the pretense anymore. It was time to give Magic Man his memories back. She removed the fake ones, the stories about the invisible cat-burglar who never existed in the first place and restored his memories of the much more sexy and manipulative bitch which was about to break his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gear shift!\", came Mementa's imperious voice. \"Wha?\" came the hero's confused reply. He was shocked to find himself snapping to attention. It was another one of Mementa's post-hypnotic suggestions. His body was no longer under his manual control, it was now on automatic, ready to do whatever the gorgeous ginger goddess before him commanded it to. She leaned in towards his stock still body and whispered in his ear, \"Remember me?\" \"Mementa!\" came the startled reply. Melody pulled back and laughed at this. \"That's right, hero. Too little too late though. You're in a precarious position now. You see, I brought you here so that you and can play a little game. I'm afraid it's not a very fair game, but it <i>is</i> going to be <i>lots</i> of fun. It's dead simple, I'm going to fuck with your mind and your body, and you have to try to stop me with what little means I left you. I've spent most of the afternoon giving you a shiny new set of hypnotic triggers, so you're gonna have to fight really <i>really</i> hard if you want to stop me from turning you into my little super plaything. Make sense, right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mementa, I don't know what you've done to me, but you're not going to get away with it. Try all you might, but I'll never give into you.\", said Magic Man defiantly. All the attraction that Mark had been feeling towards her had disappeared. Right now all he felt was rage. He was angry at her, of course, but most of all he was angry with himself. How could he have been so stupid to have ended up in this position. He had broken the one rule he had for fighting Mementa. Never get close to her. Why did he walk straight up to her in that alley. What had he been thinking. Then he realized, the bank. She had rushed past him in the bank. In that instant, she must have erased his memories of her powers, and his memories on how to avoid them. Suddenly, he didn't feel so bad, but he still needed to find a way out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think so, hero. I think you're going to put up a fight, of course. You've always had an iron will, it's one of the things that always attracted me to you. Such a rock of self control, I could hardly wait to break it down. Which brings us to right now. Ready to start the game?\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" came the brusque reply. \"Too bad.\" came the teasing voice. \"Lie on the floor\". Magic Mans body instantly obeyed. \"Mementa, stop this.\" he cried. \"Oh I don't think so hero, it's far too much fun. Now, stop breathing.\" His mouth snapped shut like a bear trap. His lungs ceased to function. \"Senseless\" she shouted. This was a new suggestion she had added earlier this afternoon. It shut down all Magic Mans senses. He could no longer hear, see, smell, taste, or feel. This came with a drawback though. Without his senses, Melody had no way to manually bring his senses back. She had to put a time limit on this feature. She had one minute thiry seconds. More than enough time for this next trick, since she would have to get him to start breathing soon afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put, Mark was terrified. Thirty seconds ago he was panicking at how he had been unable to control his body. How helpless he was against Mementa's commands. Try as he might, he couldn't remain upright once she had told him to lie down. Fifteen seconds ago, he had lost the ability to breathe, making it feel like he was drowning on dry land. He could no longer feel air being drawn into his lungs. Five seconds later, he could no longer feel anything. He had become trapped inside his mind. One the plus side he could no longer feel the sensation of suffocation. On the down side, he had no idea how he was going to fight Mementa if she had to power to put him into what was effectively a coma at will. If this was her opening gambit, what would her actual strategy be like? He thought about his options when his sense came back. The first thing he noticed was how his lungs felt like they had burst into flames. Then he heard her voice, and for the first time in his life, he was happy to hear one of her commands. \"Breathe hero.\" He obeyed, he opened his mouth and flared his nostrils so as to suck in as much air as possible. That's when he noticed the feeling of damp fabric on his face, and how the air he had just breathed in smelled and tasted much different than he expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMementa stared down at her captive while fingering herself through her compression shorts. If it wasn't for the fact that she still had plans that involved those shorts, she would have kept them off hen she stripped off her panties and layed them on the paralyzed heroes face.The sight of the helpless hero gasping for air through her soaked underwear had made her indescribably aroused, but she could return to pleasuring herself later. She still had work to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do they smell, hero? How do they taste? Do you like it? Huh? Do you like my pussy juices. Be honest, don't be shy. Most men can't get enough of that scent. They never seem to tire of the taste. Are you really so different from those other men? Maybe you haven't had enough?\" She shoved the panties into his mouth to test her theory.</span></div></div>",
