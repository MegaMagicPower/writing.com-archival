With the technology we have now, people can now choose to become a trainers like normal, or they can become an anthropomorphic version of their favorite pokemon! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new development has brought about the creation of an entirely new pokemon league made specifically for these pokemon anthros. Some travel in teams with no human trainers to compete, while other anthros may decide to join up with a human trainer for various reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome trainers even decide to become an anthro to help increase the bond they share between them and their own pokemon friends!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, then, who are you?</span></div></div>",

You have shoulder-length black hair, bright blue eyes, and a decent figure. You woke up early that morning, as it was at last your sixteenth birthday. That meant that your parents would finally let you choose whether you would become either a trainer or a pokemon anthro, and you honestly couldn't wait to get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly showering and getting dressed, wearing a red tank-top and blue jeans, you hurried down to the kitchen where your father was preparing breakfast. Your mother is sitting at the table, sipping her homemade latte. The family pokemon Leafeon and Kirlia were also having their breakfast, Kirlia being allowed to sit at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Daddy!\" you exclaim, hugging him from behind as he scoops a small stack of pancakes onto a plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sweety! Glad to see you're up early! Here's your breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the plate, and sit beside your mother. \"You'll have to go in about half-an-hour, Emily. Make sure you're ready in time,\" she reminds you. \"Have you made your decision yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod with a grin. </span></div></div>",

But, I want to leave which pokemon I chose a surprise for later,\" you explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, can't you at least tell us?\" your mother asks, using her Herdier-eyes trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has no effect,\" you tease back as you finish your breakfast. \"I'll let you guys know when it's all done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright. Just be careful on your way back home, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround ten o' clock, you leave the house and make your way towards the massive pokemon research facility located in the center of the town. It just so happens that one of the pioneers of the anthro technology, a man by the name of Jason Willow, works at the lab, and will be watching over your transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe famed middle-aged man is already waiting for you at the front doors. He's rather tall, has a fit build, and has short brown hair. He wears a long white doctor's coat, and a stethoscope hangs around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you again, Ms. Lewis!\" he says as he shakes your hand. \"We're all set up inside, so there won't be much of a wait! Just need to fill out a form or two, and then we can get to the big moment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! And thanks again for all of this, Mr. Willow!\" you chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pleasure!\" He guides you inside, and through a series of halls until you reach a set of large blue doors with a sign over it reading: \"Anthromorphic Lab. Do not enter without prior appointment or authorization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse with bright pink hair poked her head out of a room on the left as you walk in. \"Ah, Dr. Willow! The serum is all set and waiting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ashley! Emily, please go in with Nurse Joy, and we'll begin! I'll save the paperwork for later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and do as instructed. Inside in what looks like a normal hospital room, with a large bed in the center, and an IV standing beside it. You gulp, hating needles, but you knew you had to put up with it. A Chansey is right beside the woman, holding a clipboard. \"Chan Chansey!\" she exclaims happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Emily! I'm Ashley Joy, and I'll be the assistant nurse for you today! Please undress and sit on the bed for me, and I'll get the IV in nice and quick! Don't worry, I'm good with needles, so you'll barely feel anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay, that's good to hear,\" you reply. Blushing slightly, you strip off your clothes, and sit up on the bed. The nurse puts a paper covering over you so as to not embarrass you in front of Dr. Willow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You close your eyes, and a second later, you feel yourself being pricked. It didn't really hurt though, true to her word. You relax, and begin to focus on the form of the pokemon you had chosen....</span></div></div>",
