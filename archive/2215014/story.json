            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>14-year-old Kitty Pryde was walking back to the Mansion after getting some take-out at a nearby fast food restaurant. While eating the double cheeseburger, she heard someone screaming. Quickly finishing her meal, she went to a nearby alley and changed into her blue Shadowcat uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning over to the source of the screams, she found the place empty. Suddenly, she heard a sound behind her. She turned around and saw a group of the alien Brood, a group of aliens who she had met back when she was still new to the X-Men. During said battle, the Brood had tried to infect her and the other X-Men with their eggs and thus make them into Broods as well, but the team had succeed in stopping this procedure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brood lept to attack her. Kitty didn\u2019t react fast enough, couldn\u2019t get away, and was knocked unconscious by the Brood via a stun blaster. \"We've got her. Quickly, get her into the ship.\" order one Brood to his two cronies. One picked Kitty up and carried her to the ship in question and they then took off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty soon awoke to find herself strapped to a chair, still wearing her costume. Then a Brood came into view, and snarled, \u201cYou shall be the new vessel for our queen, but your body is yet to be ready. As such, we shall give you the perfect body for you to carry our queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kitty can protest or say anything, a machine came in and stuck a hose into her mouth. Then, she started to feel something entering her mouth. She realized it was food, Earth food. Cake, pie, doughnuts, burgers, sandwiches, cookies, hot dogs, cupcakes and more. Kitty tried to hold it back as it started filling her mouth, but she eventually swallowed the food when she realized it wasn\u2019t going to stop, not wanting to choke as her cheeks were pretty stuffed by that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being fed, Kitty\u2019s mind was focused on how to escape, and as such didn\u2019t realize her slowly protruding belly as it started to bulge against her costume's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ororo Monroe, Wolverine and Colossus were waiting for Kitty. \"I wonder where Kitty is. She usually is not this late without calling first.\" Storm said with concern. Since meeting Kitty, Ororo had formed a mother-daughter bond with the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she got held up on the subway, or somethin' 'Roro. Punk'in can handle herself. Ya know that.\" Logan grunted assuredly. Like Ororo, he had a close parent-daughter like relationship with Kitty ever since he helped her during an adventure in Japan a few months prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the same, Katya usually is not late in returning home. We should investigate.\" Colossus offered with concern for his ex-girlfriend. After a moment, the other two agreed. Soon, they were in the Blackbird, heading for space after going to the alley and discovering what had happened. Magneto, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Phoenix had all offered to come help, but the trio had declined. They knew the Brood was responsible for Kitty's kidnapping and that, if they failed and were made into Broods themselves, the other four would be needed to help defend the planet should the Brood or other alien foes of the team try to invade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later and Kitty had finally given up, deciding to accept whatever was happening to her. She had gained much in that time, her belly was much larger, almost making her look pregnant. Her breasts and butt had also expanded, becoming twice as large as they were before. Her face and arms had also been subject to her weight gain, and looked thicker and softer. Her blue costume was straining against her ever expanding stomach, yet the machine kept on feeding her, filling her up with bite after bite of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod, I hope the others find me soon before I burst like an overstuffed diaper.\" Kitty thought as she kept loudly gulping down the food, swallowing a large piece of custard cream pie followed by a large chili cheeseburger, three ham sandwiches, six glazed doughnuts, four brownies and a large ice cream sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine kept feeding Kitty even more food. Cake, sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, pizza, cookies, doughnuts, ice cream, chocolate, tacos and other foods kept pouring into her gullet. She lost track of time, as her body started to grow ever fatter. Her belly had grown so much that it had long since started spilling out of her pants, over her waistband. Her arms and legs looked like inflated balloons, and kept growing as piles of fat continued to stack on her. Her breasts were the size of basketballs, and though she couldn\u2019t see it, she knew her butt was much larger. Her face had also developed a double chin. She looked at her new expanded body, and thought, \u201cI am gonna kill those Brood for this when I get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard some crashing from somewhere close, and soon, Storm, Wolverine and Colossus came into the room. Once they finished up the Brood guarding her, they made their way over to Kitty and removed the hose from her mouth. As she swallowed the last of the food in her mouth, she gave a large belch, becoming slightly embarrassed by it. However, none of the others said a word, as they slowly lifted and pulled the obese Kitty out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she struggled to walk due to her thick legs, she had to rely on the others as support as she got used to her plump legs. Finally, she gave up and turned to Colossus, saying, \u201cCan you just carry me? It\u2019ll be a lot faster that way.\u201d He then lifted her up and started to run out of the room, but as they rounded the next corner, they saw their path blocked by even more Brood.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou should stay here, Katya. We will handle this,\u201d Colossus said as he put Kitty down. However, she was not going to just sit out of this fight, so she stood up with some effort and ran into the fight, huffing and puffing, her large gut jiggling and bouncing, already seeing sparks of lightning and what looked to be sliced off arms of Brood. As she phased through everything in front of her, she made her way to a few in the back. Turning solid, she tried throwing a punch, but due to her new girth, she threw more than the punch, falling forward and tumbling into the Brood. \u201c Okay, that works,\u201d she thought as she continued to run into Brood, toppling them down with her weight, and pinning them to the ground with her massive belly, before giving a swift punch to the face of each Brood.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this weight can help me,\u201d Kitty thought. And soon, she and the rest of her team were running over to the Blackbird, flying back to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling, Kitty?\u201d asked Storm. Kitty replied with a shrug, saying, \u201cPretty good, actually. I\u2019m thinking about keeping this fat to help me fight. Maybe I'll lose a little bit though. Also, when we get home, can we stop by someplace to eat, like maybe a few pie shops, taco restaurants and bakeries?\u201d She smiled, just as the others looked at her with a look of shock and wonder as she patted her big belly which rumbled in hunger at the thought of all that food..<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nOne month later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut the money down, and step away from the people,\u201d Kitty ordered the thieves as she phased in from the roof of the bank. In the month since being fed by the Brood, she had tried to work off some of the weight to give her more mobility, but she also retained some of the weight, training to fight with her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty\u2019s belly, while still big, was trimmed down, so that costume could at least cover most of it up. Her arms and legs were less thick, and her face looked less puffy. She had, however, retained some extra weight on her thighs and back. \u201cNow I can sit on the guys I\u2019m fighting,\u201d she had told Storm when asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fattened body, she realized, can also take some of the punches thrown her way. It also adds some extra force to her punches, kicks and overall strength. Kitty had also made a commitment to keep her weight, which made her gain a massive appetite, eating much more fatty foods whenever she got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thieves at the bank recovered from the shock of her entrance, the leader shouted to his men, \u201cShoot her fat ass!\u201d As the thieves started firing their guns at her, she ran at them, phasing through the bullets, and as she made her way towards the leader, turned solid, and tackled him to the floor, pummelling him until he put up his hands in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the police came in to arrest the thieves, she heard Colossus ask her her situation through the comms. \u201cGood,\u201d she replied, \u201cI\u2019m coming back to the mansion, and you better not have eaten all of the pizza, or I swear I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty changed back to her normal clothes and started for home. As she did, her large big belly gurgled hopefully. \"What's up, tummy? You need somethin' to tie you over until we get home and hopefully have more of that yummy cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and pineapple pizza?\" she guessed, patting it. *Grumble* *Gurgle* confirmed her tummy as it jiggled and burbled in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked around and then noticed a McDonald's nearby. \"Perfect.\" She smiled and hurried over to it. She went over to the counter and looked at the menus thoughtfully. After a moment, a young female cashier came up. \"Hi and welcome to McDonald's. What can I get for you?\" she smiled politely. Kitty smiled after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take 10 Big Macs with cheese, ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce and onion. I'd also like 6 large fries, an extra large chocolate shake, five McRibs, heavy on the sauce, and three Fillet of fish, no tarter sauce.\" She requested. The girl seemed shocked by this but quickly nodded and moved to fill the order after Kitty quickly paid for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the large bags were ready. Kitty grabbed them, thanked the girl and left McDonald's humming happily as she headed for the mansion, her belly jiggling and wobbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she had reached the mansion just as she finished the last Fillet of fish sandwich and fries. Stifling a big burp, she entered the mansion and went to the kitchen, still humming one of her favorite songs as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the kitchen, she found Colossus, Rachel and Colossus' younger sister and her roommate/best friend Illyana there. They were clearly finishing up lunch as they had empty plates and glasses in front of them. Illyana noticed her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who just waddled her big butt in.\" she giggled. Kitty rolled her eyes. Illyana had been making fat jokes about her for the last month since the Brood incident. Despite this, the others knew she was only joking and so Kitty often laughed along. Kitty's favorite joke about her girth was Illyana stating that Kitty is so fat, she needs a cab just to get to the next corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Illyana. You know, if we weren't best buds I'd sit on you.\" Kitty joked as she phased partially into the fridge and located the cheese, pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and pineapple pizza her taste buds and belly were craving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I don't wanna be under your hippo butt, especially after you've eaten enough spicy Mexican food or chili to take out an army with just one of your super farts!\" Illyana laughed. She wasn't kidding about Kitty's farts either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks earlier, Kitty had eaten an entire pot of Rogue's Five-Alarm Chili for lunch and had ended up dealing with burping actual smoke (due to how hot the chili had been) and large, smelly farts. Even Wolverine was in tears from the fumes. Kitty had farted so much that day that she swore that she'd nearly pooped her pants a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. I'm hurt, Illyana. I thought we were best friends.\" Kitty whimpered dramatically. Illyana giggled as she watched Kitty take the large pizza box out of the microwave and sit down beside Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kitty, how'd the bank situation go?\" Rachel asked as she watched her friend and fellow X-Man take a large bite of pizza and slowly pull the slice away, causing the cheese to stretch out until it broke and hung from Kitty's mouth as she slurped it up while still chewing. Kitty chewed for a few minutes and then swallowed loudly before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went really good. I didn't have to sit on anyone and my awesome new strength helped me wallop those suckers into next year!\" She giggled before attacking the last few slices of pizza. \"I thought you said you were coming home right after the mission. What kept you, Katya?\" Colossus asked gently. \"Oh I got hungry and stopped at McDonald's for a 'light' snack.\" Kitty explained before belching loudly as she tossed the empty box into the recycle bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hope you didn't eat too much. We've got our dance class with Stevie today.\" Illyana reminded her. Kitty wiped her mouth and nodded. \"Thanks for reminding me.  We'd better go and get ready.\" She smiled as the duo headed for their bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStevie Hunter was a former dancer turned instructor after an injury during a performance. She'd become Kitty's dance teacher after Kitty had joined the X-Men a year prior and so knew of Kitty and Illyana's statuses as mutants. Despite this, she kept her friendship with the team and was very kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in their room, Illyana and Kitty changed into their dance leotards. While Illyana had no problems, Kitty had to struggle a bit. She had yet to order a larger leotard and had barely managed to keep this one from bursting as she got bigger. Once ready, the two BFFs set off for Stevie's studio (after Kitty made a quick pit stop to the bathroom). </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once they arrived at Stevie's studio, Kitty and Illyana met up with some of their friends there. The girls were soon chatting away about comfortable topics when another girl sauntered up to Kitty. \"Well, well, well, Pryde. Looks like someone's been hitting the market a little too much lately.\" she smirked, poking Kitty's large belly. Kitty just glared at her. \"What do you want, Blaire?\" she asked in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just wanted to see the class' fat little piggy before today's lesson. Wouldn't want our porky girl to become pooped during class.\" Blaire said with a superior smirk. \"I'd rather be big and fat than a skinny, twiggy pompous jerk like you!\" Kitty replied, forcing Illyana to quickly grab hold of her obese BFF's arms and restrain her as Blair laughed in superior amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ignore her, Kitty.\" said another girl, an African-American girl named Lesha. \"Yeah. Blair thinks she's so hot 'cause she has money, powerful parents and mansion.\" agreed another girl, this one a Chinese-American named Kumiko. Kitty smiled at her friends as Stevie arrived to begin the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the today's lesson progressed, Kitty handled it rather well. Though pretty heavy and out of shape, she could still dance surprisingly well with her blubbery girth. However, she should've known things wouldn't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty performed a twirl, she felt her left slipper slide along the floor. \"Woooooaaahhhhhh!!\" She yelped as she lost her balance and fell with a heavy THUD on her butt, causing her body to jiggle like a large bowl of Jell-O. Some of the girls, mainly Blair's posse, snickered while Illyana, Stevie and the others all winced in sympathy. Blushing as red as a giant tomato, Kitty quickly heaved herself up and resumed her dance routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the slip, things went normal until the end. Kitty finished her dance neatly and smoothly. \"Well done, Kitty!\" Stevie smiled as the others, except Blair and her cronies, cheered, applauded and smiled in agreement. Kitty, panting slightly, smiled and took a deep bow. But as she did, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Kitty's leotard could no longer handle the strain of stretching so much and ripped right down the middle of her butt, exposing her panties to the class. Immediately, she shot back upright, hands covering the giant hole, her face bypassing tomato red and going full blown deep maroon. No one spoke for a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Blaire howled with laughter. \"Guess you better lay off the snacks and buy a bigger leotard, Pryde! I bet a car seat place has your pattern on file!\" she snorted, causing her posse to howl in delight as well. Kitty didn't say anything. She just turned, grabbed her stuff and raced out as fast as her thick, plump legs and feet could take her, sobbing as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite growing very tired as she did, Kitty didn't stop running until she reached the mansion and flopped onto her bed, sobbing loudly into her pillow, resulting in it becoming soaked from her sweat and tears. Lockheed, her pet dragon, gently landed beside her and nuzzled her face, whimpering slightly. \"Oh L-Lockheed! I'm so embarrassed! Not only did I slip and fall in class, but I also split my leotard, exposing my undies to everybody!\" She wailed before burying her face into her sopping wet pillow again, her shoulders shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she heard Illyana returning. \"Are you okay?\" Illyana asked gently as she sat down beside her friend. Kitty's face was blotchy from crying and her eyes were still red, but she had calmed down. \"Yeah. I'm feeling okay now.\" she sniffled, blowing her nose loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaire's been kicked out for a few weeks.\" Illyana revealed. Kitty looked up in surprise. \"Why?\" she asked. \"Lesha and Kumiko told Stevie about Blaire's insults after you left and Blair wouldn't shut up about you ripping your leotard during your bow. So Stevie told her not to come back until she learns to grow up.\" Illyana smiled. Kitty smiled as she wiped her eyes one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd Stevie say about everything?\" she asked. Illyana was quiet for a moment before answering. \"She said she'd order you a new stretchy leotard. Since she knows about what happened last month with the Brood, she figured you'd like that since you've decided to stay fat.\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I would.\" Kitty smiled as she looked at her best friend and roommate. \"Stevie also said she'd like you to meet her for lunch tomorrow at noon.\" Illyana added. Kitty nodded and grinned. \"I'd like that.\" she smiled. \"Stevie also said she knows a place you'll like. She'll pick you up here and take you to it.\" Illyana smiled as she hugged her best friend. Kitty nodded again. Then, she looked at the alarm clock. It read 3:45.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better get a move on! Wolvie and I have a Danger Room session at 4!\" She yelped as she quickly got up and pulled on her Shadowcat costume before phasing down to said room for the session as Illyana watched with a grin.</span></div></div>",

Logan was already there, clad in his brown and yellow costume. \"Hey, Logan.\" Kitty wheezed slightly, bending down and touching her knees as she caught her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're alright, Punk'in. Illyana told us 'bout what happened at dance class this afternoon.\" Wolverine replied. \"Oh. Okay. So... what're we doin' today?\" Kitty asked after a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured we'd see how yer current weight affects your agility and fightin' skills.\" Logan explained as he allowed Kitty to enter the room first. Once they had entered the Danger Room, Logan turned to Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let's see you run through this obstacle course. You've got twenty minutes ta do it.\" Logan said, nodding to the course. Kitty bravely went to the starting line. Then, \"GO!\" Logan barked, starting his watch. Kitty took off quickly, her jumbo belly jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an obstacle course she'd run with Logan and the others before. You had to dodge lasers by zig-zagging or dodging them anyway possible before testing your leg muscles by jumping over hurdles, swing on a rope over a small pool of water and other items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty plowed on, determined not to let her girth ruin her record at this course. She evaded all the lasers with no problem, cleared all but one hurdle (her boot caught onto it and she took a massive belly flop as a result), and did everything very well. She finished the course, sweating, huffing, puffing, wheezing and red in the face, but smiling. Logan was grinning too as he eyed the stopwatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Pun'kin. Ya beat your own record!\" Logan revealed as he showed her the stopwatch. Kitty's previous time on the course had been 18.20 minutes, the highest out of all the X-Men and New Mutants who did the course except for Logan and Storm. But now, the stopwatch read  18.09 minutes! Kitty couldn't believe it. She just kept gulping air and panting in between gulps as she grabbed her water bottle and guzzled half of it before she managed to answer. \"Thanks... Wolvie...\" she panted as she took another large swing of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now, let's see how ya can handle these robots.\" Logan smirked as he pushed a button and six large robots appeared. They were rather big and powerful looking. Kitty smiled as she squared off as the robots lunged for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Kitty phased through the final robot, short circuiting it and causing it to collapse on its' face. The other robots were either completely destroyed or otherwise depowered. \"How was that, Logan?\" she smiled. Logan just smirked. \"Kid, I think ya can still handle yerself in a scrape, even with your current weight.\" He chuckled, patting Kitty on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty smiled and went to get her water bottle. Once in the locker rooms, she got undressed and took a nice, hot relaxing shower, allowing the water to run over her large, obese body. After a while, she climbed out and dried off before squeezing herself into a tight yellow t-shirt and green sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to go and see if dinner was ready yet since it was almost dinnertime now. Concentrating hard, Kitty slowly walked up through the ceiling and into the main hallway. She then happily skipped towards the kitchen for a big dinner. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty soon arrived in the kitchen to find Storm cooking away. Ever since Kitty had decided to keep the weight the Brood had ballooned her up to, she'd been eating larger and larger meals. Right now, Storm was busy cooking a large butterball turkey, a large basket of biscuits, five trays of corn on the cob, seven pies and a giant bowl of mashed potatoes. Kitty couldn't help it and started to drool hungerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm happened to turn around and noticed her youngest teammate watching with wide eyes and her tongue hanging out of her mouth. \"Hello, Kitten. Dinner is almost ready.\" smiled Ororo, knowing why Kitty was eying the food like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. 'Cause I'm starvin'!\" Kitty smiled licking her lips loudly as she rubbed her hands together. Ororo smiled as she carried the food out to the table in the dining room. Kitty tried to help, but Storm just smirked. \"I know you Kitten. You would eat all the food on the plate or tray before reaching the table.\" she explained when Kitty looked at her in bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everything was ready and the X-Men and New Mutants gathered around for the meal. Kitty sat beside Rachel, Colossus and Illyana. As the turkey was passed around, Kitty eagerly grabbed two large drumsticks. She also took at least six corn on the cob and a giant blob of mashed potatoes. No one said anything as they watched Kitty start eating. She tore through the cobs like crazy, cleaning all six in seconds. She then plopped a large spoonful of mashed potatoes into her mouth, moaning in delight as she stuffed a second one in before swallowing loudly and repeating this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the X-Men or New Mutants moved as they just kept watching. \"An' Ah thought Blob was the only one who eats like a hog!\" Rogue remarked quietly from beside Storm, who smiled slightly at the comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we say something?\" Nightcrawler asked, eyeing Kitty as she grabbed a drumstick and tore a very big chunk off, bulging her cheek as she chewed loudly, licking and smacking her lips and fingers after polishing both drumsticks off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna try, Elf, be my guest.\" Logan smirked as they watched Kitty continuing to make a pig of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a biscuit, Kitty?\" Rachel asked, handing the basket over. \"Thanks.\" Kitty smiled as she took one, only to then pour the entire basket into her mouth, making her cheeks bulgy and lumpy like a chipmunk's. Once Kitty'd swallowed them, she popped the remaining one into her mouth as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somethin's tellin' me we ain't gonna get a lot of this meal.\" Cannonball remarked quietly from beside Illyana and Sunspot, Roberto smirking slightly as Illyana merely chuckled. Finally, Kitty licked her plate clean and rubbed her giant tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBUUURRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* She belched loudly with a grin. \"Excuse me.\" she smiled as she heaved herself up and started for her and Illyana's bedroom. Once she left, the others began talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we be concerned that Kitty is eating too much now?\" asked Magma. \"No. She still works out and has lost a great deal of weight after the Brood incident.\" Storm replied. \"Not ta mention her blubber seems ta give her strength similar ta Rogue an' Petey.\" Logan added. That was true. Ever since she'd ballooned up, Kitty's strength had grown considerably. She could now lift items like a small car or fire engine with no trouble and could go up against Colossus and Rogue's strength with ease in sparring sessions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Storm and Wolverine. As rather unorthodox as Kitty's current situation is, she does seem to enjoy it and it certainly seems to have its' uses for her in a fight.\" Magneto agreed thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye. But the lass still has some drawbacks with her weight.\" Rahne \"Wolfsbane\" Sinclair countered. \"Yeah. Yesterday we went to the mall to play video games and get lunch. She had seven triple cheeseburgers with fries and a shake and she was so bloated, it took me pulling her and her powers to get her out of our booth.\" Cypher agreed, blushing at the memory of Kitty's soft, warm squishy belly on top of him when they'd hit the floor after Kitty popped free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention her accident in dance class today.\" Illyana added. The others nodded, having heard of Kitty ripping her leotard during her bow at Stevie's class when the girls came home. Luckily, Kitty already knew that they knew since Illyana had mentioned this when she was getting ready for her and Logan's Danger Room session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will not say anything at this time. As long as Kitty keeps working out and dancing, I see no problems with her girth.\" Storm decided. The X-Men and New Mutants agreed after a moment and spent the rest of the meal quietly talking amongst themselves.</span></div></div>",

Soon, Stevie's car pulled up and Kitty went over to it. \"Hi, Stevie.\" Kitty smiled as she climbed into the passenger seat. \"Hey, Kitty. How're you feeling?\" Stevie asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good. So, where're we goin'?\" Kitty asked eagerly as she buckled up. \"You'll see.\" Stevie smiled as she started the car and they set off.  The drive into the city was fairly uneventful, with Kitty and Stevie talking about this and that as they drove along. Soon, Stevie stopped the car and they climbed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked at the place in shock. It was a new swanky looking restaurant. \"Wow, Stevie. This is where we're eating?\" she asked in surprise. \"Yep. I figured this place'd be a good area to have lunch.\" Stevie beamed as she led Kitty inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was very nice looking and big. Several people were already there eating lunch. A smiling waitress brought Kitty and Stevie to their booth and handed them menus. \"So, what looks good to you, Kitty?\" Stevie smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty groaned as she looked at each item. \"Everything looks so yummy, Stevie! But I don't have enough money to pay for it.\" she sighed in dismay. Stevie chuckled as she looked at her overweight pupil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I told you I'm paying for lunch today. Order anything you want.\" she reminded Kitty. Kitty smiled mischievously. \"You're gonna  regret sayin' that, Stevie.\" she giggled as the waitress arrived again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you two decided on what to order?\" she asked. \"Yes. I'll have the chicken salad and a side of fries please.\" Stevie smiled as she handed her menu over. \"Alright. And for you, miss?\" the waitress asked Kitty. Kitty smiled at Stevie. \"I'll take the bacon cheeseburger and a large side order of fries. I'd also like some of your Yankee pot roast with stuffing...\" Kitty listed five more meals she would like as Stevie's eyes widened in shock, as did the waitress's eyes. \"...And I'll finish with two of your apple cinnamon pies.\" Kitty finished with a smile as she handed her menu over. The waitress just nodded in shock as she left to fill the order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kitty? Are you sure you can eat all that food? I mean, I know your appetite's giant now, but that seems to be a bit much for even you.\" Stevie said with concern. Kitty just smiled and tied a napkin around her neck. \"Don't worry, Stevie. I can handle this, no problemo!\" She smiled as she awaited her massive meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the duo's lunches arrived. Stevie's was what she'd asked for: a medium chicken salad with french fries. Kitty's was bacon cheeseburger with fries, a large yankee pot roast with stuffing, five cheese, ham, tomato, bacon, lettuce and mayo sandwiches and two large apple-cinnamon pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your meals, ladies.\" The waitress said as she walked away. Kitty licked her lips eagerly and then set to work pigging out on the massive feast. Stevie just watched in shock as she ate her salad. Kitty was completely demolishing her feast with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Kitty didn't answer. She just sat there, her cheeks bulging as her tummy rumbled. And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* She let out a giant burp, causing several people to look up in surprise. \"Excuse me.\" Kitty blushed as she then stuffed the whole sandwich into her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better now?\" Stevie asked. Kitty nodded as she swallowed her large mouthful of sandwich with a giant gulp. \"Uh huh. Just need to bur-\" Then she froze and screwed her face up. \"Kitty?\" Stevie asked. Kitty just grunted as she clutched her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPPOOOOOOORRRRRRRAAAAAPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!* A thunderous fart escaped her giant butt. \"Much better.\"  she giggled as she went back to eating her pies. Finally, the duo were ready to leave. Stevie was somewhat shocked by the bill, but ultimately accepted it with a smile. The duo got up and went back to Stevie's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy our lunch, Kitty?\" She asked, Kitty, who was lovingly stroking her big belly with a smile. \"Yeah. Thanks again, Stevie. I really enjoyed it.\" Kitty smiled as they arrived at the institute. \"I'll have your new leotard ready by next week.\" Stevie smiled as they hugged, Kitty's blubber squishing against Stevie's trim belly. \"Thanks.\" Kitty smiled as she climbed out of the car and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, she went to her and Illyana's bedroom. Lockheed was there, calmly sitting on her bed. \"Hey boy. Were you a good dragon?\" Kitty cooed to him. Lockheed yipped and wagged his tail as Kitty stroked his head before sitting next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a really good lunch today boy.\" she smiled as he crawled into her lap and curled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the alarms went off. Kitty jumped up in surprise, forcing Lockheed to use his wings, otherwise he would've taken a spill to the floor. \"Better get ready.\" said Kitty as she tugged on her Shadowcat costume. It was a bit snug due to her pig out, but it would need to do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then phased downstairs to the meeting room. Magneto, Rachel, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Wolverine and Storm were already there. \"What's the problem?\" Kitty asked. \"There is an attack occurring in downtown.\" Magneto said promptly. \"Who?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" </span></div></div>",

Mystique, Destiny, Blob, Pyro, Spiral, Avalanche and Spider-Woman were all attacking the New Salem Mall. The team had once been terrorists, but had since cut a deal with the government to become agents. However, it seemed they had decided to go AWOL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must stop them.\" Storm said. With that, Magneto, Kitty, Nightcrawler, Rachel, Wolverine, Rogue, Colossus and Storm set off to stop Freedom Force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, they found that Avalanche and Pyro had used their powers to create a barrier, making a fortress of sorts inside the mall. Spiral was on lookout while Mystique, Spider-Woman and Destiny looted several stores and took hostages while Blob went to the third floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Rogue you will handle Blob. Wolverine and Nightcrawler, you two can deal with Spider-Woman. Storm will take Mystique. Rachel, you will free the hostages. Colossus you will try and break down the barrier and I will evacuate the remaining workers and shoppers not yet captured.\" Magneto ordered promptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha Mags.\" Logan said as they prepared. \"Wait. Who's gonna take Spiral?\" asked Rachel suddenly. \"I can.\" Kitty said promptly. \"Alright. Just be careful Kitten.\" Storm said as she watched her obese friend and teammate head to the second floor via walking on air, belly, boobs, hips and booty jiggling as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching the second floor unnoticed by the FF, Kitty slowly made her way towards the spot beneath her where she knew Spiral was. The only thing separating them now was the floor/first floor ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked down at her big body and got an idea that made her smile. She phased through the floor and then went solid, allowing herself to fall. Spiral only had time to look up and see a massive blue butt falling for her. Not only was she too shocked to teleport in time, there was also no time for her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOoommmmppphhh!\" Kitty grunted as she crushed Mojo's teleporter and right hand woman under her jumbo booty. Spiral was incapacitated and Kitty now had a different challenge: getting off the six armed villainess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wolverine and Kurt were fighting Spider-Woman. Despite being fairly new to the villainess game, the new Spider-Woman was proving to be no pushover. Kurt and Logan were only just able to counter her web lines and physical attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Storm was fighting Mystique in hand-to-hand combat. Both were proving to be equally matched, though Storm was somewhat quicker than Raven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny stood back and watched. Due to being blind, she usually didn't intervene physically. Instead she used her future predicting power to help the best she could. But right now, with Mystique and Storm moving around so much, she couldn't get a clear reading of the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Colossus was busy crashing his way through the still very thick barriers. Though he was making good progress, it was taking him forever to get through it entirely due to Avalanche and Pyro making an even thicker wall behind the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was nearby, using her telekinesis to free the tied up hostages from their bonds. When each one was freed, they quickly began helping Rachel free the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagneto was evacuating the still free guards, shoppers and workers, using his powers to protect them from Avalanche and Pyro's attempts to capture them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blob was (naturally) making his way to the third floor food court. Rogue was already there, just sitting calmly at an abandoned table, unafraid of the 510 pound mutant. Rogue then got an idea as she watched Blob lumber towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her glove off, she leapt onto Blob, absorbing his power and knocking him out cold. Rogue then felt a massive change coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty managed to finally heave her obese body off the still unconscious Spiral and slowly made her way towards the fortress.  </span></div></div>",

Let the snacking continue!\" She smiled, licking her lips as she grabbed a carton of ice cream and poured it into her mouth while grabbing another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma smirked as Kitty kept eating.

Kitty just smiled and buried her face into the rest of the large cake, eating like a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours seemed to just fly by as the duo ate and ate and ate and ate and ate. Finally, Karma was much bigger than before and Kitty was getting closer to being the same size as her friend. Karma, however, didn't want her too. She only wanted Kitty to know hunger and not end up immobile as her. \"I'd better take my hunger out of her otherwise she's gonna need help movin' around too.\" she decided as Kitty devoured an entire basket of large buttery biscuits in one go, her belly now hanging over the waistband of her tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

A very bloated Shadowcat was eating like crazy, her belly jiggling as she did so and she didn't even seem to notice her obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?!?!? Karma? What's happened to Kitty?!?!?\" Ororo demanded to know in disbelief as Kitty devoured an entire ham in just a few bites before loudly chugging more soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted Kitty to experience the same hunger I've been facing so I gave her some of mine. Don't worry. I'm gonna take it out of her right... now!\" Karma explained as she quickly pulled her hunger from Kitty. The second she did, Kitty let out a large burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUURRRRRRPPPPPP!!* Ugh... man, what happened?\" Kitty groaned, rubbing her head. Then, she noticed her very large, squishy, jiggly belly poking out of her costume's jacket. Her hips and butt were also bigger, her face was round and doughy, her boobs had gone up a few sizes, her arms, legs, feet, hands, fingers and toes were all plump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Karma?!?!? What happened to me?!?!?\" She asked, poking her large belly, causing it to gurgle loudly. \"Um... well... I kinda used my powers to give some of my hunger to you.\" Karma sheepishly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!? You brainwashed me to become fat!?!?!?\" Kitty shrieked, only to clutch her belly as it rumbled ominously. \"No! I-I just wanted you to understand the level of hunger I'm facing right now! I mean, you pack food away like crazy and don't seem to either gain a pound or even think about it!\" Karma protested. \"I am sure her intentions were noble, Kitten. Though they were a bit misguided.\" Ororo said gently. Kitty frowned, but then sighed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, Ororo. Karma, I'm sorry if I didn't understand your hunger pains. Boy, I sure do now! *Brrraaaapppp!*\" She smiled, letting out another giant burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you seemed to enjoy our pig out.\" Karma smiled. \"Yeah. Somethin's tellin' me I'm gonna need to have a few extra Danger Room sessions to lose this blubber.\" Kitty giggled, poking her gurgling, rumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure they will only be for a few weeks, Kitten. Then you'll be slim and trim again.\" Storm smiled. \"Would you like to start now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Kitty smiled. But then, *RUMBLE* *GURGLE* GLOOORRRRRPPPP* *SLOSH* *GGGURRRRGGGGLLLLEEE* Her belly let out five alarming tummy noises. \"Uh, actually Ororo\u2026 could I take a raincheck? My tummy's got other plans!\" Kitty whimpered. \"Certainly.\" Ororo smiled as Kitty, despite being rather bloated, turned and raced for the bathroom where Storm and Karma heard her puking a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Storm's theory about Kitty's dieting and exercising worked and Kitty was back to her slim, trim fighting form within two weeks. Though Kitty's new larger appetite remained, she was careful not to extremely overdo it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, the entire X-Men outright objected such a forced notion, but it wasn't something that even the famed heroes could do a thing about, for it was the choice that Kitty's parents had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with sorrow in her heart, Kitty was left with little alternative but to say a saddened farewell to the people she fondly referred to as her \"second family\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Present Day ==<br>\r\n== Two Weeks Later ==<br>\r\n== England ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding just outside of the local airport, Kitty, dressed in an overcoat with a fashionable hat, holding her suitcase in both hands, as the stereotypical English rain downpour around her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What Kitty Pryde had soon witness was quite an...<i>\"unusual\"</i> sight to behold, as the heavyset blonde calmly and gracefully exited the vehicle, appearing before the smaller brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. Aren't you such an adorable cherub?\" She chirped, taking note of the young Pryde's adorably petite physique, a subtle twinkle in her sapphire blue eyes. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, Kitty took a substantially long moment or two, gazing over the entire physical appearance of the woman standing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the blonde woman had this air of <i>\"Nobility\"</i> and <i>\"Elegancy\"</i> to her, especially with her all-white ensemble and flowing ivory cape with the fur collar around her shoulders. However, in contrast to the woman's choice of attire, there was a far more notable aspect about her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight and overall size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Kitty would guess, the woman had to at least weigh in at approximately the four-hundred pound mark, with nary a sign of dimpling or unsavory blemish in sight. The woman had these wealthy plump breasts, which pressed against her corset-like one-piece clothing, which was only surpassed by the woman's substantial yet matronly boulder of a belly. However, Kitty couldn't help but feel like something felt...<i>off</i>, regarding what she was wearing underneath such expensive clothing, but it was a mere thought for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...E-Excuse me? Are...A-Are you Miss Emma Frost? The headmistress of the, um...\" Kitty stammered, looking back at the brochure to properly ascertain the school's full name then continued, \"...The Academy of the Order of the Friars of Saint Francis of Wycombe? ...I-I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> It is quite alright, my dear.\" Emma retorted, reassuring the younger woman of her shyness, to which she then performed a small curtsy and elaborated, \"...And to answer your question, I am indeed Emma Frost. Headmistress of Wycombe Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like a lioness circling it's prey, Emma Frost looked over Kitty  from nearly every angle with eyeing curiosity, to which she then asked, \"...And if I must wager a guess, you must be the lovely Katherine Pryde, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yes. Yes I am, Miss Frost. B-But...M-My friends call me \"Kitty Pryde\". If, um...I-If that's okay with you.\" She timidly answered, obviously feeling a little tense due to being examined in such a manner by a person she had no familiarity with. Of course, Emma Frost couldn't help but become quite amused with the young woman, to which she then reassured, \"Quite the adorable name, my dear. And please...You can call me \"Emma\", if it makes you feel more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...O-Okay.\" Kitty complied, and like a mother coddling her child, Emma Frost calmly and gently guided Kitty towards the limousine as she said, \"...Do not fret, my dear Kitty. I'm most certain you will be quite at home in Wycombe Academy. Now, what do you say we get out of the rain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I would like that.\" Kitty answered, being personally escorted by the rotund Emma Frost. However, she couldn't figure out what exactly was making all these <b>*rustling*</b> and <b>*crinkling*</b> noises, despite being in close proximity with said sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost allowed Kitty to enter the vehicle first, only to then enter inside herself, making sure her elegant ivory cape was not caught when the door was closed. And with that, the chauffeur proceeded to return to the driver's seat to escort his charges back to the illustrious Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Kitty couldn't believe how...extravagant, it was inside the limo. Looking at her interior surroundings, she soon noticed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though, it was there that Kitty Pryde soon caught a gaze at the newest individual in proximity within the luxury vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her appearance and vocal accent, Kitty could very easily tell that this person was undoubtedly Scottish, sporting a short mane of fiery red hair, as well as an equally heavyset physique, albeit not as vast as the headmistress, but enough to be distinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, instead of a lavish ensemble like Emma Frost, the Scottish redhead wore a one-piece schoolgirl-esque uniform, complete with a plaid skirt. Speaking of the lavishly dressed Emma Frost, she soon sat beside Kitty, just as the limousine began to move, to which the rotund blonde then quipped, \"Come now, Rahne. Surely, you haven't forgotten about the arrival of your new roommate already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roommate?\" Kitty questioned, initially flabbergasted at how she was going to have a roommate, only for the ivory-dressed woman to compensate, \"My sincerest apologies, Katherine! I should've told you sooner! Anywho, allow me to introduce you to your new roommate-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rahne Sinclair's me name! So...\" Rahne interjected, to which she then got really close to Kitty, whilst the sudden <b>*crinkling*</b> filled Kitty's hearing once more, as the feisty redhead then blurted, \"...Whit kinda d'you hae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" She rebutted, becoming quite confused as to what exactly she was talking about. Meanwhile, Emma Frost couldn't help but chuckle some from Rahne's feisty curiosity, obviously finding amusement towards the Scot girl's child-like wonder. Of course, she soon stepped in and retorted, \"Again my apologies, Katherine. Though, to put it simply...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Emma Frost began to use her telepathic abilities to converse with Kitty, as she telepathically continued, \"...She is simply curious about your Mutant abilities is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction, Kitty was completely taken by surprise, quickly putting two and two together, which ultimately culminated in her gleefully yelping, \"You...Y-You're Mutants! You're just like me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Indeed we are, Katherine.\" Emma replied, a plump gloved hand gesturing over towards Rahne, only for Kitty to bear witness to a surprising metamorphosis. In appearance, Rahne's body began to take on more lupine features, as reddish-brown fur began to grow and sprout from every part of her body, which gave her short fiery red hair to look more akin to an exaggerated wolven mane. Her teeth sharpened into a pair of lupine fangs, as her fingernails became a pair of claws on each hand, along with a short canine tail floofing out from behind, with her legs becoming digitgrade to cap it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Kitty couldn't help but be amazed by the sight before her, as Rahne mock howled at an imaginary moon to sell the look, to which Emma then coyly teased, \"Down, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever ye say, Teach!\" Rahne complied, just as swiftly reverting back to her human form, where it was soon Kitty Pryde's turn to speak, with only astonishment in her voice while she asked, \"This is amazing! But...I-I don't understand, Miss Frost. Are you like Professor Xavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> ...In a way. I suppose you can say I am England's equivalent of Charles Xavier, my dear Katherine. Right down to being the proud owner and headmistress of an illustrious academy, no less. Now...\" She explained, laying the truth the bear before Kitty, to which she then presented a bountiful spread of cuisines before the brunette and politely asked, \"...Would you like something suitable to eat? I have a guess that the food provided to you on the plane wasn't as substantial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it would be rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty chirped, grabbing a few steaming scones, taking a bite out of them one after the other. \"Mmm! These are pretty good!\" She chirped, her tastebuds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst Kitty was busy stuffing her gullet, Emma Frost watched as the baked treats began to slowly work on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, <i>\"Hmm... She has begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become...\"acquainted\", with the new meat on your bones in due time, along with a surprise or three as well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Emma Frost blocked her mind off from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who appeared as if she was in a gluttonous trance, scarfing down several handfuls of sweets at a near breakneck pace. Of course, such binging was bound to show itself on the young Pryde's physical form, as her stomach began to slowly but surely bloat and expand outwards, yet not enough to stick out a great deal to be conspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Emma contemplated how this school year will be quite...<i>\"unique\"</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wise men would say that <i>\"A lot can transpire in the span of a week\"</i>. Though, she certainly didn't expect THESE kinds of changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of it good, while some of it was legitimately bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first arrived at Wycombe Academy, the first thing she noticed right off the bat was how...<i>\"Substantially endowed\"</i> all the female students and some of the female staff were, along with unsubtle hints of what could be underneath their specifically designed attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't all bad. After all, she and Rahne quickly became fast friends, not just outside of class. Plus, Kitty soon found out that she was transferred into a school for Mutants, similar to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, but in England. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, much to her own personal shame, Kitty began to experience this bad case of bedwetting, always waking up with soaked bedsheets. At first, she tried to disguise this source of shame from her new best friend/roommate out of attempting to preserve her personal dignity. Of course, having the abilities of a wolf, Rahne was easily able to discover her bestie's wetting predicament. In fact, they made a deal regarding Kitty's \"issue\", as the young Pryde recalled her friend's words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look, Kitty. I understand the shame of wetting the bed, so I'm not going to judge ye. However, if it starts getting bad, we're gaunnae hae to blether this to Headmistress Frost aboot yer...\"issue\". Okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bedwetting wasn't the only change in her daily regiment she had undergone, as Kitty stood before her pee-stained bedsheets, now sporting a somewhat chubbier physique, complete with a small but developing potbelly, fuller breasts, plumper butt, and the subtle beginnings of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there in her nightgown, with her panties dampened some in the front. Suffice to say, it felt rather embarrassing for her. Fortunately, her new best friend was there to console her, to which the redheaded Scottish Mutant then asked, \"Dae ye want to head to Miss Frost's office, lassie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Headmistress Emma Frost's Office ==<br>\r\n== 10 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, within the bowels of her personal office, adorned with numerous trophies and shelves full of works of literature, Emma Frost was looking over some of the student records, inspecting to see if their educational grades were up to snuff, a plump gloved finger tapping against the mahogany oaken surface of her lavish study. That is until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a series of rattling knocks at her double doors, to which she promptly answered, \"You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with such permission granted, Rahne and Kitty soon entered their Headmistress's proverbial lair, with Rahne hauling in the rolled-up bedsheet from Kitty's bed slung over her shoulder. From there, the duo swiftly closed the doors behind them to allow some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost soon diverted her full attention upon the two roommates, keenly gazing upon them with intent, to which she chirped, \"Ah, Miss Pryde and Miss Sinclair! To what do I owe the pleasure from you two lovely ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Teach... We hae to blether to ye aboot something. It's important.\" Rahne retorted, her Scottish slang prevalent as ever. From there, she then unfurled the bedsheet before the heavyset headmistress, thus revealing the full truth to the leader of Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see your point, Miss Sinclair. I take it that this is your bedsheet, Katherine?\" Emma calmly hypothesized, to which Kitty reluctantly and timidly nodded her head in confirmation, obviously quite embarrassed by her current predicament, meekly uttering, \"...Y...Y-Yes, Miss Frost. I...I-I-I don't know wh-what's going on w-with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing her newest student feeling so ashamed of herself, Emma calmly stood up from her wheeled chair, waddled over towards the embarrassed Kitty, to which the <b>*crinkling*</b> sounds filled the air once more. From there, she placed her plump gloved hands upon Kitty's shoulders, then quickly pulled her into a matronly embrace, akin to a mother coddling her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I am terribly sorry for this, my dear. You have my utmost sympathies.\" She caringly whispered, showing her sympathy towards the young girl. But then, as if it was preordained in her mindset, the bloated blonde, now with a reassuring smile across her lips, looked back at Kitty and said, \"...You know, I believe I may have a solution to your <i>predicament</i>, my dear. ...If you are willing to make a few necessary changes to your lifestyle, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Kitty swiftly looked back at the headmistress, a glimmer of hope in her eyes, to which she instinctively hugged Emma Frost, despite her arms not fully reaching around the woman's body, and chirped, \"Thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, if it will allow you to be more at ease, please follow me.\" The larger woman quipped, to which Kitty followed suit, unaware of what the headmistress had in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 5 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, after waiting out in her study, Rahne was soon re-greeted by the return of Emma Frost and Kitty Pryde. However, the Scottish redhead easily noticed what was newly different about her new bestie, as Kitty fidgeted a bit in her new puffy undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...M-Miss Frost? Are...A-Are you sure about these...<i>things</i>? They're very bulky.\" She asked, noting with clear clarity at how thick and padded the diaper she now wore actually was, as she could easily feel how the padding positioned between her legs forcibly pushed her legs apart some, giving her a semi-noticeable waddling gait, as well as making her butt appearing to have doubled in size.</span></div></div>",

Indeed ye will, Kitty!\" Rahne quipped, obviously trying to reassure her bestie that wearing such bulky diapers wasn't all bad as she thinks it will be, to which she cheekily handed Kitty a more <i>fitting</i> Academy uniform. Of course, Kitty then reluctantly shrugged, as she then began to undress out of her nightgown in order to don her school attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...With all due respect, Miss Frost, but...A-Are these REALLY necessary? Something feels...<i>off</i>.\" Kitty asked, as she began to equip the one-piece uniform shirt onto her body, still feeling a bit uneasy considering what was transpiring. However, becoming rather sympathetic towards the younger brunette's apprehension of the whole situation, Emma let out a empathetic sigh, then inevitably confessed, \"<b>*sigh*</b> ...Well, I suppose it won't do harm to tell you the truth, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...What are you talking about?\" She questioned, becoming rather confused as to what exactly Emma was going on about, only to then feel the bloated blonde waddle over to her to do up the button flap on her onesie-like uniform shirt. From there, while she carefully and properly dressed Kitty, Emma Frost then calmly elaborated, \"Now, I'm not entirely sure how to properly put this into words, but...Katherine; This school...has a curse attached to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cursed? Come on, Miss Frost. There are no such thing as curses.\" Kitty scoffed, as she felt the larger woman button up the diaper flap on her onesie-esque shirt, thinking that the headmistress was pulling her leg. However, it was Rahne's turn to chime in as she chirped, \"I'm afraid it's naw wee ghost story laddies and lassies tell each other around the campfire. What dae ye think we're wearing under our uniforms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what her best friend and roommate just told her, Kitty was struck with a surprising revelation, her noting the crinkly bulges around the waistlines of both the headmistress and her bestie, hearing the enciting <b>*rustle*</b> and <b>*crinkle*</b> noises from the motions made by both individuals chafing about. Finding the right words to say to them, Kitty eventually spoke up and questioned, \"...H-How long has it been like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Emma looked back towards the diapered Kitty Pryde, to which she promptly responded to her question via plainly answering...</span></div></div>",

Finally, she looked at Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So is that why we gotta wear-\" she began, nodding to her thick diaper. Emma and Rahne both nodded. \"I'm afraid so, Katherine. Ever since new students arrived, we have been plagued by bedwetting and messing ourselves, myself included.\" Emma confessed gently, nodding to her large diaper. Kitty didn't say anything as she poked her diaper through her onesie uniform. Then, she turned to her roommate, classmate and bestie. \"R-Rhane, was it this bad for you?\" She asked.

Emma and Rahne both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid so, Kitty. I thought when we leave for holidays and whatnot, it would fade away. But I was proven wrong after Christmas my first year here when the girls and teachers all revealed that they had wet and pooped themselves repeatedly, forcing them to keep their diapers on at all times, unless they managed to reach the loo or were already in it.\" Emma explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but curses can be broken, can't they? W-what if we learn how the curse came to be and if it can be destroyed?\" Kitty offered. But both Rahne and Emma shook their heads. \"I fear it would not work, Katherine. We have been trying for a year to figure out the curse and it's weaknesses, but have come up with nothing.\" Emma confessed gently. Kitty honestly felt like bawling her eyes out. She was just 13 and a half, she couldn't need diapers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Emma looked at the clock. \"And on that note, girls, I do believe it is time for breakfast.

I'm so starved I could eat a horse!\" Rahne smiled eagerly. Kitty nodded in agreement, her potbelly gurgling in equal hunger. Though, secretly, Kitty was wondering about the curse and how worse it would get as she stayed at Wycombe.</span></div></div>",

Wha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye alright, Kitty? Ye were spacin' out on me.\" Rahne asked, showing obvious concern toward her bestie, placing a hand on the girl's shoulder. In response, with the audible <b>*crinkling*</b> noises emanating from her own bulky diaper filling her ears, Kitty blushed and ultimately confessed, \"...I-I'm sorry, Rahne.

In appearance, much like the headmistress herself, the teen girl sported a flowing mane of straight golden blonde hair, with shimmering blue eyes. However, much like the entire student body and school staff, she too wasn't spared from sporting a more chubbier physique and equally padded undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was in the midst of devouring a platter full of jelly-filled sprinkled donuts for breakfast, only to then hear an all too familiar voice, \"Oi! Illy! Yoo-Hoo!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tables across from her, she easily became aware of a certain Scottish Mutant's greeting, to which she responded by turning her head briefly as if to non-verbally say, <i>\"Get over here.\"</i>, to which they complied with such an answer, waddling their way over to where she was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they sat before the heavyset blonde, carrying their own assortment of sweets and edibles upon two trays for each of them. Of course, during her first week here at Wycombe, Rahne first introduced Kitty to one of her other friends, Illyana Rasputin. However, Kitty soon found out that Illyana was actually the younger sister of one of her friends back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters; Peter Rasputin, also known as \"Colossus\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, upon hearing of this, Illyana was relieved to hear that her brother was doing quite well over in America, which garnered a great deal of respect towards the young Pryde. Obviously, Illyana gave off a warming smile towards Kitty, which showed how close they've became as friends, only to then resume her binge assault on the small hill of cuisines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to strike up a friendly conversation with her, Kitty spoke towards Illyana, taking a bite out of some blueberry pancakes as well, and said, \"So, Illyana...How's it going with your training? Learned any new skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not much, Kitty. Though, I did learn how to deflect energy blasts with my sword...\" She replied, bearing a thick Russian accent, which made Kitty feel a little nostalgic in regards to Colossus. After all, despite the man's Mutant abilities of Super Strength and being to turn his skin into a flexibly hard steel-like tissue, he was a rather \"Gentle Giant\" as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Kitty was actually surprised when she first saw Illyana's Mutant ability to harness and use magic, thus garnering her the now-famous nickname \"Magik\", with the word having a \"K\" instead of a \"C\" in it. Overall, much like her nickname's namesake, Kitty became rather curious with Illyana's more supernatural abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the trio conversed for about half an hour, including the part where Kitty was now in diapers just like them, to which Illyana offered her sincerest sympathies. Eventually, their morning classes had soon begun, starting off with...</span></div></div>",

The three girls headed to the school's large gym where Betsy was waiting for them. Like most of the staff and girls, Miss. Braddock was rather obese, weighing in around 350 pounds, though she still had somewhat of a hourglass figure. She had purple hair and, like most of the staff, wore a thick diaper under her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class. Today I've decided we would go for a mile jog around campus. Don't worry, I won't be keeping time so if you need to stop, you may and as long as you at least run most of the mile, you'll get your points.\" Betsy smiled as she grabbed her clipboard and led the girls out. Once they'd warmed up, Psylocke blew her whistle to start the mile. At first, Kitty did surprisingly well, despite her slightly cumbersome waddling run due to her new diaper. However, by the half mile mark, she was wheezing and panting heavily, sweat rolling down her face. By the time the mile was finished, Kitty was among only three girls to have made it all the way. The other two being Rahne and Illyana. The second they finished, the trio flopped onto the ground, gasping, panting and moaning in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha'... was... bloody... hell!\" Rahne gulped, her tongue lolling out like a wolf as she panted heavily. \"I... agree. I... wish... Miss. Braddock would... let me... just teleport with... my... portals.\" Illyana groaned, laying on her back. \"Man... I probably... shouldn't've eaten... those last... 10 blueberry... pancakes. My belly's killing me.\" Kitty moaned in agreement. Psylocke waddled over with a smile. \"Well done, lassies. You completed the mile in good time.\" She said. Then she turned to the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies. Tomorrow we'll take an off day as most of you did manage to do most of the mile today. Let's head back in and get ready for your next class!\" She called. Huffing, puffing and groaning, the girls all started waddling to the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it lunchtime yet?\" Rahne asked hopefully. Kitty looked at her watch. \"Nope. It's only 7:50, Rahne.\" Kitty confessed with a smile as Illyana laughed as they waddled after their classmates. \"Blast. I was hopin' ta sink me teeth into a juicy hamburger with cheese, pickles, ketchup, mustard, onion and bacon!\" Rahne groaned. Both Kitty and Illyana moaned in delight at the thought, their bellies rumbling in equal delight. \"Now you've done it, Rahne. How're we gonna focus on our next few lessons while we're waitin' for lunch?\" Kitty playfully teased her bestie as they changed into their uniforms, having reached the locker room. \"Sorry Kitty. It's jost that I'm starvin'. Runnin' a blasted mile does that to me belly.\" Rahne replied as her tummy rumbled in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting changed, the trio went to their second class, which was... </span></div></div>",

Nicknamed \"Domino\" due to her black and white hair and white face with a black spot over one eye, she was a fairly cool teacher in Kitty's eyes. Similar to Emma and Psylocke, Domino was obese and diaper clad. Unlike most of the teachers and students, she wore only a t-shirt and her thick diapers in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Rahne and Illyana all found their seats at the front of the class and Domino waited until the other girls were ready before beginning her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning girls. Today we'll be covering basic geometry and algebra. Don't worry if you don't get it, I'll be happy to help you.\" she smiled kindly as she wrote a few problems on the board. The hour passed fairly quickly, with Kitty and the girls working on the problems Domino had written down for them. Finally, the bell rang and the girls got ready for their next class. \"Okay, remember girls, there'll be a quiz in two weeks so study hard!\" Domino called as they left with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty waddled with Illyana and Rahne to her next class, she let out a giant fart. \"Och! Kitty! That reeks!\" Rahne protested playfully, shoving her bestie's shoulder. Kitty blushed as she then froze, a look of pain on her face. \"Kitty? Are you alright?\" Illyana asked with concern. Kitty bent over, clutching her stomach as she squatted and started straining and grunting. A second later, with a very loud *POOOOOOOTTTTTTTTT!!!!* she pushed a large, hot, sticky and smelly load of poop into her diaper. After she finished, Kitty stood up and, upon noticing several girls looking at her aside from her besties, she went deep red. Without a word, she turned and raced away, tears of humiliation pouring down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't stop running until she reached her and Rahne's dorm room and, not even bothering with her full diaper, flopped face first onto her bed and started bawling her eyes out with loud sobs. After a few minutes, there was a knock on the door. \"Katherine, may I come in?\" Emma Frost's voice asked gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty sniffled and sat up, whining as she felt her poop squish against her plumper butt. \"C-Come *hic* in, Miss. Frost.\" she hiccupped sadly. Emma slowly waddled inside and smiled gently as she saw Kitty's bulging, poopy diaper. \"W-what's wrong?\" Kitty asked. Emma smiled as she sat down next to Kitty. \"Miss. Sinclair and Miss. Rasputin just told me what happened on your way to your next class. Are you alright?\" she explained with concern. Kitty hiccupped again before shaking her head in dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. I'm s-so e-embarrassed! I-I haven't pooped my pants since I was three! And now I j-just took a major dump in- in front of e-everyone!\" Kitty sobbed, burying her face in her hands as she kept crying. Emma gently rubbed Kitty's back reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitten. Everybody here has had a similar accident in or before a class since this curse began. I actually anticipated you would poop your diaper before or during lunch today.\" She confessed. Kitty looked at her, tears still rolling down her chubby face. \"R-really?\" she asked with one more hiccup. Emma nodded and gently hugged Kitty like a mother would a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitty. According to Miss. Rasputin, everybody was only staring out of sympathy. Not amusement or anger at you.\" She revealed. Kitty smiled despite her teary eyes. It cheered her up that her friends weren't laughing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why don't you change your nappy and take a nap? Tonight, I would like to have you eat with me in my private quarters.\" Emma smiled. \"Okay.\" Kitty sniffled as she got up and took her full diaper off and started cleaning up. \"I will tell your next few teachers that you wanted to lay down after your accident. They will understand since, like I said, this has happened before.\" Emma said reassuringly as she waddled out. \"Thanks, Miss. Frost.\" Kitty said as she taped her new diapee on and got dressed again. She then sunk onto her bed and decided on following Emma's advice about taking a nap before dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, Rahne and Illyana came in to check on Kitty as she woke up. Rahne's diaper was bulging and smelly while Illyana's was soaking wet and bulging with poop as well. \"'Ow're ya doin' Kitty?\" Rahne asked her bestie. Kitty smiled at her friend's concern. \"I'm doing much better. Thanks.\" she smiled. \"Miss. Frost told us you were having dinner with her tonight so we should make sure you don't eat too much. She said she's having the chiefs make a really big dinner a'fore the two o' ya.\" Rahne added with a smile. Kitty grinned as she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was lunch?\" she asked, having slept through it. \"It was good. Turns out Rahne's prediction about it being hamburgers was right. She pretty much licked her tray clean and you can smell the result in her diaper!\" Illyana joked with a smile. Rahne smirked and stuck her tongue out. \"Well, at least I didn't flood me nappy with pee like you did after a-drinkin' four cans of lemonade and soda!\" she retorted. Illyana blushed slightly. \"Yeah, that might not have been a good idea.\" she agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just giggled at her two besties playful jeering of each other. \"When did Miss. Frost say I should head down for dinner?\" Kitty asked after a moment as her two besties started getting changed into cleaner diapers. \"She said ye could drop in at anytime, lass.\" Rahne smiled as she finished putting a clean diaper on. Kitty nodded and, upon looking at her alarm clock, saw it was 5:56 P.M. \"Guess I should probably go now.\" she smiled nervously as she stood up. Rahne and Illyana both smiled assuredly to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinna fast yerself, Kitty. We've both had dinner with teach a'fore an' it's actually very nice.\" Rahne said as she hugged Kitty, their diapers crinkling loudly as they were pressed together. Kitty nodded, waved goodbye and waddled off to meet Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Kitty took a deep breath and did so. There was Miss. Frost, already seated at a large oak table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss. Pryde. Glad to see that you could make it.\" said Emma with a grin. Kitty nervously sat down across from Emma, her face stating that she was clearly nervous. Emma just gently patted Kitty's hand with hers. \"It is alright, Katherine. I am not going to bite your head off. I have dined with students before.\" she pointed out. Kitty blushed and nodded sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Miss. Frost. I'm just a little jittery.\" Kitty apologized. \"Perfectly understandable, Kitty. Now, I hope you enjoy our dinner tonight.\" Emma smiled as the chiefs came out with several trays of food. Hamburgers, fried chicken, steak and lobster. As well as desserts such as cake, pie, doughnuts, eclairs and all kinds of yummy treats. Kitty was so hungry, she feared she was going to start drooling over the food. Emma giggled slightly at Kitty's reaction, causing the brunette to blush deeply again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's eat!\" Emma smiled as she grabbed a large plate and started piling food onto it. Kitty quickly did the same. Once she had loaded her plate to overflowing, she used her knife and fork to cut a piece of chicken. However, to her surprise, Emma was eating a drumstick with her hands, loudly tearing chunks of meat off the bone. Upon noticing Kitty's surprise, Miss. Frost swallowed and belched loudly before smiling kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not hold you against eating like you normally do, Kitty. You must be hungry.\" Emma smiled sweetly. Kitty thought for a moment and then, dropping her fork and knife, grabbed her own drumstick and began tearing equally big chunks off it, sauce and grease smearing her face as she did. After that, she grabbed a large scone and crammed it into her mouth, chewing loudly as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it taste so far?\" Emma smiled. Kitty swallowed loudly before answering. \"This has gotta be the best meal I've ever had!\" She smiled truthfully. Unknown to the young girl, her belly was now beginning to expand more, slowly forming into a large potbelly. \"I am glad to hear it, Kitty. Now, let's eat it all before it gets cold.\" Emma smiled as she went back to stuffing her mouth with scones, burgers and other foods. Kitty nodded and quickly followed suit, cramming 3 cheeseburgers, four doughnuts and 6 scones into her mouth at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo didn't have speak anymore as they scarfed down the mountain of food like crazy. Manners were tossed out the window as they chugged, chomped, belched, hiccupped, slurped and licked their way ahead , slowly shrinking the feast down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the entire table was littered with empty plates, pie tins, pitchers and glasses. \"Well *BBBURRRRPPPP* that was a very fine meal.\" Emma smiled with a large burp as she rubbed her enormous tummy, which gurgled and sloshed happily. \"And how was your meal, Kitty?\" she asked the equally stuffed and happy 13 and a half year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP* Definitely... really yummy... Emma...\" Kitty panted after letting out an even bigger burp than Emma just had. She gently poked her now genuine gut as it gurgled in delight at being so full. \"Do you feel better?\" Emma asked Kitty as, huffing and puffing, the duo managed to stand up, sweating slightly as they did. \"Yeah I do.\" Kitty grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo then slowly waddled to the door of Emma's office. \" You should probably get back to your dorm, Kitty. It's nearly curfew and I doubt you want to be in detention on your second week here.\" Emma smiled. \"Thanks *Buuuurrrraaaappp* again for the *hic* meal, Miss. Frost. It really was awesome!\" Kitty smiled with another loud burp, this time with a hiccup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *urp* glad you *hic* enjoyed *burp* yourself Kitty *hiccup*. Now, head off to your dorm please.\" Emma smiled back, giving Kitty a fleeting hug before gently pushing Kitty towards the hallway. Kitty smiled, gave a wave, and waddled back to her dorm, burping loudly most of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRahne and Illyana were both waiting up for Kitty when she finally came in. \"Well, how'd it go, Kitty?\" Rahne asked kindly. \"It went really *uuuurrrrrpppp* well.\" Kitty smiled, unleashing another rumbling burp. \"We can see that.\" Illyana smirked, playfully poking her friend's tummy, causing poor Kitty to fart loudly again. \"Och! Seriously, Kitty. I think ya need ta see the nurse 'bout yon stinky booty!\" Rahne giggled teasingly. \"Maybe I should've passed on the baked bean burritos.\" Kitty agreed sheepishly, rubbing her belly as it gurgled and rumbled, happy to be full of such good food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio then talked for awhile before Illyana went to her dorm for the night. Rahne and Kitty got into their nightgowns, crawled into bed, bade each other goodnight and were soon sleeping soundly, Kitty often burping loudly in her sleep as she dreamed about food all night long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

Frost?\" Kitty asked nervously as she eyed the banquet. Emma smiled as she sat down across from Kitty. \"This, my young lady, is a welcome present. I figured that that airplane food wouldn't be substantial. Would you like a bite?\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess it would be pretty rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty smiled, grabbing a few steaming scones. Upon tasting the first one, she started inhaling one after the other. \"Mmm! These're pretty good!\" Kitty chirped, her taste buds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. Once she had licked the plate clean, she grabbed two chocolate glazed doughnuts and, ignoring Miss. Frost, shoved both into her mouth at once. With a rather loud gulp, she swallowed them almost whole before grabbing six more. Just as she started to inhale them, she noticed Emma watching with a smile. At this, Kitty blushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um... I-I'm sorry, Miss. Frost. D-Do you w-want some?\" She asked sheepishly. Emma chuckled and shook her head. \"It is alright, Kitty. I already had lunch and I'm quite sure you can handle this banquet on your own.\" She smiled kindly. \"Okay.\" Kitty shrugged as she then stuffed the six doughnuts into her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kitty, however, Emma Frost watched as the banquet started working on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, \"Hmmm. She's begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become... 'acquainted' with the new weight on your bones in time. Along with a surprise or three as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, Emma had blocked her thoughts from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who now seemed to be in a gluttonous trance, loudly scarfing down giant handfuls of sweets at a surprising pace. Of course, such binging was likely going to reveal itself on the young Pryde's physical form as her belly started to bloat and expand outward, not enough to stick out to be conspicuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Emma anticipated this school year to be... \"interesting\". </span></div></div>",

Rogue and Kitty both nodded. Kitty quickly got dressed into her blue costume with the eye mask while Wolverine got dressed in his shirtless orange-yellow and brown outfit and Rogue dressed in her green and black costume. Once done they headed out to save the Councilman. In Kingston's office, two of the Morlocks were standing gaurd a couple of feet away from the Councilman, when suddenly Wolverine burst through the wall, sending the two Morlocks flying but they quickly recovered Wolverine quickly attacked the largest of the two Morlocks cutting him cross the face while Rogue flew through the hole in the wall and attacked the other Morlock, knocking him down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty get the Councilman \"ordered Rogue Kitty nodded and headed for the Councilman slowly at first but upon not seeing the third Morlock, Kitty sprinted over to the young man, who was wearing a black suit. But before Kitty could reach him a female Merlock stepped out of the shadows she had black hair and scars running across her face. Kitty was about to attack her when suddenly the Morlock's blue eyes turned in to hypnotism-like swirls. Kitty felt her mind became foggy. Then she started to hear a voice inside her head while she started swaying side to side, her eyes becoming colorful swirls as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to Scar. You will do whatever I say \"said Scar inside Kitty's head. Kitty could feel bits of her mind fall away from her. Suddenly the connection was broken by Rogue kicking Scar in the head, knocking her a few feet away. She quickly got up, was grabbed by the two other Morlocks and teleport away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" asked Rogue, helping Kitty up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine \"said Kitty shaking her head. It still felt a little funny but Shadowcat decided to keep that to herself.

Thank you so much for saving me \"said the Councilman as they escorted him out of the building and into the hands of the medics. Later that night Kitty was lying in bed and her stomach suddenly rumbled. She thought it was strange since she was never hungry at this time but quickly gave into her rumbling stomach and headed down stairs making herself three peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a couple of slices of leftover pizza. After a few minutes, she left the table, feeling rather bloated and happy. </span></div></div>",

Here's the plan: Kitty, you go through the wall and get the hostages while we get the robbers.\" Ordered Wolverine. Kitty nodded and made her way to the back of the bank and walked through the wall. As she did so Kitty felt something grow rather heavy in her pants and an awful smell. As she looked at the big bulge in the back of her suit, Kitty realised that she had pooped herself. She was slightly embarrassed, but was brought out of thoughts by gunfire and quickly went to the hostages. \"Quickly, come with me \"said Kitty. The hostages scrunched up their faces at the smell, but did as they were told and Kitty quickly got them out of the building and to the safety of the police. After a couple of minutes, the rest of the group came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did getting the hostages go?\"asked Phoenix, but before Kitty could answer, she was interrupted. \"And what's that smell?\" asked Phoenix looking around, trying to find the source of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I farted.\" lied Kitty, not wanting them to know. \"But yeah it went fine.\" said Kitty with a shrug, not noticing that Rogue was giving her a \"I don't believe you look\". Later that afternoon,Kitty was changing out of her outfit, desperately wanting to get rid of her poopy outfit, she was suddenly suprised by Rogue's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So were ya plannin' on tellin' us ya pooped your pants or...\" said Rogue, making Kitty blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it's a one time okay? So don't tell anyone.\" begged Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but to make sure it doesn't happen again, Ah'm puttin' ya in diapers.\" said Rogue with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!? No!\" shouted Kitty, refusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't than Ah'll tell the others.\" said Rogue. Kitty nodded her head, not wanting the others to know and so she followed Rogue to the supermarket and Rogue grabbed a pack of thick, white Pampers diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're gonna make me wear them, can you at least get the one with flower patterns on them?\" asked Kitty with an annoyed look. Rogue just shrugged, grabbed the flower ones and paid for them. When they got home, Rogue helped sneak the diapers up to Illyana and Kitty's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do ya need help putting them on?\" asked Rogue with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" said Kitty, slamming the door on Rogue's face and quickly got changed into the first diaper. She had to admit it was pretty comfortable and she was sure she wouldn't have to wear them for long </span></div></div>",

Plus she could spend time eating instead of going to the bathroom and a big change had happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had became chubby. Her belly being big, round and jiggly and her appetite causing her to sometimes have three servings each meal. One morning Kitty woke up late and quickly got up, her orange pjs stretching over her belly. She quickly got changed into her way too tight clothes before she walked to the kitchen to see it was empty and saw a note on the table. It read \"Kitty an emergency popped up. We tried to wake you but you wouldn't wake up so we left you. Be back soon \" it read in Illyana's somewhat messy hand writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" said Kitty as her stomach let out a loud rumble. \"Better feed it.\" said Kitty, patting her belly, not notching how big it was and went over to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her options, she took out a box of left over pizza and made many different types of sandwiches to peanut butter to ham and cheese and went into a feast eating them all, getting some on her clothes. She was so busy eating, she didn't notice herself wetting her diaper until it was completely soaked. After an hour of eating, Kitty sat back rubbing her bloated belly and burped loudly just as Rogue and Illyana walked in and looked at Kitty, surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty what happened?\"asked Rogue walking over to the fridge to see it empty. \"Did you actually eat all the food?\"asked Rogue, a little upset that her teammate and friend had done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was a bit hungry.\" replied Kitty with a shrug, rubbing her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that smell?\" asked Illyana, holding her nose as the stench of Kitty's pee reached her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kitty's wearin' diapers now \"said Rogue with a smug smile on her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue!!!\" shouted Kitty a little embarrassed as her chubby cheeks turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Do you need help changing your self  ?\" Asked Illyana, a little awkward that the information she had just learned about her best friend and roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can do it myself \"said Kitty struggling to get up and waddled away, leaving the two concerned girls.</span></div></div>",

Their conversation was interrupted by Kitty walking into the room, her belly jiggling as she walked over to the table and made herself a stack of pancakes covered in syrup and whip cream and strawberry on top and sat down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what're you guys talking about?\" Asked Kitty her mouth already filled with pancakes, syrup running down her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much \" replied Rogue. \"So has anything strange happened to you lately?\" Asked Rogue, rising her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" said Kitty digging into her pancakes.

She just shrugged and followed they went down the hall and opened the door to see Kitty struggling to pull off her diaper her big belly getting in the way of her seeing what she was doing. She turned around to see Rogue and Illyana looking at her, making Kitty blush, her belly jiggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a little help with that?\" asked lllyana with a small smirk, making Kitty blush even more. Kitty thought about it for a few seconds. she was having trouble seeing what she was doing thanks to her belly but getting changed would be embarrassing but she decided it was best. Kitty simply nodded, laid down on the bed and lllyana started to change her, removing the soaked and poopy diaper and throwing it over her shoulder, with it landing in the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kitty about all the strange things at been happening to you lately... can you think of anything strange that happened to you before this all started?\" asked Rogue watching as lllyana put on a fresh diaper on Kitty.  Kitty took a couple of seconds to replay all the events that had happened over the past couple of weeks then the event with Scar popped into her mind <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when we were saving the Councilman, one of the Morlocks made me stare into her eyes then my mind went strange for a few seconds then it stopped.\" said Kitty with a smile shrug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that one was trying to mind control you but it didn't work and left you with some side effects \"said lllyana helping Kitty sit up, her belly flowing onto her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think her name was scar or something \"said Kitty rubbing her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we need to find her maybe she could fix this \"said Rogue.</span></div></div>",

It was a bit of a struggle for Kitty to fit her massive belly, getting stuck a bit. She had to use her ability to get through the window though when she got through, she let out a massive fart, causing her diaper to sag. When they walked around the hid out it wasn't long before they came across Scar. \"Hey Scar, you got to fix our friend she since you infected her mind. You can do it the easy way or the hard way.\" said Rogue, getting ready to fight just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I don't want any trouble \"said Scar putting her hands up in surrender just as she started to use her mind abilities. Suddenly Callisto and two other Morlocks teleport in to the hid out and instantly attacked. Rogue and Illyana quickly engaged two of the Morlocks. Callisto sneaked past them and grabbed Kitty before grabbing another Morlock that could teleport and before they could teleport away she looked at Scar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll deal with you later traitor \"said Callisto as her and the Morlocks teleported away leaving the three women alone  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like we are going to have to rescue Kitty.\" said Illyana, rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you. I know where their main hideout is.\" said Scar with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok how did you end up with the Morlocks anyway?\" asked Rough rising an eyebrow <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They where the first other mutants I met. What they said seemed to make sense at the time.\"  said Scar which made Rough and Illyana feel sorry for her half an hour later they end up at the main hid out and saw Callisto and the other Morlocks surrounding Kitty. All three women instantly started to attack the Morlocks. During the fight Kitty got a surprise making her mess her diaper even more and was pushed down by one of the Morlocks, making her fall in her very full, messy diaper, smearing poop all over her hippo butt. After an hour of fighting,  the Morlocks realized they where hopelessly out matched and teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" asked Illyana, helping Kitty up with a lot of effort to get Kitty on her feet <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah apart from messing my diaper.\" said Kitty. Scar quickly used her abilities to remove the mind control from Kitty's brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it \"said Scar as they went back to the mansion  Kitty still wore the diapers as she grew used to them and she was still pretty fat, not being bothered to lose the weight and scar now joined the team and lived with them becoming Kitty and Illyana's best friend.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Charles Xavier is a man with a vast knowledge and powerful psionic abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn\u2019t chance that he is the leader of the X-Men group and the leading figure in his School for gifted young\u2019s. Still, as time went on and within a seemingly period of calm he started to reflect about some tests and projects he had thought about in the past but, had never the opportunity to make them real. Specifically, he had been tinkering with the idea of seeing the effects in human/mutant relationship when physical changes were to be applied to determinate people under a specified set of condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that fateful day, as he was sitting behind his desk in the empty classroom, waiting for the next class to arrive, he saw through the window on the garden three particular persons that were chatting between themselves and thought about bringing that project to life using those girls as test subjects. The more he looked at them the more he realized they would be perfect for that personal project of his. The girls under his scrutiny were Storm, which was an omega mutant and so a major threat to most and a most useful ally to others, Rogue, a being powerful enough with her capability to drain powers and abilities from her opponents, and Shadowcat, that while not as powerful as her two friends, she still could be an annoying adversary to face with her ability to make herself insubstantial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hidden smile he opened his mind, making sure that no others around the mansion could feel what he was doing and began tampering with their minds, starting to input into them thoughts and subconscious feelings that would bring them to his ultimate goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor X had thought long and hard on what changes he could actively promote in his test subjects and reached the conclusion that, for the best results, all he had to do was to promote a sensation of well being toward being overweight in the minds of his \u2018guinea pigs\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes, girls. You shall be part of a marvelous experiment indeed. <br>\r\nNothing harmful will come to you. I\u2019ll make sure of that. Just follow my voice and do as I say\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were sitting in the garden, enjoying a moment of peaceful quiet, Ororo, alias Storm, was currently meditating trying to relax a bit after her last classroom teachings. It had been a particularly difficult one since some of her students seemed to be interested more in her body than in her teachings. For that she told herself to talk with them singularly to let them understand their mistakes. Rogue, instead was laying down on a bench, reminiscing about her past, still battling internally with the desire to be freed of her powers and the need to protect and support her allies. Still, since she couldn\u2019t have any direct contact, she wondered what she could do to enjoy life a little. Finally, there was Shadowcat, the bubbly young girl had matured somewhat and while still being a bit immature, she was getting her bearings toward being more responsible, although, she took some time to just be herself. As she was doing currently, phasing through the tree in the garden joking and kidding as she made only a portion of her body emerge from within the tree bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Xavier worked his \u2018magic\u2019 on them, none of them actually realized something was happening but, some thoughts began to circulate within their minds, changing their focus on life as it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, conflicted on how to deal with her students began to tinker with the idea of changing herself a bit, to see if with a less distractive body, her lesson could proceed more smoothly. True, she didn\u2019t want to end up unable to perform her duties but, maybe, if she were less toned her students could become more focused on what she said, instead of what she looked. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thought, it was more like a whisper carried by the wind that she managed to hear with her mind that, strangely enough, remained stuck within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, instead, as she depressed herself about her future and the need to enjoy something in life seemed to reach the conclusion that noting she could do was actually going to change her life majorly, still she could try to be less strict in certain aspects of her life, not when it came to covering her body, of course. She didn\u2019t want to have her friends in danger but, maybe, if she could act less rigidly from that moment on, she could actually find something to make her life more\u2026pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl, instead, began to feel strange, it wasn\u2019t the first time that something or someone tried to tamper with her mind, so she appear to be more focused on the sudden thought than her two friends but, still, after the briefest sensation of having someone else there with her, she seemingly forgot about that and a strange new thought seemed to snake its way into her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I wonder\u2026what'd happen to my powers if I were to occupy more space than I currently do? Could it be an advantage when I\u2019m needed to disable electronic instruments? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what if I have more mass to make my martial arts capabilities more effective?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm\u2026this might not be a bad idea after all.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three girls became more enraptured with these strange and yet, so alluring, new ideas, one of their stomachs growled, making all three of them blush simultaneously. Storm, the more motherly of them, was the first to blame herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, girls. All the stress in my classrooms is apparently getting to me. I think I\u2019ll go prepare myself something from the kitchen, just to tide me over till lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ororo stood up, both Rogue and Shadowcat agreed to the idea, joining their friend, still blushing a bit, since each thought of being the one responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah Storm\u2026\u201d Rogue stammered a bit \u201cI totally agree with you. I mean, I could use a small snack right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, girls! Alright! I mean\u2026I think I may join you for a bite\u2026must've had a too light breakfast this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls left the garden and moved into the house, Xavier kept following them in his mind, he hadn\u2019t do anything to effectively change their behavior yet, but as he had simply put some subconscious thoughts into them he was amazed by the results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I wonder if they\u2019re so susceptible to my thoughts due to my powerful abilities or if they were already having some inner thoughts of their own that simply helped my suggestion to stick through?<br>\r\nStill, it\u2019s an advantage for me, so that I can bring forward my social experiment and with them I\u2019m sure it will be a success.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs they walked through the mansion they barely met anyone around, most students were either in class or elsewhere in the garden, enjoying the wonderful weather outside. While most of the teachers were either in class or, as in Wolverine case, doing some odd jobs around. As they entered the empty kitchen, each of them seemed to move with absolute decision toward a certain destination, as if it hadn0t been a simple, momentary thought that had brought them there, but a very essential need.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStorm quickly went to the fridge, opening it and getting out from it a tub of Vanilla Ice cream, with that she filled almost completely a small bowl she took from one of the cupboards. Once the bowl was filed, she slowly placed the tub into the fridge and with spoon simply began to dig in into her small-ish snack, enjoying the taste of the cold ice cream on her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, instead, opted to open one of the many cupboard, taking out a half liter bottle of soda and a bag of chips, helping herself with few handfuls from it, before washing them down with a few sips from her bottle. In truth, she didn\u2019t really wanted to eat but, since she was convinced her body had different ideas she thought to comply with it as she waited for lunch time to roll around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadowcat, making use of her powers, simply walked through a cupboard and emerged on the other side holding a jar of chocolate chip cookies, quickly bringing one of them within her lips, stopping from pushing a second one only when her friends shot her a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Began Storm, as she cleaned the last spoonful of ice cream. \u201cThat is why cookies are so scarce in this kitchen, lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmf. And to think that I was being suspicious of Nightcrawler. Should have known it was you, all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadowcat, already one hand within the jar, turned suddenly toward Rogue, with an embarrassed and angered look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRogue! Th-That\u2019s just not fair! Wh-Why both of you are ganging up on me? I-I like these cookies, true. B-But I\u2019m no thief!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadowcat then, still holding the jar, simply let herself phase through the floor, leaving the room offended by the accusation from who she believed were her friends. As she appeared in her room, feeling anger and embarrassment, she began chowing down on the cookies as if there was no tomorrow, trying her hardest not to start crying. The other two girls, seeing Kitty\u2019s reaction, soon felt guilty and, after quickly polishing their snacks, went after her. Storm, in particular, was feeling deeply sorry for her negative outburst toward the younger girl. She knew that even the less malicious rumor could hurt others and so wanted to amend to her friend. Rogue, too was a bit ashamed of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she to negatively comment on what the others do, especially when she hadn\u2019t any evidence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two stormed out of the kitchen, a figure suddenly popped out into it, making sure that the coast was clear, before opening the cupboard and grabbing a few containers of cookies from there. Nightcrawler, hugging within his body the few containers he had snatched from the cupboards, simply vanished into thin air, teleporting himself away from there. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As both girls reached Shadowcat's room, they heard her sniffling inside and this pushed even more heavily on their hearts. Both of them knew they'd acted horribly toward Kitty, it had come out of their mouth almost immediately, the negative comments, but they didn\u2019t actually mean it. Still, their younger friend seemed to have taken the accusation rather personally and now refused to talk with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard they knocked or how loudly they asked to enter the room, Shadowcat refused to listen to them. This went on for a few minutes until, with no more patience to spare, Rogue kicked the door open, revealing the sniffling figure of Kitty, crumpled on her bed. Both girls slowly walked in until they were stopped by the crying 14-year-old girl, who assaulted them with fiery words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now!? What more do you two want? Want to accuse me of something else? What've I done to you to deserve to be treated like this? I thought you were my friends, that I could trust you\u2026instead all you wanted was to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, moving closer to the frantic girl, quickly grabbed her arm, with her gloved hands, forcing her to turn toward them, to see the tears streaming down of her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Kitty, we didn\u2019t want to hurt you. We\u2026we talked without thinking. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026are sorry.\u201d Added Storm moving forward and kneeling beside Shadowcat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have said such mean things to you. I\u2019m truly sorry for what happened in the kitchen. I wish I could return back and take back my words but, I cannot. That is why, to ask you to forgive us, we would like to treat you to lunch. What do you say? We can go wherever you want to go, no fuss about the location. What do you say, Kitty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest girl, sniffling less than before, before saying anything, jumped forward, closing her arms around both Storm and Rogue, this last one making sure not to get in contact with her skin, hugging them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, guys! I just felt so angry, so\u2026betrayed. But it warms me knowing you didn\u2019t really mean those words\u2026Although, I gotta confess something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Shadowcat broke the hug and sat on the edge of the bed, before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm quite addicted to those cookies so I may've taken a few out the jar during the past few nights\u2026heh heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute there was silence in the room, until all three girls burst out laughing and joking with each other, revealing that each of them had snuck a few in the past, avoiding notice from the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tension gone within them, Kitty suddenly sprang up from her bed, as she began walking around the room, a finger on her chin as if deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, Kitty?\u201d Said Storm, curiously watching the youngest girl deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Just thinking about where you two are going to treat me to lunch.\u201d Replied the girl, grinning widely, as the two older girls scowled jokingly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor X had followed the events with his mind and decided once more that the tree friends were just the perfect test subjects for his project. He had only to nudge them a bit more in the right direction, before starting to input a more definite sets of planted thoughts in their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shadowcat pondered where to go, a sudden idea sprang in her mind, she wasn\u2019t really sure where she took that notion but, it suddenly seemed the perfect way to close up the situation they were all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it, girls! I\u2019ve heard of this new buffet style place that opened recently. Anyone who's gone there's been talking about it as a cool place. And, most importantly, the owner isn\u2019t against mutants at all, so we could go there\u2026so you two can also enjoy a good meal. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, both Storm and Rogue agreed that, indeed, was a good idea. What they didn\u2019t know was that the place wasn\u2019t as normal looking as it seemed. Indeed, any customer who went there, left the place giving the best review they could of the place. It could have seemed strange that an all-you-can-eat place that had opened up by barely a week, already had better reviews than most other restaurants in town. Still, people seemed blind to this strangeness, and kept returning to it, unaware of what was happening right under their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already lunchtime when the three X-girls entered the restaurant and, just as soon as they passed the entrance a smiling waiter reached to them, showing them around a bit, before taking them to their table, explain to them the rules of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome ladies, welcome to The Food Heaven. Are you all together? Good, follow me. I\u2019ll accompany you to your table.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked the waiter showed them how the place was built, not only there were the massive isles where food could be collected by bringing the plates but, all around the hall there was a mechanical moving belt that let food circulate around the various tables, giving the customer the chance to pick something from it without the need for leaving their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go, ladies. Now, we have a strict no leftovers policy so whatever you carry to your table have to be eaten if you want to include it inside the All you can eat Menu. Selected packages and offers can be chosen from to decide your meal, and you can see all the details from the interactive menu here at your table. Mainly, the Buffet style menu includes beverages and food, no limit on the number of refills you wish to do, for the price of 10 dollars per customer. As I said before, due to our no leftovers policy, the plate left with food in it will be charged at full price. Single plates prices can be consulted with the menu. Hope you\u2019re enjoy your meal and stay. For any need, don\u2019t hesitate to call one of us waiters and we will assist you as best as we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter politely excusing himself, the guy left them on their own, as he went to greet more customers entering the restaurant.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe three friends looked around ecstatic, checking out the place and enjoying already the heavenly aroma\u2019s coming from all around them. Quickly, they sat and began scrolling through the various options but, in the end, they decided to just pick the buffet style menu and start from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly they separated and each went to a different section of the place, carrying a few plates with them. After a while, upon returning to their table, each could see that the other had decided to treat this occasion as if it was a cheat day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was the first to return to their table, bringing with her two plates full of different kinds of pasta. One was a common looking mac \u2019n' cheese while the second one was a plate of fried Chinese noodles with pork and eggs. Both plates were quite larger than what they usually used at the mansion but, she told herself that it wasn\u2019t the end of the world if she let herself go for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her, was Ororo. The African girl returned balancing three plates with her, the first two filled with different kinds of Chinese noodles, while the third one was some kind of tasty looking stew she had found while walking around. Last one to arrive was Shadowcat, she returned holding with both hands a massive bowl of Japanese ramen which, compared to the rather short teenage girl, appeared to be even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Kitty\u2026pretty hungry, today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Rogue, I gotta confess I\u2019m feeling famished but, I see you\u2019re no less hungry than me, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two half joked with each other, Ororo broke the building tension with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, ladies. Let us just enjoy some freedom today\u2026and, if someone is going to have the prize for hunger\u2026it should go to me, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other two laughed at that, the three friends began to eat and, as soon as the first bite passed within their lips, they began to literally tear at the food they had brought with them. It was so delicious that all of them couldn\u2019t stop from shoveling more and more of it within their lips. In less than twenty minutes, all three of them had cleaned their plates, almost licking the plates. And yet, as much as their bellies had bloated quite a bit, neither of them felt full, nor satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, who'd even drank all the soup from her bowl, simply stood up, albeit a bit slowly, and turned toward her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll go for round two. Girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue stood up along with her and quickly they walked away, searching for something to catch their eye, while Ororo, sat there, feeling as her, usually tight, abs had been replaced by a itty bitty bloated belly. Still, sitting there she noticed the mechanical beltway just bringing plates loaded with cuts of meat and fried mix ups. Interested she quickly grabbed a few out of it and placed them right under her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit, due to the amazing smell coming from her plates, she noticed that for once, she maybe had taken more than she could possibly consume. In front of her, in fact there were now two plates with quite large portions of beef stroganoff and the third platter filled with a mix of fries in all shapes and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could delve into her meal, her friends returned to the table with their choices and she noticed that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kitty hummed happily as she placed each one down in front of her before sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kitten... are you sure you can eat all that?\" Ororo asked gently. Kitty rolled her eyes. \"C'mon, Ororo. Gimme a break. I can eat as much as I want here. Besides, your meal isn't exactly small itself.\" She retorted as she eyed Storm's two plates loaded with beef stroganoff and the tray loaded with fries. Ororo blushed as she realized Kitty did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right, Kitty. My apologies.\" Storm said with an embarrassed smile. Kitty grinned. \"It's okay Storm. You're just hungry like me.\" She smiled as she patted her friend's hand assuredly. Then, her stomach growled hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay already! Geez belly, gimme a minute!\" She fumed, causing Ororo to smile and chuckle slightly. Kitty then grabbed a BBQ sauce drenched drumstick and tore a giant chunk of meat off, getting sauce on her face and fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm just smiled as she began eating her own feast of stroganoff and fries. The duo kept eating and eating, unaware of their stomachs bloating even more. As she ate, Storm wondered what was taking Rogue so long to come back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, did you see Rogue while you were grabbing your current meal?\" she asked. Kitty, sauce smeared around her mouth and now dripping onto her t-shirt, shook her head as she swallowed the latest mouthful of meat she had packed into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Sorry, 'Roro. I thought I saw her near the farther part of the conveyor belts, but I could've imagined it.\" Kitty replied as she began attacking her fourth plate of ribs, loudly tearing the meat off and licking and smacking her lips and fingers as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro frowned as she looked up at the belts but then her stomach gurgled with hunger and she returned to eating as well, while still trying to keep an eye for Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two X-Ladies kept wolfing down their newest meals as they waited for Rogue to return with her next meal. Finally, the duo leaned back slightly and sighed in contention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was the best barbeque I've eaten in a long time.\" Kitty sighed, sucking on her BBQ sauce coated fingers as she lounged in her seat, patting her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree Kitten. Though, for some reason, I still want... more.\" Ororo remarked as she rubbed her own bloated belly as it bulged against her t-shirt. Kitty nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes it unanimous.\" she giggled, stifling a big burp a second later. Ororo just rolled her eyes in amusement and chuckled as Kitty kept going on and on about the delicious food here. She had to agree with Kitty. The food was very delicious and she could see why it was so recommended after only a few weeks of operations. At the same time, she was wondering about Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, </span></div></div>",

Rogue's plates were overflowing with mega sized burgers, hot dogs, bacon strips, corn on the cob, what seemed to be an entire turkey, blueberry pie, chocolate cake and a honey glazed ham. Ororo's belly rumbled at this beautiful sight and she heard Kitty's tummy mimicking hers. Neither of the duo spoke as Rogue managed to place each meal down as she sat down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we know now why you took so long to come back.\" Ororo smirked at Rogue, who smiled sheepishly. \"What can Ah say, 'Roro? Ah'm a hungry gal today.\" she smiled as she tore a drumstick off the turkey and began chomping on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, Kitty. Let us go get some more food.\" Storm smiled at Kitty, who nodded eagerly and was already standing up in delight. With that, the duo headed to the conveyor belts and started looking for tasty treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro soon began loading her tray after reaching her decided location. Soon, it was overflowing with a large ham, biscuits, corn on the cob, more beef stroganoff, fries, bacon, ham and cheese sandwiches and a huge pumpkin pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, went to a different part of the belts and was soon loading her own tray. Soon, it was heaped with mega sized burgers, doughnuts, eclairs, a giant heap of bacon, death by chocolate cake, chocolate chip, sugar, peanut butter and molasses cookies, hot dogs and other sugary/greasy foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue eyed the two X-Ladies' trays when they returned with a smirk. \"So, Ah ain't the only one who's takin' advantage of our cheat day, huh?\" she joked, patting her big belly as it bulged against her black costume and green sleeve-less top. Kitty stuck her tongue out at Rogue playfully as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a break Rogue. You're not exactly one to talk yourself, Miss. Piggy.\" She giggled, poking Rogue's gut with her finger, causing Rogue to let out a gentle burp as she blushed sheepishly. Kitty just smirked and then plopped five cookies into her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I do feel peck-ish again, Rogue. Though, I do not know why.\" Storm admitted thoughtfully as she sunk her teeth into the first large ham and cheese sandwich, moaning in delight at the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, placed three large doughnuts on her index finger and then inhaling them. Swallowing them in one giant gulp, she smiled and then crammed three large hot dogs drenched in ketchup and mustard into her mouth, smearing said condiments and the grease around her mouth as well with some of them dribbling onto her t-shirt too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three X-Ladies kept eating and eating their massive meals, unaware of what was happening to their bodies as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she inhaled the corn on the cob she'd gotten, Rogue's large gut slowly shrank, the fat moving mainly to her hips, butt and boobs. While her belly still resembled a boulder, it was considerably less round while said body parts were much bigger/heavier and her arms, legs, fingers, feet, toes, hands and face were also softer and chubbier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, loudly slurping/guzzling an extra jumbo chocolate milkshake, also seemed to plump up in her legs and hips while her booty grew even larger. Her hips began getting even bigger while her already huge booty cheeks strained at her pants. She'd also developed a round face and bigger boobs, fatter arms, hands, fingers, feet and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty's body was starting to chub itself out as she devoured her cake. Her front and back started gaining rolls of fat, causing her curves to soften. Her thighs widened slightly as pudge covered her arms and legs. Her boobs and butt also plumped up, though not as much as Rogue's or Storm's. Her face also became soft, with a double chin soon appearing as her arms, legs and other body parts plumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio just kept eating and eating, oblivious to these changes as they kept wolfing down their unhealthy meals. They seemed to have grown addicted to eating, regardless how much they'd eaten before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was obvious because as soon as a new thing of food was reached, the trio completely dove into it, tearing chunks of whatever it was. The waiters soon caught on to this and began bringing the large plates to the X-Ladies' table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the plates were brought in with some type of logic, but they gradually became more and more chaotic. Massive cheeseburgers, dripping with grease, were soon followed by very huge piles of glazed doughnuts, which were soon joined by massive pots of chili and rightly followed by large, frosted cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Storm handled the burgers, Rogue the chili and Kitty the doughnuts and cake. Storm stuffed three burgers into her mouth at once before swallowing them and cramming another three in. Rogue was busy loudly gulping down the chili, getting quite a bit of it on her clothes and face, but like Storm, she didn't care a bit. She just smiled, burped loudly and kept on a-chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was having the time of her life with the doughnuts and cakes. First she poured half the first tray into her mouth, bulging her cheeks like a chipmunk's as she chewed away. After swallowing that, she grabbed two large slices of a seven layer pound cake and crammed those into her mouth. Then she repeated this until the first doughnut tray and cake were gone before she inhaled a big, plump red velvet cake, burping loudly after doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the girls switched. Kitty took the hamburgers, Rogue took the cakes and doughnuts and Storm the chili. Kitty actually managed to stuff five of the mega cheeseburgers into her mouth at once as she did so. Storm did what Rogue had done with the chili and slurped it straight from the pots, also getting chili on her already grease stained clothes and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue gulped down two stacks of doughnuts at once before eating an entire four layered chocolate cake with chocolate pieces on it in just two monster sized bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Storm was given the doughnuts and cakes, Rogue the cheeseburgers and Kitty the chili.  Storm poured 15 different doughnuts into her gullet as she moaned in delight at their tastes before stuffing a fistful of cheesecake into her mouth as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue crammed six cheeseburgers into her gullet at once before swallowing loudly and downing another six while Kitty guzzled the remaining pots of chili even more sloppily than her friends did, dripping big globs of it onto her t-shirt, which was already covered with frosting, powdered sugar, grease, BBQ sauce, ketchup and mustard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the three X-Ladies leaned back in their seats and burped loud and long as they massaged their large bellies in delight at their gorge. Storm's belly was poking out from under her shirt, now resembling a brown boulder and her whole body was soft and doughy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue wasn't much better as her gut was straining against her costume more than ever. Her face looked like a ball of dough and her whole body jiggled with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was just as bad as her friends were. Her belly almost reached her knees, her body resembled a boulder in roundness and she was almost bigger than her two older teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter came up a second later. \"Excuse me, ladies, but the buffet is closing soon. However, if you would like to continue eating, I'll speak to the chief. What would you like to do?\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trio stared at each other for a moment. Then, Ororo slowly turned back to the waiter. She stifled a very big burp, bulging her cheeks as she did before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no *burp* thank *belch* you. We *urp* have *burp* eaten *hic* enough for *burp* today. Thank *hic* you. We will take the... check... now... please...\" she gasped in between burping and hiccupping from her fullness. Rogue nodded in agreement, her double chin jiggling as she did while Kitty merely let out a giant burp while massaging her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter nodded and walked off to get their check, leaving the three bloated and pooped out X-Ladies to catch their breaths. After a few minutes, Kitty, still rubbing and poking her ginormous gut, spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *burp* gotta say *urp* that was the best *belch* food I've *hic* eaten in *hic-urp* a long time *booorrrppp*. Man, is my tummy full.\" She groaned in delight, despite her bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm with ya sugah. We really gotta come back here again sometime.\" Rogue agreed as she stroked her bulging belly in equal delight as she eyed her fat and youngest teammate with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit I too feel happy from eating so much. Normally I would disprove of eating so much in one day, but, I shall make an exception for this yummy and delicious food.\" Ororo admitted with a grin as she poked her belly, watching a sausage sized finger sink into the squishy, warm and brown flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the waiter came back and, after Ororo paid the check, he and two other waiters helped the bloated girls to the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio started for the mansion, but it soon became apparent that, despite it not being far away, the walk was doing the trio more harm than good in their bloated forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes, Storm was leaning against a lamppost, clutching her side as she wheezed and panted heavily, sweat running down her greasy and plump face as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had sat down on a bus bench, also wheezing and panting, sweat running down her own doughy face as she leaned back, her massive boobs and belly raising and falling as she tried to get oxygen back into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, had simply belly flopped onto the ground and was now laying on her massive belly, gulping like a beached trout, her tongue nearly touching the pavement as she wheezed, gulped and panted loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... so... pooped...\" She groaned. \"So... am... Ah... sugah... mah feet... are... killin'... me...\" Rogue groaned in equal exhaustion as she managed to lift her head up to eye her younger teammate and friend sprawled on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely... the... mansion was... not... that... far... away... when we... walked... here?\" Ororo gulped after a minute, wiping her sweaty and greasy forehead off with a large meaty hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... we... should... just... call.. a... cab?\" Kitty finally wheezed. The other two nodded as they kept trying and failing to get enough energy and oxygen into their large bodies. Kitty managed to pull her phone out of her tights and, after trying and failing to type the number in with her own sausage sized fingers, used voice command to call a taxi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the taxi pulled up and the fat, sweaty and greasy X-Ladies heaved themselves into it. They were cramped in the back together, but merely assumed the taxi was out of date enough to be or feel cramped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the trio arrived at the institute and waddled inside. Rogue was the one who broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gals? If... we... go back... soon... we'd... better... use... the... cab... ta... get... too an'... from it...\" She remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Ororo both agreed and the trio waddled to their bedrooms, cleaned themselves up and plopped into bed, dreaming about food and how nice it was to let go and eat like they'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this happened, the fat they'd gained, slowly worked its' way around their bodies, fattening them up even more in their hips, boobs, butts, faces, arms, legs, toes, feet, fingers and hands during the night.</span></div></div>",

He could see that his action had led the mutant woman to let herself go, reducing the standard of physical perfection she usually went by. He also noticed that he was getting some weird vibes from the restaurant they were in but discarded the thought. Roaming through the restaurant it didn\u2019t take him long time to find Rogue and Kitty, the two were currently standing next to a few containers of food, unable to choose what they wanted to pick. Since they all made part of his experiment, he smiled within himself and gave them a little mental push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Kitty, it\u2019s a cheat day\u2026nothing harmful will come from it. Enjoy yourself to the fullest\u2026Can\u2019t you feel your stomach grumbling? It need food to work properly. Satisfy it.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Rogue, why not trying to live life as much as you can? One plate? Two or even four? Follow your hunger\u2026and you\u2019re getting pretty hungry, aren\u2019t you?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed the connection he tiredly crashed against his chair, yet, he was smiling. The three test subjects were showing a great promise already\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant, Ororo had already cleared the first plate of Strogonoff, her belly bloating already a bit, as a small sliver of her skin began to emerge between her long tight pants and the sleeveless top and jacket, she was wearing. Besides, she didn\u2019t feel full, yet, so she placed the empty plate aside and brought the fried mixed plate in front of her when she saw her friends returning. As soon as she spotted them, she gaped open mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kitty and Rogue were closing on their table with a massive platter on their hands, she couldn\u2019t believe in seeing that both massive platters were literally overfilled with food. As the two girls finally seated the table trembled for a moment with the added weight of their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitten? Rogue? What\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026maybe I took a bit too much? But it\u2019s okay\u2026Feeling ravenous today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rogue began to literally assault all the food in her platter, mostly massive double decker hamburgers and huge hot dogs, with the sparse presence of fried greens and salty fries. As she started munching through those she quickly grabbed the ketchup and mayo, as she began to literally cover the entire platter with those sauces, making it even more greasy and with a higher calorie content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, instead had filled her own platter with an immense selection of junk food and confectioneries. The massive palter was indeed choked full of hot dogs and greasy, multi dickered, hamburgers. Right between that huge carb fest, there were also mounds of bacon strips right along with at least a dozen donuts, a few \u00e9clair and even a couple of slices from a Devil\u2019s food cake. She too began attacking the plate with a ferociousness that Storm had never seen before, as the greasy sauce began to smear her lips and chin, slowly dribbling even on her clothes. Kitty, seeing the interrogative stare of Ororo, simply smiled, swallowed and replied to her as if it was the most normal of the things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just hungry\u2026and I was dying for both fast foods and sweets\u2026so, that\u2019s perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, seeing her two friends enjoy so much their meal decided to let herself go, and so she started imitating them, taking plates from the conveyor belt, filling herself up as she too began to feel a rising hunger coming from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, all three of them managed finally to demolish whatever they had brough to the table. Useless to say, the girls who had entered that buffet, were very different from those that were now seated at that table. Storm was belching quietly, as she caressed her bloated belly which had definitively opened the gap between her pants and her top, the globular stomach rested on her thighs, a boulder like belly, round as a ball and yet, not filled up to capacity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue too, was in a similar situation, her clothes, already tight when she entered the restaurant, were now on the verge of ripping apart on the torso, as her round belly pushed mightily against her black outfit, making her sleeveless green top appear more like a makeshift bra than anything else. She was laying on the back of her chair, caressing her bloated tummy and yet, she still was feeling quite a bit hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, of all of them, was the one most impacted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the shortest and the youngest, the results of her binge were the most dominant on her figure. Her belly had grown massively in size, pushing tightly against her clothes, as it weighed he down, wobbling slowly under the table, and yet, both her face and her clothes, drenched in grease and powdered sugar, were evidence enough of just how ravenous she had been.<br>\r\nExcept she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio breathed slowly, regaining their energies from all that time spent eating, they suddenly noticed one of the cute waiter boys coming toward them. As he stepped up to their table, he smiled seeing that all plates on it had been emptied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI take it you ladies have enjoyed your meals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah\u2026*Belch*! Pardon me\u2026.It was all very good\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter, not at all impressed by the belching, smiled at the girl with the white dyed mohawk hair as he turned toward the other two, complimenting each of them and informing them of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, I\u2019m sorry to say this but it\u2019s almost closing time. Still, if you wish to stay here and have some more, we will inform the chef about it. This is an \u2018All you can eat\u2019 buffet\u2026if our Guests return home hungry, we haven\u2019t done our job well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what is gonna be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three friends looked each other in the eyes, as a grinning smile appeared on their faces, before turning all three toward the waiter replying with a definite \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll having some more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, for their enjoyment, the waiters began to bring platefuls of food directly to their table, as they were the only customers still present in the restaurant, meaning that whenever one of them cleaned a plate, another filling meal presented itself under their eyes. The three girls began to be so engrossed in the act of eating that they barely noticed the effects that all that food was having on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kitty was already cleaning out a plateful of baked corns with glazed ham slices, when her bloated belly began to shrink, the weight and fat slowly distributing itself overall on her body, chubbying it out. Her curves began to soften as fatty rolls began to make their appearance on her front and on her back, her thighs widened a little bit, as a small layer of jiggling pudge covered her arms and legs. Her face too softened up, with a second chin starting to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, just as she had cleaned a massive platter with an entire roasted turkey, also began to soften up, although she began to grow mostly I her breasts, which began to grow larger and heavier, and on her hips, widening hip quite a bit. Her belly, although it had softened up was still quite small. Ororo, instead, as she finished guzzling a massive milkshake offered by one of the waiters, seemed to be expanding mostly on her hips and legs, as her ass seemed to grow out of control. Her already wide hips began to wide up hugely, with her ass check that started to wobbly overflow the chair she was sitting on, pushing to their stress limit the pants she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them seemed to have become addicted to eating, no matter how much they had eaten before, as soon as a new plate was placed before them, they totally dived in it, taking huge chunks of whatever it was. At first, the plates seemed to be carried over with some kind of logic but, after some time, everything seemed to grow more and more chaotic. Massive hamburgers, drenched in grease, were soon followed by huge piles of glazed donuts, which were then replaced by large pots of chili, rightly followed by large frosting covered cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept gorging on the amazing food that was being presented to them, unaware of what their bodies were experiencing, just as if a trigger had been activated within them turning them into human waste disposal machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as they gorged and guzzled, three things happened at the same time. First, Professor X checked on them, smiling in seeing how his project was already providing good results. Then, from the kitchen doors the Chef watched with admiration and fascination as those guests kept on eating his food and, finally\u2026.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the chef was sure that the three new guests were too engrossed with their food, he let out a small cackling laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in his plan seemed to be going steadily. As he closed the door and returned inside the kitchen he couldn\u2019t stop smiling. He was an honest man, he hadn\u2019t any superpower to call his own and that had made him jealous of the mutants, at first. Then he realized that with those superpowers, the mutants could wipe out mankind and humanity wouldn\u2019t have stand a chance. So, to his jealousy, it soon began to appear hate for the mutants. Still, he was a peaceful man and he knew he couldn\u2019t fight them directly so a plan hatched within him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no power, but he had his culinary skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to that some hunger stimulants and metabolism suppressors, he concocted his personal plan to stop the mutants from destroying the world. Once hey were going to be all so fat that all they wanted to do was eat, he could have called it a victory for mankind. That was why he had spent so much on those mutagenic tracer installed on the entrance of the restaurant, once he could know which of his guests was a mutant he could stuff them full of food, changing them in the eating machine he needed them to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Sure\u2026</i>\u2019 he thought to himself a he prepared the next batches of blueberry pies to be brought to his current victims \u2018<i>\u2026A few humans will end up as big, if not bigger, gluttons than them\u2026but it\u2019s a small price to pay for everyone to be freed of the mutant threat.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, he knew he couldn\u2019t push it too much in one day. Already he had stopped providing stimulants to the food of those three mutant girls there. Still, he already had made preparation to have them back in his restaurant soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls though, were still gorging gluttonously with all the food brought to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them knew how long they had been staying there eating and yet, as the stimulants in their bodies began to fade, they too began to slow down in their consumption. Rogue was the first one to stop. With her now exaggerated hourglass figure, her breast had become more of a hassle than anything else. Weighing her down as they had grown massively, losing almost all of their perkiness, they were kept somewhat lifted up only by the small-ish potbelly she had developed. Her hips too had widened hugely, forcing her to seat with her legs spread apart a bit. As she swallowed the last cupcake on her platter, the last of three dozen she had been given, she burped a bit and simply crashed on the table, unable to continue, feeling completely stuffed and yet, happy for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm followed her example ten minutes later. <br>\r\nThe African girl had grown hugely during the almost endless lunch they had, her ass cheeks were now hugely wobbling masses of lard. Piling heavily on her enlarged thighs and legs, her poor pants hadn\u2019t managed to resist during her binge, ripping apart in several places. She was still covered for the most part but, several gaps had opened letting several inches of fatty ass to spill out. As Ororo managed to swallow down the last taco she had been given, she too almost collapsed on the back of her chair, as she massaged a bit both her massive ass and globular belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty Pryde, was the last one to give up. While rogue crashed, she managed to eat a whole pot of lentil stew. Burping and farting away trying to make some more room. As Storm collapsed, she cleared out a large plate filled to the brim with cookies and ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, just as she had cleared out that last plate, her clothes seemingly exploded out of her, ripping into shreds, leaving her almost naked but she didn\u2019t seem to notice anything apart form the fact that she was finally feeling contently full. As she swallowed down her last morsel she smiled and turned toward the waiter standing beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I think\u2026we\u2019re\u2026done\u2026now. Could you\u2026bring us\u2026the check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she, too, collapsed on herself, suing her humongous belly as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the three, she seemed to have bee growing the most. With her forms growing apple shaped, her belly was massive, it hung bloated, down on her legs, almost up to her knees, as did similarly her ass. As it almost overflowed her chair. Her face too had softened up quite a bit more, with a second chin definitely there, and the hint of a third one starting to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waiters cleaned the table, and them, they also gave to the three girls some time to rest a bit, before waking them up telling them that it was time to close the buffet. The three mutants didn\u2019t seem baffled to have spent most of their day in that restaurant, nor of how their bodies had grown. But that was simply because nether of them could see herself truly. Charles Xavier, since he had followed their descent into gluttony, had made so that their minds couldn\u2019t see the physical changes within themselves. This was made to make sure that no false data was going to be collected as his experiment went on. Also, because he wanted to see what reaction would the others have in seeing their friends so much fattened. As he broke the contact, he couldn\u2019t wait to see the three girls waddle slowly through the halls of the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered briefly if someone would have the courage to approach them asking the dreaded question.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs Kitty, Storm and Rogue woke up and stood from the table, each of them felt as if there was something that wasn\u2019t quite right but, unable to see how vastly each of them had changed, they simply dismissed the thought. As Rogue paid for their meal, since it was a treat that they had decided to offer to Kitty, one of the waiters reached to them, smiling gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, please to wait a moment, before you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe\u2026*burp*\u2026es?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, feeling definitely stuffed, turned as a burp escaped her lips, although the waiter didn\u2019t seem to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to let you know that, since you\u2019re first timers in our restaurant, and since you\u2019ve enjoyed so much our products, the Owner would like to offer you a special discount within our establishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this case, we offer you a fifty percent discount on all your expenses if you come here to eat at least four times a week, while a thirty percent discount if you should decide to hire our personal catering service directly to your home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI must admit you must have made quite an impression on the Boss, we have only a handful of Clients to which this deal has been offered to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, with the discount, the no leftover policy is removed. So any residual can be brought home or home delivered, as you would prefer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, without even waiting for her friend response greedily nodded several times, just before Storm slapped her lightly on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse my friend eagerness. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t think before speaking. Anyway, we will think about it, if possible, and let you know the earliest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the waiter nodded gently, with small smile on his lips and helped the three fattened beauties out of the building. As they were outside, swollen bodies shown to the world in their largeness, the three mutants slowly began the hard trek home, although it had took them only few minutes to get there in the first place. As a few meters passed, with their overburdened bodies getting completely drenched in sweat, the three girls stopped suddenly, completely out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Huff*\u2026didn\u2019t seem\u2026to be\u2026so far away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, huffing and puffing, stood against a lamp post trying to regain her breath. Her huge ass, shaking and wobbling as she tried futilely to calm her heartrate down. Rogue and Kitty didn\u2019t fare that much better. Rogue was currently seated on a nearby bench, completely collapsed on it as her potbelly bobbed up and down, as she breathed heavily. Kitty, instead was sitting down on the street, trying as hard as she could to recover her energies. As time passed and neither of them could recover enough to start moving again, it was Rogue who first piped up with a proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls\u2026what if\u2026we call\u2026a cab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, trying hard to find air enough to speak, simply nodded, barely breathing out a yes, just as Kitty took out her phone and tried vainly to call a taxi with her sausage like fingers, until she simply went on internet and spoke with a trembling voice asking for a cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited there, Storm finally managed to pipe up, having recovered some much-needed oxygen in her overburdened, overstuffed, body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust remember\u2026for tomorrow\u2026to go there with\u2026the cab.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the end, each of them simply thought that the cab had to be so run down that they were forced to sit tightly against the other. As the ride progressed, suddenly Rogue piped up, asking the driver to stop even though they were almost there at the mansion. Storm, massaging her widened hips, not really understanding how big they really were, turned a puzzled look to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnneMarie? Why did you ask the driver to stop? We\u2019re almost home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty Pryde, instead, having seen what had picked the interest of her white streaked friend, eagerly nodded making her chins wobble slightly and her arms too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ororo, since we\u2019re almost there I thought maybe we could pick up a donut or two\u2026you know, for later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fattened, white haired mutant smiled a bit within herself. She didn\u2019t want to be the first to admit it but, even though they had finished lunch just a couple of hours before, was feeling rather famished. Still, trying to be the mother Hen as she usually did, she accepted but adding a remark for her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but just a couple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the cab was quite the feat for the three newly fattened ladies, yet, after a bit of prodding and pushing, they managed finding themselves short of breaths but right in front of the bakery. Waddling slowly, one by one, they entered the place finding themselves suddenly surrounded by a treasure trove made of sweets and treats. As they waddled toward the counter, though, Professor X was checking on their progress with quite an interested mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I see\u2026No matter that they\u2019ve eaten more than enough to satisfy their normal intake two or three times over. But, they still are growing hungrier yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmmh. This must be studied further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to try and let themselves go just as they did at the Buffet. <br>\r\nThe more their exterior changes, the more effective will be the results of the experiment. </i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor, then, did something he normally wasn\u2019t fond of doing. He entered the mind of the clerk at the shop and imprinted into it the idea that the three new customers were their millionth customers and so they could have all they wanted for, almost, free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the professor did that, he felt his energies dwindle and so had to abruptly cut the link, taking care to rest, while promising himself to check on them as soon as they returned into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three bloated beauties had managed to reach the counter, although each of them was feeling rather down in energies, so they actually thought that a load on sugary things was just what they needed. But, as they reached the counter, the clerk looked at them and quickly showed them to a table near the counter, while providing, especially for Storm, wide seats for them to seat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere ladies, have a seat here. You\u2019re our millionth customers of the month so, you\u2019re awarded with a discount of the ninety-five percent to our store wares. Let me know your order and I\u2019ll bring them right here to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn\u2019t make any fuss about it, ordering immediately a dozen jelly filled donuts, followed suit by Rogue which instead went for an extra large milkshake and three pieces out of a chocolate sheet cake. As those two ordered, Ororo tried to contain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls! We said just a couple of donuts\u2026haven\u2019t you eaten enough already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLighten up, 'Roro\u2026\u201d said Kitty thickly as she massaged her massive belly rolls, anxiously waiting for her order. \u201cIt\u2019s a cheat day, isn\u2019t it? Plus we\u2019ve got this deal they\u2019ve offered to us. If we don\u2019t use it it will be a shame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026*slurp*\u2026\u201d Reinforced Rogue, as she began drinking from her massive milkshake, her already overburdened belly starting to bloat out eve more. \u201cWe should definitively take advantage of that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her two friends seemed to have gone all hog, Ororo finally decided that if they were to act like pigs, she should then be the one out eating all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026if you put it that way. Sir? May you bring me a Devil\u2019s food cake? No, not a slice. A full cake, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, under the surprised stares of Kitty and Rogue, both girls decided that if that was the game to play, they could compete too. Right after that thought the girls began to guzzle and munch all the way, letting out all they had to show each other that they could eat more. It soon began some sort of competition within them. With Storm taking huge chunks of the cake, smearing her face with it, just as Rogue began to chug milkshake after milkshake, downing them one after another almost as fast as Kitty was downing donut after donuts. As the girls lost themselves once more into their gluttony, their bodies began to expand once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm practically exploded out of her outfit, her pants completely ripped in two, leaving her in her, tighter than ever, panties. And even though her jacket was still, somewhat, wearable the same could not be said for her top. This one had in fact turned into a make-shift bra, pushed up by her quickly bloating, and filling up, belly. Rogue was right beside her, although, since her hourglass shape couldn\u2019t grow much larger, the rest of her seemed to be catching up. Especially her belly that began growing out and about, getting wider and hanging lower on her thighs as she kept clearing whatever was offered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real deal was with Kitty. Shadowcat was growing hugely, her already massive stomach seemed to be outgrowing even her diminutive body, as it reached the floor, filling up on sugar treats as she kept eating and eating. Her overall shape blossomed out soon, with her arms getting fatter and fatter, as bingo wings began to form under her arms and her legs began to bloat out so wide to resemble tree\u2019s trunks. And yet, as if blind to how big the three ladies were getting, the clerk kept bringing more and more from pastries to pies, and even full cakes to each of the lardy ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if a beast had awakened inside their bodies, even though they were starting to feel full, and they heard their clothes ripping apart, not one of them found herself able to stop from having more. Within themselves they reasoned that they were going to have one more pastry, then it became one more slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil they reached the limit at one more cake, just another one and we will stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that limit was reached, even though they were blinded by the mind tricks of Professor X, each of them began to wonder how they could eat so much. Rogue, as she grabbed a Bundt cake from the table, bringing it to her lips, wondered if they were, maybe having too much of it. That didn\u2019t prevent her from consuming it whole, but it still gave her some doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, too, was having these issues. <br>\r\nEspecially since she could feel her ass cheeks overflowing the chair she was seated on, and yet, she almost inhaled the thirty six chocolate glazed donuts that she had been served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Shadow cat, the most gluttonous of them, was having doubts. Not because she couldn\u2019t see her feet anymore, since all that stood within her and the floor was now a humongous belly, but because her grabby arms were trying futilely to grab at the next sheet cake and she wasn\u2019t even close to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Girls\u2026? I\u2026I think\u2026maybe\u2026we should\u2026stop. Ororo\u2026Anne Marie\u2026don\u2019t you think\u2026we\u2019ve had\u2026enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Storm felt like rejecting the idea, but, as she felt herself stuffed, once more, over the brim she had to concede, while nodding in defeat as she felt herself getting tired and tired, even though she thought they had to feel pretty energetic with all the confectioneries eaten. Rogue, As she inhaled the last morsel of cake, feeling it slowly travel from her throat into her vastly overburdened stomach, stopped too, while slowly nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they rose from the chairs, wobbling all over, they paid what was due and left the place as they began to waddle at a crawl\u2019s pace toward the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026We didn\u2019t\u2026overate\u2026too much\u2026didn\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waddled slowly, bloated like overinflated zeppelins, and yet blind to their massively fattened bodies, Rogue was the first to speak, as her tired and breathless voice spoke slowly, whit huge intake of air between each word, almost. Her two friends, in an equally overfilled state, took their time to respond, although only Ororo actually spoke, as Kitty was far too tired to even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t\u2026think\u2026so. A\u2026good\u2026night\u2026sleep\u2026 and we\u2026will feel\u2026better\u2026tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finally managed to enter into the mansion, the three bloated beauties slowly separated to go each in their own bedroom. Rogue, as soon as she was in her room, simply collapsed on her bed, as her body digested the massive amounts of food she had consumed in that day, letting her body slowly deflate quite a bit, while gaining a serious poundage yet.  Kitty did almost the same. As she reached her bedroom she went to her bed and soon fell asleep, as her humongous belly began to shrink once more, spreading the fat gained throughout her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, even though she felt completely drained of energies, still managed to get into the shower, to clean herself a bit. After both the buffet and the bakery, she had managed to get herself pretty much covered in food stains and frosting. Finally clean, although she noticed to have taken much more time than usual, she finally went to bed letting her body, too, digesting the massive amount of calories received that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she began to fall asleep, she realized with a smile that it was nice to let herself go like that, occasionally.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning came and the three friends woke up feeling refreshed and restored. Storm was the first of them to wake up, and to shower herself. While in the shower she inspected her body but, although she felt like she had put on weight, she herself couldn\u2019t see any exterior damage ad so simply discarded the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was very different.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheat day she had with her friends had brought quite a few pounds on her frame but her mind, due to Xavier manipulation, wasn\u2019t really able to pick up such changes. And so, Ororo, finished showering and began to put on her clothes, finding out that they were feeling tighter than they had ever been, and yet he didn\u2019t recognize this as a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Must have shrunk in the wash\u2026mmm\u2026yes, that must be it</i>\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue and Kitty had the same issue and yet, neither could face the issue at hand. Both deciding that it was probably old clothes or washing malfunction that prevented them to wear their clothes properly. One thing all of them shared, though. As if planned, their three bellies began to rumble noisily, asking for food and since it was breakfast time, the three ladies left their rooms and walked toward the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was the first to find out that walking seemed way more tiring than it ever was, still, she marched on although her chubby belly wobbled at her every step making her feel weird, especially so since she couldn\u2019t see it herself. Rogue, instead, seeing that walking was definitely a chore, lifted herself into the air and began to float slowly through the hallways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was the one that had gained the most between them, while Ororo had a small potbelly and a wider ass, and Rogue seemed to bring out an inflated hourglass shape, Shadowcat had apparently gained almost everything in her overall form making her squishier and softer in her body and on all of her appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so that when she tried to leave her room, she found herself unable to pass through the door without a hitch. Having instead to use her powers to phase through it, as she also did when she realized she would have to walk all the way to the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short time, the three ladies met in the kitchen and, as soon as they were there, each of them received dubious, and one interested, stare from the other X-Men there with them. As Jean Grey cooked and prepared breakfast, dutifully helped by Wolverine, the other X-Men whispered among themselves as they watched their three friends come into the kitchen looking rather zaftig than what they usually appeared. Cyclops was the first to try and break the ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOroro, Kitty? Do you\u2026Do you feel alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Scott? I feel great today\u2026a bit hungry, but still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Cyclops\u2026Me and Storm are feeling wonderfully. It\u2019s such a good morning\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I meant is\u2026err...Have you gai\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSCOTT! Could you come over here and give me a hand, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean interrupted Cyclops and forced him to leave the question at that, as Ororo, Kitty and Rogue shared a wondering stare, as they waited for the breakfast to be prepared and served.  Cyclops though wasn\u2019t the only one who had noticed the additional inches on each of them, and yet, every time somebody tried to make a remark about their figures, Jean was there shushing them up. In a short while, although most had tried to say something the three friends had remained as clueless as they had been waking up, what they noticed was that Jean seemed to act a bit strangely toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost half an hour, as their other friends had left, one by one, in the kitchen there was only Jean and the three chubby ladies. The psyker then, finished preparations and soon left quite the platter to each of the three friends, leaving each one of them stupefied by the sheer mass of food awaiting them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro looked in disbelief as she had in her plate six donuts, two slice of shortcake a couple of muffins and some milkshakes. She tried to politely refuse but, after being rebuked that breakfast was important, she didn\u2019t discuss it anymore and went at her meal with gusto. Rogue, instead, was facing a junk food fest in her plate. In fact, Jean had left in front of her four hotdogs drenched in ketchup and mayo, two cheeseburgers and two massive double decker hamburgers, all of this accompanied by three XL sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rogue tried to replay, jean simply shaked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need your carbs to start the day in the right way.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, instead, was the only one who accepted her platter without a fuss, as she received it from Jean she simply dived in with gusto, enjoying the two bowls of fried chicken, the massive mound of fried bacon strips and the surrounding fried chips. <br>\r\nAs Jean watched the three girls going at it at the massive, unhealthy, breakfast, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from feeling excited. It had been always a fantasy of hers to be able to cater to girthier people and now, with Storm, Rogue and Kitty growing themselves to that size, she couldn\u2019t help but assist them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Breakfast was over, as Jean cleaned the dishes and left the three bloated beauties to recover, the three friends tried to discuss what they were going to do in that day. Kitty, although appearing the most exhausted by the meal just consumed was the first who piped up and proposed to return to the All You Can Eat Buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tell you, guys\u2026We should totally go there\u2026it was so good\u2026and the\u2026discount! We\u2019ve gotta accept it\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro moved slowly the head from side to side, as she massaged her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026*urp*\u2026We went yesterday...since it was a \u2026 cheat day. We can\u2019t\u2026 go back there\u2026today\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, as she stifled burp after burp, having downed her three sodas almost one after the other, was having difficulties to speak but, as she managed to release some more gas, she joined the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with\u2026Kitty this time\u2026\u2019Roro. We\u2019ll\u2026just have\u2026a bite to eat\u2026and return. No big\u2026Deal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their discussion progressed, Professor X tuned in on them to see their progress and was ecstatic to see them talking about food, right after such a massive meal. For a moment he thought about the strange behavior of Jean but in the end, he let it at that. There was going to be time to investigate in that direction. Now he wanted to focus on his three test subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, by sending out subliminal messages, he eroded Storm defenses, making her more susceptible to side with what the majority of the group decided to do, while he also increased Rogue confidence in her superior genetics, as well as boosting up Kitty\u2019s desire for more. In this way, his three guinea pigs surely would have gone down the path that he wanted them to pick. Exiting from their minds he stood silently around them, watching as the discussion proceeded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Said Storm \u201cWe either go to the buffet\u2026or we go to the mall and, after, to the buffet, is that correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, already licking her lips, nodded eagerly. No matter that her bloated belly almost touched the table, she was already feeling hungry for more and, although she wondered what would happen if she asked Jean to prepare her something, she also wanted to go straight away to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so she could barely wait her friends to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, thought about it for a bit. She had been against returning to the buffet so soon, for one this was no cheat day and then, she was afraid that even with her heritage, her genes couldn\u2019t resist much more food before turning her into a fattie.  Poor Storm, if only she could see herself. Right after her meal, her belly and hips had already gained a few more inches and yet, she was blind to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the idea to go back to the buffet was also enthralling. The food there had been so good that she still seemed to remember the taste of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was the second most decided of them, she too wanted to go back at the buffet. She had noticed that her girls seemed to have grown larger since her last visit and was clearly excited by the prospect. Although she had still the no touching issue, having curves on her otherwise lean body, couldn\u2019t be but a plus, in her book.  Still, as much as she wanted, she also wanted to try and go to the mall, to try and see if something interesting was there to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls digested their meals they had almost reached a decision when, suddenly, Jean appeared at the doorway with a smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girls! I see you\u2019re still here\u2026How about I prepare you a mid-morning snack? You girls may need the energy if you wanna go out again today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this new proposition hung in the air, the girls decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kitty, Rogue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited for her friends she tried to look as inconspicuous as possible. It wasn\u2019t she didn\u2019t like Jean it was only that she didn\u2019t trust her own senses around the woman. At the buffet, at least, she could use her will to stop eating if she was going to eat too much. Kitty and Rogue, seeing Ororo standing up looked at each other for a moment, until each decided what to do for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing \u2018Roro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass guys\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue herself was surprised in hearing herself saying that. She had wanted to go to the buffet once more but, after hearing Jean and knowing that the woman was as lean as her, she thought that maybe she could give her some advice on how to grow more voluptuous. Kitty and Ororo, too, seemed shocked for a moment but, without wasting any time, they simply accepted their friend decision and moved on toward their decided location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Storm and Shadowcat, although feeling quite snug in their uniforms, left the mansion opting to take a cab to go at the buffet, Rogue remained seated in the kitchen, watching interested as Jean slaved away at the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Rogue\u2026I see that there is someone here who knows how a proper diet has to be followed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026 To tell you the truth I wanted to go too but, I believe you may help me with something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, as she cooked, turned an intrigued stare toward the bloated mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, I\u2019m trying to get some more curves on my lean body and, since you\u2019ve got a perfect shape I thought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more. I\u2019ll coach you and you\u2019ll see that you\u2019ll be the most curvaceous girl in the mansion. I so vow it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Oh man, oh man, oh man! I\u2019ll have Rogue all for me to cater and pamper all day long! <br>\r\nAnd then tomorrow\u2026and next week\u2026Oh, I wonder how she will look by the month\u2019s end\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jean returned into the real world, she quickly grabbed a plate and, after having it filled with a dozen donuts and a few pastries, slid it in front of Rogue, inviting her to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, AnneMarie, I\u2019ll help you achieve your dream as much as I can but You\u2019ll have to do what I tell you. You will need lots of carbs, proteins and some sugar for this to work so, leave the cooking to me and dig in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, seeing as the other woman seemed to take her request so seriously, decided to follow her new Curve-Coach directives and, without further ado, began to chow down on the plate she had in front of her. As she munched on the donuts she realized that Jean had to be a great cook, cause those were the best she had ever tasted. As she cleared treat after treat, unnoticing of how her belly seemed to bloat out more at her every bite, she saw that more was soon going to come as Jean was already placing in a plate a few burgers and even a steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Jean seems to know what she\u2019s doing\u2026I better follow what she tells me to do\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ororo and Kitty had just left the cab which had brought them to the buffet they loved. Upon entering, a little surprised it was already open by mid-morning, they were greeted by one of the waiters, which recognized them almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, welcome back. I see you\u2019ve come to enjoy our fine foods once more, isn\u2019t it? <br>\r\nWell, that\u2019s truly good. As you can see there is already a few people in here but, we will find you the perfect table for you all. On and, by the way, have you thought about the discount offer we\u2019ve proposed yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm and Kitty had discussed it during the trip and, finally, Kitty managed to convince Ororo about the usefulness of the offer. So, as the waiter accompanied them toward a table close to the buffets, and within range  of the finishing beltways, they both accepted their offer, making sure that also her missing friend, Rogue, was inserted into the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSplendid! Now, here\u2019s your table. Should you need anything, please to let us know. Enjoy your meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waiter moved off, Kitty was already standing and closing in toward the buffet, under the stupefied gaze of Ororo. Still, spurred by her Kitten actions, also she rose from the table and moved closer to the buffets, searching for something that intrigued her. After a few minutes, both girls returned to their table, each with her fair share of plates. Kitty was first with just a couple of plates filled with apple fritters and a smallish tray with buttery cookies and a tall glass of chocolate milk. Ororo, instead, returned with two small trays filled by \u00e9clairs and jelly filled donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls seated, both began enjoying the food, unaware that the kitchen staff had been already informed by the owner and filled each of their portions with appetite stimulant and metabolism suppressors. As the two mutants ate with abandon, each could feel her own hunger rising the more she ate. Until both stopped tasting their food but simply swallowed it as fast as they could. Leaving their plates almost licked clean, both Ororo and Kitty shared a look of ravenous hunger and, same as before, both rose from their seats to fill their plates once more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs time passed both girls made trip after trip toward the buffet lines, bringing more and more food each and every time they rose, due to this their uniforms, already snug to begin with began to get tighter and tighter across their bodies. Storm, as she had already a dozen plates under her belt, could feel her pants cutting tightly in her mid-section, so much so she began to unfasten her belt and opening them up, to give her growing belly more and more room to expand. Kitty, instead, didn\u2019t seemed fazed by the fact that her uniform was stretching out to accommodate her bloating figure. She was feeling so ravenous that even when the spandex like cloth began to tear at her belly button, she still kept shoveling food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the mansion, Rogue wasn\u2019t faring much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Jean care, for the last two hours, she had kept eating whatever the other woman brought to her, making short work of burgers, hot dogs and chicken wings by the pound as Jean seemed an indefatigable cooking machine. The once lean mutant was looking quite bloated already, her belly ballooning out under her very eyes and yet, as she was presented with yet another platter, this time  filled with ribs almost submerged in BBQ sauce, she still leaned forward to munch at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was feeling ecstatic. Rogue seemed to be insatiable, and yet, she knew that sooner or later she had to slow down. Otherwise all that her growing buddy had eaten was going to be wasted when she would feel sick. But, for sure, she was going to give her another round of burgers before stopping. And then, maybe, it could be the case to use the special medicine she had bought just for similar cases?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, instead, was already feeling quite sated, and yet she kept going, knowing that Jean had only the best interests toward her. Still, as she cleared ribs after ribs, she couldn\u2019t lie to herself that she wasn\u2019t enjoying all that food. In truth, it wasn\u2019t as good as the one from the buffet but, it still was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept going, her belly still bloated up more and more, already filling her lap and starting to mash against the table, as her uniform too began to stretch way too much and a slight sound of stitches under pressure could barely be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter countless trips to the buffet line, Both Kitty and Ororo were feeling stuffed and tired, and yet, both were still quite famished. Their figures had bloated out even more, with Storm almost bursting out of her clothes. For which she decided to get her jacket off, leaving herself with just her top, now used mostly as a bra, and her pants, left wide open with her belly pooching over it. The African beauty had lost count of how many plates she had consumed. Last number she remembered had been plate sixteen. Yet, as full as she was feeling, she still felt a powerful hunger begging her to get more food. But she was way too tired to simply move from her seat. Her body had, once again ballooned in every direction, although her hips and ass seemed to have absorbed the most from her meal. Already she was slightly overflowing the chair on which she was seated, and her hands were rather busy kneading and massaging the large, bloated, belly that protruded in front of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty wasn\u2019t faring any better, she was even in worse condition. <br>\r\nLast plate she remembered taking was plate twenty-three, but after that her hunger had been too much to control and she soon found herself in a whirlwind of gluttony that now left her speechless, breathless and as mobile as a beached whale.<br>\r\nHer suit had ripped apart all around her midsection, leaving her bare belly to jut forward, filled up to the max with delicious, fattening food, and yet, she too was feeling still rather famished for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the two bloated la(r)dies were unable to move, one of the waiters approached providing a solution to their problems\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not even for a moment this event worried them, as they both were too filled up with food to think clearly but, as much as stuffed they were, they still were hungry for more. Which was quite a predicament for they couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the waiters, though, seeing as the two that their boss wanted to get as round as possible, noticed the situation they were in and moved closer to them to propose a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, I see you\u2019ve enjoyed your meal\u2026but are you done or would you rather keep going after a breather?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-More\u2026still\u2026so hungry\u2026but, so\u2026tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Storm was surprised by how easily and rapidly she had answered back to the waiter and yet, it was the truth. Kitty, opposite to her, couldn\u2019t answer but, as she hiccupped, she nodded in agreement to her friend statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ladies, since you\u2019re Special Guest, we have a solution to your problems. A few of my colleagues will help you go to a private room we have in the back. There, you shall be able to continue your meal without the need to move a finger. Would that be ok with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls nodded, a fleet of young waiters moved toward them, assisting them into standing and accompanying them toward the private room where they could resume their meal. As the two were moved away, the main waiter looked at them and wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>They\u2019re already this big and it\u2019s only lunch time\u2026True, for the most part is bloating but\u2026how big will they get in the feeding room?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mansion, Rogue was feeling just as her friends were at the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stuffed full, completely filled up to the gills, and yet, Jean was still seemingly cooking more. The once lean, now resembling more of a ball with arms and legs, mutant, could only stare with desperation as the other woman kept preparing more and more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jean\u2026? I\u2026I think\u2026I\u2019ve had\u2026enuff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman though seemed deaf to her pleads, until she turned around and cleaned away the last remnants of the massive midmorning \u2018snack\u2019 she had provided to her friend, which had lasted up to almost lunchtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know Rogue. You silly, we can\u2019t have you eating all the time...\" '<i>For now, at least)</i>' \"...You may rest a bit and take a nap\u2026I\u2019ll wake you up as soon as its lunch time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words Rogue blessedly fell almost immediately asleep, but as she slept away her humongous meal, Jean moved closer to the bloated heroine, caressing her filled up body, where the suit hadn\u2019t ripped yet. As she inspected her friend, heavily snoring, Jean wondered dreamily at how larger and girthier she could manage to make her before she would realize it. In truth, she had a way to ensure Rogue growth but, she was afraid of using it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2018<i>I could use those drugs I bought\u2026But would it be fair? And yet, when another occasion like this could present itself to me?<br>\r\nIf I don\u2019t use it now, when will I?<br>\r\nNo, there isn\u2019t time to be picky. Don\u2019t worry Rogue, will manage to bring you blimp sized before you may have time to say Cake\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, then, as she kept preparing the lunch she had promised Rogue, while making sure that their fellows X-Men weren\u2019t going to intrude on them, she simply added a few drops of one of the drugs she had brought on the black market, this being a powerful appetite enhancer. The other, she had acquired through a common enough store, being bulk-up powder to be used through gain shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lunchtime approached, barely an hour later, Jean began to sweetly prod Rogue awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWakey, wakey. It\u2019s time for Lunch, AnneMarie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026How much\u2026have I\u2026slept?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue felt groggy and, still, a bit stuffed. Yet, her stomach getting used to be fed such massive portions, already began to grumble a bit asking to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean smiled innocently and, shamelessly, lied to her friend, telling her that she had slept way over the real thirty minutes that it had been, then, without further ado, she began giving to her widening friend what was going to be only nominally considered lunch. The woman began by leaving a plate with two Double Bacon Cheeseburgers, with bacon and fries to the side, along with two tall glasses of shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Rogue. You may start with this\u2026I\u2019ll bring next course in a few.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, shaking away the last of her grogginess, leaned forward and, feeling more comfortable, she moved closer to the plate and grabbed the first double burger with both hands, giving it a big bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the enhancer went to work within her system and Rogue felt herself growing hungrier and hungrier by the bite. She still, didn\u2019t worry though. Between the subliminal orders from Professor X and the fact that at the buffet she had felt the same, she didn\u2019t worry herself about it. Preferring instead to simply let her hunger and gluttony drive her from there. Jean kept providing plateful after plateful, slightly increasing the portions she was giving to her friend, and yet Rogue kept cleaning each and every plate she received. Her body working overtime to process all those calories it was receiving, quickly storing them as fat in order to speed up the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue\u2019s body seemed to literally balloon as more and more food went eaten, her hourglass figure quickly changing in a more rounding shape. Sure her breast and ass still were growing massively but, her belly too had begun growing larger and larger. Her ass soon began to overflow the chair she was seated on, while her breasts started to move to either side of her, pushed away by the dome of a belly she was getting. Jean, seeing this development, began to try cooking faster and faster, wanting to enjoy the show as much as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the buffet, instead, both Storm and Kitty had been finally moved to their special private room, this one was as luxurious as it could be. Extremely comfortable couches, massive stout tables, there were even two massive 52\u201d flat screens, one in front of each of the girls. Both girls were ecstatic about the location but, as their hungry bellies rumbled, they still were feeling quite hungry. Yet the waiters quickly positioned them on a massive, comfortable, couch and soon left, replaced by a few guys dressed as chef\u2019s which moved closer to the two ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one closest to Kitty, brought forward an iPad, on which there was represented which way the meal was going to be served. As Kitty scrolled through the menus, her new double chin slightly squished against the other, she finally decided to go with the option called \u2018\u00e0 la carte\u2019 which meant that food was going to be brought to her by one of the waiters there, until she asked for it to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, which also was checking through a similar booklet, was undecided. Each choice seemed good but, in the end, her belly decided for her. With a grumbling sound louder than the usual, her finger stopped on the \u2018Beltway\u2019 method. <br>\r\nAt that, Storm\u2019s waiter nodded and in no time a portable mechanical beltway was mounted and directed toward the African mutant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her was given a small remote through which she could select the speed of the belt transporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, both girls began to go back at their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, quickly cleaned plateful after plateful, almost uncaring toward what was brought to her. Her waiter moved each plate to her, letting her clean it out completely before getting a new one from a trolley stationed nearby. Shadowcat suit\u2019s began to rip more and more, tearing apart not only at her mid-section but also at her thighs, as her entire body was seemingly filling up. And yet, the girl couldn\u2019t stop herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger she felt was pushing her to have more and more, as she started to act more and more piggishly, with smears of food on her face and uneaten bits falling on her bloating breasts and belly. Her plates soon began to be overfilled with fried up concoctions of chickens, burgers, sausages. At a certain point even ice creams and cakes that were given to her had been previously fried, granting them this crunchy fried cover to their cold insides. Kitty enjoyed each plate to the fullest and seemed unstoppable in her consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, instead, at first had started to regret her chosen method. Food was brought forward though the transporter directly into her mouth, all she had to do was to open up her lips and munch and swallow. Yet, also she was making a mess of herself, with bits of food falling all over her breasts and shoulders. That happened until a waiter noticed and simply adjusted the output of the transporter, making so that it would go perfectly into Storm open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point, the weather controlling mutant simply abandoned herself to the pleasure of filling her gut up, feeling her hunger getting sated and, yet, increased at her every bite. As Kitty was filling out nicely, getting herself quite rounded, Ororo was getting fuller mostly in her ass and hips, as they began to grow wider and larger, as more calories entered her body. But she didn\u2019t care or noticed, all of her focus was on the next mouthful she was receiving, be it a massive triple patty hamburger, a whole pizza pie, in slices, or even a massive cake. As she gulped down each item, she could almost feel it heaviness falling int her overfilled gut, rapidly being converted into fat to make room for more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly she rubbed her eyes and looked around her own room. <br>\r\nWhen she first got here she did't really knew what to think. She was a mutant. Most people were't too fond of mutants. They made that very clear. Then she went living here. But to be honest it was't so bad here. This was her new home and to be honest she felt very good here. It felt like home. All other persons here felt like... well family. Sure there were rules, and if you broke them there was a chance you were punished but that's everywhere. <br>\r\nBut what was the best thing was that her powers were here not strange or different. Everyone here had powers. Perhaps not the same like her but still they had something special that made them 1 force. The X-men.<br>\r\nSlowly the young teen sat up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that was a good night sleep. Now I would like some breakfast. I gotta admit I'm pretty hungry. Like, don't you agree Rogue? Rogue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look at the bed of her roommate and saw it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she up already? Ah well. Like, it doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed some clothes, got dressed and walked downstairs. She walked right through the kitchen door and looked around. No one was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one here. Probably enjoying their free day. But breakfast totally is, like, the most important meal of the day, and I'm starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon grabbed some bread and made four peanut butter jelly sandwiches and a big glass of orange juice for herself and started her breakfast. The tasted pretty good. Soon the sandwiches disappeared in her belly. She let out a soft girly: \"burp!\" and giggled. But for some strange reason she noticed she was still hungry. She grabbed the box of cereal and poured a big bowl full of cereal, whole milk and also poured some sugar over it. She just liked cereal more when there was a lot of sugar on top of it. Some others told her that there was already sugar in the cereal but telling her that was a lost cause. She just liked it more with sugar. And with no body else around she could do all she liked without receiving criticism. But after her first bowl, she noticed she still didn't feel full and took a second bowl before she was really full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Guess I was more hungry then I thought. Ah well I'm a growing girl after all.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe lifted her shirt a bit and looked at her belly and slowly rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hmm. That feels good. Well I'm really full now.\"<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty slowly got up still rubbing her belly wondering what to do with her free day and decided to watch some T.V. Perhaps a funny cartoon or sitcom. Problem was that a lot of others thought that those shows were a bit childish and rather watched something else. Still she wondered why she suddenly was so hungry. She was so lost in thoughts she bumped against Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch were you're going half pined.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry Wolverine. I was a bit lost in thoughts. What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take my bike for a ride. Sometimes a man just wants to be on his own without kids around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked over her shoulder while Wolverine walked further. She had sometimes mixed thoughts about him. He sometimes acted a bit grumpy and sometimes had a bit of a temper, but at the same time she knew he could be very nice. He would never hurt her or the other kids around here. If someone would attack her or one of the other kids, she would almost feel sorry for that person. Wolverine would go totally berserk at that that person. So he was nice and friendly but did't always show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the living room . No one inside. She wondered why all the others were. Maybe outside playing. Well better for her. Then she could watch T.V without anyone else asking to change the channel. She watched T.V for about one and a half hour but suddenly noticed she was hungry again. She did't understand why. It was't like she did anything other then normal. She did't used anything. So why did she suddenly had such a big appetite. Perhaps puberty? Growth spurt? She must admit she would like it to grow a bit taller and got some more female curves.<br>\r\nShe walked into the kitchen and after looking around for some time she found three bars of chocolate, on box of cookies, two family sized bag of chips and a two liter bottle of coke. She carried it all back to the T.V. As soon as her butt hit the couch she started stuffing the first chocolate bar in her mouth. She quickly finished him and started on the second. After that one was gone she devoured the third one in a record time and drank some of the coke. after that she started on the cookies. Eating them one by one taking sips of coke every now and then. After they were gone she ripped open the first bag of chips and pushed them in her mouth. To much focused on the T.V shows to really notice how full she was getting. She even finished the second bag of chips. After that she emptied the bottle of coke and let out a huge belch.<br>\r\nThe teen laid lazy on the couch. Crumbs of cookies and chips around her mouth. Her belly a bit bloated thanks to her current snacks. She Finally turned the T.V of and looked at the empty box, two empty bags, some empty wrapper and one empty bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men did I eat all that? I did't even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe she suddenly felt how full she really felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Now I believe I ate it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lifted her shirt a bit showing her bloated belly. She pushed with her finger a bit in her belly button but finally started rubbing her belly and it did work. Slowly the full feeling got less. She lazy kept laying at the couch slowly she closed her eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty slowly opened her eyes. Suddenly she remembered why she was in the living room. She saw the remains of her snacks. She fast stuffed the empty bags and wrappers in the empty box of cookies and threw it in the garbage bin. <br>\r\nShe'd really made a pig of herself. But no one had been around to see it so it didn't really matter. She brushed the crumbs off her face. She suddenly noticed all the crumbs on her shirt and a few chocolate stains. While she stuffed the chocolate bars in her mouth, some small pieces fell of and had melted causing some brown stains. She walked upstairs straight to her room. She pulled off her shirt and looked for a new clean one. A minute later she walked back downstairs in a clean shirt. <br>\r\nSuddenly Nightcrawler appeared in a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kurt! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kitty. I just wanted to tell you we gonna have lunch. It's such nice weather so we decided to eat lunch outside. Do you come too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty thought about her recent snack. She really shouldn't. If she kept eating like this she would turn into a blimp in a few days. At the other hand she would like a bite to eat. How was that possible? She should have a tummy ache from eating so much food. Was something totally wrong with her? Perhaps she should ask Charles Xavier, or else Hank McCoy. <br>\r\nThey were both the two smartest people she knew. Or the smartest mutants. But according to Charles Xavier mutants were people who were just a bit more evolved. Perhaps one of them knew what was going on with her.<br>\r\nShe thought again about the lunch. Lunch did sound good and she didn't had a weight problem yet so one day of overeating wouldn't change that. Would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'll come too. Lunch sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later she came outside. Everyone was sitting at a table or on the field. One mutant ran around in her dog form with a sandwich between her jaws. She went sitting next to Kurt and grabbed two sandwiches and a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been doing all day? I have't seen you?\" Rogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much. Watched some T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also made a total pig out of myself, she thought but she didn't say that. She stopped thinking that quickly since Jean or Xavier could hear that thought in her mind. However they probably wouldn't tell anyone. But still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Wolverine?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I've seen him. Don't go bother looking for him. He went away on his bike. If he doesn't want to be found... you don't find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you have someone who's good at following tracks. Like Sabretooth.\" Spyke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I really hate that guy. He's so scary and mean,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hate him?\" Kurt asked. \"That goes double for Wolverine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or even triple,\" Spyke said. \"Those two really hate each other.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty already finished her first two sandwiches and grabbed two more. She hoped no one would notice how much she consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her side and saw Scott and Jean in the shadow of a tree. Eating and kissing. She felt a bit jealous. She would also like it to have a boyfriend. Well you had Lance who seemed to like her. But she didn't like him. Every time when Lance was in a bad mood he made an earthquake. And his friends weren't really people she liked to hang out with. Especially Toad. He ate insects and had the hygiene of a dead pig. Also the place they lived looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. What probably was the case.<br>\r\nShe sighed and grabbed another two sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Kitty. That are you fifth and sixth sandwich,\" Kurt said. \"Are you feeling all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess I'm just a little bit... hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I would touch you long enough\u2026 would I then also gain some of your weight, or only your appetite?\" Rogue asked with a naughty grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never find out, you rechargeable battery,\" Kitty said grinding her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after her sixth sandwich she stopped eating. She must admit she did start to feel full.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty walked to her room and sat on her bed. She was a bit angry at what Rogue said. Maybe Rogue just made a joke, but she said what Kitty was scared of. If she did keep eating like this she would lose her body for sure. She liked her body. Sure she would like it to have some more rounder female curves and to grow a few inches but she was slender and she was proud of that. She didn't want her flat stomach to turn into a overinflated beach ball. Then Rogue would really have something to laugh about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell down on her bed and looked at the ceiling, thinking about what could have caused her hunger. Puberty? Sure that could cause some hunger but not this much. Did she ate anything strange or drink something strange? She couldn't think of anything. Not anything she didn't had before. At least not that she could remember. But she wasn't sure. Of course if she knew this would happen she would have put a little more attention to what she had been eating and doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her hand went right through her drawer and came back with a bag of candy. She liked it to chew on something when she was thinking. She kept pushing one piece of candy in her mouth after another and didn't notice how much she ate. At least not until she noticed the bag was empty. Had she eaten the entire bag? It had been pretty full. She looked at her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This late already?  Better get down or I'll be late for dinner. Hm I could of course....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she faded right through her bed, through the floor and dropped out of the ceiling landing perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can go down being perfect on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly all other members gathered at the table for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for dinner?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turkey, mashed potatoes and green beans.\" Storm answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked with open mouth. She loved Turkey, and mashed potatoes. Green beans were fine but not special. Suddenly she knew the growing rumbly feeling in her belly. She wanted to eat. No! She wanted to pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPull yourself together Kitty she said to herself. You can't go making a pig of yourself. You're a human not a pig. She smiled a second at the thought that her name Kitty was also the name of a animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she did grab a lot of food. She was able to eat well mannered. Ate without dropping anything on her clothes. But the food went down pretty fast.Turkey with greasy gravy and mashed potatoes went down so fast she barely had time to chew.  After her first plate she took a second, and even a third. During her third plate she started noticing others were looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She asked. \"Do I have something on my face?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling all right?\" Storm asked. \"This is already your third plate. Normally you never eat so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just love Turkey and mashed potatoes,\" Kitty mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You maybe do but your clothes don't,\" Rogue whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty wanted to give her a mean look but saw she had been right. Her belly was, thanks to all snacking and not yet digested food, pretty round and poked out between her pants and shirt. She blushed and hoped no one else had seen it. <br>\r\nAfter the last piece of food went past her lips she decided she was full for now. But she had't counted that Storm came with cake. She cut the cake in perfect slices. Kitty couldn't help herself. She grabbed with both hands a slice of cake and pushed them in her mouth. Suddenly she realized what she had done and looked around. Most people looked a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think I'm feeling well. Sorry I... I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she ran to her room she noticed she really didn't feel good. She had a terrible tummy ache. No wonder if you realized how much food  was in it. She felt terrible. Her belly made gurgling noises in protest of being so incredibly full. She was in so much pain. In her room she quickly unbuttoned her jeans. At least it took some of the pressure off her belly. But still she was in a lot of pain and was hearing constant gurgling noises from her belly. Suddenly she remembered how good it felt if she rubbed her belly. She put both hands on her belly and started rubbing. Her belly felt kind of hard, like a bag of wet cement. Probably because of all the food inside it. She started rubbing her round belly. It did feel good and the pain did become a bit less. She continued rubbing her belly. It felt so good she didn't even notice that she fell asleep.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Her belly rumbled and wanted food. Even after having a terrible tummy ache last night. But that was yesterday. That food had digested by now. She wanted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be this hungry? I don't understand. I really need to ask the professor what's wrong with me. Or else Mr. McCoy. He's smart. But I'm so hungry. What should I do first? Hmmm, guess talking with the professor is easier on a full stomach. Besides it's not like he's going anywhere. I can take a breakfast and ask him afterwards. Good idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked downstairs. She hoped she didn't see anyone. She didn't liked her sudden hunger attacks but still she ate. But no body else needed to know that. She walked further and listened. She heard a lot of voices outside. Well it was a nice sunny day. Perhaps she could go swimming. If the water was warm enough. It would be a nice chance to wear her new bikini.<br>\r\nIn the kitchen she saw Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Wolverine. How was yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine. Sometimes I just need to blow of some steam kiddo. But I need to work on my bike. If anyone needs me I'll be in the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon if he left, she grabbed bread and peanut butter and jelly and made five peanut butter jelly sandwiches just for herself. She also poured in a tall glass of orange juice and fast stuffed the sandwiches in her mouth. They tasted good. She must admit that. That was why she was sad they were gone that fast. She decided to finish it with a few bowls of cereal with a lot of sugar. But instead of the two bowls from yesterday she ate three entire bowls. It seemed like it only got worse and worse everyday. This way she soon would be a blimp. <br>\r\nSuddenly she saw her belly poking out between her pants and shirt. She sometimes wore shirts that showed her belly but not in this way. And those times her belly was flat. Not round. She tried to pull her shirt down but it rode up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid shirt. I wish someone washed it in too hot water. But I know that's probably not what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran back to her room and looked in her closet for a bigger shirt. She soon found one made sure it hide her belly. She brushed her hair a bit and decided she looked presentable enough and ran downstairs.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw professor Xavier behind his desk and also Storm. Storm looked doubt full at her like if she knew something was wrong with her. She also saw Beast. It was sill a bit strange for her to see her old teacher with blue fur and claws but knew very well he had a heart made of gold and would rather fight with words and science then with his muscles. But if he needed to do that he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Kitty. Nice to see you. Why do you come to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's about the cake don't worry,\" Storm said. \"I've made plenty more. Besides you seemed to feel bad after\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that. But I did feel bad afterwards but that's not it. I seemed to have suddenly since yesterday a huge appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's something to worry about Kitty. If you're hungry you just need to eat. You're a growing girl.\" Professor Xavier said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No professor! It's not just a bit more. It's a lot more! I seem to don't have control! It started yesterday,\" Kitty said and started a list about what she all had consumed yesterday until the two slices of cake and the terrible tummy ache afterwards. \"And today I woke up with a terrible hunger. I already ate five peanut butter jelly sandwiches and three bowls of cereal. Being a bit hungry I can understand that but this is not normal. Not for me. I have a small appetite. Now I have a appetite like The Blob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That is strange. It seemed you can suddenly eat about three times what you normally eat. Just suddenly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since yesterday morning. Could it have something to do with my mutant powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never heard mutant powers effect someones appetite. Except maybe like someone like The Blob. I don't see any reason why your body would suddenly want more food. Did you do or eat anything strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can think of no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it might have something to do with her mind,\" Beast said. \"When your stomach is full it gives a sign to your brain so it knows it's full. If your appetite suddenly is so out of control it might be that someone is playing a trick at you. playing with your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean a telepath? Like professor X?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Jean,\" Professor X said. \"But I did't do anything and I know Jean would't do anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Emma frost? The white witch?\" Storm suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could do that,\" Professor X said. \"But I seriously doubt it. Why would she do that? give Kitty a bigger appetite or making her gain weight I don't see how that would help her. That's not her style. But perhaps another telepath. This seems like just teasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just teasing?\" Kitty yelled. I'm at risk of losing my body. I already have one shirt that's to small and\u2026 I don't wanna get fat.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe other three looked at her<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This one I'm now, and one that only wants to fill her belly. Not really caring about anything else. Not really caring what it is as long if it's edible. That's gonna ruin my perfect figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you don't want that but what do you want us to do?\" Storm asked. \"Change your appetite back to normal? We would love to but we don't know how. But we will look if we can find anything until then\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty walked out with a bowed head. Like someone who had been sentenced to death. She know what soon would happen. Soon she would be hungry again and ate a large meal. She could try to stop it, but was aware that it wouldn't do any good. She knew her hunger kept growing and growing until she couldn't control it and she stuffed herself. She might as well just eating large meals. Eating large meals would make her gain but maybe keep her hunger enough under control so she didn't made a total pig of herself. Otherwise Rogue would really have something to tease her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how it all started. Kitty did what she could trying to eat enough so her hungry side wouldn't take over. It did work most of the time. Lucky for her it was summer vacation. At school she wasn't allowed to eat during classes. However the eating of large meals did take a toll on her body. Slowly she started gaining all over her body.   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Kitty hadn't told anyone else about her hunger attacks except for Kurt. Professor X, Beast and Storm did their best to not let anyone else notice her problem by giving her some extra food she could consume in her room without anyone else knowing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did this happened to her?  Who did this. Was it really a telepath?  Then where was he? At school? Or was it a telepath or something else? Perhaps a mutant? Maybe just a disease? That would probably be the best option. In that case she wasn't alone and it was obvious it wasn't her fault. And who knows? Perhaps they would find a cure. If there was a cure.<br>\r\nShe stretched herself once and looked in her mirror. She really liked her mirror. She took it from home. It was a full length mirror so she could see her whole body in it. When she was a little girl she could spend hours in front of it. Dressing herself up. Many times in her mother's clothes, wearing her mother's make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off her night shirt and looked at her naked body. Her new potbelly. But when she looked higher she noticed some thing. Her boobs. She slowly put her hands on them and squeezed softly a bit. They were bigger. A least a entire cup size. She looked carefully at her body. The extra weight at her butt made it more curvy. The same went for her thighs. Even her arms gained some of the weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe know some people gained around their waist and other in their butt and thighs but it seemed she gained all over her body. Well that wasn't so bad. But the more she looked at her body, the better she felt. Those extra pounds. It didn't look so bad at here. Gave her a bit more female look while her face was still as pretty as before giving her something\u2026 cute. All that eating made her gain weight but had that been a bad thing? It didn't look that bad at her. She never would have realized this if she would't have gained. Perhaps she would look even better with even more pounds. Would she really gain on purpose? That was crazy. On the other hand why not? She realized it didn't matter at all. She would gain anyway. On purpose of not. The calories of those huge meals need to go somewhere. She would gain anyway. But perhaps that wasn't so bad. Was fat unhealthy? Well tell that to those girls who smoked a dozen cigarettes each day. Or the boys who drank half a dozen beers each day. Or the ones who used drugs. It was all wrong. Well those beers weren't really bad as long if you didn't drink to much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides those health problems only come when your dangerously overweight. I'm not near that. I'm just a bit chubby. Well I won't be for long. I'll gain weight everyday. I might as well enjoy it. Why is becoming fat so bad? I mean, like, there's anorexia everywhere or people totally starving in Africa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softly stroke with her hands over her new curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's decided. I'm gonna gain weight. Well I was gonna do that anyway but now I'm gonna like it.\"   <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She kept eating huge meals, not really caring what it was. At least it stopped her from losing control and eat everything in sight. Some of the others thought it was a bit strange. It was obvious she gained a lot of weight in a short amount of time. But at the other hand she liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wobbling butt, and her rubbing thighs. Also her upper arms got flabby. Her cheeks were now pink and puffy and she had a second chin now. Her chest was bigger and of course her belly had taken a lot of the weight. She stuffed her belly swollen, bloated and round at every meal. It always shrunk a bit after the food digested, but then there was more fat added to the rest of her body. And her belly was bigger then before the stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly she poked her belly button. Her deep belly button. Before she started gaining she didn't had such a deep bellybutton. She enjoyed her new deep belly button and her new flab. It was soft and squishy. Also were warm and felt kind of nice. It was even fun to play with. She liked playing with it but that was only after the food had been digested. That meant she would soon be hungry again. After she had eaten her belly was round and stuffed like a balloon and kind of hard and less fun to play with since it was usually too full to bounce up and down rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and Storm walked in with a bag and got out three big pizzas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" Storm said. \"This should be enough to keep you full until dinner. I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Storm. I really appreciate it. But I really need to eat. I mean if I don't eat my hunger takes over. And then another Kitty takes over. The only way to stop her from taking over is eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so bad for you. Before Professor X found me I lived on the street. I was hungry a lot of the time. I know it's not fun to be hungry. But what you have is even worse. You're hungry and gaining like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do Beast and Professor X have any idea what happened to me what caused this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they did they would have told you. Don't you think? They don't have a idea. Perhaps you're right and it does have something to do with you mutation. Being able to pass through walls and things. I never heard of something like that but at the other hand how many people can go through walls? But it does't make sense. Why would you mutation cause you to get a huge appetite, while all others have a normal appetite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Do you think I like it?\" Kitty asked with a very full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no. However you do seem less stressed and less sad about your weight gain. Perhaps it is possible someone else is doing this. The question is: who is it? and : Why does he do it? I don't seem why he would do this. Or perhaps it's just a prank. Did you make some enemies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" Kitty mumbled with her still full mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got some work to do.

The next moment her zipper was forced all the way down, letting Kitty belly flow out like a river. Kitty smiled seeing how fat she had gotten she massaged her belly. This wasn't the first button she lost. She lost another pants button a day or two ago and a few on her blouses. She knew there was one thing that she needed to do. Go clothes shopping. She looked in her wallet. Just enough to buy about two outfits. But just to be sure maybe it was better to buy them a few sizes bigger. Then she had some room to grow. That was a good idea. Perhaps also look for some elastic clothing. That would, at least, last longer. She normally didn't wore much elastic pants but back then she was a skinny twig. It would be a part of her new lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she looked in the closet. She found one elastic pants that would fit around her tummy. She put her new pants on and walked out of her room. Downstairs there was suddenly a cloud of smoke and Kurt appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kitty. What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing special. Just going out. You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really are in that gaining thing. If I wouldn't have been here the past weeks and I saw you, I would think you would be Kitty's twin sister who has troubles with her weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt you know I can't help it. If I don't eat enough I going totally crazy eating anything I can get my hands on. I emptied the entire fridge one evening. If I don't eat enough, at dinner I would eat my food and that of everybody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why didn't you tell anyone except me, Beast, Storm and Professor X?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because\u2026 Well... they're adults. They're looking out for us. They wanna help us. Besides they're trying to find out what's wrong with me, and help me. But to do that they need to know about well the hunger. And as for you\u2026 well... you're my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that. I just don't get why you didn't tell the others. They will understand. Everyone has their problems. Now they just think you're a gluttonous pig. Not that you can't help it. However you are now fine with the wei...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Kitty slapped her hands around his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want the whole institute to hear us? I don't want anyone else to know that. Now I going to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty froze. Then she turned to him with a playfully mean grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna come with me... a girl... to the mall\u2026 to buy clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I guess so. I just offered that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Why not? Sure you can come. But believe me. It's better if you put another face on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt pushed at his watch and his blue skin turned into a normal skin color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can go.\"     <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Nothing strange about that. Just being normal for once. Fine, the reason that she needed new clothes wasn't normal. But she really needed new clothes. If she didn't get bigger clothes soon, she would need to start wearing bed sheets and/or sumo sized diapers. And with her still gaining with no end in sight, that might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they reached the clothing store, Kitty felt the familiar rumbly, gurgly feeling in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" She mumbled. \"Please not now. I just ate several pizzas. Come on... hold on. Oh crap I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't believe it but... I'm hungry. Kurt I really need to eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt looked around and saw a fast food joint. He grabbed Kitty by her hand and dragged her in. He pushed her down on a chair went away to get some food. But Kitty's hunger started to take over. Suddenly she saw some other people left leaving a half eaten burger and some fries. Normally Kitty wouldn't think about this but this wasn't normal. She wolfed down the burger and the cold weak fries. Barely taking time to taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw some other people looking a bit shocked at her. She smiled weakly, waving at them with mustard and ketchup smeared around her lips. They slowly waved back.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty looked pained. That small bite didn't even came close to stopping her hunger. That was slowly starting to take over. She looked around. There must be a way. She couldn't just start eating the food of someone else. Where was Kurt? She saw him standing at the counter. She ran over to him. Kitty reached him just as the first food item was put on his tray. She grabbed it and pushed it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Sorry kid. But this man...\" The man behind the counter started but Kurt stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. She's with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pulled up one eyebrow and lifted his shoulders and put the other food on Kurt's tray. Kurt walked back to their table with their tray while Kitty already started eating. He put the tray down and Kitty started eating like she hadn't eaten in days. Her gut told otherwise, while she ate all the food on the tray.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This problem was of course was totally different from most teenager problems. This had nothing to do with money, boyfriends or clothes. This was something totally new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still hungry,\" Kitty mumbled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still? Are you really still\u2026\" Kurt started but stopped when he saw Kitty's face. \"Fine I'll get some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was really still hungry. But with some food in her belly and knowing Kurt would soon be back with more was probably enough to not start eating everything in sight. But if she wasn't totally full the hunger would probably start again. Hopefully this would be enough for her. Hopefully the next hunger attack would be at the institute. She had peace with her weight gain but the hunger attacks were still a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are,\" Kurt said. \"I hope it's enough because I have no more pocket money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt bad when she heard this. She realized Kurt has been paying for this food with his own pocket money. That you would pay for your female friend was fine but not when she was eating like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry Kurt. I'll totally pay you back. I promise! But that might take some time. I need to use the money I have now for new clothes because I'll, like, soon outgrew these. Then I need to wait again before I have more pocket money but I promise you I'll pay you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Kitty started stuffing her face. Kitty didn't leave a single crumb but when the last bite of food went past her lips she must admit she felt\u2026 full now. She slowly opened her mouth and\u2026. \"BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRP!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked up disturbed by the very loud and big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Excuse me.\" Kitty mumbled with a red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bowed her head and saw that part of her tummy was poking out between her pants and shirt. Her shirt rode up a bit. It gave a good view at her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10,\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said: 10. You ate 10 large meals. I'm not sure Kitty but it looks like that hunger of yours gets bigger each day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right. Well better go get some clothes now. Now my belly is so totally full, I can, like, be sure the clothes'll fit around my big belly when it's full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out, getting some strange stares from other people as Kitty burped loudly every few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do *BBAAAURRRAAAPP* people maybe *OOOOUUUURRRRPPP* think I'm, like, pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. People who are pregnant have big round bloated bellies. Also bigger boobs because they're gonna be filled with milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a big *UUURRRRAAAPPP* round belly. My boobs also got *BBBBURRRRRPPPP* bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like your thighs, butt, arms and face. Those don't get bigger with pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the clothing store. Kitty fast walked to the part she normally went but soon realized that those clothes wouldn't fit her anymore. But after looking a bit they found clothes for bigger woman. Kitty grabbed several clothes and took them to a dressing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to stay here Kurt,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand you don't want me to see you undress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too but you need to tell me which outfits look best at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026.

Either they were too tight that they nearly ripped open upon starting to go over her tummy or weren't big enough. Finally, Kitty decided to try the new pants she'd picked out, hoping they wouldn't be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wrong. The first pair didn't even make it to her hips before becoming too tight. She bounced up and down, trying to force them up, only to make her belly and boobs jiggle in the process. The second pair did slightly better, but were too tight on her big plump butt while the third pair was similar to the first. Finally, Kitty just pulled on her old clothes and came back out to Kurt, who'd been waiting for her to show him the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, nothing totally fits me!\" Kitty groaned in dismay. \"Really? Nothing at all?\" Kurt asked with concern. \"No! Like, either I'm too big or they're not big enough or both!

Kitty merely nodded and let out a hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try a new plus sized store that opened two doors down? It's called Big, Plump Girls. They should have some clothes that'll fit you there.\" the woman smiled gently. \"Like, thanks.\" Kitty smiled as she handed the clothes over to the woman before she and Kurt went over to said store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gainer part of her liked that she was to fat for normal clothes. But there was another part of her that felt a bit embarrassed that she was to fat for regular clothes. However there was also a clothing store for fat girls. That was a good thing. When she was thin, she sometimes saw fat girls trying to squeeze themselves in the biggest clothes they had in the store. The only reason they took that clothes were because they were the only ones that fit them more or less. But to be honest Kitty didn't even would be found dead in those clothes. Perhaps they had some nice clothes for fat girls here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're in the right place. I'm sure we can find some clothes for you here,\" Kurt mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked around. She realized Kurt was right. There were a lot of fat girls around them.

Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon found the place were there were clothes for girls of Kitty's age and Kitty must admit there were a lot of nice clothes. She picked several of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Kitty. I don't know how much money you have but I don't think it's enough for all of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not.

Telling himself that he would never agree on going to a clothing store with a girl. But finally, after trying on many outfits, Kitty bought the ones that looked best. She probably would come back here again. She needed clothes for her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kurt I would say the shopping was, like, totally a success. I found a lot of nice clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for us to go back to the institute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.

Within minutes, she came back with four jumbo burritos and eight grande sized tacos. Kurt just watched in disbelief as Kitty devoured the next meal with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on and on it went. Kitty, following her Mexican food gorge, went to a Chinese stand, ordering a large amount of said food and destroyed that. Then, she ate about a month's worth of pizza from a pizza stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her pizza feast, Kurt thought for sure that Kitty would be stuffed, but was proven wrong when Kitty got up and, much more bloated now, staggered slightly over to a fried chicken place and ordered a Super Mega Jumbo bucket of fried chicken. Finally, after eating the last piece (not leaving a piece of meat on the bones), Kitty leaned back, rubbing her now evidently full tummy as it bulged against the table, now covered in remains from the feast. Empty Chinese take out boxes stacked in each other, greasy wrappers from her burgers, empty milkshake cups and more now littered the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Kitty?\" Kurt asked, watching his stuffed friend and teammate with concern. Kitty nodded after a moment. \"Yeah. Like, I'm totally fine, Kurt...\" Then, she stopped and her cheeks puffed up as her belly rumbled and gurgled ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" Kurt said. Then, Kitty opened her mouth. *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPP!* And let out the biggest belch yet. Everybody turned to look at her in disbelief, awe and disgust respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, excuse me.\" Kitty mumbled in embarrassment, her cheeks turning bright red as she kept rubbing her tummy. \"Vell, at least you shouldn't  need to eat dinner.\" Kurt pointed out as he helped Kitty stand up. Kitty nodded and grabbed her shopping bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think we shouldn't tell anybody about this pig out, Kurt. I'll just say I ate dinner at the burger joint we stopped at.\" Kitty decided as she staggered slightly, still getting used to how full her now very big belly was, grateful she had gone with a very stretchy extra-large t-shirt and her elastic pants for the pig out as she and Kurt left, leaving only two things behind: very shocked employees and costumers plus a very dirty table.   </span></div></div>",

Do you have any idea how much you ate?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty bit her lip. She must admit that she didn't had a single clue what or how much she had eaten. The only thing she had cared about was feeding her tummy. The only thing she did remember was eating food. Well it was more wolfing down food then eating. She also knew that it was a lot. Her swollen belly was a proof of that. It was a good thing the clothes she bought were a few sizes bigger or else they might probably be tight already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Kurt I don't. There're two Kitty's inside me. The one I am now, also the one that bought clothes, and then there's the Kitty that thinks about nothing else then food and stuffing her face. Like well you know. I don't like that other Kitty. Most of the time I'm able to make her shut up by eating large meals. By the way did it look bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um you mean how you ate and left the table. In both cases... it was bad. Very bad. Most people there were shocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Kitty moaned. \"How could I embarrass myself like that. That's another thing about the other Kitty. She totally doesn't care about anything else except feeding her tummy. She doesn't care about what other people think of her. Nor does she care of other people go hungry. Just as long if she isn't the one who goes hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a problem. But you ate a lot this morning and when we arrived at the mall. How is it able you were so hungry afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Kurt! All right?!?! I don't know. Perhaps the fact we walked to the mall. I mean that must cost some energy, right? I guess that made my body totally think that it might need some.extra fuel. But instead of a bit more, it became a lot more. Man if I keep this up, I won't be able to fit through the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later they arrived at the institute. Kitty went straight to her room with her bags. She plopped down on her bed which made cracking noises under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may need a new bed too soon too. Well I have some nice clothes but all that walking did, like, totally poop me out. I'll just close my eyes for a few seconds...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she was out like a light. Kurt saw her and decided to let her sleep and poofed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't Kitty coming down for dinner?\" Professor X asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no. We went to the mall and ate some there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't have any problems?\" Professor X asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... no not... \" Kurt started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt you know I'm a telepath. I know when you're lying.  I rather have you tell me the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt sighed and knew lying wasn't a option. So he told everything what happened. Exactly how much Kitty ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Professor X said. \"It seems like her hunger attacks are getting worse. We still have no idea what's causing this. I will talk with Hank and Storm after dinner.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Slowly, she sat up, rubbing her belly. \"Like, what time is it?\" She wondered, noticing it was dark outside and that Rogue was asleep in her bed. Looking at her alarm clock, Kitty saw it was currently 12:02. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, midnight? I guess that totally makes sense since I ate a lot and fell asleep.\" Kitty decided. Her belly gurgled again, a little louder this time. \"Okay, belly. Like, don't worry. I'll totally put some food in you.\" she whispered to it, patting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Kitty got up and phased through the floor, straight into the kitchen. \"Like, I'll just totally have a tiny snack...\" Kitty told herself as she opened the fridge. And then, her hunger took control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a box of doughnuts and poured them into her mouth at once. Chewing nosily and rudely, she grabbed a loaf of bread and started shoveling slice after slice of it into her gullet, almost before she'd finished her doughnuts. After the bread, Kitty poured 7 jars of jelly into her mouth, getting some on her face and a few globs on her new t-shirt. Without pausing, Kitty then grabbed a large container of potato salad and devoured that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty kept eating and eating, not slowing down. Her belly grew rounder and rounder as she cleared each shelf of the fridge. A huge head of lettuce was next, with Kitty chugging an entire bottle of ranch dressing to wash it down. She also devoured the apples, oranges, cucumbers, cabbages, peaches and other foods like ham, bacon, eggs, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was just finishing the last of some leftover mac and cheese when she noticed a new cake Storm had made. It was five layers, with chocolate frosting. Kitty knew Storm wanted to save it for a cookout dinner they were having on Saturday, but the cake just sitting there was just torture for her. \"Like, Storm probably won't notice if I take, like, just a tiny, eensy weensy bite...\" she thought as she grabbed the cake and a fork. Needless to say, she didn't stop after the first bite. She inhaled the entire cake and licked the tray until it was spotless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kitty was sitting with her back against the fridge, panting heavily, the debris of her pig out littering the floor and fridge shelves. Her face was a mess of dressing, jelly, frosting, butter and other foods. Her t-shirt was also messy. Upon noticing some frosting on her shirt, Kitty promptly used her finger to lick it up. Then, after a moment, she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!* Kitty burped so long and loud, she honestly expected everybody to come downstairs within seconds. To her surprise (and relief), they didn't. She then looked around and seemed to notice what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, oh crap! I totally did it again! Ororo's gonna kill me when she finds out I ate her cake before the cookout! Not to mention I'm in deep trouble cause I, like, totally ate everything in the fridge!\" Kitty whimpered, one hand on her large belly, which was now poking out from under her t-shirt, exposing her bellybutton as she managed to haul herself up and managed to clean most of the debris up as well as wash/lick her face and t-shirt off. Then, fatigue completely slammed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, there's totally nothing more I can do about it now... I'll have to wait until morning... Maybe Storm and the others'll understand. Storm did seem to be okay with me when I ate those two slices of cake awhile back.\" she thought as she phased back into her and Rogue's room and got changed into her pajamas, her pink t-shirt barely covering her bellybutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, like, so totally pooped now. That pig out totally wiped me out...\" Kitty mumbled as she fell asleep again, her belly gurgling and grumbling quietly as it digested her enormous pig out, causing her to occasionally burp, hiccup and even fart in her sleep.</span></div></div>",

She felt a bit bad about what happened. Especially about the cake from Ororo. She worked so hard to make it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit it tasted delicious,\" Kitty mumbled. \"Maybe Ororo fells better if I tell her that\u2026 but I seriously doubt it. Well I can at least wear some of my new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she crept out of bed and pulled her new clothes out of the bags and put them on. At least they still fit her. But she was worried that they would soon be to tight. To be honest that store had more nice clothes but she didn't have enough pocket money to buy new clothes every few days. To be honest she didn't wanna go back to the mall. Suppose she got another hunger attack? She'd already more or less ate all the allowance from Kurt. That all you can eat free was just luck. But she didn't thought that would be the same next time<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nShe walked downstairs straight to the kitchen. She wasn't alone. In the kitchen were Storm, Wolverine and Spyke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want breakfast kiddo you're out of luck. Someone ate everything we had in the fridge,\" Wolverine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He also ate the cake Auntie O made for the cookout,\" Spyke added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Kitty mumbled, stifling a large burp by turning her head and putting a hand over her mouth. \"Any idea who was behind it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well according to everything that has been eaten it was more then one person,\" Spyke said. \"That or the Blob. But I don't think he would come here just to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that would be very unlikely,\" Kitty agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing else is gone,\" Wolverine said. \"There's not a trace that anyone broke in. So the people who have done are probably students here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty can you come with me for something?\" Storm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty got a hollow feeling in her belly and that wasn't only from her developing hunger. Slowly she followed Storm. When they were far enough from the kitchen Storm looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say anything Kitty. I know it was you. Don't worry\u2026 I'm not angry. If someone under normal circumstances would have eaten my cake and everything in the fridge I would be angry, but that hunger of yours is everything but normal. I still have time to bake a new cake as long if you don't eat that one also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry Storm. It's just that I can't\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt told us what happened yesterday at the mall. He also told about everything what you ate. Don't be angry at him. Professor X asked him and you can't lie to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Storm where are we going?\"    </span></div></div>",

Storm knocked after a moment. \"Do not worry, Kitty. He will understand you could not help yourself.\" She told Kitty, who was nervously drumming her fingers on her belly. \"Like, thanks Ororo.\" Kitty whispered as Professor X's voice told them to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty slowly entered the study behind Storm, biting her lower lip nervously. \"Ah. Storm. Kitty. What can I do for you?\" Xavier smiled upon seeing the duo. \"Charles... it happened again.\" Storm said gently, nodding to Kitty, who was absentmindedly picking her bellybutton while determinedly not looking at them. Professor X quickly understood upon seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? Could you please look at me?\" He asked. Slowly, Kitty did this. \"How much did you eat?\" Xavier questioned gently. \"Like, the entire fridge. I totally even ate that five layer cake Ororo worked so hard on for the barbeque this weekend! I'm so sorry, Professor! I went downstairs last night to get a light snack but then Hungry Kitty took control and I stuffed myself like Blob! I didn't mean to!\" She sobbed, burying her face into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty. It is alright. Kurt told me about your excursion to the mall last night and how you went overboard then as well. Despite the fact that you had just eaten 10 meals beforehand.\" Xavier said gently. Kitty looked up, big fat tears running down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I just don't know what else to do! If I keep this up, I'm gonna, like, totally need to phase through the walls to get into a room cause my tummy'll be so round I'll get stuck!\" She hiccupped before blowing her nose after accepting a tissue from Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, please listen to me. We will all help you with this. From what we've seen over the last few weeks, your plan to overeat has somewhat restrained your otherwise enormous appetite. I believe you may need to step it up slightly.\" Xavier said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty couldn't believe her ears. \"But, like, what'll the others say?\" she asked. \"I am sure they will be willing to help you Kitty. I will talk with Scott, Jean, Kurt, Rogue and Evan once you leave. I am certain even Rogue will be alright with helping curb your appetite more.\" Xavier smiled kindly. Kitty nodded and smiled as she stood up. \"But, like, what'll we do for breakfast in the meantime?\" she wondered. \"I just sent Logan out to pick up groceries. He should be back before the others fully awaken.\" Storm smiled, coming back into the room. \"Kitty, I will contact Scott and the others now.\" Xavier added as he began doing so. Kitty nodded and left the study.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

All of them had troubles. That mostly had to do with the fact they were mutants but still. However she trusted professor Xavier. He was right most of the time. Without him this place wouldn't be around. It had been a real home for her and many of the others. She thought about it. She leaned back on her bed rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later she heard Wolverine coming back. She hurried down. She wanted breakfast.

As the five watched in disbelief, Kitty placed 10 pancakes, four cinnamon rolls, two biscuits, five strips of bacon and a heap of scrambled eggs onto her plate. As she sat down and picked up her fork, she noticed them eying her in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked. \"Nothing. We're just... surprised that you're gonna try and eat that much.\" Scott said quickly as the others nodded awkwardly. Kitty shrugged and began eating. Using her fork, she managed to shovel five of her 10 pancakes into her mouth whole, bulging her cheeks out like a chipmunk's. None of the others said anything as they watched her with wide eyes. Kitty chewed and then swallowed loudly before doing the same with the remaining pancakes. \"I can't believe that the K-girl can eat like that and not choke or anything, man.\" Evan whispered to Kurt as he ate a biscuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. You should've seen her last night during the food court's All-U-Can-Eat thing. I thought she vas gonna eat the table at one point.\" Kurt replied with a slight smile as he drank some orange juice while they watched Kitty devour all four cinnamon rolls and then chug her big glass of milk, leaving a milk moustache as she forked all five pieces of bacon into her mouth before inhaling the large pile of scrambled eggs with record speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, Kitty felt the awful feeling bubbling in her belly. Hungry Kitty was coming out. \"Oh no! Like, not now!\" She thought pleadingly. However, it was too late. Before she could even think about what she was doing, Kitty grabbed Rogue's plate and poured it's entire contents into her mouth. \"Woah! Hey Kitty!\" Rogue yelped in surprise as Kitty licked the plate clean and then went for Scott's plate. Scott was so surprised, he couldn't say or do anything but watch his friend stuff her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, take it easy! You're loosing control again!\" Kurt warned with concern. Kitty just grabbed his plate and scarfed down the remaining contents before grabbing both Spyke and Jean's and doing the same thing. The X-Kids watched in disbelief as Kitty then went back to the breakfast bar and started reloading her plate, even more this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kitty felt very stuffed. Panting heavily after her 19th plate, she looked at her surprised friends and the pile of plates next to her. Slowly, what happened hit her as she eyed these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Like, I totally lost control again, didn't I?!?!?\" She wailed in dismay as she started bawling for the second time that day. \"It's okay, Kitty. We know you didn't mean to. That's what we're gonna help you control.\" Jean smiled gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kitty hiccupped as she wiped her nose with a napkin. \"Sure, Kitty. We agreed to help you before breakfast didn't we?\" Scott smiled. Kurt, Rogue and Evan all nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks guys.\" Kitty smiled as she rubbed her large belly. Then, her belly gurgled and rumbled. \"Uh oh. I think I totally have a tummyache now.\" she groaned, clutching her big tummy. \"I think I better lay down for awhile.\" Kitty told the others as she staggered to her room, burping and groaning as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing the professor told us about her hunger. I still can't believe it. Bet she could even out eat Blob.\" Scott remarked in shock. \"I know. I think I have an idea for us to help her get her hunger back in control.\" Jean smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Evan asked. \"Well, what if we each split into groups and, whenever Kitty's hungry, we either make her an enormous meal here or we take her to a buffet. We'll keep doing that each day or so until Kitty's so full or sick to her stomach, her appetite will go back the way it was.\" Jean offered. \"It might work, but Ah think we should probably tell Ororo an' the other instructors first.\" Rogue advised as Scott and the others nodded in agreement.</span></div></div>",

Beast and Storm where there too and Scott told them their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does that sound? We take shifts to help her,\" Scott ended their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I see the plan,\" Professor X said. \"But I don't think this will work. It's good that you want to help her. Don't get me wrong. But those hunger attacks more or less appear suddenly. Don't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they do,\" Jean admitted. \"I mean one moment we were just talking with her and the next moment everything was stuffed in her mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point,\" Professor X said. \"I'm afraid that when her hunger attacks start you don't have enough time to make a large meal or take her to a buffet. How are you planning to take her there in a few seconds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Nightcrawler can teleport\u2026.\" Evan tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That teleporting isn't as easy as it seems!\" Kurt said. \"Getting her there is a great distance and anyone could see us. Then they'd know we're mutants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That don't matter,\" Rogue said. \"They already knew we're mutants. The only reason they don't know you're a mutant is thanks to that device on your wrist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that how do you think Kitty might feel when she devours a entire buffet?\" Professor X said ignoring what the others said. \"How would you feel Jean if you would be Kitty's new size and devour a entire buffet in front of all other people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be embarrassed,\" Jane mumbled. \"Of course! We only thought about the problem. We didn't thought about Kitty's feelings. Or how to solve the problem. Only doing something when the problem already started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean is right,\" Kurt said. \"We're a joke. We think simple, but don't thought about the other part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it's better Kitty doesn't leave the institute,\" Professor X said. \"Here everyone knows what's going on. That's better then getting nasty looks from other humans. However if you do make a huge meal then Kitty can eat it and perhaps get her hunger under control. So we'll make a extra big meal for her for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That might help stop her from getting a hunger attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand but aren't those huge meals gonna ruin her figure?\" Jean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she doesn't eat huge meals she gets a hunger attack and eats everything in sight,\" Evan said. \"That'll ruin her figure anyway so that doesn't really matter.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wished I knew who or what is the reason for those hunger attacks,\" Professor X said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, Kitty was laying on her bed. She'd taken a long nap and felt a lot better now that all that food was digested. Her belly was now much rounder and bigger looking. Curious, she poked it, her finger sinking into her soft, warm squishy blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling slightly, Kitty pulled her finger out and rubbed her big fat tummy lovingly. Then, she looked at her alarm clock. It now read 12:00. \"Wow. Like, I must've been sleepy. I totally slept until lunch!\" Kitty remarked while stretching. Then, her belly gurgled hopefully. \"Yeah belly. Like, totally time to go fill you again.\" Kitty giggled as she lovingly patted it. She then slowly phased into the kitchen again. To her surprise, no one was there making lunch or anything, though there was quite a few pots, pans and other items in the sink, so someone had to've been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that's weird. Where is everybody? Usually the kitchen's, like, totally full at lunch. I mean, I know the New Recruits are out for the day, but Scott and the others aren't here.\" Kitty remarked with concern. Then, she smelled something. Something tasty, greasy and deep fried. Her belly rumbled and gurgled in delight at the smell. \"Yeah I totally smell it too, tummy.\" Kitty told it as she followed the smell to the dining room. Kitty couldn't believe it. The long table was covered with food. Fried chicken, hot dogs, French fries, hamburgers, corn on the cob, crawdads, biscuits and at least 16 pies. Kitty was drooling just looking at the deep fried feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, who could've totally made all this?\" Kitty wondered, wiping her mouth. \"Ah did, sugah.\" Rogue said from behind Kitty. Kitty turned and saw Rogue wearing an apron. Scott and the others were beside her. \"Why?\" Kitty asked. \"Well, we had an idea ta help ya curb your hunger. We were plannin' on either stuffing you here or takin' ya to a buffet until your attacks quit. But the professor said we shouldn't take ya in public for awhile an' we weren't exactly thinkin' about your feelings 'bout your hunger attacks.\" Rogue explained with a genuinely sympathy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he did say we should make you big meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\" Scott added. \"Rogue offered to make you lunch since she's been cooking since she was four.\" Jean added with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Where Ah'm from, ya kinda learn to cook either durin' or after you begin toilet trainin'.\" Rogue explained with a smile. \"Well, like, thanks guys.\" Kitty smiled as she grabbed a large drumstick and took a bite. Flavor burst into her mouth and she began tearing into the food. \"Good thing we ate beforehand. Otherwise I don't think we're gonna need anymore.\" Scott remarked as Kitty stuffed more chicken into her mouth, grease and sauce covering her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty kept eating, each piece of food inhaled within seconds. Finally, Kitty reached the pies and, skipping the knife and forks, buried her face into each one, loudly gobbling it down. On and on it went, with Kitty eating each pie like she was a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Kitty leaned back, panting and very stuffed. Her face was a mess of sauce, grease, butter and pie fillings. \"That... *BBBBUURRRRRRPPPPP* was so totally yummy, Rogue! Thanks for everything! Especially, like, those last 16 pies!\" Kitty smiled as she managed to stand up and stagger out, burping and hiccupping loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I don't believe it. She ate everything on the table!\" Jean gasped as she eyed the huge stack of plates, trays, pie tins and other items. \"Yeah. And she didn't even blink an eye!\" Scott agreed in disbelief. \"Vell, at least it vas not Hungry Kitty this time.\" Kurt pointed out gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But still man. K-girl's gotta cut back on the eatin'.\" Evan said with concern. \"That's why the Professor's having us make her enormous meals for each course, Spyke. The question is, who's gonna make dinner?\" Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can. I know a few of my grandmother's recipes that may help fill Kitty up more quickly.\" Jean offered. \"Alright. Just remember to sit a few of them aside for us first.\" Scott advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Teasing someone because he or she is fat and eats a lot, that happens a lot. But teasing someone because of their weight while they can't help it... that's just low. Very low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I at least don't have to hide my huge meals anymore. That's a good thing. And the other help me by making huge meals. At least this way I don't have to worry hungry kitten is gonna appear. Well even if she does the others would't make a problem of it. I just wish I would know why I have this huge hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner Time!\" She heard Jean yell from downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just faded through the floor entering the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are,\" Jean said. \"I decided to cook. I used some of my grandmothers recipes. They're very filling. I thought it would be good for you. Since they are filling, you probably need to eat less to get full. When you eat less you won't gain so much weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I really gained a lot of weight didn't I? Well it's not all bad. I mean my boobs did grew a few cup sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean smiled. She was comfortable with her own cup sizes but understood very well that young kids of Kitty's age sometimes were very ashamed because of their body and wanted bigger boobs. She knew very well that some girls stuffed their bra with socks, toilet paper or tissues. She once met a girl that used chicken filet. Sadly enough enough for her people found out when she went to the swimming pool at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also got some more female curves, it does gives me a bit more female look,\" Kitty continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty... don't get this the wrong way. It did gave you maybe some female curves... but It also gave you some curves at places\u2026 that shouldn't be curved. No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some taken,\" Kitty mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others walked in looking at Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jean cooked for you. All food that's on the table is for you,\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean put some food aside for us,\" Scott said. \"We know you can't help it and we do wanna help you, but that doesn't say we don't have to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can understand that,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But while you busy eating all that food we can eat without someones eating our food from our plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt a bit guilty about eating their food at breakfast and not leaving a single crumb of food after lunch. She could have saved a few pies for the others. Well a bit too late to think about that now. At least now she could eat knowing that the others would have food also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean gave Kitty a huge helping and put the rest of the food in front of Kitty and gave the others their helping. Kitty started eating her food fast, hoping Hungry Kitty wouldn't suddenly come up. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Kitty! Snap outta it sugah! You're startin' ta loose control!\" Rogue shouted as she barely moved her hand away in time as her best friend, teammate and roommate began scarfing down Rogue's helping of the chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans and gravy. After doing the same to Scott and Evan's, Kitty then started eating from the large bowls and tray themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean, I thought you said your grandmothers' recipes were very filling!\" Scott said with concern as Kitty loudly gulped down the rest of the gravy from the gravy boat, spilling some on her t-shirt. \"I really thought so, Scott! Hungry Kitty must've surfaced before Kitty could even start feeling stuffed.\" Jean realized as Kitty shoved the rest of the chicken into her mouth and swallowed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kitty was leaning back in her chair, moaning and groaning loudly, her tongue lolling out of her mouth as she panted heavily. Her belly was so swollen, she looked like a pumpkin. Gravy was smeared around her mouth, which her tongue started lapping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now I think the stuffed feeling's working.\" Jean said. \"Yeah. Good thing we ate most of our dinners before she got 'em.\" Evan agreed as the others nodded. \"Kitty? Are you feeling alright?\" Kurt asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo\u2026 Like, I'm sooo full, my tummy's *BBBURRRRRRAAAPPPPP* like a lead ball. Why did I ate the entire chicken?\" Kitty moaned, her face turning bright green as her belly gurgled and burbled in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did warn you that my grandma's food was very filling.\" Jean said gently. \"Yeah. But, like, Hungry Kitty didn't wanna listen so now I totally gotta stuffer her poopy mistake...\" Kitty whimpered as she barely managed to heave herself up on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do ya need help gettin' back to our room, Kit?\" Rogue asked as Kitty stumbled slightly. \"N-No. Like, I got it.\" Kitty groaned as she slowly regained her footing and managed to walk out, burping, moaning and whimpering in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should've doubled the meal's size.\" Jean remarked with concern. \"Yeah. But what's done is done, Jean. You did your best and it was a good meal.\" Scott smiled gently. \"You think the K-girl's gonna be okay?\" Evan asked with concern. \"I think so.\" Kurt said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they heard a large SNAP and a THUD! \"Ouchie! Like, there goes my bed!\" They heard Kitty cry in dismay. \"An' we better tell the Professor that Kitty's gonna need a bigger and stronger bed.\" Rogue added. \"Who should cover breakfast?\" Evan asked. \"I guess I can.\" Scott offered. \"Vhat're you gonna make?\" Kurt asked. \"You'll see.\" Scott smiled.</span></div></div>",

That she had gotten too fat for her own bed. This was probably one of the reasons why people did't wanna become obese. She must admit it did had his downsides. But she accepted the weight gain. But the part she hated was the hunger attacks. Also the fact that she ate the food of the others. Eating more then all the others was fine but eating their food... well that was just wrong. Especially since they tried to help her.<br>\r\nShe slowly rolled of her mattress like a beached whale. She got up on hands and knees. With a bit help of the wall Kitty got up and waddled downstairs. <br>\r\nWhen she entered the kitchen she saw all others were already downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Good morning everyone. How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slept so peacefully,\" Rogue said and smiled. \"I just could't bring myself to wake you up. Besides that we need to do something else first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having breakfast,\" Jane said. \"Don't worry. We're not mad at you that you eat our food too. It also seems that it is't fun for you either. But well we also need to eat. So that's why we ate breakfast before you woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt a bit offended by that. But soon she realized that she ate their breakfast and dinner yesterday she must admit she could understand that they also wanted to eat and with hungry Kitty who seemed like she could appear at any moment it was wiser for them to eat while she was't around. But still\u2026. it was no fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did had breakfast before you. However I did make you breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Oh that's so nice. I love you guys. I really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took her to the dining room and looked surprised at all the food that was there.

I don't really like hungry Kitty. She does't think about anyone else besides herself. She dies't care about anything except filling her tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\" Kitty said annoyed. \"I'm thank full for it Scott. Can I eat now? If I don't fill my tummy soon you know who comes out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Scott said. \"Go ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Kitty started eating. The others blinked seeing how fast the food was disappearing into her mouth. She ate with knife and fork but still very fast.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, Hungry Kitty was taking over. Within seconds, Kitty had shoved a giant forkful of pancakes into her mouth and swallowed them with a large gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the table eagerly, she grabbed a tray of doughnuts and stuffed ten of them into her mouth at once, swallowing them after barely chewing them. After Kitty had eaten the last few doughnuts, she grabbed a platter of bacon and shoved handful after handful into her gullet, gulping loudly and loudly licking and smacking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-Kids just watched in disbelief. \"Scott, I don't think your idea's working.\" Jean said as Kitty then guzzled down a very big pitcher of pulp-free orange juice, belching loudly after doing so before going back to scarfing down hash browns, sausages, scrambled eggs, ham, omelets, fruit and another tray of pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, \"*BBBURRRRRRRRRAAAAUUUPPP!!*\" Kitty belched loudly, her stomach pressing against the table due to how big and fat it now was. Slowly, she noticed her friends' expressions and quickly realized what had happened. \"Like, I totally lost control again, didn't I?\" She whimpered sadly. Scott and the others all nodded silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Kitty. We know you didn't mean to.\" Jean said kindly. Suddenly, *SNAP!* Kitty's chair broke under her large girth, causing the now obese girl to plop onto the floor with a *THUD* \"Owie! Like, that's the second piece of furniture I've totally broken in two days!\" Kitty moaned, rubbing her hippo sized butt as tears welled up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, we know it's not your fault. We told Professor X last night when you went to bed about your bed breaking and he guessed we'd likely need to order more chairs and things in case this happened anyway.\" Scott told her as he and Kurt heaved Kitty up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I hope we find out what's causing this hunger soon. I don't wanna be immobile.\" Kitty whimpered as she went to get dressed. As she did, Scott and the others eyed the debris from her pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One meal down. Two or so more to go, depending on Hungry Kitty's appearances.\" Kurt said with concern. \"Ah know. I hate ta say it, but Ah think we may need to... increase the meals' sizes.\" Rogue said gently. \"What do you mean?\" Evan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the cookout's this weekend. That don't give us a lotta time to help Kitty. So Ah'm thinkin' we ask Storm to help us create meals so big, that even Hungry Kitty can't eat 'em all, startin' today.\" Rogue explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty waddled back in, wearing some more of her new clothes. Even though only two days had passed, she'd outgrown most of them. This was especially evident in her current jeans, which gave her a large muffin top belly. Before anyone could say a word, her pants button popped off with a loud *Ping* and would've socked Rogue in the eye if she didn't dodge in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess I'll totally need to buy new ones.\" Kitty whimpered as she held her pants up so the others wouldn't see her undies, grateful she'd bought the very stretchy underpants from the store that both she and Kurt had gone to two days prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty went to change into a large skirt she'd bought from the store as well before going go to buy more pants, Scott turned to the other X-Kids. \"Okay. Rogue's right. With the cookout this weekend, we can't afford to have Hungry Kitty attack then. We'd better tell Storm now so she knows.\" He told the others as they set off to do so.</span></div></div>",

Then at least we have some kind of solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks auntie O,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Okay Evan,\" Storm said. \"I'm always willing to help all of you. Even a hungry Kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the others smiled a bit since that sentence could mean two things.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well then, I better can start making lunch,\" Storm said and walked out of her room followed by all others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm went straight to the kitchen. Put some pans on the stove and poured some butter in them. Grabbed some bread and made some peanut butter jelly sandwiches. She bakes some eggs and cooked some other and used the leftover eggs to make omelets. She took more break from the freezer and make toasts with cheese, ham or both. Also cut some fruit for a fruit salad. Backed some bacon. Some bread rolls with mozzarella and put them in the oven. She also made some spaghetti and tomato sauce with meat balls. She also made some wraps filled with salad, salmon, cheese or salad and mackerel. She also made some break with salad and fish or cheese. Also cooked some vegetables cutting them in tiny pieces baking them wit some bacon. She even made some cakes and pies. A few stacks of pancakes and more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Storm was done she was exhausted. Sweat was dripping from her face. The kitchen was a total mess with dirty pots and pans. empty plates and empty boxes and bags  But no matter how messy the kitchen was it was a huge meal. There was so much food on the table you could barely see the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this be enough?\" Rogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so,\" Evan said. \"To be honest I hope it's more the she can eat. Then I can also take a bit of this food. This stuff is delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps she leaves some,\" Kurt said. \"But with hungry Kitty around\u2026 I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe we're able with all this food to stop hungry Kitty from coming out at all,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we soon will find out,\" Scott said. \"It's lunch time.\"  </span></div></div>",

What's...\" But she was cut short by a loud rumble in her belly. \"Like, I need food now!\" She told them. \"Look in the dining room.\" Jean said with a smile. Kitty, surprisingly quick for a girl her size, raced in and squealed in delight at the ginormous meal for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yummy!\" She cheered and with that, Hungry Kitty charged the food. First, Kitty started with the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, stuffing two into her gullet at a time, chewing and gulping loudly. Then, she loudly scarfed down the eggs and omelets, licking each plate clean to make sure she didn't miss a single crumb. Then, came the tray of bacon and fruit salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-Kids and Storm all watched, nervously. Hungry Kitty wasn't showing any sign of stopping yet and she still had quite a bit to eat. They only had today to curb Kitty's appetite before the cookout and this, along with dinner, would be their final chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think this'll work?\" Rogue asked as Kitty buried her face into the giant plate of spaghetti and meatballs, loudly slurping the noodles up as sauce coated her face before spearing all of the meatballs in one go with her fork and plopping them into her mouth after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope so, Rogue. Otherwise the cookout's gonna be a massacre tomorrow.\" Scott remarked as Kitty moved to the salad, salmon, cheese, salad and mackerel wraps, inhaling each one. By now, her belly was even plumper, starting to hang over her pants' waistband as she, with some difficultly, managed to cram the entire stack of pancakes into her mouth, stretching it rather wide as she chewed and swallowed with a very loud gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then grabbed the veggie and bacon dish and wolfed that down with ease along with the bread. Now, came the pies and cakes. But just as Kitty picked up the first apple and cinnamon pie, Jean noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think she's slowing down!\" she said excitedly. Sure enough, Kitty's chewing wasn't at top speed now. In fact, it was getting slower and slower. Finally, Kitty licked the tray clean and let out a very big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!* Oooohh\u2026 Like, too... much... foooooddd\u2026\" She moaned, turning bright green as her belly rumbled and gurgled deafeningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it worked!\" Scott shouted in excitement as the others cheered as well while Storm merely smiled. Kitty looked at her celebrating friends and quickly realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-like *Urp* you *hic* totally *hic-urp* filled Hungry *burp* Kitty *belch* early.\" She groaned between each burp and hiccup, her tummy still making alarming noises. \"Yeah. Sorry to do this to you but we figured to make meals so big even Hungry Kitty couldn't keep up.\" Scott apologized as Rogue and Spyke helped heave the enormous Kitty up from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess it's totally okay. I think it may've worked this time.\" Kitty smiled, having calmed down a bit in the indigestion department. Then, she yawned loudly. \"But, like, I'm totally pooped now. I'm gonna go lay down and digest before dinnertime.\" She told them as she slowly waddled away, still lime green and burping and hiccupping loudly. She even farted very loudly at least six times before she completely left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least she saved us dessert.\" Kurt pointed out as he and the others looked at Storm's remaining cakes and pies. \"Yes. I can put some of them away for both dinner and the cookout tomorrow.\" Storm agreed with a smile. \"Hey, Auntie O, could we have one since we didn't get dessert with our lunch yet?\" Evan asked. \"I suppose so, Evan.\" Storm sighed with an amused smile as Jean levitated a large chocolate cake over to her and the others while Storm set to work gathering the remaining ones.</span></div></div>",

Problem was that hungry Kitty did't knew her limit causing Kitty to have belly aches after every meal. Lucky for her Kurt and Jane helped her by giving her tummy rubs that did fell pretty nice and also helped against the tummy aches.<br>\r\nBut then came the day they all feared for. The cookout day. <br>\r\nKitty woke up. Looking at her body that was bigger each day. If she kept gaining she needed to start wearing bed sheets. Or somebody who might be willing to make some big clothes for her. She rubbed her belly. She liked it when the food was digested. Then it was soft and squishy like a nice pillow. Downside about this was it meant she would soon be hungry. She really need to eat. Today was the cookout. She ran downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kitty you're up,\" Jane said. \"We made some breakfast for you in the dining room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I would't want to have hungry Kitty at the cookout.\" Kitty said and ran over to the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was full of food. Sandwiches, omelets, baked eggs, omelets, boiled eggs, pasta, meatloaf, toasts, pancakes, waffles, wraps and a few buckets of chicken.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yummy. lets hope it's enough to shut up hungry Kitty,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that lately it was getting harder and harder to get hungry Kitty under control. She could't do anything about it. It was like a sirens call. But at least then you could stuff your ears with wax or let someone tie you to the mast of a ship. That would help her since she would phase right through the ropes. <br>\r\nKitty decided not to think about anymore and do why she came here for and started to stuff her face. She ate and ate Sandwiches omelets and baked eggs. It all tasted delicious. Especially the waffles. But the strange feeling she normally had did't happen. Was she finally rid of hungry Kitty? could it be?However she kept eating and eating. But a bit more slowly. She was already halfway done and still nothing from hungry Kitty. She finished of the meatloaf the went after the toasts and some of the other food. But suddenly she stopped eating. She let out a soft girly: \"burp.\" and giggled.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm full. No hungry Kitty. I did it. Better lay down for a while to let all this food digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up to her room and went lying on her new bed and soon fell asleep. A few hours later she woke up thanks to the sound of voices outside.<br>\r\nShe looked out of her window. The cookout started. A lot of people showed up. Many parents and siblings from some of the other students joined the cookout. Many people were talking with each other and laughing. Students showed their family where everything  was and introduced them to others. Also some other new people appeared to have joined the party. Perhaps some people who had a mutant child and were planning to put their child here but were't entirely sure. Or maybe some friends of others. But many people brought food.<br>\r\nKitty went pale. She knew what was gonna happen. But she did't want this to happen. Not now. Not with all this people around. Sure the others knew what was going on, but not all new students did nor their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh all that food,\" Kitty mumbled when a familiar but unpleasant feeling appeared in her belly. \"Oh no. Not now. Please not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Kitty's last thought before Kitty was gone and Hungry Kitty took full control. She faded right through the floor and as soon as she landed she ran straight through the wall the the garden were the cookout was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Kitty,\" Rogue said who noticed her first. \"Kitty do you feel all right? You have a strange look in your eyes. Oh no. Please don't tell this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUNGRY!!!\" Kitty yelled in Rogue's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It's hungry Kitty,\" Rogue mumbled on a defeated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other started to notice her too and realized that it was hungry Kitty. Could't really miss it. Because Kitty ran at the table were Storm's cake stood and almost inhaled it. She ran over to another plate with pastries and stuffed them in her mouth so fast people almost could't keep track. Cinnamon rolls, steaks, hot dogs, hum burgers, cake, pies, fishes, squid, weenies, chili, pizza's and all other kinds of food. It did't really matter anything to Kitty. As long if it was edible and could fill her empty tummy. Hungry Kitty did't cared about anything else. She just stuffed everything she could find in her mouth. Kitty barely tasted the food. It did't matter to her. She ripped of pieces of the steak like a predator. Stuffed the hot dogs in her mouth two at a time.<br>\r\nSlowly all guests stopped with what they were doing or were talking about and started looking at the morbidly obese girl that was pigging out on the food for the cookout making herself even fatter. <br>\r\nFinally Kitty swallowed the last crumb and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!! Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kitty saw all the shocked faces of all the people and the all the empty plates and the realized what she had done. Her face got as red if a tomato from embarrassment. Her eyes got wet and the next moment she ran inside crying straight to her room. She jumped on her new bed and started sobbing in her pillow. Then she noticed something else. Her tummy. It felt awful. She had a terrible tummy ache. No wonder if you realized all the stuff she had eaten. Now she was in pain and could never show her face to the others ever again. This day could't get any worse.       <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Sniffling, Kitty managed to sit up, despite her belly's protests. \"C-c-come in.\" She whimpered, while wiping her eyes. Storm opened the door and slowly walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, she sat down next to Kitty. \"Are you alright?\" she asked. Kitty shook her head. \"No I'm not okay, Ororo! Like, Hungry Kitty attacked worse than ever! I totally thought she was under control again when she didn't strike during breakfast but then the cookout began and when she saw all that yummy food, she just snapped. Now I had a terrible tummy ache and I can't show my face to the others again! I'm such a big greedy selfish pig!\" Kitty wailed, burying her face in her hands and sobbing anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty. It is alright. We all knew this might happen, remember? We honesty let our guard down after seeing how well breakfast went with you as well. Scott and the other upper classmen are currently explaining everything to the New Recruits right now so they understand too. The parents are freaked out a little as well, but they seemed to calm down when Charles told them after you left.\" Storm said assuredly. Kitty blew her nose loudly and sniffled as she looked up at her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" She hiccupped, her belly gurgling slightly now. \"Yes. Believe me, Kitty. The New Recruits will still like you no matter what. In fact, Jamie told me he, Amara and Tabitha would like to talk with you once your stomach calms down and the cookout ends.\" Ororo smiled as she gently hugged Kitty. \"What about?\" Kitty asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would not say. Tabitha wants it to be a surprise.\" Ororo admitted with a nervous look. Tabitha, or as she and the others called her \"Boom-Boom\", was often unpredictable and had often rebellious ideas. But she was a good person despite the rebellious side of her and got along with most of the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Like, tell them I'll be down in a bit.\" Kitty smiled as she managed to stand up upon hearing her belly gurgle urgently. \"Are you alright?\" Ororo asked as she too stood up. \"Yeah. Like, I totally just gotta use the bathroom.\" Kitty explained as she quickly raced into the bathroom. Storm watched with concern. Then she heard a giant fart, splash and Kitty sigh in relief. \"It's okay! Like, I just totally had to take a poop!\" Kitty called, somehow sensing Storm's concern as she let out another, longer fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm just smiled, relieved Kitty seemed to be feeling better, and went to inform Jamie, Amara and Tabitha that Kitty would be down soon to talk with them and hear Tabby's idea. She hoped Tabitha's idea wouldn't get the trio, or Kitty, in trouble.</span></div></div>",

But since some time her thighs were rubbing. Running was't gonna happen. Well she could still walk. Or more waddling to be exact. She was happy when she found out most other people left. She did't want them to see her. A girl who acted like a greedy pig. She sighed and walked further and saw Jamie, Tabitha and Amara. She patted Jamie on the back and the next moment there were four of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kitty there you are,\" Tabithia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Storm said you three\u2026 or six wanted to see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six. Well there are two of you. We have Kitty and hungry Kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but were sharing the same body. It's only one at a time. And we act totally different while Jamie's copies are the same person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Tabithia said. \"All right! Don't get you underwear into a wrinkle. Scott told us. You could't hep yourself. We understand right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we understand,\" Amara said. \"I mean come on. I almost made a volcano erupt. You're worried about that you ate to much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you seemed kind of upset.\" Tabithia said. \"You know what always makes me feel better? Going on a shopping spree. We go and we want you too come with us. Besides I do think You need some bigger clothes don't you. Guess you need to go for a store for big sizes. But well that's no problem is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty remembered exactly were the store was for big sizes. She must admit it was a nice store. They also had some nice clothing. But she had two problems. She did't had any pocket money and what would happen if hungry Kitty showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure you guys. I would love to go on a shopping spree with you. I really do. But I don't have any pocket money left and what will happen if  hungry Kitty appears?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well you don't have to worry about pocket money,\" Storm said who suddenly appeared. \"Professor X told your parents about your hunger right after the first time you told us. So since the clothing problems are not really your fault he decided to send you some extra pocket money to buy bigger clothes. Don't forget to thank him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kitty smiled weakly. That solves on problem. But I don't wanna sound ungrateful but what Do I do when Hungry Kitty appears?\" Kitty asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she ate so much at the cake out she did still feel pretty stuffed. But she knew very well that could soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a solution for every problem,\" Tabithia said. \"We take you on a shopping spree and a pig out session!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really guys? I wanna warn you I do eat a lot. I don't wanna drain you from your pocket money just to make me feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Tabithia said. \"I have a idea.

They had considered walking there, but Kitty knew she'd likely get very pooped before they even reached the mall due to her girth. So, Tabitha, having \"burrowed\" Lance's jeep, decided to use that. For once, Tabitha actually drove pretty smoothly and they were soon heading for the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I really don't wanna put you guys out of your money like I did with Kurt a few days ago.\" Kitty was saying from the backseat. She and Jamie were sitting there together while Amara was in the shotgun seat. \"Hey. Don't worry, Kitty. I told you I've got an idea.\" Tabitha smiled as they drove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty felt that rumbly, gurgly feeling in her tummy again. \"Uh oh.\" She said. \"What's wrong?\" Jamie asked, his 11-year-old eyes wide with concern. \"Tabitha, it's happening.\" Kitty groaned, clutching her stomach. \"What?\" Amara said with concern for her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Hungry Kitty wants out!\" Kitty whimpered as her stomach kept rumbling and burbling, getting louder and louder with each one. \"Okay!\" Tabitha called as she gunned the engine and drove the jeep to a new buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this, Tabitha?\" Amara asked as they climbed out and Kitty nearly bowled Jamie over darting inside. \"Relax, 'Mara. I told you I got a plan and we'll use it soon.\" Tabitha smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio followed Kitty inside and found her already loading a plate with pizza, chicken, cake, cookies, pie, burgers, corn dogs, ham and doughnuts. \"Uh, Tabby? What's your plan?\" Jamie asked as he eyed Kitty's giant meal. Tabitha merely smiled, grabbed a plate and started loading it with the same amount of food as Kitty. Kitty seemed surprised for a second, but merely shrugged and took the extremely full plate to a booth. \"C'mon guys! This buffet's got a deal: Eat all you can and you get all meals free for the rest of your life!\" Tabitha smiled as she grabbed a rather giant drumstick from her plate and took a big bite. Amara and Jamie looked at each other doubtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabitha, I don't think we can eat all this food too.\" Amara said nervously. \"Sure you can Amara! That's why I brought you!\" replied Tabby, her cheeks bulging as she stuffed two cookies into her mouth while she kept eating her chicken. Kitty, meanwhile, was already mowing through her burgers, starting with one, then managing to stuff four more into her mouth at the same time before swallowing with a very big gulp, nearly choking as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why am I here?\" Jamie asked Tabitha. \"We need a cheering section, Jamie baby. You can eat some of you want.\" Tabitha explained as she finished the chicken and shoved two big slices of cheese and pepperoni pizza into her gullet. With a nervous look, Amara grabbed a plate and loaded it with the same pile of food as her friends had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie watched as the three girls chowed down. Kitty was finishing her first plate and managed to get up and refilled it, this time with hoagies, roast beef sandwiches, and other foods. Jamie decided to take a few cookies to eat, not wanting to go overboard as he watched and encouraged his three friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time ticked on Amara and Tabitha's bellies swelled up as they went back for seconds, thirds fourths and fifths. Kitty was already eating her 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th helpings, her belly starting to push against the table. During the third course, Tabitha had to unbutton her pants and loosen her belt so they didn't pop off due to her belly starting to feel restrained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara only had to undo her pants button since her pants didn't need a belt to hold them up. Kitty didn't even bother to do either of these since she knew they'd give way to her girth anyway and this proved true when her button popped off and nearly put out Tabby's eye if she hadn't ducked in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the three girls swallowed their last few crumbs and leaned back, stuffed and happy. \"Like, oh boy. That was totally worth Hungry Kitty's appearance.\" Kitty smiled, patting her enormous belly in delight before burping loud and long. \"See? Told ya this'd pay off.\" Tabitha smiled before letting out a giant burp as she rubbed her own bowling ball shaped tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, your idea was to go to this buffet, pig out with me and then I'll get meals here free for the rest of our lives?\" Kitty asked in surprise, lovingly stroking her big belly as it churned all the food in it. \"Yep!\" Tabitha smiled, licking her fingers off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara? Are you okay?\" Jamie asked, upon noticing said girl's pained face as she clutched her poor tummy in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm gonna explode.\" Amara groaned, letting out an equally jumbo burp, her cheeks bulging as she did. \"Do you guys still feel like going to the mall?\" Jamie asked as he eyed both the girls and the other diners watching them in disbelief, disgust and/or awe. \"Yeah, Jamie baby. It'll give us time to- *URRRRRRRPPPP!* digest.\" Tabitha smiled, burping loudly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or loose our lunch.\" Amara moaned, hands on her head as she rested her chin on the table before burping loudly again herself, her face slightly green.  </span></div></div>",

If you did't notice I needed to lose my belt and opened my pants button,\" Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did too but I still feel awful,\" Amara said burping loudly again. \"I never have eaten so much. I also never felt so stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop whining,\" Tabitha said. \"Be happy. We did it. With a lot of help from hungry Kitty but you must admit we put in a lot of the work too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides Amara you were always stick thin,\" Kitty said. \"I think some extra pounds will look great at you. Give you some female curves. They will look great at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O really?\" Amara mumbled on a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Tabitha confirmed. \"Of course I already have perfect female curves but making them a bit bigger would be great. What do you say Amara. Don't you want a hot body with female curves where all men will drool over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if it's worth this pain,\" Amara moaned. \"Let's go look for some new clothes. I don't think my old clothes will fit me any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know a place!\" Kitty yelled excited. \"I've been there one time before with Kurt. It is a place with clothes for girls with a few extra pounds on them. Like me. It's a cool place. Not far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I suggest will go there.\" Tabitha said and stood up. \"Kitty lead the way because well you know where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait if it's a place for girls can I enter?\" Jamie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, as long if you don't look in the changing rooms,\" Tabitha said on a sweet tone. \"Besides we need some advice how our outfits look. We of course need the opinion from a boy because one reason we dress nice is because we want to get attention from nice guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to get attention from guys all you have to do is show your naked boobs or walk around naked,\" Amara mumbled. \"Believe me then you get enough attention from men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that's not really the attention we want,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Kitty saw the store. Big plump girls. Clothes for larger girls. The four entered the store and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit that they do have nice clothes here. Amara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they really do,\" Tabitha added. \"I did't know they had this much nice clothes for bigger girls. That fat girls at our school normally Always wore tasteless clothes. To be honest I would't even wanna found dead in them. But those at the other  hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna be found alive in them. So people see how good I look in them,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls started grabbing clothes and started trying on clothes. Poor Jamie was place on a chair and told not to move and tell them any time how good the clothes looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Amara bought some black with red clothes that looked really good at her and remembered the other three at her magma form. Tabitha got some jeans and purple shirts. Kitty was wise enough to buy clothes a few sizes bigger then her current size and made sure they were elastic. At least this way her clothes would last for longer the just a few days. She also bought a new bikini since it had been pretty hot the past days.<br>\r\nThey all four  left the store with a few bags filled with clothes. Kitty must admit that Tabitha had been right. This did cheer her up. She barely thought about her binge at the cookout. She also felt happy that she had some new clothes. She also was surprised how nice Tabitha was to her. Normally she was a rebel at hart who did nothing else then causing problems for herself and the others around her. But nothing of that hat happened today. At lest not as far if she knew.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Not again!\" She whimpered, clutching her tummy in agony. \"Hungry Kitty?\" Tabitha guessed in concern. Kitty merely nodded as she felt said persona taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need food now!!!\" She cried desperately. \"Okay! C'mon, guys. We gotta get her to the food court!\" Tabitha shouted, taking Kitty's arm. Quickly, the four raced for the food court. Upon reaching it, they were in for a nasty shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all the booths were closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd they close down? It's still afternoon.\" Amara remarked. Kitty blushed as she realized the reason. \"Because, like, I totally demolished their food supplies last time I was here.\" She confessed with a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue did mention that.\" Tabitha remembered, using her nickname for Nightcrawler. \"Well, what're we gonna do?\" Jamie asked as Kitty doubled over again due to the rumbly, gurgly feeling in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was quiet and then got an idea. \"Over here!\" She said, pulling Kitty over to a large mall restaurant nearby. Amara and Jamie quickly followed. A bright chipper waitress came up after a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Welcome to Big Belly Bomb. Table for how many?\" She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Table for four and could you make it a booth please? Our friend really needs food now!\" Tabitha said quickly, nodding to Kitty. The waitress seemed to understand after eying Kitty's agony and quickly led them to the biggest booth in the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so big, you probably could've fitted everybody from the mansion in it and still have room for some of Jamie's duplicates left over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, the woman returned with menus for them. \"What'll you have to drink?\" she asked. \"Um, I'll have an Orange soda.\" Amara said politely. \"I'll take four chocolate milkshakes.\" Kitty said. \"Root beer for me and Jamie.\" Tabitha added as Jamie nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress nodded. \"And have you decided what to order?\" she asked. \"No. Have any suggestions?\" Tabitha replied. The waitress smiled politely. \"Well, we have Jumbo Gut Bombs... we also have some awesome lasagna... turkey... hoagies... and every kind of dessert you can think off!\" the waitress smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Kitty, Tabitha and even Amara's tongue's practically flopped onto the table in delight. \"Sounds great! Like, give us four orders of everything!\" Kitty squealed. \"You must really be starving in order to order that much.\" remarked the waitress in surprise as she went to fill the order. Once she did, Kitty, Tabitha and Amara all tied napkins around their necks eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get some of your guys' food?\" Jamie asked gently. \"Sure thing babycakes.\" Tabitha smiled as they waited. \"It better not take too long. Otherwise I'm gonna start eating other people's food.\" Kitty warned. \"Yeah, Kurt told me about that cold burger you ate during your first public pig out.\" Jamie admitted. Kitty blushed sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, normally I wouldn't do that but I was so hungry. Luckily, the people who bought that meal had left beforehand. But, like, it was still totally humiliating.\" Kitty said as her stomach let out a giant rumble, causing several people to look up in surprise.</span></div></div>",

But soon their food was ready. As soon if the waitress put the plates down Kitty started stuffing her face like if she had't eaten in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really were hungry,\"The waitress said. \"I get the rest of your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was't the only one. Tabithia was also pigging out. Amara also was eating pretty fast but Kitty noticed she was doubting. She ate fast but was mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shoud't be doing this but I'm really hungry. But I don't want to feel sick again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty focused on her lasagna. It was richly filled with sauce and meat and delicious cheese on top. It tasted pretty good. Also Jamie took a tiny piece of it however it was't much to what the girls were eating. <br>\r\nAfter the lasagna was gone the girls attacked the tukey's. it were pretty big ones but the girls did't care and ripped the meat of the bones like starving Komodo dragons. Jamie was able to get one leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange they call thing things legs,\" Amara said who got her own Turkey leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think it's strange?\" Tabitha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is't really a leg but a thigh. Let's be realistic. A bird leg does't have any meat on it. That's just bones with skin. But the thigh. That's were the meat is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!\" Tabitha yelled and stood up. \"The meat is on the thighs.\" She slapped her one big thighs to proof her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty smiled. That was really Tabitha. So sassy and confident and at the same time did't really cared. But she was sometimes what irresponsible. That sometimes caused problems. It drove others, (especially Scott) crazy.<br>\r\nThe girls soon turned the turkeys in noting more the a pile of bones. Totally licked clean. There was't the tiniest piece of meat left. But the girls did't bother and started on the hoagies.<br>\r\nJamie just laid back. He had enough. He looked at the girls and must admit he liked watching them eat. He then noticed Tabitha undid her belt and opened her pant button just like Amara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should't do this. I know I should't but still\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look there are the desserts,\" Tabitha said while their table was filled with different kinds of dessert. Cakes, pies, ice cream. It all looked delicious. All three girl licked their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara suddenly did't care anymore. \"Ah what,screw it,I gonna eat myself stuffed like a turkey at thanksgiving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girl were eating dessert until there was't a crumb left. Only four burping girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh men,\" Amara moaned. \"I really have a tummy ache...  again. But considering how good those desserts were\u2026 it was totally worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked at the table filled with the remains of all their food. Suddenly Kitty realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... girls. How are we gonna pay for all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Tabitha said</span></div></div>",

If we eat all of it, or at least most of it, we'll get this meal free too.\" Tabitha smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the dessert?' Kitty asked with interest. She did have some pocket money left over and it could cover at least most of the feast, but she also knew Amara and Tabby barely had any left over after the shopping spree. \"It's a 50 pound ice cream sundae.\" Tabitha smiled. At that, Magma turned dull green. \"Tabitha... I don't think I can eat that. I'm too full.\" she moaned, her belly gurgling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Tabitha looked at her. Amara really did look ready to burst or throw up or both. \"It's okay, Amara. I think Kitty and I can handle it.\" smiled Boom-Boom. Kitty nodded. \"Totally.\" she smiled. So, when the waitress came up with the check, Tabitha put the request down. Needless to say, the waitress was very surprised. These girls had just eaten four orders of everything, including desserts and now they wanted the 50 pound sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough surprised, she agreed and went to inform the staff. \"Are you guys sure you can eat all that, Tabby?\" Jamie asked, eyeing his obese female teammates and friends. \"Yeah Jamie baby. Kitty and I can destroy that sundae, no problem.\" Tabitha smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty nodded eagerly. \"Tabitha's right, Jamie. My tummy's a lot roomier now that I've started eating bigger meals and I do have some of Hungry Kitty's hunger left over from our late lunch. This shouldn't be a problem.\" She smiled, ruffling Jamie's hair playfully. \"On that subject, I think I better go make some room.\" Tabitha said as she got up and went for the ladies room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the waitress arrived with four guys carrying the sundae. It was very big, with scoops of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, blue moon, mint chip, rocky road, cookie dough and peanut butter ice cream, a generous amount of hot fudge, a mountain of whipped cream and a cherry on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Kitty?\" Tabitha asked, grabbing a spoon. \"Yeah, Tabby. Like, let's totally do this!\" Kitty cheered as she grabbed a spoon herself and the duo started eating at top speed as Jamie and Amara watched in both surprise and encouragement as their friends ate and ate and ate and ate.</span></div></div>",

It looked like Kitty's eating habits had rubbed off on her. On herself too she must admit. She was a normal girl with a small waist and normal appetite but today she ate more then she'd ever ate before. She had a huge tummy ache to prove it. She looked at her friends destroying the sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you could lose a hand in there,\" Amara whispered. \"Be careful you two don't choke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was supposed to be a joke but if you saw how they were eating, it could become reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy,\" Jamie said. \"Or else you get a brain freeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Tabitha were busy eating when both spoons suddenly hit a empty bowl. The bowl was empty. They had done it. Two girls had ate a huge sundae. Both were sitting rubbing their bloated bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty opened her mouth and: \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!! Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on,\" Tabitha said. \"That was nothing. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! See that's a real burp!\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nBoth burps were so loud some other people looked up disturbed and a bit disgusted. However Tabitha didn't seem to care. At all.<br>\r\nHowever the waitress came over at their table not looking happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you did it. You ate that entire sundae so it's free. But can you two just GO!?!? You're disturbing our other costumers. And they pay for all the food they eat, and they don't burp so loud everyone in a ray of 100 yards can hear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Tabitha said. \"We'll go. It's getting late anyway. Come on girls and boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Tabitha struggled a bit to get up which caused the waitress to make a soft sound in disgust before walking away. The four teens walked or in some cases waddled to their car and drove back to the institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shopping spree lasted longer then I thought,\" Tabitha said. \"I think we're too late for dinner. That's too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara turned a bit green hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell me you two are still hungry!\" Amara said.  \"You can't be. We went to a buffet and we just ate all that food, especially you two with that entire sundae.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty giggled. \"Don't worry Amara. I must admit even I am pretty full. I don't need dinner. Or at least not right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they arrived at the institute and got inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" Tabitha said. \"I think we should finish this shopping spree with a girls sleepover!\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tabitha had decided to keep the sleepover between the five \"Bayville Sirens\" members this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean and Rogue were surprised to see how round Amara and Tabitha now were due to their eating, but quickly shrugged it off. Per Kitty's suggestion, they had brought a ton of snacks in case Hungry Kitty struck again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza, snack cakes, candy bars, popcorn, doughnuts, cupcakes and even more snacks were ready for the girls. Each girl was now wearing their pajamas. Jean wore her usual blue nightshirt with yellow collar and cuffs. Rogue wore her normal orange and light green long sleeved pajama shirt and matching pants. Kitty had changed to her new extra-large, stretchy pajama t-shirt and shorts. Amara wore a big t-shirt and stretchy sweatpants and Tabitha wore a sleeveless t-shirt and big pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tabitha... how do you like your new... um... plumpness?\" Jean asked awkwardly. \"You kiddin' Red? I love it. I mean, I already had curves, but this blubber makes 'em even plumper!\" Tabitha laughed as she slapped her big jiggly thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout you, Amara?\" Rogue asked as she eyed Magma's large brown belly. Amara was quiet for a moment before she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I like it too. Like Kitty said, I've always been pretty skinny and now I do have some curves.\" Amara admitted. She still felt somewhat queasy, but had felt well enough to come to the sleepover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a low, loud rumble filled the room. \"Like, I don't believe it! I'm totally hungry again!\" Kitty said as she patted her belly. Then, Tabitha's stomach gurgled in agreement. \"Me too.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda hungry myself.\" Rogue admitted as her stomach grumbled and she put a hand on it. Jean's own stomach rumbled as well. \"Good thing we have a ton of food.\" Jean smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll bet you guys can't eat as much as me and Tab!\" Kitty suggested with a giggle. Jean and Rogue looked at each other thoughtfully. After a quick (and telepathic) conversation, they turned to the younger girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" Rogue smiled as Jean nodded. Amara watched as her four friends started pigging out on the ginormous mountain of junk foods. She had to admit she felt peckish, but her belly was still pretty rumbly and yucky feeling. So, she just decided to sit back and watch the feasting.</span></div></div>",

Kitty was the first one done, grabbed the remaining two slices placed them on top of each other and stuffed them in her mouth. The other girl noticed this and did the same with the other pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Amara, for some reason she didn't understand herself, liked watching this and made a list in her head how much each girl was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were the cakes. There were six. Each one grabbed a cake. Stuffing them in their mouth like a starved animal. Both Kitty and Jean looked at the two remaining cakes. Kitty went to grab one but Jean's mind was faster. The two cakes floated in the air and each cake broke in two equal sized pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is fair,\" Jean said and took a big bite of her cake, smearing frosting over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext there were four bags of popcorn. A least that what the box said. But when Kitty grabbed a bag it seemed pretty small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this bag contains popcorn?\" Kitty asked. \"It does't feel like popcorn. It's kind of hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pass me one bag,\" Amara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty handed here one bag but as soon as Amara grabbed it they heard popping sounds inside the bag. It started to swell and a minute later it was turned into a big bag of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. You just needed to pop them first,\" Amara said and handed Kitty the bag with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the other bags too,\" Tabitha said and threw the three other bags to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara sighed and also heated the other three bags until the were filled with popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls almost inhaled the popcorn. They didn't pause except to taking sips from one of the bottles of soda. Each girl liked how the fizzy drinks made their bellies swell even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned into a real competition. However they made it fair. Each girl was given the same amount of food. They equally shared the doughnuts. the candy bars and all the other food. Every girl was so busy in eating all of the food the didn't notice how stuffed they were or how big their bellies were getting. However Amara noticed how their bellies were swelling. But then suddenly the last bite of food was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was it,\" Kitty said on a sad tone. \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew that's gross,\" Jean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not,\" Tabitha said. \"This is gross.

It seems like Rogue wins,\" Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Rogue said. \"Jean still needs to burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really you guys I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four started to cheer: \"Jean! Jean! Jean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean knew there was no way out of this. She opened her mouth and: \"burp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was all?\" Tabitha said. \"What a disappointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not just a belcher,\" Jean said. Then she felt a horrible pain in her belly. \"And I don't know about you but I have a serious tummy ache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?\" Rogue asked, turning pale green. \"I thought it was just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I just kept eating. I didn't noticed how full I got.\" Tabitha admitted, her own face also taking on a greenish hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here. Even with hungry Kitty inside me I also have a tummy ache.\" Kitty said as she too turned green as her belly gurgled and rumbled ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara looked a bit amused at her four friends who were all moaning in pain from their over stuffed bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second,\" Rogue asked. \"Who won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a tie,\" Amara said. \"I saw the whole thing. You split everything equally. You all ate the same amount. It was a tie. But I can tell you it was a lot. You were acting like real gluttonous pigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not so skinny yourself chubby,\" Kitty moaned, barely clamping a hand over her mouth in time as she burped ominously, her cheeks bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche,\" Amara admitted. \"But what now?\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Tabitha was still asleep in her sleeping bag. Kitty yawned. Then went sitting up straight and stretching herself once. This got the attention of the other three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look who finally woke up,\" Amara said. \"Morning sleepyhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm up right? It's not strange I was sleepy after last night. Besides Tabitha's still sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get it,\" Amara mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was sleepy. It got pretty late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that Kitty,\" Jean said. \"We were having a conversation short before you woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems like you're not alone anymore,\" Jean answered. \"Kitty you must have noticed what we ate yesterday wasn't normal. You have Hungry Kitty inside of you. But what we ate yesterday... Well, it's way more food Rogue and I normally eat. While we did have dinner. And we may believe Amara that you and Tabitha both also ate awfully a lot in the mall. She did too. Both of you. Not just you. And now we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026 do you think I got something to do with it?\" Kitty asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they don't,\" Tabitha said who clearly had woken up. \"But what Jean means is what has happened to you\u2026 is now also happening to us. That's not your fault. At least I don't think so. But well I'm hungry. Lets get dressed and get down for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girls agreed and went to their own room to get dressed. <br>\r\nKitty must admit some part of her felt\u2026 a bit better. At least now she was not alone. The others did help her and now she had some friends who seemed to have the same problem. It was more fun to have a problem with friends then just on your own. Now you could lean a bit on each other. She was happy she bought those new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Kitty, Jean, Tabitha and Amara were all in the kitchen making a big breakfast for all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where's Rogue? She needs to help too,\" Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I am,\" Rogue said and waddled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue wore what she normally wore but between her pants and shirt you could see a stroke of her belly. A bit of her belly peeked out from between her pants and shirt. It seemed like all the snacking yesterday did took a toll on her body. Perhaps she also did eat a bit more during the day. She didn't know since she hadn't gone to the mall with Tabitha, Amara and Jamie like Kitty did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right since we're all here let's start making breakfast!\" Jean said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five girls started making breakfast. It was pretty easy since Amara could defrost, toast, cook and bake things in less then a minute. Finally the table was covered. with sandwiches, baked eggs, omelets, boiled eggs, fruit, toasts, sausages, some pasta, wraps an a lot of other food. All girl looked at it almost drooling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt a unpleasant feeling in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh. Seems it's time for Hungry Kitty!\" She warned the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as hungry Kitty started eating so did the others. Even Amara. All five girl started stuffing their faces. Not having a care in the world except filling their bellies making them fatter by the day. Most of the girls didn't really notice what they were eating. They didn't really care either as long if it was edible. It was hard to believe how fast the food was gone. But after not to long all girls were leaning back in their chairs with swollen bellies. Kitty, Tabitha and Amara wore the clothes they bought yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kitty could clearly see that Rogues belly was exposed now. Her shirt wasn't able to even cover her bellybutton. But Kitty must admit she liked seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean stood up and stuck out her arms and stretched and the next moment there was a loud: RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!!! Her light purple pants split. Both legs ripped at the sides. Jean stood there a bit in shock and embarrassment as the next moment the remains of her pants fell down revealing her tight pretty pink panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other could help it and burst out in laughter. Jean, with a head as red as a tomato, grabbed the remains of her pants and tried to cover herself with it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"OK!\" Kitty said giggling a bit. \"You two need new clothes. So I suggest... we need to shop!\"</span></div></div>",

Jean and Rogue were somewhat uneasy by the idea of shopping at a plus-sized store. But they realized that the stores they normally went to wouldn't likely have larger sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was wearing a pair of Tabitha's new plus sized pants since none of her skirts or pants would go over her hippo butt anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, was thankful her pants and current shirt were still able to handle her size somewhat. She hoped Big Plump Girls had a gothic section for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Like, here we are!\" Kitty smiled as they entered the shop. Jean and Rogue looked around in surprise. There were quite a few large girls shopping and several clothes they'd enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, ladies... let's help our friends look good and fat!\" Tabitha smiled as she dragged Jean over to a rack. Kitty and Amara led Rogue over to another nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Kitty, Amara and Tabitha were sitting in front of the dressing rooms waiting for Jean and Rogue to show off their new clothes. So far, the duo had each tried on 8 different styles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean and Rogue felt a bit embarrassed being put on display for their friends while overweight. But they got over it and began doing so, figuring they might as well do it since their friends were willing to help them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean went first with a blue t-shirt reading \"I'm a big cute piggy\" and a large beige skirt. That got a thumbs up from Kitty and Amara and Tabitha gave it a playful \"Oink\" of approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue's first choice was rather surprising. She went with a red t-shirt with the words \"Gimme my food or I'll sit on you!\" and navy blue shorts. That got a big thumbs up from all three mock judges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, with Jean and Rogue taking turns in trying out new wardrobe ideas. Some (like Jean wearing a large muumuu reading \"Got pie?\" and large light blue jeans) got a big thumbs up, others (like Rogue wearing a hot pink t-shirt reading \"Will you be my feeder?\" and kaki pants) got a big raspberry, a thumbs down or both from the three younger girls. Other times, both Jean and Rogue would look so funny, the trio would laugh until they cried and/or (in Tabitha and Kitty's cases) fall onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jean slowly came out of the dressing room she was in for the final time. She wore a bright pink extra large t-shirt that read \"I'm a big, fat girl and proud of it!\" and large dark blue jeans. \"Well?\" Jean asked. Tabitha smiled. \"I like it.\" \"Totally.\" Kitty agreed. \"It's really cute Jean.\" Amara beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue then came out, wearing basically an extra large version of her normal clothes. \"Like, you totally look nice Rogue.\" Kitty smiled with a blush. She still felt something for Rogue ever since seeing her pale tummy poking out of her shirt at breakfast. She couldn't explain why but she really felt turned on by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kitty. Ah like it better than that last one Tabitha made me try.\" Rogue replied, glaring at Tabitha, who giggled. Tabitha had made Rogue try on a fluffy white sweater with a cat on it that, as Kitty put it, \"totally looks like a giant, poofy marshmallow\" and cargo shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of this stuff isn't really cheap, is it?\" Jean remarked as she eyed her 4 new t-shirts, 5 pants and new bra and panties. \"Don't worry. We still have some money leftover from yesterday. We can loan it.\" Tabitha smiled. Rogue smiled and grabbed her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since we got what we came for, Ah say we head on home an' see if the others are up yet.\" she remarked as she headed for the checkout, followed by her friends.  </span></div></div>",

I guess I need to eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry Kitty,\" Jean asked. \"Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her to the buffet. Since last time we're able to eat there for free.\" Tabitha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Jean helped Kitty over to the buffet. Rogue looked at Amara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can eat there for free?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it has a deal,\" Amara said. \"Eat all you can and you get all meal free for the rest of your life. We went there yesterday. I guess if we go there anyway I might also grab a bite to eat. All that shopping made me hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too.\" Rogue must admit. \"Be careful Perhaps I have a hungry Rogue. Well Kitty was sometimes able to keep hungry Kitty under control by eating enough. I guess we can better do that too. By the way you three can eat there for free. Jean and Ah first need to eat all we can. But with our appetites that shouldn't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty waddled as fast as a girl of her size could to the buffet and filled her plate with chicken, burgers, corn dogs. Tabitha wasted no time and filled her own plate. Jean was doubting for a moment. She put a hand on her belly and also grabbed a plate. Rogue and Amara followed. about two minutes later they were all sitting at a table stuffing their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you four were all hungry too?\" Kitty asked between two large bites of chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure we were hungry,\" Amara said eating large  spicy meat balls. \"But we could use a bite. Besides if we don't eat enough you'll maybe meet hungry Amara. Or hungry Rogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well better hope we never have to deal with our hungry versions,\" Jean said while pushing a huge meatball sub in her mouth. \"But perhaps they come out in the near future. But at least we have each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty pushed a corn dog in her mouth and realized she felt kind of happy eating with friends who understood her because they almost were going through the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But eh Kitty I have a question,\" Rogue said between eating some chicken fingers. \"What is causing those hunger attacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. If I knew what was going on don't you think I would have done something about it!\" Kitty yelled biting a fat sausage in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does make perfect sense,\" Amara said taking a bite of tofu. \"But when we're back at the institute we might tell professor X that what happened to Kitty is well also happening to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jean asked, taking another bite of her sub. \"Does it only happen to mutants or not? Also why does it only happen to girls? I mean, can it also happen to boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Kitty said stuffing fries in her mouth. \"I don't know anything more then you. You get hungry you eat more and gain. Besides I'm gonna go get some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that goes for me too. \"Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me three.\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and Amara looked a moment doubtful at each other. Then they lifted their shoulders and both grabbed their plate for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that another. After the third round Amara stopped. Saying she was feeling full. You could see a small sliver of brown flesh just under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the others went for another round. After that Jean and Rogue were also done, rubbing their bloated swollen bellies. But Kitty and Tabitha went for another round before they were full too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. That was a nice meal,\" Tabitha said. \"I'm really *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!* full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Kitty added. \"Me too. *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, feeling this stuffed and eating what you like does feel nice,\" Rogue admitted. \"You don't have to care. *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you all ate more then me?\" Amara said. \"I wonder why that is? *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!* Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you Jean, come on.\" Tabitha said. \"We wanna hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you girls,\" Jean said. \"It's just not my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty suddenly put her chubby hands on Jean's tight belly and started massaging it, rubbing and pushing. Jean made soft moaning sounds of pleasure. But then suddenly: \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!* Wow! Did that just came out of me?\" Jean asked in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Jean.\" Tabitha said. \"That was a nice one.

What can I-\" Professor X started, but he stopped upon seeing the bloated Jean, Rogue, Tabitha and Amara with Kitty. \"We think what's affectin' Kitty's also happenin' ta us now.\" Rogue explained, poking her belly and watching her plump finger sink into her pale white flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Amara and Tabitha both ate two really big meals with me yesterday and then we, like, totally had a pig out session last night during our sleepover with Jean and Rogue.

It may only effect female mutants since Scott and the other boys have been eating normal meals and snacks. Though, given Kurt's appetite, I wouldn't be surprised if this was affecting him as well.\" Professor X smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls giggled at the remark. Kurt was well known for his own appetite throughout the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I believe for the time being, we may have to double your own meals like we've done with Kitty.

When she saw what was on the table she was having trouble not to drool. The table was covered with fries, hams, bowls of chili, chicken, sausages, hamburgers, fried bacon with eggs on bread, spaghetti with sauce and meatballs, steaks, baked potatoes, fried chicken and much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others soon entered and looked at all the food. It only took a few seconds before all girl started eating. Well it wasn't really eating. The girls were more devouring the food like a bunch of starved animals. All four totally forget to use manners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey attacked the food like a pack of wolves and devoured the food like a couple of pigs. Kitty pushed fries in her mouth with two hands, while Amara devoured a whole ham. Tabitha and Rogue tore into a turkey that Storm was bringing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean in the meantime ate the fried bacon with eggs on bread. Pushing it into her mouth causing it to smear yellow egg all around her mouth. Not only yellow egg. Kitty had grease smeared all around her mouth. Rogue who after the Turkey was gone (what was soon gone by the way, only leaving a couple of bones), started on the hamburgers smearing grease and sauce around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara devoured another ham smearing more grease around her mouth as well. Tabitha covered hot dogs with mayonnaise and Ketchup and both sauces were smeared around her face dropping on her shirt. It was the same with the shirts of the other girls who were covered in food stains. Kitty stuffed so much food in her bulging cheeks she looked like a chipmunk. All the girls were focused on eating food and didn't notice the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Hungry Kitty is busy again,\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hungry Kitty is but not she alone,\" Kurt said. \"Also Hungry Tabitha, Hungry Rogue, Hungry Amara and\u2026 isn't that Hungry\u2026 Jean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Scott yelled and looked back at the table seeing his Jean slurping spaghetti like she hadn't eaten in days. The extra weight around her waist told otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I saw eating like this once in a documentary,\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that about girls?\" Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er no. I believe it was about Komodo dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Evan said. \"Auntie O told me that some other girls were also having big appetite's but this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey anyway they're still our friends,\" Jamie said. \"We need to help them and be there for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you girls taste the food?\" Storm asked a bit irritated, since she put a lot of work into making the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. It's delicious,\" Amara said guzzling down a bowl of chili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best food I ever tasted,\" Kitty managed to say between bites of sausages and baked potatoes.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNext moment there was a sound in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Evan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New recruits,\" Scott said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed a group of new recruits walked in but stopped when the saw the show of five girls devouring a entire feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if there's any food left for us with them around?\" Jubilee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls were finally able to finish everything until the last crumb. Except for what was smeared around their mouth and what was on their shirts. All four girls had swollen bloated bellies and were softly moaning. <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

I, like, totally don't feel so good.\" She moaned, turning apple green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too..\" Jean groaned, her own face turning pale green as her tummy let out an equally big gurgle. Suddenly, Tabitha's own belly rumbled and gurgled as her face took on a deep green hue. \"I think I'm gonna be sick too.\" she groaned, clutching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, both Rogue and Amara also went green and their bellies started to rumble and gurgle. \"Ah think either Ah ate too much or Ah ate it too quickly.\" Rogue managed to moan before letting out an ominous burp, her cheeks bulging threateningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys gonna be okay?\" Bobby asked. \"Yeah. Like, I think we totally just need to *URP!* digest.\" Kitty moaned, letting out a big burp of her own as her tummy rumbled even more, causing it to jiggle like a big bowl of Jell-O. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or explode.\" Amara groaned before a thunderous belch of her own escaped her lips, causing her tongue to flop out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the four girls slowly managed to stand up and started waddling to Kitty and Rogue's room. Jean, Tabitha and Amara were too full to try and make it back to their rooms right now so they decided to rest in said room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I feel like my belly's gonna blow.\" Jean moaned as she laid on her back, rubbing her large tummy in agony. \"Me too. I can't believe how much we ate.\" Amara groaned, laying on her large belly before quickly switching to her back when it became apparent her belly was too upset to lay on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Amara? We just *burp* ate two big meals *belch* before this *hiccup* and now *urp* you're *hic-urp* in *burp* disbelief over *hic* how much *belch* we ate?\" Tabitha moaned as she lay beside Rogue, who was also laying on the floor, her tongue lolling out of her mouth as she rubbed her now large pale tummy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm sick to my belly but I gotta admit, that Storm's cooking was totally the best yet!\" Kitty smiled despite her stomach pains from beside Jean. \"Yeah. Ah've never had a turkey as awesome as that one.\" Rogue agreed with a slight smile herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those hot dogs and burgers...\" Tabitha agreed, licking the remaining ketchup, mustard and mayo off her face and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop!\" Amara moaned, clutching her belly. \"My bellyache's bad enough as it is without you guys mentioned all that, admittingly yummy, food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, 'Mara. We forgot.\" Tabitha smiled. At that moment, there was a knock on the door. \"Come in.\" Kitty called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and in came Scott, Jamie, Kurt, Spyke, and Storm. \"How're you guys feeling now?\" Scott asked. \"Still stuffed like turkeys before Thanksgiving.\" Jean replied, wincing slightly as she sat up despite her still sore tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys want?\" Rogue asked as she, Kitty, Amara and Tabitha also managed to heave themselves up into sitting positions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell, ve wanted to see if we could give you belly rubs to help calm your stomachs down.\" Kurt explained. \"Uh... sure.\" Jean said as the others nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the five set to work. Scott took Jean for obvious reasons. Jean moaned in delight as he gently rubbed and pressed on her tummy. It was so soothing and relaxing that Jean caught herself starting to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt offered to rub Tabitha's belly. As he did, Tabitha sighed in contentment as his three fingered hands gently went over her large gut, occasionally causing her to giggle as his fur tickled her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, wearing gloves, covered Rogue. The southern goth moaned happily as Ororo's hands lovingly stroked and pressed her pale, marshmallow belly while she relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie took Kitty. He seemed a bit embarrassed to be doing so since Kitty was a few years older than him and he'd briefly harbored a crush on her earlier this year. Kitty noticed and smiled kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it's totally okay Jamie. I don't mind you rubbing my tummy.\" she told him. Still blushing furiously, Jamie slowly began rubbing her large belly. Kitty sighed in blessed delight as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Spyke was rubbing Amara's large brown belly. All four girls sighed in relief as they felt their bellyaches fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty got a weird expression on her face. \"Are you okay?\" Jamie asked, upon noticing this. \"Yeah. Like I just feel like I'm gonna...\" Kitty started when a giant, smelly fart escaped from her big butt. *BLURRRAAAAPPPPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa K-Girl! Stink city!\" Spyke yelped as the others all looked at her in surprise. \"Like, sorry!\" Kitty blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tabitha got a smirk on her face. \"That's pretty good, Kitty, but not as good as this!\"  And then, she let out a bigger fart.<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOURRRRRPPPPTTTT!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's vhy we call you 'Boom-Boom'!\" Kurt joked as he fanned the stench away as Tabitha laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kids' stuff, Tabitha! Here's how a real southern gal does it!\" Rogue jeered with a smirk as she also unleashed a doozy of a fart. *BBRRRRAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! I didn't know the Rogue had it in her!\" Bobby remarked as they all stared at Rogue. \"Like, totally awesome fart, Rogue!\" Kitty giggled as even Storm looked impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing! Check this out!\" Amara smiled as she started to strain and grunt. After a few moments, *BBBBBBLLLLLOORRRPPPPPPPTTTT!* A pretty impressive fart escaped her rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jean! It's down to you!\" Tabitha giggled. \"Jean, you don't have to-\" Scott started when Jean smirked and began straining. <br>\r\nShe strained so much, her face went as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!*  Jean let out the biggest fart any of the X-Kids or Storm had ever heard. They could smell everything Jean had eaten since that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mein gott, Jean!\" Kurt coughed as the stench reached his nostrils. \"Jeez! Not cool, man!\" Spyke agreed, plugging his nose. \"Wow! Jean, what did you eat this mornin'? Baked beans?!?!?\" Rogue agreed, coughing and hacking like the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I probably should've mentioned this sooner, but chili tends to make me gassy.\" Jean apologized with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we've gathered!\" Tabitha wheezed in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Scott and the others left to get some air fresheners and other air cleaning things, the five girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Jean! Like, I totally thought my farts smelled yucky at times but yours are totally the bomb!\" Kitty giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Who'd think Miss. Perfect has a slobby side?\" Rogue joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you teach me that for when school starts up again?\" Tabitha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. At least our bellyaches are gone. Guess I'm both a big burper and a big farter.\" Jean giggled along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kitty felt something wet in her pants. \"Um guys? Like, I totally don't know about you... but I think I totally pooped my pants.\" she squeaked. \"Yeah. Ah think mah fart did that ta me too.\" Rogue agreed as the others nodded sheepishly.</span></div></div>",

New pant and shirts since their shirts were covered with food stains. Jean an Rogue at least now had a good reason to show their new clothes. The fitted their fatter bodies perfectly and looked pretty good at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those clothes look really good at you,\" Kitty said and yawned. \"All that eating made me tired. Perhaps I take a small nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe Amara beat you to it,\" Jean said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the dark girl was already fast asleep softly breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I'm sleepy too.\" Tabitha said. \"Oh. Jean is also gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later all girls lay passed out in the room. All five were deep asleep while their bellies gurgled and groaned digesting their huge meals, adding more fat to their bodies. But while the girls were in dreamland, they were thinking about one thing. What was for dinner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for you to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty opened her eyes and saw Amara standing over her. She blinked a few times and looked at her alarm clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is it 5:55 already!?!? It's almost time for dinner!\" Kitty yelled waking up all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner sounds great.\" Rogue said. \"I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Amara said. \"That's what was waking me up. That and the rumbling of my and your tummies. But I guess they have a big meal prepared  for us. I can smell something delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha put her nose in the air and sniffed. \"She's right. I smell it too. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ran down stairs except for Kitty who like normally faded right to the floor and was first to reach the table. Kitty looked with big eyes at the feast before her. The table was covered with mainly junk food. Pizza's, fries, burgers, corn dogs, hot dogs, croquette's, minced meat hot dogs, milkshakes and other stuff that was dripping from the grease. Kitty couldn't help it and drooled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott entered while he was chewing on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you noticed. Go ahead. The others already ate so\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to say anything more. All girls started to attack the food like if they hadn't eaten in days. Soon their cheeks were so stuffed with food they looked like chipmunks. It was almost unbelievable. The girls started stuffing their faces. Kitty crammed about five corn dogs in her mouth at once. Jean did the same with the hamburgers. Tabitha took a pizza and was spinning it on her finger taking bites out it and soon the pizza was gone. Amara stuffed croissants in her mouth. She was going pretty fast but slower then the other four. Rogue wolfed down hot dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked from a distance. He was afraid one of them might choke and he need to help them. But Lucky for him they were always able to swallow the food down without choking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty placed two pizza's on top of each other and ate them like they were a huge cookie. Tabitha stuffed several minced meat hot dogs in her mouth and the ends were hanging out of her mouth. The girls were eating so fast you would ask yourself if they tasted the food. However they seemed to like it. Amara shoved hamburgers inside with both hands. Rogue grabbed one of the plates of fries and emptied the plate in her mouth. All girl were eating like there was no tomorrow. At this moment they were all taken over by their hungry versions. Kitty smashed her head right into the fries almost inhaling them. Amara stuffed herself full with corn dogs while Tabitha started on the croissants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I thought girls were always so worried about their figure,\" Evan said. \"But it seems like those girls only think about filling their tummies. Can tummies pop?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who can eat most.\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess Kitty,\" Evan said. \"She already had those attacks before the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but don't you remember Jean's fart?\" Kurt asked. \"I bet she also burps louder then the others so she probably also eats the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think Tabitha is wilder and is most likely to let herself go.\" Jamie mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue? Probably, but I don't think she eats more then the others.\" Kurt said. \"She started at same time with Jean but...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara? I don't think so.\" Evan said. \"For some reason the hunger seems to have less effect on her then the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to say since we don't know how much each girl eats,\" Kurt said. \"We should split the food in five equal parts and sees who eats the most. But I still think it's Jean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet on that?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure I'll take that bet,\" Jamie said <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Scott was quiet for a moment, then sighed and nodded. \"But we better tell the girls first so they don't feel like trophies.\" He advised. \"Yeah, good call.\" Evan agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys slowly came up to the five girls as they took a break. \"Um, guys... we were wondering if you'd like to have a contest.\" Kurt said. Kitty, Tabitha, Jean, Rogue and Amara all looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What's the challenge?\" Jean asked. \"We're wondering who can eat the most out of all five of you.\" Spyke explained. \"So we decided to have each of you eat a pile of food. Whoever eats the most will win the bet.\" Scott added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what do we get?\" Kitty asked. \"Well, if one of us wins, we get out of chores for a month and the losers take on the winner's chores as well as their own.\" Bobby explained. \"What about us?\" Rogue asked. \"What'd you girls like?\" Jamie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls were quiet for a moment as they thought about it. \"Like, I'd totally love belly rubs while being fed by the losers and getting out of our own chores.\" Kitty smiled. \"Oh that sounds heavenly.\" agreed Tabitha as she pictured her large belly being rubbed and pressed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does sound cool, Kitty.\" Jean agreed as she pictured Scott feeding her numerous grapes, bananas and other foods while rubbing her own boulder sized tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara and Rogue also nodded their agreement. \"What about the losers of the eatin' challenge?\" Rogue asked. \"Well, aside from a likely tummy ache, the losers won't need to do extra chores.\" Scott suggested. The girls eyed each other again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally in!\" Kitty cheered. \"Me too.\" Amara smiled. \"I'm game!\" Tabitha whooped. \"Ah guess it'd be interestin'.\" Rogue shrugged. \"Okay, it's a deal, Scott.\" Jean beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's choose the girls!\" Spyke smiled. Scott picked Jean while Kurt picked Tabitha, Spyke took Rogue, Bobby picked Amara and Jamie chose Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Now let's bring on the grub!\" Tabitha shouted. Quickly, the guys set to work bringing out the remaining food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there was five large piles of junk food on the table. They consisted of doughnuts, cupcakes, regular cakes, pie, ice cream sandwiches, pizza, hamburgers, chocolate bars, hot dogs, corn dogs and cinnamon rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Everybody's clear on the rules, right?\" Scott asked. The girls and guys nodded. \"Like, we can only eat from our own piles and we can't leave any crumbs.\" Kitty smiled. \"Yeah. And we also can't hide any food in our pockets or down our shirts.\" Tabitha added as Amara, Jean and Rogue all nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Just wanted to make sure.\" Scott smiled as he readied his stopwatch. The girls grinned as they tied napkins around their necks and got ready for the upcoming pig fest.</span></div></div>",

They ate like starved animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a doughnut's on in each hand and stuffed them in her mouth. She barely chewed them once before she stuffed another two in her mouth. Tabitha noticed this and didn't wanna be left behind, and did the same. This didn't go unnoticed by the other three girls who also tried to eat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if it's wise if they eat fast. It may sooner cause a tummy ache,\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Scott said. \"You're free to tell them. But do you really think they will listen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet that when you're sitting on the table they come at you they start eating and after that there's nothing left from you except a skeleton,\" Evan said with a smile. \"That would make a great horror movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were done with the doughnuts and Kitty and Jean already started on the cupcakes. Jean used her powers to put ten cupcakes on top of each other and stuff them in her mouth. Kitty just rolled onto her back, opened her mouth and stuffed cupcakes into it. The girls stuffed them in so fast they had barely time to chew the food but they didn't care right now. Amara was a bit slower then the others. But she as well was starting eating the cupcakes very fast, Just like Rogue and Tabitha who were both stuffing cupcakes in their mouth with both hands. All the girls had bulging cheeks what made the look like a bunch of chipmunks. Chipmunks the size and appetite of hippo's and eating like pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a large apple pie holding it in both hands eating it like a huge cookie. No matter how fast she was eating she seemed to enjoy it. The other five also reached the pie's. Jane grabbed one and took a few bites and stopped. She looked a bit worried. She opened her mouth again and : \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!! Oh that feels better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha smiled. After eating two pies she also opened her mouth: \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!! Hear that Jean? That's how you burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue put no attention to this. She was too busy eating. Amara as well. But she didn't think she would be able to win. All this time she was eating slower and less then the other girls. But she wasn't planning to lose this bet. She wanted those belly rubs more then anything else. So she stuffed another pie in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty reached the ice cream sandwiches. She first held her head back and: \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!* That's how you burp and\u2026\" She bent down and *POOOOORRRRRRRRRPT!!!* Let out a huge fart. After that she started stuffing ice cream sandwiches in her mouth. So much at once she could barely close her mouth. Rogue was able to stuff twelve ice cream sandwiches at once in her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're gonna eat the ice cream this fast they gonna have a tummy and a head ache.\" Jamie remarked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara saw the ice cream. She remembered what Jean did with the cupcakes and used her own power to melt the sandwiches just a tiny bit so they went down easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue suddenly opened her mouth and \"*BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!*\" But at the same time: \"*BRRRRRRAAAAAAP!!!!!*\" A loud fart escaped her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jamie said. \"Like my grandmother told me when you can burp and fart at the same time you have no soul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nonsense,\" Bobby said. \"However\u2026.\" He grabbed a towel and tied it around his nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah good idea,\" Kurt agreed. \"He disappeared and appeared a few seconds later. with towels for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean suddenly went sitting up straight and: \"*BLUUURRRP!!!*\" Then she opened her mouth: \"*BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!!!!!*\"   The next moment she grabbed a pizza and tried to stuff as much in her mouth if was possible. Amara put two slices on top of each other and ate them that way. Suddenly she paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Did that just came out of me?\" she asked surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girl had undone their buttons and had undone (if they had one) their belts.  There was grease, ice cream and frosting around their mouths and as well some stains on their clothes but the kept eating. After the pizza's were gone Rogue reached the hamburgers and corn dogs. Rogue stuffed hamburgers in her mouth one by one before swallowing them. Kitty and Tabitha tried to stuff as much in their mouth as possible. Jean used her power to make the food just float to her mouth and eat it. Amara grabbed one hand full of corn dogs and another full of hamburgers and stuffed it in her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing not one of them has elastic skin.\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara crawled further. Suddenly she stopped and and: \"POOOOOOOOOTTT!!! That does feel better. I can still fit more in my tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing were cinnamon rolls. Most of them started stuffing them in their mouth several at a time. Tabitha was smarter and just grabbed the plate and poured all cinnamon rolls in her mouth, making her cheeks bulgy and lumpy and started on the next food. The other four paused for a moment wondering why they didn't think about that. All four grabbed their plates and poured all cinnamon rolls in their mouth. All five girls were burping and farting then they started on the hot dogs. Each of them were heavily covered with mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. After that, the girls started stuffing as much into their mouths as was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!* *POOOORRRRRT!!!!* *BRAAAAAAP!!!* *BUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!!!!!* Were all sounds that could be heard from all five girls as they ate the hot dogs and started on the chocolate bars which went in pretty easy after all the other food. Especially for Amara who just melted them and drank the melted stuff.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Not one of them's stopped,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Jamie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure but I guess we find out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara got a head lead thanks to her ability to melt the chocolate, but now came the cakes. 5 four layer chocolate cakes. Kitty wasted no time and smashed her head right into it inhaling it. Tabitha just broke lumps of it stuffing them in her mouth as fast if she could. Jean made the cake float over to her as she ate it in mid-air. Rogue went over to the cakes on hand and knees and started eating like a pig. Then a few seconds later at the same time five huge long belches could be heard and that was it. All the food was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls looked at each other. All, of them had a green face. All five were burping and farting and a lot of moaning. Grease, sauce, frosting and other stuff around their mouths. Their bellies bloated, swollen and hard as a rock. Their shirts covered in food stains and some clothes started to rip at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys slowly walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who won?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it was a tie,\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My tummy, like, totally hurts!\" Kitty whimpered in agony as she rubbed the aching orb of flesh. \"Mine too.\" Amara moaned as she tried hard not to vomit as she burped ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah belly's so stuffed, I think Ah'd explode if Ah try an' put one more thing into mah mouth.\" Rogue moaned in agreement as she laid against the wall so she was sitting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with you, Rogue. After that grub fest, I don't think I could eat another bite until breakfast.\" Tabitha groaned as she slowly messaged her jumbo tummy with both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the guys said anything for a moment as they watched their female teammates burp, groan and moan in agony. They felt bad for their friends and wanted to do something that would cheer them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had an idea. \"Hey, why don't we at least give them a belly rub? That helped at lunch when they had bellyaches.\" He offered. \"Worth a shot.\" Scott agreed as Kurt, Spyke and Bobby nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the five guys went over to their girl and knelt down. \"*Urp* Scot? What *belch* are *hic* you *burp* *urp* doing?\" Jean moaned as she felt her boyfriend's hands slowly start to rub and press her giant belly. Slowly, she felt its hardness fading and becoming soft again, lessening her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're giving you guys belly rubs to help with the pain. It was Jamie's idea.\" Scott explained with a smile. Sure enough, Kurt was rubbing Boom-Boom's belly, Jamie was gently rubbing and pressing Kitty's while Bobby took care of Amara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan, meanwhile, was gently messaging Rogue's orb of a belly while wearing cleaning gloves. \"Feeling better?\" He asked as he kept rubbing, pressing and pinching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mah god yes...\" Rogue moaned in relief as the hard rock feeling in her tummy went away, replaced with soft squishy blubber.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" Kitty agreed as she smiled at the blushing furiously Jamie while he kept working away on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo gooooodddd...\" Tabitha moaned in bliss as Kurt's furry fingers kept stroking hers gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I agree.\" Amara smiled as Bobby's fingers ran over her brown skin, partially chilly to help dull the pain in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all five girls' tummies rumbled loudly. \"Like, now what?\" Kitty asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all knew. \"Not again!\" Kurt groaned as the X-Boys quickly retied the towels around their noses just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, *PPPPPOORRRRRRTTTTTTTT!!!* Kitty let out another big fart. \"Now I totally feel better.\" Kitty sighed in relief as the pain in her hippo belly lessened greatly after that big toot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"That's not fartin', Kit. This here is fartin',\" Rogue smirked as her belly rumbled again.*BBBBLLLLOOOORRRRRPPPPP!!* A bigger fart slipped from her booty as she smirked again. Kitty playfully stuck her tongue out at her roommate, best friend and teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you guys can't fart. Like Blue said this afternoon, this is why they call me 'Boom-Boom'!\" Tabitha laughed as she strained hard. *FFFFFFFBBBBBBBBRRRRRRTTTPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* Out came a fairly decent fart from her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I thought we did this hours ago, Tabitha!\" Amara giggled as she took a deep breath and strained hard. After a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPOOOOOORRRRRAAAAAAPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!* A big, long fart escaped her large butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again I see I gotta teach you girls how to make a stink!\" Jean laughed as she began straining very hard. \"Like, plug your nose!\" Kitty shouted, quickly pinching hers closed as Rogue quickly grabbed a clothespin and clamped it on hers while Tabitha and Amara both tied some spare napkins around their noses just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBLLLLLLOOORRRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* Jean's fart was big, loud and really long. Soon, the entire dining room smelled awful. \"Open-ack- a window!\" Kurt choked. Even though he and the other X-Guys still had their masks on, Jean's stench was still able to get in their noses. Scott quickly ran over and threw the windows open, letting fresh air in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man! Jean, what did you eat last round! There wasn't any chili!\" Rogue groaned in disgust. \"I guess it was all the grease and stuff that can do it too.\" Jean shrugged with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better now?\" Scott asked with a slight smile. \"Yeah.\" Jean smiled as she and the others stood up. \"Good. See you girls later.\" Spyke smiled as he and the other guys left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was quite a gorge.\" Rogue smiled as she rubbed her now completely soft tummy. \"Yeah. But, like, I think I totally pooped my pants again with my farts.\" Kitty blushed as she felt that now familiar wet and smelly feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again!\" Rogue groaned as she looked in her pants and saw the same thing as Jean, Amara and Tabitha all discover this mess in their panties and pants as well. \"Like, maybe we should totally buy plus-sized diapers for teens.\" Kitty suggested, causing the girls to giggle at the idea.</span></div></div>",

Something everything was very thankful for. Next morning some birds were chirping outside the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can those stupid birds shut up?\" Tabitha yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked at her friend. She saw Jane and Amara and Rogue. Since their sleepover the girls kept staying together. Well they all had the same problems and supported each other. That was the spirit of the institute. Helping gifted kids with their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabitha,\" Amara said. \"Those birds perhaps woke you up, but you complaining about them woke me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me as well,\" Jane added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry gals.\" Tabitha said. \"How did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit it feels good sleeping with a full tummy,\" Rogue added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tummy was full?\" Amara asked. \"Mine was overfilled. It's a miracle I did't threw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ended up all right, did't it?\" Tabitha said. But I could go for some breakfast. Lets get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed was easier said the done. Some clothes were very tight and most would never fit them. However Kitty gave them some of her not so old clothes. Some of her new clothes still fitted her and the five went downstairs. All smiling when they saw a table full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha you're here,\" Storm said. \"We made breakfast for you. After breakfast Professor X wants to talk to you. He maybe can find out what causes those hunger attacks and perhaps\u2026 stop them. I sure hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I hope so too,\" Amara said. \"But now\u2026 food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girls ran to the food. Storm looked a bit irritated. She knew the girls could't help it. It was just that she spent a lot of time, work and effort in making food and those girls just wolfed it down in a few seconds.<br>\r\nKitty ate a entire stack of pancakes in one bite. Amara did the same with waffles. Wolfing down a entire stack in one bite. Jane was stuffing herself with doughnuts. She put two on each finger like the were huge rings. The next moment she stuffed them all in her greedy mouth. Rogue attacked the bacon with scrambled eggs as Tabitha ate a whole bug tray of sweet rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls are eating again.\" Kurt said. \"Lately they're putting more attention to eating then to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Kurt,\" Scott said. \"I heard that the professor might know what's wrong with them. Perhaps he can help them. Then their back to normal and I will have my Jane back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... before she's her old self again\u2026 she might need a  big diet and do a lot of exercise,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's true\u2026 but I love Jane. No matter which size she is. I will help her lose the weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls still gulped everything what was on the table, Sandwiches, wraps,muffins, cakes, chicken sandwiches, hamburgers. Nothing escaped the appetites. The were't just eating. They tried to stuff as much food in their mouth if was possible at once. It was surprising they did't choke. However Scott thought it was a few times very close. Kitty plopped muffins in her mouth like if it were berries. Tabitha placed five sandwiches at top of each other and stuffed the entire thing in her mouth in one go. Amara grabbed the wraps eating three at once. All girls were eating that you thought like if their life depended on it. But then all the food was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that was a good breakfast,\" Kitty said. \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nothing,\" Tabitha said. \"Listen to this\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no matter how much fun this is,\" Amara said. \"I believe professor X is waiting for us. Oh and better don'f fart. Or do you want to meet the professor with crap in your pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girls agreed that that maybe was't a good idea. All five walked to the office of Professor X. With jiggling bellies, rubbing thighs and wobbling butts. Kitty knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" Professor X answered, and the girls entered. \"I see you all put on some weight. But I think I know how to find the answer. Kitty. can you come over to me? I'm gonna look in your mind. We really think someone is playing with your mind. But I need to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty went over the Charles Xavier and stayed calm while he put his hands on her head and made contact with her. A few minutes later he let go of Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who it is. It's...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls looked at each other in surprise. \"But why would she do this?\" Jean asked. \"I think it is payback for the last time you and the others crossed her and her own student team.\" Professor X said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty scanned her memory. She remembered the X-Kids' last fight with the Hellions, Emma's team of mutants who were loyal to the Hellfire Club, which Emma belonged to. Most of the members there were mutants as well. The Hellions consisted of Empath, Catseye, Thunderbird, Roulette and Tarot. The group had broken into Area 51 for unknown reasons with Emma accompanying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the team had encountered the X-Kids, Magma, Boom-Boom and Professor X. During the fight, the Hellions were beaten and Emma had sworn revenge on them, especially the girls. But at the time, they hadn't taken her seriously. Now, it seemed that had been a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this must be her revenge. Making us fat.\" Kitty realized. \"But why?\" Amara asked. \"She must've decided it would be appropriate to make us into sumo-sized girls since the Hellions called us 'fat cats'.\" Jean replied. \"Well we really look the part now.\" Rogue agreed as she eyed her jumbo orb sized belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually thought I heard her voice in my head a few weeks ago the night before this started.\" Kitty admitted. \"What? Why didn't you tell us this?\" Tabitha asked in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that Emma's mental powers planted the suggestion into her head and then ordered her to forget who did so.\" Xavier replied. \"I was only just able to unlock this information from Kitty's thoughts. Emma's powers are equally, if not slightly stronger, to mine.\" He admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. If she only wanted ta make Kitty pay, why hit us?\" Rogue asked. \"I believe she actually meant to do it to all of you, Rogue. You, along with Jean, Amara and Tabitha were only recently affected due to her likely only wanted to largely punish Kitty.\" Xavier explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Jean asked. \"The next step is finding the Hellions and try to convince Emma to reverse the damage before you all become immobile.\" Xavier stated. \"Totally. Like, the last thing I need is to need a forklift or scooter to get around.\" Kitty agreed as the girls nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall use Cerebro to try and pinpoint the Hellions' current location since they likely abandoned their Chicago school. When I pinpoint them, I shall inform you and the other X-Men.\" Professor X said assuredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Professor. We'll be waiting.\" Jean smiled as she and the other girls waddled off to relax in Kitty and Rogue's room for awhile while Xavier headed for Cerebro to try and find Emma and the Hellions. </span></div></div>",

I'm so stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma played you,\" Jane said. \"You could't do anything about it. No one blames you. It was even harder for you since had those hunger attacks longer then us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we know who did it and why but... how are we gonna solve it?\" Rogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" Tabitha said. \"We go over there and force her to take that curse away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the violent way right Tabitha.\" Jane said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna do then?\" Tabitha asked. \"Just friendly ask her. What do you think she will do then. Sorry I put a curse on you. I take it off now and no hard feelings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess Tabitha is right this time,\" Amara added. \"I don't think she'll just take that curse away if we ask her nicely. We might need to use some force. I normally don't like if I need to use violence. But in this case I make a exception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued talking in the office of professor X while he looked with Cerebro. After several minutes he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find her?\" Tabitha asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. She's not far from here. She also was't hard to find. I'm a bit worried. It seems like she does't do anything to keep hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the address?\" Tabitha asked. \"You do know were she is right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor X wrote something on a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is were she is. We need to go there but not\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for once the girls did't listen and ran out (or more waddled) with jiggling bellies, wobbling butts and rubbing thighs. The professor looked at the door a bit surprised the girls ran away without listening to him. They normally always listened. He knew Emma well enough that she would't make this easy. Even while she had been very easy to find. That did't make sense. Emma was a telepath and she knew Cerebro. So why did't she\u2026 then it hit him. This was most likely a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls in the meantime took a car and dove away to the address they had. Kitty and the other hoped the could stop Emma before their next hunger attack. If she does't I gonna switch to cannibalism starting with Emma herself. See how long it takes before she'll take that curse away. after a few minutes Kitty looked around surprised. This part of the city was a part were she would rather stay away. Homeless people, drunk people and criminals were here. Also a lot of old empty houses. with boards before the windows, cracks in the wall. Gardens filled with weeds. <br>\r\nFinally Jean stopped by a big house. It did't looked different from all other houses. A garden covered with weed. Cracked walls, closed windows with board before it and blistering paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Emma live here?\" Rogue asked in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the address professor X gave us,\" Jean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we know for sure she's here?\" Amara asked. \"I trust professor X but it looks like no one has been here for over...well not since I was born. Look at that house. Would one of you want to live there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not me,\" Kitty said. \"I don't like the neighborhood and the other houses. This house needs a lot of work. Just like the garden. All other houses and gardens around here needed a lot of work too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Emma frost is white, not green,\" Rogue said. \"It looks like no one has been here but lets go inside anyway. Perhaps she is't there but maybe she is. I don't have a clue where she could be else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of several places I would rather be then here,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over the the door and opened it. As soon as the entered the heard some scratching on the floor. Probably some mice and rats who were disturbed and looked for a safe place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does't look like anyone has been inside here in a while either,\" Amara said looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A big layer of dust everywhere.\" Jean said. \"I don't think anyone has been here in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" Kitty said. \"How is it possible the professor and Cerebro were wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment the front door closed. Then they heard footsteps on the stairs and down came Emma frost. She seemed a bit amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I expected you. It took you girls long enough\"to find out it was me. You five don't look like last time I saw you. It seems like you all put on some weight. Haha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to us!\" Tabitha yelled. \"I warn you! Take of this curse or else\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what Miss Boom Boom. That's how they call you right. You don't scare me. Not one of you does. As for the curse\u2026 no I'm not gonna take it of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it of!\" Rogue yelled. \"You're strong perhaps but you can't fight all five of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like to admit \u00edt but that's probably true. But I'm not alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shadows  came: Thunderbird, Jetstream, Cat's eye and Empath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took some of my best students. Capture them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderbird tried to grab Kitty but she faded right through his arm. <br>\r\nJean focused on Emma frost. It was a telepathy battle. Jean was having a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must confess I'm impressed,\" Emma said. \"You have a lot of strength for such a young girl. You have potential. Guess that's why professor X put so much interest in you. You might be stronger then him some day. You could be like me But one thing you don't have is... experience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWit those words Jean was knocked to the wall and was out. Kitty seemed to escape all of Frosts students by fading through them all the time<br>\r\nCat's eye turned into her panther form and walked too Amara like if she was a tasty looking snack. Amara started to burn but suddenly her flames got shorter and stopped. Amara noticed she was scared to death for the predator. She was so scared. She realized it was Empath. Sure standing eye to eye with a panther was a bit scary. But Empath made it look even scarier. The next moment Empath hit her on the head with a piece of wood. <br>\r\nTabitha made some of her famous balls. But before she was able to throw them Jetstream flew right beside her and she dropped her balls at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" She mumbled. \"This is gonna hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment the bolls exploded throwing her to the wall and she passed out.<br>\r\nRogue was busy fighting Thunderbird. Thanks to his Super athletic ability he was able to duck away and block any attack Rogue did. At the same time she could't avoid his attacks. Of course if she could grab him she could defeat him. But Thunderbird was't maybe the smartest member of the team but he was't so stupid he would give Rogue the ability to touch him. Finally he jumped in the air. Gave Rogue a few good kicks against her head and she passed out and fell on the floor. <br>\r\nKitty noticed all her friends were defeated. The only reason she was't defeated because she faded through everyone and anything. But she knew she was't gonna win this way. Suddenly she froze. She could't move a single muscle. She knew who it was. Emma Frost. Sure she could fade through any body or object but that did't go for her mind. The next moment she passed out.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

As her grogginess faded, she gradually became more aware of her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still in the old house, but, from the looks of it, she was in the basement now. She tried to move her hand to her head, but realized she couldn't. Looking down, she saw her hands were strapped to the arms of the large chair she was in. There was also belts strapping her legs down as well and a belt stretched over her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, Kitty noticed something: she was no longer in her large clothes. Instead, she was wearing only her new plus sized bra and, here she blushed in embarrassment, a thick white diaper. \"What the-?\" Kitty looked around and then noticed that Jean, Rogue, Tabitha and Amara were also there, strapped to chairs and clad in bras and diapers. They were just starting to wake up now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? What's going on? Why're we in diapers?\" Amara asked as she tried to break free, but she was too groggy to flame up much to do anything. \"Like, I don't know guys.\" Kitty admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Emma walked downstairs with an evil grin. \"Ah. I see my five big babies've woken up.\" she jeered as she approached a control panel. \"Why're you doin' this, Frost?\" Rogue snarled as she struggled to get free, her diaper crinkling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't bother Miss. Rogue. Those belts were specially designed to keep your powers low enough to barely work.\" Emma smirked as she watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you totally gonna do to us now?\" Kitty demanded. \"Simple, Miss. Pryde. I'm going to use my new feeding machine to force feed all of you and make your even fatter.\" Emma smirked, nodding to the large machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why put us in diapers though?\" Tabitha asked, nodding to hers. \"Miss. Smith, what makes you think you'll be able to use the bathroom at any point during your feeding?\" Emma said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get away with this!\" Amara shouted bravely at Emma. The White Queen merely smirked at her  as she pulled a lever and the large, expansive feeding machine roared into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty went first, stopping at a large tank labeled ICE CREAM. A second later, large scoops of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, peanut butter, mint chocolate chip, blue moon and other ice cream flavors poured out into her gullet, bulging her cheeks. She barely managed to swallow before the next wave started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was sent to a large table piled with chili cheese burgers. Before she even really knew what was happening, a mechanical hand grabbed the first burger and smashed it into her mouth. Jean tried to fight back, but another hand merely pinched her nose, forcing her to swallow so she could breathe. Both hands then began stuffing the chili cheeseburgers into her mouth at a surprising speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, was being force fed rather huge sandwiches. PB&amp;J. Ham and Cheese. Grilled Cheese, Roast Beef. All those sandwiches were crammed into the poor fat goth girl's maw, nearly choking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was sitting in front of a large table with pies on it. One hand picked up a cherry pie and spin it on it's finger with a second forced Amara to gobble it down, getting the filling over her face. The same happened with an apple pie. Then a blueberry pie and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha, meanwhile, was parked in front of a table loaded with doughnuts. Soon, she was forced to wolf down ten at a time, her belly getting rounder and rounder as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a few minutes before they switched. Tabitha went to the ice cream, Kitty to the chili cheese burgers, Jean to the sandwiches, Amara to the doughnuts and Rogue to the pies. After they'd all gone to each station at least twice, Emma smiled down at the bloated five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for the second course!\" she cackled as she activated the second round. This time, it was Jean who went first. Before she could even protest, a large tube was stuffed into her mouth and she felt chili running into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was forced to eat chili cheese hotdogs while Amara and Tabitha both were force fed with large, head sized meatballs and Rogue's mouth was stuffed full of rather jumbo corndogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to enjoy your meals.\" Emma laughed as she left, leaving the girls to their seeming fate. \"L-like *gulp* I totally *glorp* can't take *mmmph* this much *glorp chew* more!\" Kitty groaned in between chili dogs. \"Me neither, Kitty. But what can we do? Our powers don't work thanks to these belts.\" Rogue agreed before an especially giant corn dog was shoved into her mouth, bulging her cheeks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, an awful smell reached their noses. \"Um, guys? I think Jean's the first one to need a new diaper!\" Amara called, eying Jean's very full and lumpy diaper. Then, all four of the other girls farted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPOOOORRRRRRAAAAPPPPPP!!* Went Kitty's diapered butt as hers bulged out with poop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBLLLLOOOORRRRRTTTTTTT!* Tabitha's large butt followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFFFRRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Amara's butt blared out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BLLLLLLLUURRRRRTTTCCCCHHHH!!!* Rogue went a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, check that. All of us need new diapees!\" Tabitha remarked before a new wave of food hit them.</span></div></div>",

MMMMMMMPPPPHHHH!\" Tabitha asked before her mouth was stuffed to the brim with fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the professor has the address of this house,\" Kitty was able to say before another wave of corn dogs was forced into her mouth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Jean said. \"They'll look for us! MMMMMMMMPPPPPPPPHHHHHHH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was right since Scott, Kurt, Evan, Bobby and Jamie were in their car just riding into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this's were Emma Frost lives,\" Evan asked. \"Professor X has a much better place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well be glad we're at his school and not here,\" Kurt said. \"I wouldn't wanna be here at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. This is the address,\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like Emma didn't put a lot of money in it,\" Evan said. \"If you need to pay for the repairs it will probably cost more then the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful.\" Scott said while he and the others walked in. \"I don't think Emma'll give up the girls without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that right, laser beam.\" Thunderbird said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came from behind a dark spot. Also Empath, Jetstream, CatsEye and Roulette appeared. All of the smiling in a evil way some of them cracking their knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott did a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen we don't want any trouble,\" He said calmly but on a convinced tone. \"We just want our friends back. Five fat young girls. You might have seen them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment the Hellions started to attack. Thunderbird jumped at Scott but as fast if he was he wasn't faster then a laser beam from Cyclops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJetstream flew around Bobby. Hitting him when he went by. But Bobby realized this after he was hit for the third time and the next time he froze him. He fell on the floor frozen not able to move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that you're gonna lose,\" Roulette said and threw a black disc at Nightcrawler who was limber enough to avoid it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard from your predictions. Point is it only counts when you get hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment he appeared behind her and give her a hard kick against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpath could control other people's emotions. Point was that Evan seemed to have only one emotion at this moment. Anger. Anger that the hellions dared to capture some of his friends. Anger was one thing he couldn't really deal with. And angry or not it also couldn't control the spikes he shot at Empath. it were tiny spikes but very precise. It did touched his body but nailed his clothes to the wall with him still in them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJamie or four of him were standing around Catseye, in her panther form. When two of the got her attention a third one jumped on her back. But the one on her back became two, then three and the four. All four grabbed tight at her fur, ears and tail. When a fifth and sixth appeared it was to much for Catseye. her paws couldn't carry six boys on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the last Jamie walked away from the fight. He went downstairs and found the girls. All the girls looked at him with thanks in their eyes. He quickly turned off the machines while the others arrived<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll boys couldn't help it and smiled a bit at the girls. Not because of the very full diapers they were wearing. It was more since Jamie turned the machine of during the feeding. Kitty still had a large corn dog sticking out of her mouth. Jean had five large doughnuts stacked between her lips. Tabitha still had a large heap of fries sticking out of her mouth. Amara had a hot dog halfway in her mouth while Rogue had a mouth full of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty spat out the corn dog and moaned holding her belly in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ah! I'm, like, so totally full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? I'm bursting!\" Amara complained spitting out the hot dog before starting to clutch her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really\u2026 can't eat\u2026 another bite.\" Tabitha said while fries fell out of her mouth as she barely managed to swallow the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we better get out of here.\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait we still need Emma to lift the curse.\" Kitty said. \"We're stuffed now but we all know how fast our hungry versions can appear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also still have five Hellions upstairs,\" Scott said. \"I guess they won't let us leave that easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're full but we can also fight,\" Tabitha said. \"They can't take ten of us. If they try we'll show 'em what a fat girl can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten came upstairs. Thunderbird, Roulette and Catseye had recovered, Empath had freed himself. Jetstream was standing up but she was shivering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for round two?\" Scott asked and hit Catseye. She tried to crawl back up but suddenly got the entire weight of Kitty on her. She stayed where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoulette ran at Kurt but suddenly bumped against Tabitha's belly who jumped for Kurt and threw a bunch of her balls right in front of her face. When they exploded she stepped backwards and fell right down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was fighting Empath. There wasn't any fear now in Amara only anger. She was fighting with (literally) burning fists and used her weight to push him back. He gave up and ran away. right out of the front door. Rogue jumped with her full weight at Jetstream. Pushing him right in front of Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no not again.\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby froze him again. Even more then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what,\" Jetstream said. \"How about I just walk away and we call it a tie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment he ran away. They smiled but then Emma Frost came down. She took a look at the ten members of the X-Kids. Then at her students. But before she could do anything Scott hit her with a laser beam. Rogue picked her up and pushed her against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now take off this curse or else.\" She growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can touch you so long you end up in a coma.\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can burn you like a torch!\" Amara said, flaring up her fists again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fade with my hands in your body and make knots in your insides!\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can force  my ball in your mouth before they explode,\" Tabitha said. \"Can't wait to see what'll happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try anything Emma.\" Jean said. \"I might be not as strong if you but I can hold you up long enough for the others to do their thing. We also have a few boys here. You can't control us all at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Emma said. \"I guess I'm outnumbered. So fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She waved with her hand. Kitty, Tabitha, Amara, Jean and Rogue all felt like something leave their bodies, making them feel even more stuffed. All five girls moaned, holding their swollen bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're fine now. I cannot take away their weight. I can do things with people's minds not their body. Their appetites will still remain large. Oh and say: \"hello\" to Charles for me. May I go now?\"</span></div></div>",

With that, the five fat and diapered girls waddled back downstairs with Emma as their hostage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma struggled to break free, but the five were holding her tightly. After a moment, Jean undressed Emma to her bra and Kitty forced Emma into a large diaper of her own while Amara, Tabitha and Rogue changed into fresh diapers of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brats're gonna pay for this!\" Emma snarled at Jean and Kitty as they strapped her down into a chair. \"No, Emma. You're gonna pay.\" Jean replied as she activated the machine. With one last snarl, Emma was sent to the Ice cream tank, which began pumping large scoops into her mouth. After two minutes, Emma was sent to the doughnuts and was force fed a whole truckload, giving her a big gut before the machine zipped her to the pie feeders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went until a roughly 700 pound Emma was brought over to the girls. She'd used her diaper four times during this and so it was very full and soaking wet from her urine. The girls smirked at her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you ever try and do something like this to us again, we'll do it even worse.\" Jean threatened warningly. Emma glared at her and the other girls but didn't say anything. With that, Kitty, Jean, Amara, Tabitha and Rogue waddled back upstairs, Jean and Kitty having changed into fresh diapers during Emma's force feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met up with Scott, Kurt, Bobby, Jamie and Spyke at the top of the stairs. \"How'd it go?\" Scott asked. \"I don't think we'll need to worry about Emma for a while Scott.\" Jean smiled as she hugged him, her belly smooshing against his trim lean body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, can we get outta here now?\" Kitty asked from behind Rogue. \"Sure.\" Kurt smiled as the ten started to leave. The Hellions had fled so they didn't face any opposition for trying to leave. Though the girls could only fit into their thankfully elastic and stretchy t-shirts, leaving their sumo sized diapers exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten climbed into the boys' car and sped away for home, hoping they'd seen the last of the Hellions and Emma for awhile. Even though the ride was somewhat cramped, the girls didn't mind and neither did the guys. Jean sat beside Scott in the shotgun position while Spyke, Kitty, Kurt, Rogue, Jamie, Amara, Bobby and Tabitha were all squeezed into the back seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sat beside Kitty, whose belly and love handles jiggled whenever they went over a pothole. Jamie felt somewhat embarrassed by his fixation on his doughy and diapered friend, but she did look pretty cute with the fat she now had. Kitty noticed him staring at her blubber and smiled before playfully ruffling his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was being oogled by Nightcrawler, who kept eying her massive gut as she rubbed and ran her hands over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was drumming her fingers lightly on her brown orb of a tummy as she talked with Bobby, who found it hard to keep eye contact with his NR teammate for more than two minutes before returning to eyeing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyke and Rogue both looked awkward. Rogue because she knew Evan was also slightly eying her pale, marshmallow like belly and Evan because he knew she knew he was impressed by her new size. Regardless, the ten teens made small talk as they got closer to Bayville's city limits a few minutes later.</span></div></div>",

Oh remember we need to say 'hello' to the professor from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we do that?\" Tabitha asked. \"Why should we do her a favor? After what she's done to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you mean\u2026 but I heard she and the professor once dated,\" Evan said. \"Long time ago. They broke up because they didn't agree on some things about mutants and became rivals.

I'm, like\u2026 totally hungry,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?\" Tabitha asked. \"I thought it was just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you girls are hungry too?\" Amara asked. \"I thought we got rid of that awful curse. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps all the eating made your tummies stretch so much that they need a lot of food to fill them,\" Kurt said. \"So they still will eat a lot... but I don't think their hungry versions will come out ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets hope so.\" Kitty said. \"But I guess he's right. Sure I'm hungry and I want to eat but I don't feel like I'm gonna lose control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then why don't we stop at the buffet,\" Scott said. \"We boys also like a good meal right guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can eat there for free,\" Kitty whispered to Tabitha. \"But can the boys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not our problem,\" Tabitha whispered. \"Besides they have money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stopped at the buffet. The girls waddled inside as fast if the could. Scott wasn't entirely sure that this was the best idea. All five girls still wore their diapers since their pants were too tight. It might look a bit strange. But at the other hand so many people did strange things in America. Here in America the strangest things were possible. So why did a few fat, diapered girls matter? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got their plates and went in line. Each of them pilled their plates high with food and started stuffing their faces. The boys also took some food but it wasn't a large amount. Just a normal sized meal like they normally took. Only the girls took large meals and they were really pigging out.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nKitty was stuffing five burgers into her mouth before swallowing them, a very big lump sliding down her throat as she did.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJean had grabbed a whole pizza. She grabbed one side and rolled it up like a sleeping bag made it look like a huge wrap. After that she tried to stuff as much of it in her mouth as was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had grabbed a entire basket of biscuits. She wasted no time and poured all the biscuits right in her mouth. Her cheeks were lumpy and full made her look like a chipmunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was busy with her favorite. A chocolate cake. And not just any chocolate cake. A ten layer chocolate cake. Before she only had been able to look at it while drooling a bit and perhaps have a small piece before she was full. But now with her new appetite, she decided to use it to her advantage and to finally eat the entire thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha had something else in mind. She waddled over to the place were you could get soft served ice creams. just put you bowl or cone under it and you could get a nice ice cream. But Tabitha just put her head under it and let the ice cream just pour in her mouth right out of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara wolfed down the last piece of her cake and: \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!* Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need to excuse for that?\" Jean asked. \"Listen to this: *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!* Look that's something to say Excuse me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really,\" Tabitha said with a mischievous grin. \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Hear that? That's how you gotta burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Rogue asked. \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!* That's how a real Southern gal burps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Guess I won!\" Kitty said with a big grin at her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Amara said. Then the lower part of her large brown tummy gurgled warningly. \"Oops I think I need to\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BLUUUUUURRRRRRRAAAAAAAAP!!!!!!* She filled her diaper and her face turned deep red as she felt the warm, sticky and smelly poop smooshing her butt since she was sitting down at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRPT!!!!!!!!!!!* This on came from Tabitha who also filled her diaper. Part because she needed too and part because she didn't want to feel Amara ashamed all by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of both girls started to reach the noses of all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest. I also gotta\u2026\" Rogue started but was interrupted when: *BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* A large fart escaped her bum and resulted in a rather full diaper for her too. \"Wow I gotta admit that feels a lot better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eh I need to go... get some fresh air.\" Kurt said and was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh I guess I need to go to,\" Scott said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the other boys left since the couldn't stand how bad it smelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nothing yet,\" Jean said as she began to grunt and strain, her face turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Another aroma joined the other three farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, why not,\" Kitty said with a smile. \"I could also go for a... Oh yeah. Here it comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!* Kitty let out a ginormous fart that almost immediately filled her diaper completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kitty won,\" Tabitha said with a laugh. \"Loudest burp and loudest fart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And also, like, biggest dump,\" Kitty said, poking her extremely full diaper as it bulged out from the giant poop. It was so full, it was filled from the waistband down. You could see her poop from behind her legs and the poor diaper looked like it was going to burst any second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know\u2026. I have these,\" Jane said and grabbed some clean diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were did you get those from?  Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took them from Emma. Short before we left. It seemed wise. And it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but what are we gonna do now?\" Amara said. \"We found out we did it. She lifted the curse but we still have a huge hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're still very fat.\" Jean added, poking her jumbo tummy as it gurgled slightly from the poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Kitty said. \"But at least now we can keep our hunger under control. We still need to eat a lot to get full but we don't lose control. This way there's a chance we don't eat ourselves sick anymore. Sure we're fat and we probably gonna end up fatter\u2026 but girls... like, is that totally so bad? Amara, Jean all of you\u2026 you have some lovely female curves. And your bodies are now soft and warm. At least now your boyfriends have something to hold. You don't wanna feel bones when your hug your girlfriend. Something soft feels much nicer. If we're fine with our bodies isn't that what matter most. And as far if I could see\u2026 Scott, Jamie, Bobby, Evan and Kurt seemed to totally check out our bellies and like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. I guess that's true,\" Amara said. \"So what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.... eat! Kitty said with a grin, her diaper sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we change our diapees. I don't know about you girls, but I don't want a big diaper rash when we leave.\" Amara said, noticing her butt was getting pretty itchy by that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls grabbed more food after changing into fresh diapers in the girls room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty grabbed a large bowl of chill. She tried to gulp it all down but some of it landed in her shirt and face, though she didn't care. She just burped happily and kept slurping it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara in the meantime chomped down six rather large sugar cookies at once, getting crumbs on her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean and Rogue were both busy eating a large butterball turkey... at the same time using their hands and mouths. Ripping off the meat of the bones like a pack of starved wolves. Not wasting the tiniest piece of meat except what was around their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tabitha enjoyed a big platter of doughnuts, shoving ten into her mouth at a time, getting powdered sugar, frosting and filling all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the girls kept eating and eating and were... happy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't notice Rogue went to bed. Did she sleep through that? What had happened? Suddenly she remembered. The huge dinner and her taking two slices of cake. How embarrassing. Well Storm was normally a pretty calm and understanding woman. So she probably wouldn't make a to big deal out of it. That was one good point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really needed to ask Professor Xavier what was going on with her. How to stop it. Or else she would soon look like The Blob. However Blob was fat but could take a lot. His fat protected him from objects of people that hit him. She didn't think she would have the same luck. Then her belly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again. I had a terrible tummy ache just a short while ago. How can I be hungry now again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed outside it was pitch black. Rogue was in bed. What time was it? She looked at her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Middle of the night? That makes sense. After dinner and dessert I had a tummy ache. Not so strange if you knew how much I stuffed in my belly. But that was a few hours ago. I guess the food has digested. But why am I so hungry again? I need to ask Professor Xavier. But he's asleep now. I should do so but I'm so hungry. Perhaps just a small midnight snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to fall asleep again but the hunger kept nagging on her. She sighed and decided, fighting it was a lot cause.<br>\r\nKitty faded right through the bed, through the floor and dropped out of the ceiling. Right in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the right place. Just a small snack...\" Her voice drifted of when she opened the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't knew what came over her but the next moment she started to stuff anything edible in her mouth. She even ate a raw broccoli. She ripped of leafs of lettuce and ate it with a gulp of dressing. She grabbed jars of jelly and poured the sticky stuff right in her mouth. The same went for the ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise. But she kept eating everything inside. A block of cheese, slices of ham and bacon. Fish and some other stuff that was probably mend for next dinner. But Kitty didn't mind. All she cared about was filling her belly. She even ate the six sticks of butter. The she slowly opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP!! Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty suddenly saw the empty fridge and all the empty jars and wrappers around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. I did it again. I made a total pig out of myself. Well I'm full now. I'm just pooped and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she passed out right on the kitchen floor. Her belly round and bloated because of all the food in it.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Curious, Kitty decided to check it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, Kitty saw it was very old fashioned on the inside. It had old chairs and tables that, despite their age, were still in very good shape. Though there weren't many people, despite it being the middle of the day, there was a fairly decent sized line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty got in line and looked at the glass case. There were cupcakes and slices of normal cakes for fairly decent prices. After a few minutes, Kitty's turn came. A plump redhaired girl around Kitty's age was working the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi and welcome to Schulz Bakery, where we've been pleasing customers for 100 years. My name's Brittney. How may I help you?\" asked the girl in a cheerful voice. Kitty looked at the options again and decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll take one of the Choco Creamed cupcakes.\" Kitty smiled. Brittney nodded and pulled one of said cupcakes out. It was a large chocolate cupcake with chocolate cream filling inside and white frosting and colored sprinkles on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be three dollars please,\" Brittney smiled. Kitty handed over the money, telling Brittney to keep the change. As she left, Kitty unwrapped the cupcake and took a bite. Upon contact, her taste buds erupted into singing. It was basically the best thing she'd ever eaten. Kitty wolfed down the cupcake quickly and licked her fingers to make sure she didn't miss any crumbs, frosting or filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that was totally the best cupcake I've ever eaten! I've totally gotta hit that place again!\" Kitty smiled, letting out a gentle burp before giving her  fingers one last lick to make sure she'd gotten all the frosting filling and crumbs.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it was the closest shop to the mall anyway. As she entered the shop, it was empty of people, which Kitty guessed was fairly common since it was pretty early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kitty didn't know was that she'd put on a little weight from the cupcake yesterday. It wasn't noticeable, ten pounds at the most, bringing her weight from 90 lbs. to 100. Instead of Brittney, who had worked the counter yesterday, there was another girl. She was slightly plumper than Brittney and had ginger hair pulled into a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. I'm Rachel. Welcome ta Schulz Bakery. What c'n I get a'fore ye, lass?\" she asked in a Scottish accent, smiling and showing her double chin. Kitty looked over all the cakes before deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll totally take the chocolate cake,\" Kitty said, pointing to the cake behind the case. \"Okay. We be havin' a special deal today. Buy one an' get four a'fore free,\" said Rachel smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty thought that was a weird offer but took it anyway. She sat down at a table and started eating all four cakes, leaving no crumbs. She was soon licking globs of chocolate off her fingers as Rachel came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah. Ye really enjoyed the cakes, didn't ye, lass?\" Rachel remarked, surprised that Kitty had managed to eat all four cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They were, like, totally amazing. Like, I'm Kitty by the way.\" Kitty smiled as she and Rachel shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we be havin' a job opening for a new taste tester. The owner's takin' interviews in the back.\" Rachel shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that'd totally be awesome.\" Kitty smiled, figuring she could use the extra money. With a quick nod, Rachel went to the back before returning a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss. Schulz'll see ye in the back,\" Rachel said, helping Kitty up. What Kitty didn't know was that now she had ballooned from 100 pounds to 110, giving her a chubby belly due to the four cakes adding ten pounds to her weight.</span></div></div>",

She had only taken the bakery over a year ago from her late parents. However, more modern bakeries were getting the attention nowadays. But, Dani had developed a plan to stop this. \"I'm so close to my plans for world dominance. Once everyone gets addicted to my cakes, they'll all be too fat to stop me! It'll teach them to ignore my family's business. \" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door from Rachel. \"What is it, Rachel?\" Dani asked with a fake smile as the young girl waddled in with Kitty behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dani. This' Kitty. She's here about the position.\" Rachel said, pointing to Kitty before leaving the two. Dani took a moment to look Kitty over. It was clear she'd enjoyed the bakery's cakes, judging from her chubby belly and the chocolate smeared around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi miss...\" Kitty began but was cut off by Dani waving her hand, hitting her dark brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Dani. I hate the whole formal thing.\" Dani said, rolling her eyes with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I'm gonna ask you some questions and you just answer them to see if you get the job.\" Dani added with a smile. In reality, it wasn't a food taste tester she was looking for, but someone who would promote her cakes and it looked like Kitty fit the bill, but she needed to make it look like an actual interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, first question: Have you ever worked in a bakery before?\" Dani asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. But, like, I totally make cupcakes sometimes.\" Kitty said, a little nervously. Dani just gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. When would you be able to work?\" asked Dani, tapping her fingers on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I can totally come in everyday after school. I usually have a ton of free time then.\" Kitty offered. That was true. Aside from missions and training, Kitty usually did have everyday after school free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now for the final and most important question: How do you like our cakes?\" Dani asked, even though she already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, they're totally awesome! The best cakes I've ever had!\" Kitty smiled, rubbing her chubby belly in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I think I've heard enough. Welcome aboard.\" Dani said, standing up with Kitty as they shook hands. Kitty was feeling pretty proud about getting the best job in the world in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, when do I start?\" Kitty asked, ready to start eating some of those yummy cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now.\" Said Dani, quickly calling Rachel, who waddled in carrying Kitty's new uniform. It consisted of a red t-shirt, a red visor hat and stretchy black pants. Rachel was also holding what looked like a thick diaper. Kitty grabbed both, looking at Dani in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention that all employees are required to wear diapers so we can have 100% of our employees' time.\" Dani explained. Kitty nodded after a moment and ducked into the bathroom to change. A second later, she came out in her new work clothes, the t-shirt already stretched tightly across her belly. \"You look perfect.\" Dani smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Like, I totally can't wait to try more cakes.\" Kitty smiled as her belly rumbled, wanting more cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Go take a seat near the counter. I'll have Rachel bring you the first batch.\" Dani ordered. Kitty nodded and walked to the front. Dani went to the kitchen, where six cupcakes with pink frosting were all ready for Kitty. Dani then injected a brainwashing serum into them. It would take a few weeks to kick in, but she could wait. \"Rachel, the first batch is ready.\" Dani called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it boss.\" said Rachel as she grabbed the tray and took it out to Kitty, who was waiting patiently. \"Here you go.\" said Rachel, setting the tray down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kitty said as she began to eat. She ate cupcake after cupcake until they were all gone. Then, Rachel brought out four large chocolate birthday cakes, with Kitty eating them all up. She was so focused on eating that she didn't notice she pooped her diaper as she sat back, rubbing her full, large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks had passed since Kitty got the job and there had been quiet a few changes with her. The first thing was that she had completely fallen under Dani's brainwashing. Also, her size had increased quite a bit. Her belly was becoming as round as the rest of her, causing her to resemble a sumo wrestler. Her shirt stretched over the large tummy, which now looked like a wrecking ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd also been going around school, telling everybody about this amazing bakery. This led to quite a few students and teachers becoming fat. With the exception of the other X-Kids, everybody was becoming bigger. Kitty walked into class late due to finishing her third cake of the morning. \"Like, sorry I'm late.\" Kitty said, taking her seat, causing it to crack under her diapered girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" said the teacher, not really caring as she stuffed a cupcake into her mouth, causing a button on her shirt to pop off. Kitty then pulled out a large cheesecake with whipped cream from her bag and started eating it. This concerned her friends, who'd noticed her increased size. Kurt decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kitty, maybe you should cut back on the cakes. You're getting pretty big.\" Kurt said, leaning from his desk and poking her in her large belly. \"Like, I totally have no idea what you're talking about. Besides, tasting the cakes is really good money.\" Kitty said. Thanks to Dani's brainwashing, Kitty was oblivious to her weight unless ordered otherwise. After that, the X-Kids gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring lunchtime, the X-Kids were sitting together except for Kitty, who was off doing something. All the X-Kids were eating their lunch while the rest of the school was eating cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong's going on here. Kitty's been getting really fat since she started working at that bakery and she's acting really strange.\" Scott said with a concerned expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and everybody else is getting fat too. Even the football players and cheerleaders.\" Jean said, nodding to the table where said students were sitting. The jocks did look fat and the cheerleaders were rather chubby. In fact, everybody else in the cafeteria also ranged from chubby to fat size wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has gotta be connected ta Kitty an' that bakery.\" Rogue said with a thoughtful look on her face as she crunched her apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I dunno 'bout you guys, but I think we should investigate that bakery an' see what's happenin' with the K-girl.\" Spyke suggested with concern for his fellow younger X-Man, earning nods from the others. The rest of the day went by fairly normally, aside from the fact that Kitty was absent for that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school found them sneaking to Schulz bakery, which was now a factory due to increase in demand for their cakes. All five snuck into the factory and saw a whole group of obese, diapered girls making cakes while in the middle of it all was Kitty. She was sitting at a table with Dani watching her while Rachel handed more cakes over for Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Kitty. Keep eating. With your help, soon the world will be under my control!\" Dani laughed evilly as Kitty pooped her diaper, the stench carrying around the factory. The X-Kids decided to make themselves known after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step away from our friend!\" Kurt shouted as they appeared from behind a bunch of boxes. Kitty didn't even stop eating her cakes. Dani rolled her eyes and turned to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, please help us deal with these fools. Attack.\" Dani ordered. Kitty quickly stopped eating her latest cake and charged at her friends surprisingly quick for someone of her girth. Rogue got knocked out almost instantly by Kitty's large belly, being caught off guard for said attack. The others soon followed suit as they didn't want to use their powers out of fear of hurting their friend. Dani looked over the knocked out X-Kids and suddenly had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I want you to tie these two up, change them into the company uniform and diapers and force feed them. Rachel and Suzanne, help me take those three to be frozen.\" Dani ordered, nodding to Jean and Rogue and Scott, Kurt and Spyke respectively as she, Rachel and a large African-American girl with black hair tied in a ponytail grabbed the latter three and drug them to the factory's enormous freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kitty nodding as she grabbed two uniforms and diapers for Jean and Rogue. She quickly changed them and tied them up to two chairs. When Rogue and Jean woke up, the first thing they noticed was the diapers and that they were tied up. Before they could even speak, they were being force fed numerous cakes. As time passed, Jean and Rogue started to become fatter and fatter, their bellies becoming rounder and they had no choice, but use their diapers, causing Kitty to laugh.</span></div></div>",

Within minutes, the duo were freed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man.\" Spyke said as Scott helped him up. \"Vere are Jean und Rogue?\" Kurt asked, looking for said duo. \"I dunno but I overheard Dani talking about an antidote cupcake that can destroy the brainwashing. We just need to feed it to Kitty, then we'll try and find Rogue and Jean.\" Scott replied, earning nods from the duo as he grabbed the large pink frosted and rainbow sprinkled cupcake as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio started looking around the factory and what they saw a few minutes later shocked them. There was Rogue and Jean, tied up, donned in the bakery's uniforms and diapers and being force fed cake. The duo had put on quite a bit of weight, the t-shirts riding up above their bellybuttons. Kitty was still force feeding them, often swiping bites from the cakes herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, stop!\" Kurt called, startling Kitty as Scott quickly used his optic blasts to free Rogue and Jean, who quickly used their new weight to pin Kitty down as they tackled her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Get this in her mouth!\" Scott called, tossing the cupcake to Rogue, who quickly stuffed it into Kitty's mouth. Kitty, out of habit, ate it and then burped loudly. It took a couple of minutes for the antidote to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errg. Like, what happened?\" Kitty asked as Jean and Rogue managed to get off her. Then, all the memories of her time mind controlled came flooding in. \"Like, oh man guys. I'm so totally sorry.\" Kitty said, feeling awful for hurting her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Kit. Ya can make it up by gettin' Dani for us while we try an' free Rachel and her friends.\" Rogue smiled as she helped Kitty up. Kitty nodded and took off fairly quickly despite her weight and full diaper. Soon, she reached Dani's office and phased through the door, shocking Dani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? What is it? I told you to force feed those brats!\" Dani commanded. \"Like, I'm totally me again, Dani! My friends're like, totally freeing Rach and the others now.\" Kitty smiled, nodding to the screens. Dani turned in time to see, to her horror, Jean using her telepathy to free Rachel and the other girls, who now looked surprised and confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! Those freaks'll pay for this!!!\" Dani snarled as she grabbed a tube filled with red liquid. \"Once I make them drink this, your idiot friends will be addicted just like you were!\" she laughed. \"Like, no way!\" Kitty shouted, tackling Dani and pinning her under her gut. Quickly, Kitty grabbed the vial and forced it's entire contents into Dani's throat. Within seconds, Dani swelled up into a sumo version of herself, knocking Kitty off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have cakes... gotta have cakes...\" Dani moaned as she ran towards the nearest large box and started wolfing them down as the X-Kids and her former employees watched in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, Kitty, Jean and Rogue were having a victory party in Kitty's room. Dani had been arrested and the girls, due to being brainwashed, had been cleared of charges. Rachel, meanwhile, had taken over the bakery and was doing a good job running it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, good thing we totally decided against using the cure to loose this blubber.\" Kitty smiled to Jean and Rogue as they ate their way through junk food heaps. Jean was eating numerous creampuffs, Rogue was chomping down on peanut butter, snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookies and Kitty was eating numerous cakes. They were also clad in only t-shirts and diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can't believe we ever hated being fat. We're still pretty active and agile even with our current sizes and we're really strong!\" Jean smiled before stuffing six big creampuffs into her mouth, smearing powdered sugar and frosting on her face and mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kitty, eating a large cake with her hands, pooped her diaper. \"Oopsie!\" She blushed as the stench filled the room. \"Good thing we also decided ta keep wearin' and usin' diapers!\" Rogue joked, causing them to laugh as they continued their party.</span></div></div>",

Since she'd never seen it before, she decided to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked inside, Kitty noticed the shop was very retro themed. As she walked up to the counter, she rose an eyebrow at some of the names since they were all stuff like \"the gut puncher\" and \"the stuffer\". \"Like, those are totally strange names for doughnuts.\" Kitty thought to herself as she was brought out of her thoughts by the woman working behind the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Welcome to Doughnut Heaven. How may I help you?\" said the woman in a much too cheery tone for the job she had in Kitty's opinion. Kitty looked at the menu and took a few seconds before making her mind up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll have two gut punchers,\" Kitty said. The woman nodded and pulled two gut punchers out from the display case. Kitty was surprised by the size of them. They were as round as her head with pink and blue sprinkles on them. The woman put them into a to-go bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok miss, that'll be two dollars.\" said the woman in her cheery voice. Kitty was surprised by how cheap the doughnuts were given their size, but nevertheless handed over a ten and told the woman to keep the change. Once out of the shop, Kitty pulled one of the doughnuts out and took a bite. Her taste buds exploded, it was the best thing she'd ever tasted and she kept eating as she walked. By the time she got back to the mansion, she had finished both doughnuts and rubbing her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I totally need to go there again!\" Kitty said to herself, letting out a jumbo burp,still rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

Once she got her clothes on, her belly rumbled and she decided it was best to grab some doughnuts and waddled to the doughnut shop. When she arrived, she found there weren't too many customers, which wasn't surprising since it was still pretty early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Kitty.

Kitty had been in the shop so often, she was on first name basis with most of the employees who were always cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Becky. Like, can I totally get my usual order?\" Kitty asked. Becky nodded and stuffed 12 doughnuts into a box.

I think she's getting kind of...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jean could finish her sentence, there was a loud cracking sound. A second later, they saw Kitty waddling up to the door while using one hand to eat one of the doughnuts. But as she got up to the door and tried to go through, she found that she was stuck. Her big love handles pressed against the doorframe. She tried to free herself but couldn't. After a minute, she gave up, huffing and puffing and her round face slightly red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey guys. Can you help me?\" Kitty asked, waving her flabby arms, half a doughnut in her mouth. \"Kurt, you teleport and push from behind while I pull,\" Scott said. Kur nodded and teleported behind Kitty and the duo started to push and pull. It took a couple of minutes until Kitty was completely free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks guys.\" Kitty said, shoving another doughnut into her mouth. \"Maybe you should cut back on the doughnuts,\" said Kurt, clearly concerned for Kitty as she waddled to the couch. \"I'm, like, totally fine.\" Kitty said, flopping on the couch, causing her whole body to jiggle and repositioned herself so she was laying on her back, making her burp loudly. As she made herself comfortable, the other moved away to talk about her for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, Ah'm worried about Kitty. She's gettin' huge and Ah bet it's somethin' ta do with that doughnut shop she's been going too.\" Rogue said with a worried look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.

Jean signaled for them to hide behind some barrels and they listened to the mad scientist talking to himself. \"Yes. My test subject is coming along perfectly, now that Miss. Pryde is growing huge. Soon, I will release my doughnuts around the world and everyone will be too fat to resist me taking over the world!\" laughed the mad scientist. The trio decided it was time to make their presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if we stop you,\" said Kurt as he, Jean and Scott revealed themselves. \"Ah, I see Kitty's little friends have come to put a stop to my plans.\" said the mad scientist with a huge smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will stop you,\" said Scott. But as soon as he stopped talking, a strange mist filled the room, making Scott, Jean and Kurt pass out. The scientist walked over to them smirking. \"Don't worry you will all wake up soon with a little soreness.\" He smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis current situation had put a big dent in his plans. He would need to put his off hand monitoring and take on a more practical approach. Grabbing a large bag of doughnuts, he left for the X-Mansion. Upon showing up, he saw Rogue and Spyke arguing over something in the kitchen while Kitty was still laying on the couch, holding an empty bag of doughnuts. Smirking, the mad scientist went to the front of the mansion and started saying through an open window, \"Come on, Kitty. Don't you want some tasty doughnuts?\" said the mad scientist, waving the large bag of doughnuts back and forth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doughnuts...\" Kitty said in an almost trance like state as she managed to get up and waddled to the door, turning sideways so she could get through. She then followed the mad scientist, with him feeding her doughnuts as he led her to his mansion, which took awhile to get to. Once there, the scientist helped Kitty onto a large king sized bed as she munched on her doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the scientist ran into a problem. Kitty seemed to have entered an eating trance, an unforeseen side effect of having nothing to eat but doughnuts, though the scientist didn't mind this side effect, it also brought out another side effect. Due to being in an eating trance, Kitty didn't noticed she was peeing and pooping her pants due to forgetting about going to the bathroom. The scientist struggled to find away to fix this before deciding on putting her in diapers to deal with the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of Kitty snoring softly, he put her in a large thick diaper, taking time to lovingly jiggle her big belly and love handles. This diaper wasn't like normal ones. It was able to be cleaned after each use, even the wettest pee or stickiest poop couldn't stain it and it never wore out. It wasn't long before this task was done and he went back to his main mission of spreading his doughnuts around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later...</span></div></div>",

Though Kitty didn't seem to notice the passing time since she spent most of it eating or sleeping or, in some occasions, sleep eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mad scientist was quiet happy with how much Kitty had grown. Her belly was now so big, it hung over the waistband of her diaper while her face was like a blob of dough with a double chin, plus her arms and legs were squishy and flabby, her fingers, hands, feet and toes were all plump and her boobs had swollen considerably as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to see if Kitty was still mobile, the mad scientist did an experiment in which he had her waddle to the living room. He found that, though she was able to do so, Kitty was left very out of breath and was quite slow. She then started eating the very big doughnut left for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the experiment, the mad scientist quickly changed into a smart suit. He had a meeting with a high ranking government official to get his doughnut franchise spread around the world. After checking to make sure that Kitty was still in an eating trance and had enough doughnuts to make her full, he started to leave, only for a thick cloud of smoke to appear in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke clear, he saw it was five mutant teenagers, three of who he recognized from the month before when they broke into his shop. All five were very shocked to see Kitty fat and diapered while Kitty started on another doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Kitty's as big as a pig,\" Rogue remarked, looking at her obese teammate and best friend. \"Why did you make our friend fat?\" Scott asked, glaring at the mad scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your friend is just helping me with my plan to conquer the world,\" smirked the mad scientist as he unleashed a pink mist. However, he was left confused by the fact it didn't have any effect on the five teenagers. He was even more shocked by the effect it had on Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Like, where am I? What's goin' on?\" Kitty asked, looking around in confusion at her friends and the mad scientist. When she looked down, she couldn't see her feet. Just her big ole belly. \"Like, why am I so totally fat?!?!?\" She asked, shaking her belly and thus causing it to jiggle and bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell explain later,\" Kurt said as he and the others began fighting the mad scientist. Despite their efforts, the man was quite slippery and managed to avoid their physical or telekinetic attacks. As he got near Kitty, she saw her chance and threw herself at him. Before he could move, Kitty belly flopped on him, knocking him out cold. Scott and Kurt quickly heaved her up while Jean and Spyke quickly tied up the mad scientist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys. So, like, what happened?\" Kitty asked, still getting used to her girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, you were used as a test subject by the scientist dude who wanted to make everybody fat so he could rule the world.\" Spyke explained, having been told of the man's plan by Scott, Jean and Kurt after the trio had returned to the mansion a month prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, okay,\" Kitty said, clearly still confused over the whole ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kitty... are ya wearin' a diaper?\" Rogue asked, trying and failing not to laugh at how silly Kitty looked in the extra large diaper. \"Like, I totally don't know why.\" Kitty said in embarrassment, her round cheeks blushing deep bright red as she poked the undergarment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out later,\" Kurt smiled as he teleported the gang home, leaving the mad scientist to the authorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later found Kitty heading to Bayville Mall to hang with her friends. Though she had dropped most of the weight, returning her face, boobs, arms, feet, legs, butt, hands, toes and fingers to normal, she nevertheless sported a rather large belly that hugged her shirts and sweaters. She also retained her jumbo appetite as well. Despite this, she was happy this way and her friends knew and supported it. Kitty was still able to go on missions and was actually still fairly agile despite her remaining fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unknown to the other X-Kids, Kitty also still wore the thick, cleanable diaper she'd been introduced to by the mad scientist. She did so because she found it very comfy and it made her feel safe. </span></div></div>",

Like, these flavors look totally amazing!\" Kitty smiled, showing a picture of a bowl of strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce, earning a hungry stare from the other X-Kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Not to mention they have very large ice cream sundaes here. They look incredible.\" Scott agreed, showing the others, who licked their lips in hunger as they eyed the image. This gave Rogue an idea as she stared at the menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. Ah dare ya to eat an entire sundae by yourself without any help from us. If ya do, Ah'll give ya 5 bucks.\" Rogue offered with a smirk. Kitty thought about it. On one hand, the picture made the sundae look massive. But then, on the other, 5 dollars was 5 dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that five dollars is totally mine!\" Kitty smirked back as she closed her menu. After waiting a few seconds after Scott got up to place their orders before returning to take his seat next to Jean. A few minutes later, a waitress arrived with five bowls of ice cream: mint for Jean, chocolate for Kurt, strawberry for Scott and two butter pecans for Rogue and Spyke. Then, she turned to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring your order in just a second,\" smiled the waitress as she went back, leaving Kitty to watch her friends eat their ice creams. A minute later, the waitress arrived and placed a massive sundae in front of Kitty. It had large scoops of ice cream, which were drenched in hot fudge sauce, a generous amount of whipped cream and a huge red cherry on top. Kitty's mouth was watering and her friends were shocked by the size of the sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! There's no way ya can eat all'a that!\" Rogue smirked, already gloating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, nope! That five dollars is totally mine!\" said Kitty, grabbing her spoon and digging in. Her taste buds exploded with flavor. She kept eating and eating until a half-hour later, the sundae was gone, leaving a very green looking Kitty clutching her bloated belly, her face filled with pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? Are you alright? You don't look so good.\" Kurt said with concern for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally fine...\" said Kitty. She was then interrupted by herself slapping her hand over her mouth as she felt bile raising in her throat while feeling herself starting to gag, making her cheeks puff up, but Kitty managed to swallow it down, releasing her hand and letting out a large burp. \"Excuse me.\" said Kitty and then she turned to Rogue. \"Like, pay up.\" Kitty said with a smug smile, despite her belly's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah still can't believe ya managed ta eat it all,\" Rogue said, rolling her eyes as she forked over the money and Kurt and Scott helped Kitty out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah. But it totally tasted amazing! I have to, like, totally do this again,\" said Kitty as she followed her friends out of the shop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole week since the group of mutant teens went to the ice cream parlor and unbeknownst to the others, Kitty had been going back once a day to get a cup of ice cream, resulting in her putting on a little weight. Nothing major, just five pounds. None of her friends noticed this because they spend 99% of the time together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day the gang decided to visit the ice cream parlor again for another treat after a busy week as they took their seat in a booth. \"I still can't believe you managed to eat a whole sundae last week,\" Jean said with a giggle as she looked over the ice cream menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it tasted totally amazing,\" Kitty said, licking her lips as she imagined the sundae despite the fact that she'd almost thrown up all over the table the last time she'd had it. Scott then had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I'll bet you 40 dollars that you can't eat two of those sundaes,\" said Scott with a smug grin, remembering the state Kitty had been in after eating just one last week. Kitty thought about it. Two sundaes were a lot to eat, but her appetite had been increasing over the past week. Plus, she could use the 40 dollars to buy something. After a couple more seconds of thinking, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your dare,\" Kitty said with a smirk. Jean went over and placed the order and returned a minute later. After ten minutes, two waitresses came to the table. One was holding the rest of the group's orders while the second held Kitty's two large sundaes similar to the one she'd ordered last time. After saying thanks to the duo, the rest of the group ate their ice creams while watching Kitty as she devoured the first sundae, getting hot fudge all over her face. But as she started the second one, she slowed down, starting to feel full. But she still ate and ate until the last sundae was gone, leaving Kitty looking very green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I lost 40 dollars,\" sighed Scott as he handed Kitty the money. Kitty was about to retort but she then felt bile raising in her throat. She quickly got up, grateful to have chosen to sit next to the booth's opening, and ran off to the bathroom surprisingly quick for being so bloated like she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bathroom, she entered the nearest cubical and threw up straight into the toilet, brown liquid hitting the water. After a few minutes, Jean and Rogue entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Kitty?\" Jean asked, looking at her bloated friend bent over the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, I totally think I got it all out of my system.\" Kitty said as Rogue helped her up and back to the rest of the group.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole month since Kitty had done her second sundae dare. Ever since that day, Kitty had been making multiple trips to the ice cream parlor daily, mainly getting ice cream cones. This had led to a massive change in her weight and appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly now hung over the waistband of her way too tight pants, her boobs had gone up at least two cup sizes while her face had gotten a bit rounder with chubby cheeks and a double chin coming in. All her friends had noticed Kitty's change in weight, but had decided against saying anything that might hurt their friend's feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something her friends didn't know. Due to having accidents in her pants, Kitty had resorted to wearing diapers, which had two benefits in her mind. One was she didn't have to stop eating when she needed to use the toilet plus it made her feel more comfortable. One day, Kitty was back in the parlor with her friends when Jean had a small smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I bet you can't...\" Jean began, but was interrupted by Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let me guess... you totally wanna bet that, like, I totally can't eat a whole sundae.\" Kitty said, rolling her eyes. Eating a whole sundae had become such an easy task for her at this point, she could probably finish two and still have room for at least one ice cream cone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was gonna bet you couldn't eat a whole banana split,\" Jean said, pointing to a picture on the menu, making Kitty drool slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, bring it on!\" said Kitty with a confident smirk as Scott went to place their order and returned to the group. After a few minutes, two waitresses carried the banana split over and placed it in front of Kitty, who was surprised by the size of it. It had three bananas, several scoops of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream, hot fudge and a big spray of whipped cream on top, complete with a cherry on top. Suddenly, Kitty didn't feel confident about eating it, but nevertheless, Kitty grabbed a spoon and started to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, Kitty had managed to eat half of the banana split before she started to rub her belly. Seeing that their friend needed help, Spyke and Rogue started cheering her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon K-girl! You can do it!\" Evan said encouragingly to Kitty. \"Listen ta him, Kit! Ya can't let that oversized dessert beat ya!\" Rogue agreed with an equally encouraging smile. Feeling a bit better and having freed up some room in her belly due to using her diaper, Kitty grabbed her spoon and started to eat the rest of the banana split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she leaned back, rubbing her belly with hot fudge sauce on her cheeks and bits of ice cream on her shirt and sweater. \"Wow. I can't believe you actually ate all that,\" Jean said, a little surprised by how much Kitty had eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just smirked, still rubbing her swollen belly and thinking that she was getting very good at this eating ice cream thing as Kurt helped her up from the booth and she waddled after her friends.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another three weeks had passed and Kitty had been visiting the ice cream parlor even more often than before and most of the time she would end up ordering a sundae maybe two if she was extra hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of changes had happened to Kitty. She put on even more weight. Her belly had grown bigger along with her boobs and butt and she had fully developed a double chin that wobbled as she talked and a third one was sneaking up on her. She also had to upgrade her wardrobe due to popping the button of her pants while eating one of her sundaes. She had also gotten a bigger sweater and t-shirt, but they still seemed very tight, highlighting her belly and love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even had to get bigger diapers to contain her growing butt, though Kitty still seemed pretty oblivious to her massive weight gain. She thought it was only a few pounds at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was lying on the couch watching TV, the remote control laying on her belly when suddenly her belly let out a massive rumble. \"Wow. Like, I totally better grab something to eat. It's totally almost dinnertime.\" thought Kitty as she got up and waddled to the kitchen to start making herself dinner, even though it wasn't anywhere near dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her visits to the ice cream parlor, her appetite at home had grown as well, making her eat more often and larger amounts. Kitty finished making her dinner, which looked like it could feed three people and started to eat it quite messily, with some of it getting on her clothes and face. Kurt walked past and rose an eyebrow, but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Kitty was laying in bed, trying to sleep, but she was feeling too hungry to sleep. Rolling over, she saw that her clock read midnight. \"Hmm... Like, I totally guess a quick midnight snack totally couldn't hurt.\" Kitty thought as she got out of bed, her pink pajama t-shirt clinging to her belly and her matching shorts looking like they were going to burst at any minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty waddled out of her room, going slow as possible to try and not wake anyone up. When she got to the kitchen, she started to make a sandwich with cheese, ham, tomato, lettuce, mayo, five pickles, lots of ketchup and an olive on top while also grabbing a carton of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was awakened by creaking floorboards and quickly jumped out of bed, following the sound and found a light in the kitchen. Peeking her head in, she saw Kitty gulping down her massive midnight snack and downing a carton of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. This is gettin' outta hand,\" Rogue said quietly, rolling her eyes as she left Kitty to enjoy her midnight snack. The next day, Rogue met her friends in the kitchen, except for Kitty, who was still sleeping. \"Hey. Is it me or is Kitty gettin' really fat lately?\" Rogue asked as she grabbed a cinnamon roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is getting pretty big. Yesterday I walked by and she was eating a meal that would feed three people,\" Kurt said, a little worried for his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' last night Ah saw her eatin' a large sandwich and downin' an entire carton of milk,\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should say something?\" Jean asked  just as they heard the sound of creaking floorboards and a few minutes later, Kitty waddled in. \"Hey guys. Like, what're you talking about?\" She asked, waddling over to the fridge and opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, we need to talk to you about something...\" Scott started, trying to find a nice way to say that Kitty was getting fat, but was interrupted by Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you're gettin' fat an' eatin' a ton,\" Rogue said, poking Kitty's belly, her finger sinking into Kitty's belly fat, which caused Kitty to slap her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys talking about? I'm totally not getting fat. I, like, only put on a few pounds at the most,\" Kitty said, in denial of her about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are getting fat and you've been eating everything. You really need to cut back,\" Kurt said, earning nods from the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you guys are totally just being mean,\" Kitty said, grabbing a bag of Cheetos and waddling away in a huff, leaving her friends very confused and all promising to help Kitty loose weight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole week since Kitty's friends had confronted her about her weight gain and her diet had taken an even bigger turn. Every day for breakfast, she would have a stack of pancakes covered in maple syrup and a whole box of doughnuts with mixed kinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually also had a bunch of snacks to tie her over until lunchtime where she had three PB&amp;J sandwiches, 12 chocolate chip cookies and a large soda to wash it all down. And when dinnertime arrived, Kitty usually ate fourths of whatever was being served except for fruits and vegetables, which she wouldn't touch. During one meal, Scott decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you really need to cut back on the meals, plus all the junk food you've been eating.\" said Scott, causing Kitty to pause in the middle of eating her fourth plate of pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Scott. You really do need to cut back like we told you last week. You're getting even bigger.\" said Jean, who was sitting closest to Kitty and was poking her finger into Kitty's much bigger belly, her finger sinking into the flab. Kitty slapped her hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I'm, like, totally not fat and second of all, I'm totally not addicted to junk food.\" Kitty said, grabbing her plate of pasta and waddling away, eating her pasta as she did. As she reached her room, she was slightly out of breath. As she laid down on her bed, she noticed a leftover chocolate bar poking out of her underpants drawer. This gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, if my friends totally have a problem with me eating junk food, I'll just, like, totally hide it in my room.\" Kitty thought to herself as she started picking places to hide her junk food. She then waited until midnight when everybody was asleep and then waddled down to the kitchen, grabbed several types of junk food and then carried them back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the gang walked into Kitty's room while she was out. They were looking for a couple of study notes Kitty had agreed to let them look over for an upcoming test. After a couple of minutes looking, Rogue grew bored and decided to sit on Kitty's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her butt touched the bed, she felt something crumpling. She quickly jumped up and pulled the blankets back to reveal a smooshed banana cream pie. \"Okay. That's just plain gross,\" said Rogue, lifting the destroyed pie up to show the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Kitty's been hiding junk food?\" asked Kurt, raising an eyebrow. \"Looks like it. We can't let her keep it. We need to find the rest. Start looking.\" Scott ordered. Everybody started to look. After a few minutes, Jean found a massive stash. There was several types of junk food. Spyke grabbed a bag and started putting the junk food in the bin just as Kitty waddled in and saw her friends destroying her junk food supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys doing?!?!?!?\" Kitty shouted, shocking that her friends were doing. Kurt decided to speak up since he was the more diplomatic of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Kitty, ve are doing this for your own good. You've got a junk food problem and ve are just trying to help you.\" Kurt said in a calming tone, trying to get his friend to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO YOU'RE NOT! LIKE, YOU'RE DOING THIS TO HURT ME!\" Kitty screamed, stomping her foot and causing her whole body to jiggle like jelly. \"You know what? Forget you guys! Like, I'm totally going to school!\" Kitty screamed, waddling away to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty finally made it to school. It took a bit longer than usual because she had to keep stopping to catch her breath. When she got into the building, she waddled straight to her locker where she grabbed a package of cookies she'd been hiding in her locker and started to eat them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't notice that most of the school had been looking at her. Everybody had noticed her weight gain by now. Most didn't care and went about their own business but some were laughing behind her back as the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty made her way to class, bumping into a few classmates with her huge belly, which she was completely oblivious too. When she got to class, she spent most of it sneaking bits of food from her bag. She did this for every class until lunchtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, she got herself three trays of food from hamburgers to pizza slices to corn dogs and ate them, causing several of the students to stare in amazement at how much she was eating. After half an hour, Kitty had finally finished eating, leaving herself covered with sauce and bits of pepperoni and she had also used her diaper while she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she always kept a few spare diapers in her bag. She was going to change once her bloating went down and she was starting to feel slightly sick. After ten minutes of rubbing her belly and trying not to throw up, two cheerleaders came up to the table with mean looks on their faces. Kitty noticed them. \"Hey.\" said Kitty, covering her mouth with her hand to stop a big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Pryde. You've really turned into a fat pig, haven't you?\" said one of the cheerleaders, poking Kitty in her large squishy belly. Before Kitty could respond, the second cheerleader spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You've turned into a right whale,\" laughed the other cheerleader, causing the other one to laugh and Kitty to blush. \"Like, you guys are totally just mean,\" Kitty said, getting up and waddling away, the cheerleaders laughing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty made her way to the toilets where she spent another half hour sitting on a toilet seat before she finally felt like her food had digested enough for her to actually change her stinky diaper. Once she was changed, she suddenly got a craving for ice cream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thinking it over, Kitty decided to give into her cravings. \"Like, I've totally only got two classes left away. Plus, I can, like, totally get notes from Jean and Kurt anyway.\" Kitty thought, wadding out of the toilets and down the quiet hallway to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of waddling, Kitty arrived at the ice cream parlor and ordered one of every flavor of ice cream cones and two sundaes. The waitress working there was shocked by the order for one person, but nevertheless, she told Kitty the first part of the order would be out in a couple of minutes. Kitty smiled, showing off her double chin and waddled off to one of the booths, where she squeezed herself into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a waitress came up with a tray holding six different types of ice cream cones which Kitty instantly started to dig into, not caring that they were dripping onto her clothes. \"Like, oh well. They're totally already dirty from lunch,\" said Kitty, loudly licking a chocolate ice cream cone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, two waitresses walked over, carrying both sundaes. New ones with huge bananas, chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and mint ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream with a cherry on top. Kitty dug in with glee. Half an hour later, Kitty was left feeling sick with two empty sundae bowls in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was brought out of her thoughts by her friends showing up. \"Hey, Kitty. Are you alright? Ve heard about vat happened at school.\" said Kurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally fine.\" Kitty smiled. Then *GGGURGGGGLLLEEEEE* went her large belly. \"Like, oh poops. I so totally don't feel so go...\" Kitty said before throwing up all over her friends. \"Oops,\" Kitty blushed, seeing her friends covered with barf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get you home,\" Rogue said, rolling her eyes as she wiped Kitty's vomit out of her hair while Scott and Kurt helped Kitty up and then home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Kitty went for a midnight snack. When she saw some ice cream that was on the floor after eating a lot, she figured \"what the heck\" and licked it up. She was just starting to dip some chocolate into a pot of gravy she had made when her friends came inside.</span></div></div>",

Kitty looked up at her friends and blushed with embarrassment at them seeing her doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking down, she saw her belly touching the floor. For the first time, she realized just how big she really was. Kurt could see his friend was embarrassed by the whole thing and went over to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, are you alright?\" He asked gently, helping Kitty to her feet, which was a challenge as Kitty was twice his size now. \"Ok. Like, I totally may've put on a little weight,\" admitted Kitty, only to be given a look by her friends. \"Okay. Like, maybe a ton of weight.\" Kitty said, looking down and making her double chins visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now admit ya've got a junk food problem.\" said Rogue, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I still don't have a junk food problem.\" Kitty insisted, crossing her bloated arms over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We literally just saw you licking ice cream off the floor.\" Jean said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.

Her junk food habit had been tough to break, but they managed to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one thing that hadn't changed was her usage of diapers. She was currently sitting on her bed in only a thick diaper and a red t-shirt. After a moment, she let out a giant fart as she pooped her diaper and smiled. \"Like, I totally love using my diaper.\" She giggled, laying on her back and poking her tummy, causing her burp loudly as she then enjoyed her sticky and smelly diaper rubbing it's poopy load against her still large behind.</span></div></div>",

By now, they were much bigger in size and weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Jean's bellies now hung over their pants' waistbands, their boobs had gone up at least two cup sizes, their faces were rounder and sported double chins, their bodies were fat overall and they both had bigger and plumper butts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also something else about them that was new. Per Jean's suggestion, they now also wore and used thick diapers. Kitty had to admit that this idea was pretty good since it allowed them to eat nonstop without needing toilet breaks and they did feel comfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the duo were in Jean's room, eating more of the chocolate bars. Scott, Kurt, Rogue and Evan knew of their friends' weight gain but didn't say anything since they didn't want to hurt their friends' feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I can't believe we'd never heard of these candy bars before until last week.\" Kitty smiled as she stuffed two very big pieces into her mouth, swallowing and burping loudly, chocolate smeared over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. They're so delicious. I really love 'em.\" Jean agreed with a smile as she managed to inhale three bars at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo kept eating until dinner and then resumed this afterwards. The next day, they went to the store again. As they came up to it, Kitty noticed a sign in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, 'Want a free tour of where your favorite goodies are made? Then find a Choco Extreme Factory's golden ticket in a Big Fat Choco Punch Bar for the experience of a lifetime'!\" She read aloud to Jean. The two girls looked at each other in delight. They had the same idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, they ran over to said bars and started grabbing as many as they could carry. Luckily, they had been there enough that their massive amounts of candy were now free of charge. Wobbling slightly from the weight of the giant stacks, the two X-Kids headed for the institute with their precious loads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, the duo went into Kitty and Rogue's bedroom and set to work eating the chocolate bars at top speed. Neither of them talked much, nor did they stop. Not even when they both wet and pooped their diapers. They just shrugged at each other after noticing their lumpy diapers and kept pigging out. They were determined to find that ticket and thus go on the tour.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After almost an hour of eating, Kitty and Jean were starting to get discouraged about finding the ticket. Wrappers of already eaten candy bars laid scattered all over the room and the duo's diapers were very full by now as they were starting to itch and feel uncomfortable due to how full and wet they were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this is totally starting to seem impossible, Jean. Besides, my diaper's totally filled to the waistband with my poopies.\" Kitty sighed after wolfing down her 120th bar. \"I know, Kitty. But we can't give up now. Let's just keep eating.\" Jean smiled gently as she ate her 121st bar. Kitty moaned slightly but nevertheless grabbed bar #121 from her pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unwrapped it and was just about to sink her teeth into the rich milk chocolate when Jean let out a yelp. \"KITTY! DON'T EAT THAT CANDY BAR YET!\" She yelped, tackling the surprised Kitty off the bed, the duo landing with Kitty on bottom and Jean on top in only t-shirts and extremely full smelly and itchy diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owie! Jean, like, what was that totally for?!?!?\" Kitty protested as her older friend and teammate rolled off her, allowing Kitty to sit up, still holding the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the back of the candy bar.\" Jean said slowly and gently. Kitty frowned slightly, but did so anyway. Then, as she slowly turned the bar over to look at its' back, a flash of gold hit the light. She gasped as she pulled out the gold ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Kitty!\" Jean squealed as she and Kitty hugged tightly, their bodies squishing against each other. \"Yeah. I guess I, like, totally did!\" giggled Kitty in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean took the ticket and began reading the message aloud. \"\"<i>Greetings to the lucky winner or winners of this gold ticket from Mrs. Garcia. With this ticket I invite you to tour my factory for one whole day. You may bring one person with you on the tour. You will get to see how you're favorite candies are made and afterwards, when it's time to leave, you will be sent home with all the sweets you and your guest can ever eat'! Be sure to bring this ticket with you when you arrive. The tour will begin at your earliest convenience'.</i>\" She read to Kitty. \"So, we could, like, totally go tomorrow since we don't have school?\" Kitty asked hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Kitty. Let's go ahead and clean up the wrappers and then we can change our yucky diapers.\" Jean smiled as she and Kitty started to do so, their diapers sagging so much, you could see their butts poking out if you were going past the room at that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo finished cleaning up and then changed their diapers, pulled their pants on and then went for dinner. Scott, Rogue, Kurt and Spyke didn't say anything as they watched their two obese teammates pig out as usual. Though the four were surprised when Kitty and Jean went to bed two hours later, simply stating they felt sleepy from their dinner and candy binge as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Jean spent half the night dreaming about the tour the next day. Jean dreamed about eating more and more while being fed her candy by Scott while only in a bra and a large diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, dreamed about eating everything in sight since it was candy flavored or made of sugary goodies. When Rogue came up to bed not long after, it was to find Kitty chewing on her spare pillow. The southern goth merely smirked as she went to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day found Jean and Kitty arriving at the Choco Extreme Factory. It was a very big warehouse-like building. The duo didn't say anything as they approached the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, a handsome looking tour guide came out. He wore a purple tailcoat, a black bowtie, kaki pants and black shoes. Upon seeing the overweight and diapered girls, he smiled at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. You must be our lucky winners of the tour. I'm Jose Garcia, Mrs. Garcia's son and heir to this factory. I will be your tour guide today.\" He said to the duo. \"Yeah. I'm Jean Grey and this is my friend Kitty Pryde.\" Jean smiled back as Kitty waved to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Follow me then. Let's get this tour started.\" smiled Jose as they headed into the factory. The entrance seemed to be the same as any old warehouse. Jose then led the duo towards a large set of metal doors. \"This room is the heart and soul of my mama's whole factory. It contains some of her old and new creations.\" He told Jean and Kitty, who watched as he unlocked the doors and opened them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, I give you: the chocolate room.\" He grinned as the doors swung open to reveal a large room filled with numerous types of candies and other sweets. Jean and Kitty couldn't believe their eyes as they took in this wonderful sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this is totally like <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i>!\" Kitty squealed as she licked her lips. \"Feel free to eat as much as you desire!\" Jose smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he didn't have to tell those two bloated X-Kids twice. They tore down the steps and began their pig out. Jean went first, grabbing a massive gummy bear and sinking her teeth into it while Kitty split open a large candy pumpkin and started eating it's chocolate inners with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose smiled as he watched the two girls making pigs of themselves. It was clear that the duo loved his mother's candy and were happy to be here. His family had been making sweets for years but had only started the Choco Extreme company a month ago due to moving to the US a year prior following his father's death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty was eating a large handful of jelly beans while Jean inhaled a long roll of taffy. The two girls noticed each other's actions, but beamed brightly at each other. The candy was really yummy and they just couldn't help themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they kept on eating and eating and eating, their bellies bulging over the waistbands of their pants and diapers by now. Finally, the duo decided to take a break, Kitty licking a lollipop as big as her head while Jean kept chewing on a giant glob of saltwater taffy. \"Like, this is totally the yummiest candy I've ever eaten!\" Kitty groaned in delight, patting her belly with her free hand as she crunched down the last of her lollipop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, Kitty. I don't see how this day could get any better!\" Jean agreed as she sucked up the last of her taffy and burped loudly, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little latter, the duo were following Jose over a massive vat of melted chocolate. Several employees were tending to it, making it ready for when it was needed for a recipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a little ways from above the vat when Kitty's nose twitched. \"What is it?\" Jean asked. \"Like, is it me or does this walkway totally smell like gingerbread?\" Kitty replied. Jean leaned over and sniffed the railing herself. \"You're right. It <i>does</i> smell like gingerbread.\" she realized in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm sure Jose totally wouldn't mind if we eat a tiny bit.\" Kitty smiled. Jean looked up. Jose was busy talking to an employee at the edge of the walkway. \"Okay. But just a bit.\" She agreed. With that, Kitty starting to nibble the floorboards while Jean chewed on the railing. After a few minutes, \"Okay, let's go.\" Jean whispered. But just as they started forward, the floor gave way under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, how much of the floorboards did you eat?!?!?\" Jean screamed as they plummeted towards the vat. \"Like, I totally didn't think it was that muuuuccccchhhh!!!!\" Kitty screamed back in alarm. Then *KER-SLOOPPPSSSSHHH!!!* The duo landed in the chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing both the screams and the splash, Jose looked over in alarm. \"Ladies?!?! Are you alright?!?!?\" He called. When there was no answer, he quickly ordered the employees to stop the chocolate's flowing throughout the factory in case the X-Girls ended up in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the bottom, a female employee used two hooks to fish Jean and Kitty out. After a nerve wracking minute, the hooks surfaced, pulling the two girls out. They were covered head to toe in sticky, gooey chocolate. \"Are you two alright?\" Jose asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We just, like, totally got carried away with tasting the walkway.\" Kitty explained sheepishly as she started lapping the chocolate from her arms and fingers with her tongue. \"Here, let me help. Then you can do me.\" Jean offered. Kitty stood still as Jean started licking her clean, beginning with her face. \"J-Jean! That, like, t-t-t-totally tickles!\" Kitty giggled as Jean's tongue ran over her tummy and into her bellybutton a few minutes later. Once Jean had cleaned Kitty up the best she could, the youngest X-Man did the same for Jean. With some help from some wash cloths, the rest of the cleanup went by fairly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPORRRRPPPPTTTT!!!* Kitty farted and her diaper immediately bulged and sagged. \"Like, did you bring any diapers for us in case we made a poopy or wet ourselves?\" Kitty asked Jean. The redhead blushed sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I figured we'd be okay and I left them in the X-Van for after the tour.\" Jean admitted as Kitty frowned slightly. The brunette just sighed and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Jean. Like, I guess I can totally wait until we get back to the X-Van for a diapee change.\" She said kindly. Jean smiled and then, *BBBOOOORRRRRCCCCHHHHH!!!!* Out came a giant fart and load of poop from her big booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\" Jean sighed. \"Well, at least I totally have company in my misery.\" Kitty giggled as she hugged Jean, who just giggled and smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Jose came up. \"Pardon me, ladies but I could not help but overhear your little problem. If you will follow me, I think I can help you.\" He smiled. The two girls shrugged and followed Jose farther into the factory.</span></div></div>",

She noticed  a sign in the window advertising a meal deal: a whole bucket of chicken and fries and a whole bottle of coke for 3.99. \"Like, that's totally a good deal.\" said Kitty as she walked into the restaurant. It looked like a normal KFC apart from a huge painting of chickens on the wall. Kitty walked over to the counter where a employee was standing \"Hey I would like your meal deal please \"said Kitty with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it'll just be a few minutes.\" said the employee a couple of minutes later Kitty's order was ready. \"Here you go. That'll be 3.99.\" said the employee handing over the bucket of chicken the fries and the coke. Kitty handed over the money, took her order and started to dig into the bucket of chicken her taste buds exploding with flavor.

The manager's office is just at the end of the kitchen.\" said the employee, pointing to the door past the kitchen. Kitty nodded and said thanks and wondered through the kitchen, trying not to drool at the smell of cooking chicken and fries. She somehow managed this and knocked on the door. It opened to show a middle aged woman wearing a red work shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you must be Kitty. I'm Miss. Johnson.\" said Miss Johnson shaking Kitty's hand. Kitty then took a seat and Miss. Johnson asked Kitty a bunch of questions which Kitty answered honestly. \"Ok you got the job. Will you be able to start today?\" asked Miss. Johnson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

But before anyone could reply, Kitty walked in and her face fell as soon as she saw Rogue holding one of her diapers. Before anyone could say anything, she started to cry and ran off to the boathouse. Everyone started to look for her.

Kitty had grown fatter as she had outgrown two of her uniforms and her new one was starting to look very tight, showing off her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had also put on a little weight. Not as much as Kitty but enough that she was starting to look quite chubby and had started to use her diapers more and more frequently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night after their shift, they went into the living room carrying five buckets of chicken and fries each and laid them down on the table but before they could begin their feast, Kitty needed to change her diaper but she was starting to have trouble doing it herself due to her girth. \"Here Ah'll help ya.\" said Rogue as she helped Kitty lie down so she could change her. Luckily for them everyone else was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you enjoying working at kfc ?\"asked Kitty as Rough finshed up changing Kitty <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been ok. I've kinda gotten use to using diapers even if they're a bit annoyin' but the free food is amazing.\" said Rogue, helping pull Kitty up but suddenly felt her own diaper become really wet. \"Oops.\" said Rogue, blushing a bit as she realized that she had wet herself again, causing her thick diapee to sag slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I'll, like, totally change you since you changed me.\" said Kitty laughing as Rogue nodded and laid down, letting Kitty change her while being careful not to touch Rogue's skin with her bare hands. After all that was done, they both dug into their feast eating until there wasn't anything left and both sat back bloated, rubbing their stuffed bellies.  </span></div></div>",

The Professor said it could be dangerous here so just take things slowly.\" Scott Summers, alias Cyclops, said to teammates Jean Grey, Kurt Wagner, Rogue, Spyke and Shadowcat. Professor X had sent the six teenagers to the castle as Cerebro had apparently detected a mutant signature there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be okay, Scott,\" said Jean assuredly as they entered the huge, fairly creepy looking castle. It was old and rather dirty. It looked like no one'd been there in a very, very, very long time as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll cover more ground if we split up.\" Scott decided after a moment. \"I'll take those two hallways. Rogue, you go and cover the third and fourth hallways. Nightcrawler, you and Spyke take upstairs while Jean comes with me.\" He ordered a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what about me, Scott?\" Kitty asked him. \"You can take the downstairs,\" Scott decided. \"We'll meet back here in two hours.\" He added as he and Jean set off down the first hallway's corner, Rogue took the third while Kurt and Evan teleported upstairs, leaving Kitty by her lonesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 15-year-old mutant gulped nervously. She'd always been somewhat jumpy about creepy places and things and this was definitely one of the most frightening places she's ever seen or been in yet. Everything looked dark and very spooky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was so scared, she felt like she was gonna barf, cry, scream, poop and wet her uniform all at once as she kept looking around in fright. She thought it this castle looked like something out of an old horror movie she'd seen with Rogue, Kurt and Evan. She'd been so scared afterwards, she couldn't sleep for a week unless she used a night light or, if she was really freaked out, Rogue had allowed her to sleep with her, which'd surprised Kitty due to Rogue's often grouchy and/or aloof personality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the movie had also resulted in Kitty being the butt of numerous pranks by Kurt and Spyke as a result until Logan intervened after a prank involving Kurt and Spyke dressed as the movie's monsters made Kitty wet and mess herself in front of the other students and faint. The duo ended up with two months probation and had to clean the vehicles owned by the X-Men twice during that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Kitty was ready to be brave. Sure, she'd led a sheltered life with her parents before coming to the X-Men a year ago, but she was willing to help this new mutant if it was possible. She also know that if she stayed put or hid in the X-Van for the next hour or so, she'd never hear the end of it from Kurt and Evan when they and the others found out should she do one or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, there's n-n-nothing to t-t-t-totally b-b-b-be scared a-a-a-about, Kitty. G-g-g-get a grip.\" she told herself nervously, stammering as she did. \"<i>Like, it's totally now or never.</i>\" She thought to herself as she eyed the grandfather clock nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, taking a deep breath, Kitty dove into the floor, using her mutant powers to phase through the stone flooring to the downstairs level.</span></div></div>",

As she looked around, she was very surprised by the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the castle's age, everything here was brand new. Bright lights filled the room, showing off new lab equipment, beakers, microscopes and the like. Despite the creepy castle, it didn't look like a mad scientist's lab at all. This place looked like a normal science or chemistry class and had a nice, almost cozy atmosphere around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, total freaky-ness.\" Kitty whispered in amazement as she kept looking around the large room at all the amazing looking chemicals and projects.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that someone had either been there recently or was still there. Liquids were bubbling and in some cases, frothing in several beakers over still turned on burners, a nearby computer was still on (but on the screensaver), the lights were still on and a half drank cup of water was on a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked towards the computer, Kitty noticed a large pink potion bubbling and somewhat gurgling nearby. Aside from the friendly coloring, it smelled heavenly. \"Like, what's this?\" Kitty asked as she slowly approached it nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty did so, the smell grew stronger. Kitty now realized it smelled like melted chocolate and other yummy smells like freshly baked cookies, brownies and other desserts mixed into one doozy of a wonderful smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kitty's tummy grumbled with hunger. Blushing, she put her hand on it. \"Like, I totally knew I shouldn't have skipped lunch, but Scott totally hurried us out here before I could even grab an apple.\" She sighed in dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around carefully. If Scott or the others were here, they'd likely urge her to reconsider what she was thinking of doing right now. But the potion did look and smell very tasty. Surely, if she took an itsy, witsy sip, it wouldn't hurt, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally sure a sip wouldn't hurt.\" Kitty smiled as she carefully lifted the beaker up and bought it to her lips. Slowly, the small stream of pink liquid flowed over her lips onto her tongue and taste buds. It smelled like chocolate but tasted like fresh apple pie going down her throat. Kitty let a little more pour in before gently removing the beaker from her lips, running her tongue over her lips in case some of the potion had stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!, Like this stuff totally tastes...\"</span></div></div>",

She finished it a second later and placed the beaker back where she'd found it, a giant grin on her face as she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, like, it's totally time to go back looking for clues on this new-\" Kitty started to say with a grin when she suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GGGURRGGGGLLLEEEEEEEE!!* Kitty's eyes went as big as headlights as she touched her stomach, which had made the large gurgle. \"Hey! Like what's-\" Then, her cheeks swelled up to the size of beachballs and then, *UUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!!*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty let out a ginormous burp that shook the walls and tables. \"Woah! Like, excuse me!\" she blushed in understandable embarrassment. But, despite the humiliation from that big burp, Kitty realized that she also felt... happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, why am I totally happy about it?\" Kitty wondered in surprise. Then, *GGGRRROOWWWWLLLL!!!!!* Her belly let out another growl. \"Oh no! Like, now wha-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!* This time, Kitty let out a giant, smelly fart. Now, instead of being embarrassed, she actually laughed. \"Wow! Like, that was kinda totally cool!\" she giggled as she waved her hand behind her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, Kitty picked the empty beaker up again and noticed a label on it \"Like, '<i>Tiana Mobley's Secret Dessert Sauce. Just one drop and you can have whatever dessert for dinner you please with the appearance of your healthful food'!</i>\" She read aloud, her eyebrows raising in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I don't know any kid or teen who'd totally want the ability to do that!\" Kitty smirked as she pocketed the beaker, promising to have Beast, Professor X or even the new mutant (who Kitty strongly suspected of making this potion) test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then set off, not noticing that there was a small label on the beaker that had this notice on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid label read: \"'<i>Caution: Not to be consumed by females with the 'X' gene. Will cause brief period of increased appetite, burping, farting, body odor, pooping and other forms of slobbiness while consuming fattening and/or greasy foods until sauce wears off'.</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Now, Kitty felt so hungry she was convinced she could eat an entire barnyard. Her poor tummy felt so empty and abandoned, Kitty swore it felt like she was totally skin and bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's gotta be, like, a kitchen or something totally around here.\" Kitty remarked as she kept a hand around her stomach while beginning to look around. After a few minutes, she'd found her goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, like, let there be something totally yummy in here for me to eat!\" she pleaded as she opened the door. The second she did so, her eyes popped wide open and her tongue flopped out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was fried chicken, pie, cake, doughnuts, ham, hot dogs, corn dogs, Twinkies, cupcakes, hamburgers, ice cream sundaes and other greasy, fattening foods. It looked like it'd been recently made since they were all still fresh looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I've totally hit the junk food jackpot!\" Kitty squealed excitedly, running up to the large table and sitting down in the chair at the head of said table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what should I, like, totally eat first?\" wondered Kitty aloud, licking her lips and grinning eagerly at all the unhealthy foods in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything looked so good to the young X-Man that she couldn't decide. Normally, she would avoid the meat items due to her being a Vegan, but now she was so hungry, she couldn't care less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess I'll totally try the...\" </span></div></div>",
