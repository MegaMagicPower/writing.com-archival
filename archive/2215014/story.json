            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month had passed since Emma had begun her revenge on Kitty as payment for ruining the Hellfire Club's plans and robbing Emma of Storm's powers and body. Since then, the 13-and-a-half-year-old girl had been eating larger meals and snacking constantly each day. This change in her diet hadn't gone unnoticed by the others, especially by the way it changed her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten! It is time for lunch!\" Storm called one afternoon as she, Cyclops, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus and Colossus' little sister Illyana all sat down in the dining room. After a few moments, the six heard heavy footsteps running. \"Incoming!\" Nightcrawler remarked jokingly as a very out of breath, yet grinning Kitty came lumbering in, wheezing and panting heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-Men and Illyana just stared at her as she managed to get her labored breathing under control and stand up straight. Kitty had certainly undergone quiet the transformation over the last month. The once 110-pound girl had ballooned up 90 pounds, resulting in her current 200 pounds. Her face was fatter and starting to sport a double chin, her breasts had also swollen up, her belly was round, doughy and squishy, hanging over the waistband of her shorts, her arms, legs, toes, feet, fingers and hands were all fat as well and her butt was big and jiggly. \"Hey... guys... what's... for... lunch?\" She managed to gulp out as she was still regaining her breath. \"I made you burritos.\" Storm said, nodding to the giant platter of said Mexican food. Upon seeing it, Kitty's eyes widened and her mouth started to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better have one fast, kid. Otherwise, your droolin's gonna flood the mansion.\" Logan remarked. Hearing this, Kitty blushed as she quickly sat down, her chair groaning somewhat under her 200 pound butt. Without wasting a word, she grabbed six burritos and wolfed them down in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did this, the other X-Men watched. \"Should we say something to her?\" asked Colossus as he watched his fellow younger X-Man loudly scarfing down her massive lunch as Illyana watched in amusement and slight shock. \"Nah. Pun'kin can handle herself, Petey boy. It's prob'ly just 'cause she's a growin' girl.\" Logan remarked as he casually took a swing from his beer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be Logan, but I'm pretty sure most people like their kids to grow 'up', not 'out'.\" Cyclops replied before taking a bite of his salad as Kitty popped the last burrito into her mouth and then loudly licked the plate clean. Letting out a burp, Kitty then stood up and headed off to relax, waving to the others as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Piotr, why is Katya so much bigger than normal?&gt;\" Illyana asked in their native Russian, turning to her big brother. \"&lt;We do not know, little snowflake. Perhaps, like Logan says, it is because she is a growing girl and so needs more food.&gt;\" Peter replied, again, in Russian. Illyana didn't say anything at first. She just frowned in thought as she finished the sandwich Storm'd made for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away, Emma smirked as she had witnessed the whole thing via Kitty's mind. So far, Kitty remained none the wiser as to why she was bloating up and didn't really seemed concerned. Now, Emma decided it was time to focus on the second person she'd sworn vengeance on: Ororo Monroe, better known as Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Ororo had returned home from a run to the grocery store. Due to Kitty's growing appetite, weekly shopping trips had become a habit for her. As she put the groceries away, her stomach rumbled. Surprised, she put a hand on her trim brown belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That is very odd. I could've sworn I ate lunch just four hours ago. It is nowhere near dinnertime yet, so why am I hungry?</i>\" Storm wondered as she finished putting Kitty's massive supply of Hostess cupcakes, ho-hos, ding dongs, coffee cakes and twinkies in Kitty's half of the cupboards. Then, she lifted a large chocolate cake she'd bought for Kitty. It was a six layer cake with red and light brown chocolate frosting. At that, Storm couldn't help but lick her lips at the thought of eating that large, yummy looking cake in her hands. Then, she shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>No! Snap out of it, Wind Rider! This is for Kitten! She'd be furious if you took a slice and didn't wait for her. This will be for dinner. I can wait.</i>\" She told herself as she snapped out of it. Quickly, Storm nearly smashed the cake into the fridge and sighed in relief. Then, Ororo headed off for her room, though not without grabbing a few bananas, cookies and ding-dongs on her way out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>14-year-old Kitty Pryde was walking back to the Mansion after getting some take-out at a nearby fast food restaurant. While eating her double cheeseburger, she heard someone screaming. Quickly gulping down her meal, she went to a nearby alley and changed into her blue Shadowcat uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning over to the source of the screams, she found the place empty. Suddenly, she heard a sound behind her. She turned around and saw a group of the alien Brood, a group of aliens who she had met back when she was still new to the X-Men. During said battle, the Brood had tried to infect her and the other X-Men with their eggs and thus make them into Broods as well, but the team had succeed in stopping this procedure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Brood lept to attack her. Kitty didn\u2019t react fast enough, couldn\u2019t get away, and was knocked unconscious by the Brood via a stun blaster. \"We've got her. Quickly, get her into the ship.\" order one Brood to his two cronies. One picked Kitty up and carried her to the ship in question and they then took off into space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty soon awoke to find herself strapped to a chair, still wearing her costume. Then a Brood came into view, and snarled, \u201cYou shall be the new vessel for our queen, but your body is yet to be ready. As such, we shall give you the perfect body for you to carry our queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kitty can protest or say anything, a machine came in and stuck a hose into her mouth. Then, she started to feel something entering her mouth. She realized it was food, Earth food. Cake, pie, doughnuts, burgers, sandwiches, cookies, hot dogs, cupcakes and more. Kitty tried to hold it back as it started filling her mouth, but she eventually swallowed the food when she realized it wasn\u2019t going to stop, not wanting to choke as her cheeks were pretty stuffed by that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile being fed, Kitty\u2019s mind was focused on how to escape, and as such didn\u2019t realize her slowly protruding belly as it started to bulge against her costume's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ororo Monroe, Wolverine and Colossus were waiting for Kitty. \"I wonder where Kitty is. She usually is not this late without calling first.\" Storm said with concern. Since meeting Kitty, Ororo had formed a mother-daughter bond with the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she got held up on the subway, or somethin' 'Roro. Punk'in can handle herself. Ya know that.\" Logan grunted assuredly. Like Ororo, he had a close parent-daughter like relationship with Kitty ever since he helped her during an adventure in Japan a few months prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the same, Katya usually is not late in returning home. We should investigate.\" Colossus offered with concern for his ex-girlfriend. After a moment, the other two agreed. Soon, they were in the Blackbird, heading for space after going to the alley and discovering what had happened. Magneto, Rogue, Nightcrawler and Phoenix had all offered to come help, but the trio had declined. They knew the Brood was responsible for Kitty's kidnapping and that, if they failed and were made into Broods themselves, the other four would be needed to help defend the planet should the Brood or other alien foes of the team try to invade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later and Kitty had finally given up, deciding to accept whatever was happening to her. She had gained much in that time, her belly was much larger, almost making her look pregnant. Her breasts and butt had also expanded, becoming twice as large as they were before. Her face and arms had also been subject to her weight gain, and looked thicker and softer. Her blue costume was straining against her ever expanding stomach, yet the machine kept on feeding her, filling her up with bite after bite of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>God, I hope the others find me soon before I burst like an overstuffed diaper</i>.\" Kitty thought as she kept loudly gulping down the food, swallowing a large piece of custard cream pie followed by a large chili cheeseburger, three ham sandwiches, six glazed doughnuts, four brownies as well as a large ice cream sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine kept feeding Kitty even more food. Cake, sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, pizza, cookies, doughnuts, ice cream, chocolate, tacos and other foods kept pouring into her gullet. She lost track of time, as her body started to grow ever fatter. Her belly had grown so much that it had long since started spilling out of her pants, over her waistband. Her arms and legs looked like inflated balloons, and kept growing as piles of fat continued to stack on her. Her breasts were the size of basketballs, and though she couldn\u2019t see it, she knew her butt was much larger. Her face had also developed a double chin. She looked at her new expanded body, and thought, \u201cI am so gonna kill those Broods for this when I get out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard some crashing from somewhere close, and soon, Storm, Wolverine and Colossus came into the room. Once they finished up the Brood guarding her, they made their way over to Kitty and removed the hose from her mouth. As she swallowed the last of the food in her mouth (a ham sandwich, some cookies and a cinnamon roll), she gave a large belch, becoming slightly embarrassed by it. However, none of the others said a word, as they slowly lifted and pulled the obese Kitty out of the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she struggled to walk due to her thick legs, she had to rely on the others as support as she got used to her plump legs. Finally, she gave up and turned to Colossus, saying, \u201cCan you just carry me? It\u2019ll be a lot faster that way.\u201d He then lifted her up and started to run out of the room, but as they rounded the next corner, they saw their path blocked by even more Brood.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cYou should stay here, Katya. We will handle this,\u201d Colossus said as he put Kitty down. However, she was not going to just sit out of this fight, so she stood up with some effort and ran into the fight, huffing and puffing, her large gut jiggling and bouncing, already seeing sparks of lightning and what looked to be sliced off arms of Brood. As she phased through everything in front of her, she made her way to a few in the back. Turning solid, she tried throwing a punch, but due to her new girth, she threw more than the punch, falling forward and tumbling into the Brood. \u201c Okay, that works,\u201d she thought as she continued to run into Brood, toppling them down with her weight, and pinning them to the ground with her massive belly, before giving a swift punch to the face of each Brood.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this weight can help me,\u201d Kitty thought. And soon, she and the rest of her team were running over to the Blackbird, flying back to Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow are you feeling, Kitty?\u201d asked Storm. Kitty replied with a shrug, saying, \u201cPretty good, actually. I\u2019m thinking about keeping this fat to help me fight. Maybe I'll lose a little bit though. Also, when we get home, can we stop by someplace to eat, like maybe a few pie shops, taco restaurants and bakeries?\u201d She smiled, just as the others looked at her with a look of shock and wonder as she patted her big belly which rumbled in hunger at the thought of all that food..<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nOne month later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut the money down, and step away from the people,\u201d Kitty ordered the thieves as she phased in from the roof of the bank. In the month since being fed by the Brood, she had tried to work off some of the weight to give her more mobility, but she also retained some of the weight, training to fight with her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty\u2019s belly, while still big, was trimmed down, so that costume could at least cover most of it up. Her arms and legs were less thick, and her face looked less puffy. She had, however, retained some extra weight on her thighs and back. \u201cNow I can sit on the guys I\u2019m fighting,\u201d she had told Storm when asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fattened body, she realized, can also take some of the punches thrown her way. It also adds some extra force to her punches, kicks and overall strength. Kitty had also made a commitment to keep her weight, which made her gain a massive appetite, eating much more fatty foods whenever she got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thieves at the bank recovered from the shock of her entrance, the leader shouted to his men, \u201cShoot her fat ass!\u201d As the thieves started firing their guns at her, she ran at them, phasing through the bullets, and as she made her way towards the leader, turned solid, and tackled him to the floor, pummelling him until he put up his hands in surrender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the police came in to arrest the thieves, she heard Colossus ask her her situation through the comms. \u201cGood,\u201d she replied, \u201cI\u2019m coming back to the mansion, and you better not have eaten all of the pizza, or I swear I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You need somethin' to tie you over until we get home and hopefully have more of that yummy cheese, pepperoni, mushroom, sausage and pineapple pizza?\" she guessed, patting it. *Grumble* *Gurgle* confirmed her tummy as it jiggled and burbled in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked around and then noticed a McDonald's nearby. \"Perfect.\" She smiled and hurried over to it. She went over to the counter and looked at the menus thoughtfully. After a moment, a young female cashier came up. \"Hi and welcome to McDonald's. What can I get for you?\" she smiled politely. Kitty smiled after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take 10 Big Macs with cheese, ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce and onion. I'd also like 6 large fries, an extra large chocolate shake, five McRibs, heavy on the sauce, and three Fillet of fish, no tarter sauce.\" She requested. The girl seemed shocked by this but quickly nodded and moved to fill the order after Kitty quickly paid for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the large bags were ready. Kitty grabbed them, thanked the girl and left McDonald's humming happily as she headed for the mansion, her belly jiggling and wobbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she had reached the mansion just as she finished the last Fillet of fish sandwich and fries. Stifling a big burp, she entered the mansion and went to the kitchen, still humming one of her favorite songs as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the kitchen, she found Colossus, Rachel and Colossus' younger sister and her roommate/best friend Illyana there. They were clearly finishing up lunch as they had empty plates and glasses in front of them. Illyana noticed her first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who just waddled her big butt in.\" she giggled. Kitty rolled her eyes. Illyana had been making fat jokes about her for the last month since the Brood incident. Despite this, the others knew she was only joking and so Kitty often laughed along. Kitty's favorite joke about her girth was Illyana stating that Kitty is so fat, she needs a cab just to get to the next corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Illyana. You know, if we weren't best buds I'd sit on you.\" Kitty joked as she phased partially into the fridge and located the cheese, pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and pineapple pizza her taste buds and belly were craving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I don't wanna be under your hippo butt, especially after you've eaten enough spicy Mexican food or chili to take out an army with just one of your super farts!\" Illyana laughed. She wasn't kidding about Kitty's farts either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks earlier, Kitty had eaten an entire pot of Rogue's Five-Alarm Chili for lunch and had ended up dealing with burping actual smoke (due to how hot the chili had been) and large, smelly farts. Even Wolverine was in tears from the fumes. Kitty had farted so much that day that she swore that she'd nearly pooped her pants a few times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww. I'm hurt, Illyana. I thought we were best friends.\" Kitty whimpered dramatically. Illyana giggled as she watched Kitty take the large pizza box out of the microwave and sit down beside Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Kitty, how'd the bank situation go?\" Rachel asked as she watched her friend and fellow X-Man take a large bite of pizza and slowly pull the slice away, causing the cheese to stretch out until it broke and hung from Kitty's mouth as she slurped it up while still chewing. Kitty chewed for a few minutes and then swallowed loudly before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It went really good. I didn't have to sit on anyone and my awesome new strength helped me wallop those suckers into next year!\" She giggled before attacking the last few slices of pizza. \"I thought you said you were coming home right after the mission. What kept you, Katya?\" Colossus asked gently. \"Oh I got hungry and stopped at McDonald's for a 'light' snack.\" Kitty explained before belching loudly as she tossed the empty box into the recycle bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hope you didn't eat too much. We've got our dance class with Stevie today.\" Illyana reminded her. Kitty wiped her mouth and nodded. \"Thanks for reminding me.  We'd better go and get ready.\" She smiled as the duo headed for their bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStevie Hunter was a former dancer turned instructor after an injury during a performance. She'd become Kitty's dance teacher after Kitty had joined the X-Men a year prior and so knew of Kitty and Illyana's statuses as mutants. Despite this, she kept her friendship with the team and was very kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in their room, Illyana and Kitty changed into their dance leotards. While Illyana had no problems, Kitty had to struggle a bit. She had yet to order a larger leotard and had barely managed to keep this one from bursting as she got bigger. Once ready, the two BFFs set off for Stevie's studio (after Kitty made a quick pit stop to the bathroom). </span></div></div>",

Looks like someone's been hitting the market a little too much lately.\" she smirked, poking Kitty's large belly. Kitty just glared at her. \"What do you want, Blaire?\" she asked in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just wanted to see the class' fat little piggy before today's lesson. Wouldn't want our porky girl to become pooped during class.\" Blaire said with a superior smirk. \"I'd rather be big and fat than a skinny, twiggy pompous jerk like you!\" Kitty replied, forcing Illyana to quickly grab hold of her obese BFF's arms and restrain her as Blair laughed in superior amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ignore her, Kitty.\" said another girl, an African-American girl named Lesha. \"Yeah. Blair thinks she's so hot 'cause she has money, powerful parents and mansion.\" agreed another girl, this one a Chinese-American named Kumiko. Kitty smiled at her friends as Stevie arrived to begin the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the today's lesson progressed, Kitty handled it rather well. Though pretty heavy and out of shape, she could still dance surprisingly well with her blubbery girth. However, she should've known things wouldn't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty performed a twirl, she felt her left slipper slide along the floor. \"Woooooaaahhhhhh!!\" She yelped as she lost her balance and fell with a heavy THUD on her butt, causing her body to jiggle like a large bowl of Jell-O. Some of the girls, mainly Blair's posse, snickered while Illyana, Stevie and the others all winced in sympathy. Blushing as red as a giant tomato, Kitty quickly heaved herself up and resumed her dance routine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the slip, things went normal until the end. Kitty finished her dance neatly and smoothly. \"Well done, Kitty!\" Stevie smiled as the others, except Blair and her cronies, cheered, applauded and smiled in agreement. Kitty, panting slightly, smiled and took a deep bow. But as she did, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Kitty's leotard could no longer handle the strain of stretching so much and ripped right down the middle of her butt, exposing her panties to the class. Immediately, she shot back upright, hands covering the giant hole, her face bypassing tomato red and going full blown deep maroon. No one spoke for a long moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Blaire howled with laughter. \"Guess you better lay off the snacks and buy a bigger leotard, Pryde! I bet a car seat place has your pattern on file!\" she snorted, causing her posse to howl in delight as well. Kitty didn't say anything. She just turned, grabbed her stuff and raced out as fast as her thick, plump legs and feet could take her, sobbing as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite growing very tired as she did, Kitty didn't stop running until she reached the mansion and flopped onto her bed, sobbing loudly into her pillow, resulting in it becoming soaked from her sweat and tears. Lockheed, her pet dragon, gently landed beside her and nuzzled her face, whimpering slightly. \"Oh L-Lockheed! I'm so embarrassed! Not only did I slip and fall in class, but I also split my leotard, exposing my undies to everybody!\" She wailed before burying her face into her sopping wet pillow again, her shoulders shaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she heard Illyana returning. \"Are you okay?\" Illyana asked gently as she sat down beside her friend. Kitty's face was blotchy from crying and her eyes were still red, but she had calmed down. \"Yeah. I'm feeling okay now.\" she sniffled, blowing her nose loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaire's been kicked out for a few weeks.\" Illyana revealed. Kitty looked up in surprise. \"Why?\" she asked. \"Lesha and Kumiko told Stevie about Blaire's insults after you left and Blair wouldn't shut up about you ripping your leotard during your bow. So Stevie told her not to come back until she learns to grow up.\" Illyana smiled. Kitty smiled as she wiped her eyes one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd Stevie say about everything?\" she asked. Illyana was quiet for a moment before answering. \"She said she'd order you a new stretchy leotard. Since she knows about what happened last month with the Brood, she figured you'd like that since you've decided to stay fat.\" she explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I would.\" Kitty smiled as she looked at her best friend and roommate. \"Stevie also said she'd like you to meet her for lunch tomorrow at noon.\" Illyana added. Kitty nodded and grinned. \"I'd like that.\" she smiled. \"Stevie also said she knows a place you'll like. She'll pick you up here and take you to it.\" Illyana smiled as she hugged her best friend. Kitty nodded again. Then, she looked at the alarm clock. It read 3:45.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better get a move on! Wolvie and I have a Danger Room session at 4!\" She yelped as she quickly got up and pulled on her Shadowcat costume before phasing down to said room for the session as Illyana watched with a grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty soon reached the Danger Room, huffing and panting slightly as she'd ran the rest of the way to it. Logan was already there, clad in his brown and yellow costume. \"Hey, Logan.\" Kitty wheezed slightly, bending down and touching her knees as she caught her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you're alright, Punk'in. Illyana told us 'bout what happened at dance class this afternoon.\" Wolverine replied. \"Oh. Okay. So... what're we doin' today?\" Kitty asked after a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured we'd see how yer current weight affects your agility and fightin' skills.\" Logan explained as he allowed Kitty to enter the room first. Once they had entered the Danger Room, Logan turned to Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, let's see you run through this obstacle course. You've got twenty minutes ta do it.\" Logan said, nodding to the course. Kitty bravely went to the starting line. Then, \"GO!\" Logan barked, starting his watch. Kitty took off quickly, her jumbo belly jiggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an obstacle course she'd run with Logan and the others before. You had to dodge lasers by zig-zagging or dodging them anyway possible before testing your leg muscles by jumping over hurdles, swing on a rope over a small pool of water and other items. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty plowed on, determined not to let her girth ruin her record at this course. She evaded all the lasers with no problem, cleared all but one hurdle (her boot caught onto it and she took a massive belly flop as a result), and did everything very well. She finished the course, sweating, huffing, puffing, wheezing and red in the face, but smiling. Logan was grinning too as he eyed the stopwatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Pun'kin. Ya beat your own record!\" Logan revealed as he showed her the stopwatch. Kitty's previous time on the course had been 18.20 minutes, the highest out of all the X-Men and New Mutants who did the course except for Logan and Storm. But now, the stopwatch read  18.09 minutes! Kitty couldn't believe it. She just kept gulping air and panting in between gulps as she grabbed her water bottle and guzzled half of it before she managed to answer. \"Thanks... Wolvie...\" she panted as she took another large swing of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Now, let's see how ya can handle these robots.\" Logan smirked as he pushed a button and six large robots appeared. They were rather big and powerful looking. Kitty smiled as she squared off as the robots lunged for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, Kitty phased through the final robot, short circuiting it and causing it to collapse on its' face. The other robots were either completely destroyed or otherwise depowered. \"How was that, Logan?\" she smiled. Logan just smirked. \"Kid, I think ya can still handle yerself in a scrape, even with your current weight.\" He chuckled, patting Kitty on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty smiled and went to get her water bottle. Once in the locker rooms, she got undressed and took a nice, hot relaxing shower, allowing the water to run over her large, obese body. After a while, she climbed out and dried off before squeezing herself into a tight yellow t-shirt and green sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to go and see if dinner was ready yet since it was almost dinnertime now. Concentrating hard, Kitty slowly walked up through the ceiling and into the main hallway. She then happily skipped towards the kitchen for a big dinner. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty soon arrived in the kitchen to find Storm cooking away. Ever since Kitty had decided to keep the weight the Brood had ballooned her up to, she'd been eating larger and larger meals. Right now, Storm was busy cooking a large butterball turkey, a large basket of biscuits, five trays of corn on the cob, seven pies and a giant bowl of mashed potatoes. Kitty couldn't help it and started to drool hungerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm happened to turn around and noticed her youngest teammate watching with wide eyes and her tongue hanging out of her mouth. \"Hello, Kitten. Dinner is almost ready.\" smiled Ororo, knowing why Kitty was eying the food like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. 'Cause I'm starvin'!\" Kitty smiled licking her lips loudly as she rubbed her hands together. Ororo smiled as she carried the food out to the table in the dining room. Kitty tried to help, but Storm just smirked. \"I know you Kitten. You would eat all the food on the plate or tray before reaching the table.\" she explained when Kitty looked at her in bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, everything was ready and the X-Men and New Mutants gathered around for the meal. Kitty sat beside Rachel, Colossus and Illyana. As the turkey was passed around, Kitty eagerly grabbed two large drumsticks. She also took at least six corn on the cob and a giant blob of mashed potatoes. No one said anything as they watched Kitty start eating. She tore through the cobs like crazy, cleaning all six in seconds. She then plopped a large spoonful of mashed potatoes into her mouth, moaning in delight as she stuffed a second one in before swallowing loudly and repeating this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the X-Men or New Mutants moved as they just kept watching. \"An' Ah thought Blob was the only one who eats like a hog!\" Rogue remarked quietly from beside Storm, who smiled slightly at the comment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we say something?\" Nightcrawler asked, eyeing Kitty as she grabbed a drumstick and tore a very big chunk off, bulging her cheek as she chewed loudly, licking and smacking her lips and fingers after polishing both drumsticks off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna try, Elf, be my guest.\" Logan smirked as they watched Kitty continuing to make a pig of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want a biscuit, Kitty?\" Rachel asked, handing the basket over. \"Thanks.\" Kitty smiled as she took one, only to then pour the entire basket into her mouth, making her cheeks bulgy and lumpy like a chipmunk's. Once Kitty'd swallowed them, she popped the remaining one into her mouth as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somethin's tellin' me we ain't gonna get a lot of this meal.\" Cannonball remarked quietly from beside Illyana and Sunspot, Roberto smirking slightly as Illyana merely chuckled. Finally, Kitty licked her plate clean and rubbed her giant tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBUUURRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* She belched loudly with a grin. \"Excuse me.\" she smiled as she heaved herself up and started for her and Illyana's bedroom. Once she left, the others began talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we be concerned that Kitty is eating too much now?\" asked Magma. \"No. She still works out and has lost a great deal of weight after the Brood incident.\" Storm replied. \"Not ta mention her blubber seems ta give her strength similar ta Rogue an' Petey.\" Logan added. That was true. Ever since she'd ballooned up, Kitty's strength had grown considerably. She could now lift items like a small car or fire engine with no trouble and could go up against Colossus and Rogue's strength with ease in sparring sessions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Storm and Wolverine. As rather unorthodox as Kitty's current situation is, she does seem to enjoy it and it certainly seems to have its' uses for her in a fight.\" Magneto agreed thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye. But the lass still has some drawbacks with her weight.\" Rahne \"Wolfsbane\" Sinclair countered. \"Yeah. Yesterday we went to the mall to play video games and get lunch. She had seven triple cheeseburgers with fries and a shake and she was so bloated, it took me pulling her and her powers to get her out of our booth.\" Cypher agreed, blushing at the memory of Kitty's soft, warm squishy belly on top of him when they'd hit the floor after Kitty popped free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention her accident in dance class today.\" Illyana added. The others nodded, having heard of Kitty ripping her leotard during her bow at Stevie's class when the girls came home. Luckily, Kitty already knew that they knew since Illyana had mentioned this when she was getting ready for her and Logan's Danger Room session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will not say anything at this time. As long as Kitty keeps working out and dancing, I see no problems with her girth.\" Storm decided. The X-Men and New Mutants agreed after a moment and spent the rest of the meal quietly talking amongst themselves.</span></div></div>",

Soon, Stevie's car pulled up and Kitty went over to it. \"Hi, Stevie.\" Kitty smiled as she climbed into the passenger seat. \"Hey, Kitty. How're you feeling?\" Stevie asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good. So, where're we goin'?\" Kitty asked eagerly as she buckled up. \"You'll see.\" Stevie smiled as she started the car and they set off.  The drive into the city was fairly uneventful, with Kitty and Stevie talking about this and that as they drove along. Soon, Stevie stopped the car and they climbed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked at the place in shock. It was a new swanky looking restaurant. \"Wow, Stevie. This is where we're eating?\" she asked in surprise. \"Yep. I figured this place'd be a good area to have lunch.\" Stevie beamed as she led Kitty inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was very nice looking and big. Several people were already there eating lunch. A smiling waitress brought Kitty and Stevie to their booth and handed them menus. \"So, what looks good to you, Kitty?\" Stevie smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty groaned as she looked at each item. \"Everything looks so yummy, Stevie! But I don't have enough money to pay for it.\" she sighed in dismay. Stevie chuckled as she looked at her overweight pupil. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I told you I'm paying for lunch today. Order anything you want.\" she reminded Kitty. Kitty smiled mischievously. \"You're gonna  regret sayin' that, Stevie.\" she giggled as the waitress arrived again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you two decided on what to order?\" she asked. \"Yes. I'll have the chicken salad and a side of fries please.\" Stevie smiled as she handed her menu over. \"Alright. And for you, miss?\" the waitress asked Kitty. Kitty smiled at Stevie. \"I'll take the bacon cheeseburger and a large side order of fries. I'd also like some of your Yankee pot roast with stuffing...\" Kitty listed five more meals she would like as Stevie's eyes widened in shock, as did the waitress's eyes. \"...And I'll finish with two of your apple cinnamon pies.\" Kitty finished with a smile as she handed her menu over. The waitress just nodded in shock as she left to fill the order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kitty? Are you sure you can eat all that food? I mean, I know your appetite's giant now, but that seems to be a bit much for even you.\" Stevie said with concern. Kitty just smiled and tied a napkin around her neck. \"Don't worry, Stevie. I can handle this, no problemo!\" She smiled as she awaited her massive meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the duo's lunches arrived. Stevie's was what she'd asked for: a medium chicken salad with french fries. Kitty's was bacon cheeseburger with fries, a large yankee pot roast with stuffing, five cheese, ham, tomato, bacon, lettuce and mayo sandwiches and two large apple-cinnamon pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your meals, ladies.\" The waitress said as she walked away. Kitty licked her lips eagerly and then set to work pigging out on the massive feast. Stevie just watched in shock as she ate her salad. Kitty was completely demolishing her feast with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

And then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* She let out a giant burp, causing several people to look up in surprise. \"Excuse me.\" Kitty blushed as she then stuffed the whole sandwich into her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better now?\" Stevie asked. Kitty nodded as she swallowed her large mouthful of sandwich with a giant gulp. \"Uh huh. Just need to bur-\" Then she froze and screwed her face up. \"Kitty?\" Stevie asked. Kitty just grunted as she clutched her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPPOOOOOOORRRRRRRAAAAAPPPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!* A thunderous fart escaped her giant butt. \"Much better.\"  she giggled as she went back to eating her pies. Finally, the duo were ready to leave. Stevie was somewhat shocked by the bill, but ultimately accepted it with a smile. The duo got up and went back to Stevie's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy our lunch, Kitty?\" She asked, Kitty, who was lovingly stroking her big belly with a smile. \"Yeah. Thanks again, Stevie. I really enjoyed it.\" Kitty smiled as they arrived at the institute. \"I'll have your new leotard ready by next week.\" Stevie smiled as they hugged, Kitty's blubber squishing against Stevie's trim belly. \"Thanks.\" Kitty smiled as she climbed out of the car and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, she went to her and Illyana's bedroom. Lockheed was there, calmly sitting on her bed. \"Hey boy. Were you a good dragon?\" Kitty cooed to him. Lockheed yipped and wagged his tail as Kitty stroked his head before sitting next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a really good lunch today boy.\" she smiled as he crawled into her lap and curled up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the alarms went off. Kitty jumped up in surprise, forcing Lockheed to use his wings, otherwise he would've taken a spill to the floor. \"Better get ready.\" said Kitty as she tugged on her Shadowcat costume. It was a bit snug due to her pig out, but it would need to do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then phased downstairs to the meeting room. Magneto, Rachel, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Wolverine and Storm were already there. \"What's the problem?\" Kitty asked. \"There is an attack occurring in downtown.\" Magneto said promptly. \"Who?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...\" </span></div></div>",

Mystique, Destiny, Blob, Pyro, Spiral, Avalanche and Spider-Woman were all attacking the New Salem Mall. The team had once been terrorists, but had since cut a deal with the government to become agents. However, it seemed they had decided to go AWOL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must stop them.\" Storm said. With that, Magneto, Kitty, Nightcrawler, Rachel, Wolverine, Rogue, Colossus and Storm set off to stop Freedom Force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, they found that Avalanche and Pyro had used their powers to create a barrier, making a fortress of sorts inside the mall. Spiral was on lookout while Mystique, Spider-Woman and Destiny looted several stores and took hostages while Blob went to the third floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Rogue you will handle Blob. Wolverine and Nightcrawler, you two can deal with Spider-Woman. Storm will take Mystique. Rachel, you will free the hostages. Colossus you will try and break down the barrier and I will evacuate the remaining workers and shoppers not yet captured.\" Magneto ordered promptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha Mags.\" Logan said as they prepared. \"Wait. Who's gonna take Spiral?\" asked Rachel suddenly. \"I can.\" Kitty said promptly. \"Alright. Just be careful Kitten.\" Storm said as she watched her obese friend and teammate head to the second floor via walking on air, belly, boobs, hips and booty jiggling as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter reaching the second floor unnoticed by the FF, Kitty slowly made her way towards the spot beneath her where she knew Spiral was. The only thing separating them now was the floor/first floor ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked down at her big body and got an idea that made her smile. She phased through the floor and then went solid, allowing herself to fall. Spiral only had time to look up and see a massive blue butt falling for her. Not only was she too shocked to teleport in time, there was also no time for her to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOoommmmppphhh!\" Kitty grunted as she crushed Mojo's teleporter and right hand woman under her jumbo booty. Spiral was incapacitated and Kitty now had a different challenge: getting off the six armed villainess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wolverine and Kurt were fighting Spider-Woman. Despite being fairly new to the villainess game, the new Spider-Woman was proving to be no pushover. Kurt and Logan were only just able to counter her web lines and physical attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Storm was fighting Mystique in hand-to-hand combat. Both were proving to be equally matched, though Storm was somewhat quicker than Raven. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny stood back and watched. Due to being blind, she usually didn't intervene physically. Instead she used her future predicting power to help the best she could. But right now, with Mystique and Storm moving around so much, she couldn't get a clear reading of the outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Colossus was busy crashing his way through the still very thick barriers. Though he was making good progress, it was taking him forever to get through it entirely due to Avalanche and Pyro making an even thicker wall behind the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was nearby, using her telekinesis to free the tied up hostages from their bonds. When each one was freed, they quickly began helping Rachel free the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagneto was evacuating the still free guards, shoppers and workers, using his powers to protect them from Avalanche and Pyro's attempts to capture them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Blob was (naturally) making his way to the third floor food court. Rogue was already there, just sitting calmly at an abandoned table, unafraid of the 510 pound mutant. Rogue then got an idea as she watched Blob lumber towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her glove off, she leapt onto Blob, absorbing his power and knocking him out cold. Rogue then felt a massive change coming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty managed to finally heave her obese body off the still unconscious Spiral and slowly made her way towards the fortress.  She was very sweaty and greasy feeling, but she knew that Freedom Force needed to be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Kitty waddled-ran up to the fortress as she eyed the battle. Wolverine and Nightcrawler had finally managed to floor Spider-Woman while Storm had taken down Mystique and Destiny, Phoenix and Magneto had safely cleared both the captured and still freed employees, shoppers and onlookers out and Colossus was still smashing his way through the barrier. Kitty didn't see Rogue, but she was sure her southern teammate and friend was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing Colossus's trouble in getting through the barrier, Kitty smiled and phased through the back of it. When she got into the middle of it, she found Avalanche and Pyro standing on the top of the fortress. Pyro was the first to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Avalanche! Check this out. Looks like the X-Losers've gotten themselves another Blob! An' this one seems ta be that little Sheila member of theirs!\" He said before he laughed along with Avalanche. Kitty understandably felt hurt by the laughter. Between the comments and how very pooped she was by now, Kitty was starting to doubt if she could handle these two bozos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"Not jus' one Blob Sugah! Now ya gotta deal with two of 'em!\" said a voice. A second later, a giant hole was ripped in the barrier. Kitty just stared as a 510 pound Rogue waddled in. After touching Blob, Rogue had absorbed his powers and his weight by extension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was now huge. With big, ripe looking boobs, a giant belly, elephant sized thighs, a jumbo butt and a large plumped face. She had almost destroyed her clothes, her black bodysuit stretched so that it was in danger of ripping and her sleeveless green t-shirt serving as a bra while her gloves were just barely covering her ham sized hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, shocked as she was, knew she would need to wait until later to eye her friend's new obesity. They still had creeps to stop. Pyro aimed his flamethrowers and Avalanche jumped down to face the two sumo sized X-Ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue, get me up there!\" Kitty said as Rogue picked Kitty up easily due to both Ms. Marvel and Blob's strength and threw her friend towards Pyro. Kitty flew through the air like a big, fat, soft wrecking ball. Pyro tried using his flamethrowers, but Kitty merely phased through them until the 410 pound 14-year-old mutant slammed into him, knocking the Australian mutant out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, advanced on Avalanche, knocking aside any debris he tried to use on her. She finally got close enough to Avalanche to floor him with one good solid punch to the head. Kitty phased down next to Rogue and the two obese friends plopped down on their massive booties to catch their breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... I'm so... pooped. The... others... should be... here soon... to... help... bring these... guys... out for the cops...\" Kitty wheezed, face bright red, her hands rubbing her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... you're right... sugah... ya... wanna... grab... a bite... to eat... while... we... wait? Mah... belly's starvin'...\" Rogue wheezed, her new mammoth sized belly feeling very empty. Kitty nodded and the duo, after heaving themselves up, waddled to the food court. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Wolverine, Phoenix, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Magneto and Ororo had handed Freedom Force over to the police and found the two younger girls at the food court, Kitty and Rogue had polished off two stands' supplies of food. They had food stains on their uniforms and faces, but felt very happy as they waddled after their teammates, Kitty eating a massive amount of corn dogs while Rogue munched on a jumbo bucket of fried chicken. </span></div></div>",

New Mutants member Karma had been possessed by Xavier's old enemy Shadow King. During this time, his overindulging habits rendered Karma immobility obese. The X-Men and New Mutants had successfully rescued and brought Karma home. Now, Professor X and Fantastic Four member Reed Richards were trying to find a way to help Karma while the X-Men dealt with Shadow King's remaining forces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, \"C'mon Kitty! What's the harm of one more bite?\" Karma was complaining as Kitty \"Shadowcat\" Pryde held a large slice of pizza away from her while her body was being partially phased in Karma's gut and one hand phased in her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because the last four bites you took wiped out eight extra-extra large pizzas! I think that's enough snack time, Karma.\" Kitty explained gently. At that moment, Storm arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, the team is mobilizing to take on what's left of Shadow King's organization. I need you to stay here and look after Karma.\" She said. \"Easier said than done!\" Kitty retorted as she and Karma kept struggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the others left, Karma stopped struggling. \"It's just not fair! I can't help it that I'm always hungry nowadays!\" She pointed out sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got to find a way to curb your appetite somehow. I'm sure the Professor and Dr. Richards'll come up with a plan.\" Kitty said reassuringly as she walked away. Karma frowned in dismay as Kitty did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll never understand. I'll just have to make her understand!\" she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

As this happened, Kitty froze, her eyes becoming purple in color, the way anyone's Karma used her powers on did. She then turned back to the fridge in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMM!! Let the snacking continue!\" She smiled, licking her lips as she grabbed a carton of ice cream and poured it into her mouth while grabbing another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarma smirked as Kitty kept eating. Slowly, but surely, Kitty's belly started swelling up. As it got bigger and bigger, her costume's shirt started ripping open, exposing her jumbo belly. Her face also grew rounder as her body also bloated up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Karma's delight turned to fear as Kitty started hogging the foods and drinks for herself. After eating the second ice cream carton in the same manner as the previous one, Kitty started guzzling down a large bottle of soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GULP* *GULP* *GULP* Kitty gulped very loudly, letting out a large burp after she finished. \"H-Hey! Save some for me!\" Karma wailed in alarm. Kitty grinned and, waddling slightly now, handed Karma some red velvet cake while keeping the rest to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's much better.\" Karma smiled as she ate her slices, growing bigger as well. Kitty just smiled and buried her face into the rest of the large cake, eating like a pig. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours seemed to just fly by as the duo ate and ate and ate and ate and ate. Finally, Karma was much bigger than before and Kitty was getting closer to being the same size as her friend. Karma, however, didn't want her too. She only wanted Kitty to know hunger and not end up immobile as her. \"I'd better take my hunger out of her otherwise she's gonna need help movin' around too.\" she decided as Kitty devoured an entire basket of large buttery biscuits in one go, her belly now hanging over the waistband of her tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

I'd better look in on her and Karma...\" Ororo decided as she headed for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she couldn't believe it. Karma was now much larger and she wasn't the only fat one in the kitchen now. A very bloated Shadowcat was eating like crazy, her belly jiggling as she did so and she didn't even seem to notice her obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?!?!? Karma? What's happened to Kitty?!?!?\" Ororo demanded to know in disbelief as Kitty devoured an entire ham in just a few bites before loudly chugging more soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted Kitty to experience the same hunger I've been facing so I gave her some of mine. Don't worry. I'm gonna take it out of her right... now!\" Karma explained as she quickly pulled her hunger from Kitty. The second she did, Kitty let out a large burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUURRRRRRPPPPPP!!* Ugh... man, what happened?\" Kitty groaned, rubbing her head. Then, she noticed her very large, squishy, jiggly belly poking out of her costume's jacket. Her hips and butt were also bigger, her face was round and doughy, her boobs had gone up a few sizes, her arms, legs, feet, hands, fingers and toes were all plump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God! Karma?!?!? What happened to me?!?!?\" She asked, poking her large belly, causing it to gurgle loudly. \"Um... well... I kinda used my powers to give some of my hunger to you.\" Karma sheepishly explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!? You brainwashed me to become fat!?!?!?\" Kitty shrieked, only to clutch her belly as it rumbled ominously. \"No! I-I just wanted you to understand the level of hunger I'm facing right now! I mean, you pack food away like crazy and don't seem to either gain a pound or even think about it!\" Karma protested. \"I am sure her intentions were noble, Kitten. Though they were a bit misguided.\" Ororo said gently. Kitty frowned, but then sighed and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, Ororo. Karma, I'm sorry if I didn't understand your hunger pains. Boy, I sure do now! *Brrraaaapppp!*\" She smiled, letting out another giant burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least you seemed to enjoy our pig out.\" Karma smiled. \"Yeah. Somethin's tellin' me I'm gonna need to have a few extra Danger Room sessions to lose this blubber.\" Kitty giggled, poking her gurgling, rumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure they will only be for a few weeks, Kitten. Then you'll be slim and trim again.\" Storm smiled. \"Would you like to start now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Kitty smiled. But then, *RUMBLE* *GURGLE* GLOOORRRRRPPPP* *SLOSH* *GGGURRRRGGGGLLLLEEE* Her belly let out five alarming tummy noises. \"Uh, actually Ororo\u2026 could I take a raincheck? My tummy's got other plans!\" Kitty whimpered. \"Certainly.\" Ororo smiled as Kitty, despite being rather bloated, turned and raced for the bathroom where Storm and Karma heard her puking a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Storm's theory about Kitty's dieting and exercising worked and Kitty was back to her slim, trim fighting form within two weeks. Though Kitty's new larger appetite remained, she was careful not to extremely overdo it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One evening, Kitty Pryde, Wolverine, Rogue, Magneto, Phoenix, Nightcrawler, Colossus and Storm were relaxing at the mansion when they learned of a robbery in progress at a chemical company. \"That's the new Raxxon Chemical plant!\" Kitty realized as they watched the news report. \"We shall leave at once!\" Storm declared as the X-Men set off to get into costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the team reached the chemical plant. \"Alright. Here's the plan. Rogue and Colossus shall cover the backway. Magneto, you and Phoenix will handle those who try to come out via the roof. Wolverine will handle the front, Nightcrawler is with me and we'll attack from within. With any luck, we will drive the other robbers to your stations.\" Ororo said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what about me, Storm?\" Kitty asked. \"You shall stay here in case of any stragglers.\" Storm ordered as the others set off, Kitty pouting sadly. She should be used to this, she knew. At 14, she was considered the 'baby' of the X-Men and often got left behind from the more exciting parts of missions or whole missions is a result. With a huff, Kitty leaned against the Rolls Royce the team used for local missions. \"If I'm such a baby, why aren't I in a big diaper?\" she joked slightly as she closed her eyes and stretched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Storm and Nightcrawler were creeping along the rafters, watching at least 20 thugs laughing and talking jeeringly as they unloaded numerous objects, both chemical wise and machine wise. \"It appears there are only twenty of them. Remember, Kurt, we are to only scare them into retreating. Only engage if needed.\" Ororo whispered. \"Ja.\" Kurt smiled back as they slowly dropped down and crept towards the thugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, boys. Let's get this stuff loaded into the truck.\" said the leader, a big muscular man named Snake with a tattoo of a cobra on his arm. He'd been in trouble with the law before since he was a teenager growing up in very rough area of Harlem. His father had walked out on the family when he was 8 and his mother had worked herself ill trying to support him and his younger sister. His sister was doing well, having recently been promoted at the company she worked at. She often tried to help Snake due to their closeness, but even she could be annoyed by his criminal ways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite this, Snake had recently decided to go straight. But when his current employer approached him with the heist, the pay was too high to ignore. He figured he would do this last job and then go straight and find a job. Despite his thuggish nature, Snake was an intelligent man and managed to graduate high school despite his run-ins with the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, \"Step away from the goods, villains!\" Storm commanded as she appeared from the shadows. At this, the gang all howled with laughter. \"An' what're you gonna do, little girl? Beat us with your girly purse?\" jeered Jaspar Norton, Snake's right hand man. \"Man, shut up fool! That's the leader o' them X-Men punks!\" snarled another guy, sporting an eyepatch over his left eye and holding a crowbar. \"You are correct. I am Storm.\" Ororo replied, clutching her fists and getting in a sparring stance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just stand there, idiots! GET 'ER!\" Shouted Jaspar. Then, all heck broke loose. Storm quickly managed to overpower the crowbar wielding man first by grabbing his wrist and flipping him over her shoulder when he tried to bash her head in. He smashed into some empty boxes and blacked out after receiving a well placed front kick to the chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second guy, wielding a switchblade, tried to attack her, only to be grabbed by Nightcrawler via the former's tail. \"Zat's not very nice, mein friend.\" he snarled. \"Holy mother- A DEMON!!!\" screeched the gangbanger in horror. \"Momma was right! A real demon!\" shouted a fourth punk, wielding a baseball bat. \"Get 'im!\" shouted Snake. The thugs tried, but couldn't stop either Ororo or Kurt, Kurt due to his agility and teleportation and Storm due to her incredible hand-to-hand skills. Finally, the group began to retreat in horror. \"Spread out!\" Snake bellowed as he ran for the front doors. Five went to the roof, five more took the back and another five followed Snake for the main doors. \"Going the wrong way.\" Kurt joked as Ororo rolled her eyes at her friend's joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the rooftop, \"C'mon! We gotta beat it before that demon comes back!\" shouted a younger gangbanger. Then, several metal pieces flew towards the five and began coiling around them. \"What the hell's goin' on, man!?!?!?\" a heavyset member asked in terror. \"You made a grave mistake in coming here to rob this building.\" Magneto said firmly as he and Rachel appeared from the shadows. \"More of those X-Punks!\" shouted the first guy. \"Should I probe their minds, Magneto? Maybe we can see who's behind this.\" Rachel offered as the guy shuddered within his metal prison.  \"No, Phoenix. We shall let the police handle that.\" Magneto smirked as he and Rachel kept the punks at bay, waiting for the police to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, \"My bullets ain't hurtin' either of 'em!\" shouted a dreadlocks  sporting gangbanger as he repeatedly shot his gun at Colossus and Rogue, who were protected by their powers. \"I am afraid you will not get the chance to use it again, comrade.\" Colossus smirked as with a simple punch, he knocked the guy out. Rogue was nearby, easily dispatching the four guys she was fighting with with ease due to her super strength. \"Y'all's mommas must be so proud of ya. Rippin' off a chemical company and stealin' things meant to help other people.\" Rogue scolded as she sucker punched a tattooed punk into the wall before round kicking another into a stack of crates nearby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, \"C'mon punks! Thought ya were lookin' fer a scrape.\" Logan laughed as he easily overpowered Snake and his team by cutting their weapons to ribbons with his claws. \"<i>Better cool it with my claws now that we're goin' hand-ta-hand. They're just kids. Almost 'round Kitty's age or older. Life ain't been easy on 'em, but this ain't the right way ta improve it</i>.\" Logan told himself as he kept sparring. Soon, all but Snake were defeated. Snake had fled after briefly blinding Wolverine with a broken bottle he'd pocketed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he ran to where their employer was waiting. \"I'm sorry, ma'am. The X-Men done handed our butts to us.\" he apologized to the woman. \"Don't worry, Snake. I am happy with our progress tonight. Now, you should flee before the police come.\" she told him as he quickly raced off to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kitty was still waiting by the Rolls Royce, humming a Dazzler song to herself as she looked around the empty parking lot. \"<i>Man, I knew this would happen! Every time I'm sent to cover the sidelines, nothing happens! If I wasn't 14 years old, I'd pitch a major big temper tantrum</i>!\" Kitty pouted mentally. Then, she noticed Snake heading for a van nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, YOU! STOP!\" She shouted, running for him. Snake was almost to the van when Kitty dove into the ground and surfaced a second later, grabbing his ankle and knocking Snake down. \"Who're you?\" he asked. \"Name's Shadowcat. And you just got served!\" Kitty smiled. Then, Snake's employer aimed a ray gun at the unsuspecting Kitty and pulled the trigger. A bright blue beam flew out and hit Kitty in her back. \"Hey!\" she yelped as she stumbled back, allowing Snake to escape. The last thing Kitty saw before she fainted was Snake getting into the van, driven by a woman in a lab coat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here she is!\" \"Kitty?!? Can ya hear us, sugar?!?!?!?\" \"C'mon ,Kid! Wake up an' answer us!\" \"Should I try and wake her mentally?\" \"Katya, please wake up!\" With a groan, Kitty slowly opened her eyes and found the X-Men looking down at her. \"Anybody get the name of that train?\" she mumbled as she slowly sat up. \"You, alright, Pun'kin?\" Logan asked. \"Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine Wolvie. My head's feels like a jackhammer's poundin' it, that's all.\" Kitty said while managing to stand up on somewhat wobbly legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Storm asked. \"A guy ran across the lot to this van. I managed to stop him and then for some reason I blacked out.\" Kitty admitted, holding her head slightly. \"Did we stop 'em?\" she asked, trying to change the subject. \"Yes. We stopped all but the leader. He must've been the one you encountered.\" Ororo replied. \"Did they get the stuff they were after?\" Kitty questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid so, Katya. But at least we stopped the villains.\" Colossus pointed out as the others shrugged or nodded. \"Yeah. I guess so.\" Kitty agreed as they left. That night, Kitty fell fast asleep and slept very soundly. But as she did, she didn't notice a strange tingling feeling going through her. Nor did she feel something wet and warm running down her legs onto her bedsheets as the night wore on.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bright and early the next morning, Kitty woke up with a loud yawn. \"Man, that was a good night's sleep. I-\" Then, she froze as she felt something wet and itchy on her sheet and shorts. Eyes widening nervously, Kitty threw her blankets off and saw, to her absolute horror, a big yellow pee stain right in the middle of her bedsheet. Immediately, Shadowcat wanted to cry in dismay. She hadn't wet her bed in 10 years. The last time was when she was 4 years old and had drank a ton of water before bed, resulting in a dream involving a whitewater rafting trip, which had resulted in a very wet bed the next morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe look towards her roommate and best friend Illyana's bed. Luckily, it was empty. Her dragon companion, Lockheed, was already awake and watching her. Noticing Kitty's tearful expression, Lockheed flew over and landed on her shoulder. \"Coo?\" He asked, cocking his head to the side. \"Oh, Lockheed! I wet my bed overnight! B-B-but I haven't done that since I was 4!\" Kitty sobbed as she hugged him, Lockheed gently nuzzling her cheek with his head as he purred assuredly to her, trying to calm his owner down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Kitty, still sniffling slightly, began taking her bed apart and then dumped her soaked bedsheets and pajama bottoms into the laundry chute, hoping they would be dry by the time someone washed them. She quickly got dressed, put dry bedsheets on her mattress and went downstairs to breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Illyana, Colossus, Rachel, Logan, Ororo, Kurt, Rogue and Magneto finishing up their breakfasts. \"Hey, guys.\" she smiled as she grabbed a plate and started helping herself to some pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs and toast, pouring a glass of chocolate milk as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Kitty. How'd you sleep?\" Rogue smiled as she finished her eggs. \"Pretty good.\" Kitty said, not wanting to say anything about her bedwetting yet as she quickly stuffed a large forkful of pancakes into her mouth and began chewing loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten, you shouldn't eat like that. You could get indigestion.\" Storm warned her gently. Kitty nodded and slowed down her chewing considerably. No one spoke much after that as they finished their breakfasts and then left to get ready for their day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, Kitty was reading a <i>Star Wars</i> comic book in her room, Lockheed on her shoulder. After a few minutes, Kitty finished the comic and tossed it aside, stretching and yawning. \"Think I'll take a little nap, Lockheed.\" she told him with a grin. With that, Kitty, clad in a lime green t-shirt and blue jeans, stretched out on her bed and closed her eyes. Within minutes, she was sound asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few minutes had passed when Illyana came into the room. \"Hey Kitty, you see my-\" she stopped when she realized Kitty was snoozing on her bed. Illyana was about to leave their room when she noticed something. A small wet spot on both Kitty's jeans and blanket was growing bigger and bigger. Right away, the blonde sorceress realized what was going on with her best friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh my god! Kitty's peeing her pants! That explains the weird smell I caught off her when I went to breakfast this morning. She wet her bed last night and now she's doing it again. What should I do? Should I do something? Say something to her</i>?\" wondered Illyana as she kept watching Kitty use her pants as a toilet. Eventually, Kitty was done as a smile slowly spread across her face as she relaxed in her sleep again. Illyana decided to wait for Kitty to wake up before saying anything and so sat down on her bed with a book, reading as she waited for her best friend to wake and wondering what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a half hour later, Kitty woke up and stretched with a yawn. \"Oh! Hey, Illyana! When'd you come in here?\" she asked with a smile as she sat up. \"Half hour ago.\" Illyana replied slowly. \"Cool.\" Kitty said with a grin. But then, she stopped upon feeling the large wet spot on her pants and blanket. Slowly, her eyes filled with tears and she began to sniffle in dismay. Illyana, seeing this, quickly stood up and moved to her best friend's bed. \"Hey. Hey... it's okay, Kitty. It'll be okay.\" Illyana said as she put an arm around her friend's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it won't, Illyana! I'm just a big dumb baby! I've made wee-wee in my pants twice! Once last night and again now! Who's to say it wont' stop at just peeing? I'll probably starting making poopies in my pants soon too!!!!\" Kitty bawled as she buried her face into her hands. \"You're right. We don't know when it'll stop. But we can at least try and help you.\" Illyana said while hugging her bestie. Kitty sniffled as she returned the hug with a watery smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, Illyana. But what'll I do about my bedwetting in the meantime?\" Kitty asked. \"I think I've got an idea, but you may be unhappy with it at first.\" Illyana warned after a moment. \"I'll do it!\" Kitty said quickly. Illyana shrugged as she got up. \"Okay. But don't say I didn't warn ya.\" she replied as Kitty got up as well and, after changing her pants, followed Illyana out of the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, the duo had returned home and Illyana had finished helping Kitty into what she hoped would help her best friend's weak bladder and possibly also weakening bowel control. \"Illyana, are you sure about this?\" Kitty asked as she waddled out of the bedroom, wearing a thick diaper held up by tape. \"Kitty, diapers should help you in case your control over your bladder and stuff gets even weaker. Just try them for a few days and then we'll mention your problem if it's still present.\" Illyana said assuredly.  Kitty pouted but nodded sadly as she poked her big diaper. \"Where'd you even get diapers this big?\" Kitty asked out of bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're adult diapers, Kitty. If you want, I also bought some more childish ones in case you want a more 'stylish' diaper.\" Illyana explained with a slight smirk as she held said package up, causing Kitty to blush. \"You're enjoying this way too much.\" she remarked with an embarrassed smile. \"Kinda.\" Illyana agreed with a smile as she hugged her friend, Kitty's diaper crinkling loudly at the pressure on it. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, Kitty had a training session in the Danger Room with Storm. Though nervous about it due to her diaper, Kitty couldn't think of a good enough excuse to blow her friend and mother figure off. So, that evening found her tugging her uniform on over her thick diaper. It bulged her tights out a bit, but otherwise was thankfully not noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a deep breath, Kitty slowly walked into the Danger Room, waddling slightly.  Ororo was already there, waiting for her. \"Ah, Kitten. I was getting worried that you may not make it.\" She smiled. \"You kiddin', 'Roro? I'd never miss a session with you!\" Kitty giggled with a smile, making little movement as possible so not to crinkle her diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, their training began. Tonight, they were doing a simple obstacle course with lots of objects to dodge or counter. Kitty started to breathe easier as the session progressed with no urge to mess her diaper. And the course wasn't a big challenge either as she easily made her way through each obstacle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as they finished up, Kitty suddenly doubled over in agony as the lower part of her belly rumbled. \"<i>Oh god, no! Not now! I can't take a dump now! 'Roro'll see it! I don't want her to! Please, tummy! Please hold on-</i>!\" She pleaded mentally. Storm was farther ahead by now but Kitty knew she would likely turn and see Kitty behind and wonder what'd happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her pleas, Kitty couldn't hold back her bowels anymore. Whimpering silently, she squatted and pushed a massive load of hot, sticky and smelly poop into her diaper, tears cascading down her cheeks in dismay and humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten, what is-\" Storm began as she ran up, only for the stench from Kitty's poop to hit her. \"Goddess! What is that stench?!?!? Kitty... did you...\" she exclaimed in shock upon seeing Kitty's tears and expression. Kitty then began openly sobbing for the third time that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Ororo! I-I-I-I'm so embarrassed! I don't know why but I've peed myself twice today and I just made a massive poopy in my diaper! I'm so sorry! I'M JUST A BIG, DUMB POOPY BABY!\" Kitty wailed as she kept blubbering. Storm stared at her for a moment, and then slowly hugged the sobbing 14-year-old girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten, it is alright. Illyana told me of your second accident when you two came back and you went to change into your diaper. She figured it was safe to tell me.\" Ororo admitted. Kitty looked up with a hiccupping sob. \"R-Really?\" she sniffled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I will help you, Kitten. The others will too, I am sure, if we tell them. We must find the reason for your condition soon.\" Ororo smiled as they hugged again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, 'Roro.\" Kitty smiled. Then she felt her poop smoosh against her butt as she sat back. \"Um... 'Roro? Could you... change my diapee? I think I made a big poop in them.\" she giggled with a blush. Ororo chuckled as well and the duo went into the changing rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty blushed slightly as Ororo took the full diaper off and left Kitty's lower body naked for a moment as she grabbed the clean one Illyana had given her earlier in case Kitty had an accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Ororo had cleaned Kitty up and the diaper was snugly taped on. This one, to Kitty's embarrassment, was one of the childish ones Illyana'd bought. It was bright pink with hearts on the seat of it and a big one on the front. Storm was trying hard not to smile at Kitty's expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Illyana made you take this one, didn't she?\" Kitty guessed as she poked this one as well. \"Yes. She wanted you to wear at least that one before we work out if this is a form of stress or something else.\" Ororo admitted with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just sighed and rolled her eyes in amusement. The duo then went to have dinner. No one else noticed Kitty's diaper aside from Storm and Illyana, who barely managed to keep her giggling under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Kitty wet her heart diaper before bed and Illyana helped her into a regular white one, to Kitty's relief. \"Maybe you could rotate them? Y'know, wear a regular one for a few hours until you use it and then a childish one after that?\" Illyana suggested as they climbed into bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Kitty shrugged as she curled up with Lockheed snuggled at the base of her bed. With that, the two best friends and roommates went to sleep, Kitty secretly sucking her thumb for the first time since she was 7 years old.</span></div></div>",

Then, a nasty smell reached her nose. \"Uh oh.\" She said as she sat up, wincing at the squishing noise under her butt. Sure enough, when she threw back her covers, Kitty found a wet and very full diaper bulging. Despite the bulging load she had in it, Kitty had to admit it was a good thing Illyana had bought the diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good thing I wore this diaper last night. Otherwise my pajama pants would really yucky right now.</i>\" She thought to herself as she poked the diaper slightly. Slowly, she climbed out of her bed and waddled slightly over to Illyana, who was still snoring softly. \"Uh, Illyana... could you wake up please?\" she whispered to her best friend. Illyana mumbled something as she sat up, rubbing her eyes groggily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Then, she smelled the fumes from Kitty. \"Kitty, did you-?\" she began. \"Me made a poopy and wee-wee.\" Kitty said in a joking childish voice with a goofy smile. Illyana rolled her eyes but smirked slightly at the response. \"Okay. Come on you big baby.\" she smirked jokingly as she helped Kitty to her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllyana put down a large rubber mat on Kitty's mattress and Kitty laid on it. Illyana then slowly removed the full and wet diaper from her best friend and rubbed her butt, crotch and legs clean.  After a moment, she picked a diaper and brought it over to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of this one?\" She offered, showing it to Kitty. Kitty stared at it. It was bright white, with a big rainbow design on the back with a small raincloud beside the rainbow and a pink butterfly on the other side of it. \"Really, Illyana?\" Kitty pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you wanna have another accident in your pants...\" Illyana smirked. At that, Kitty huffed and reluctantly tugged the diaper on. \"Besides, it's only until you use it and then you'll get a regular one.\" Magik pointed out as Kitty taped it up. Kitty sighed and nodded. \"You're right.\" she smiled as they got dressed a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the duo were heading for breakfast. As they came in, they found only Storm, Wolverine, Phoenix, Colossus, Nightcrawler, Rogue and Magneto. The two girls looked at each other in bewilderment. \"Uh... where's Mirage and the other NMs?\" Illyana asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are already running through their first Danger Room session for today. We wanted to talk with you, Kitty.\" Magneto said gently. Kitty swallowed nervously as she eyed Ororo, who looked guilty for some reason. Kitty turned back to Erik. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" She asked. \"Storm told us about your... accident in the Danger Room last night, Kayta. We are concerned about you.\" Colossus admitted before Magneto could. Kitty blushed as red as a cherry tomato as she whirled to face Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ororo... how could you?!?!?! I-I trusted you with this and you told them when I wasn't ready?!?!?!\" She screamed in anger. \"Kitten... I did not mean to offend you. But you must admit they would've found out eventually.\" Ororo countered gently. Kitty just glared at her mother figure and friend in anger and fury. \"Ororo really didn't want to, Kitty. I read her mind as she told us. She feels terrible for this.\" Rachel confirmed gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you find out?\" Kitty asked. \"Last night Wolverine picked up your diaper crinkling even as you tried to stop it durin' dinner.\" Rogue explained as Logan nodded bluntly. \"We vanted to talk to you before bed last night, but Ororo convinced us to wait.\" Kurt added. Kitty's expression softened slightly, though she still looked ticked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So what're we gonna do?\" Kitty asked as she finally helped herself to some breakfast with Illyana. \"I have contacted Mr. Fantastic to examine you this afternoon.\" Magneto told her. Kitty looked confused at this so Magneto explained. \"As Moira MacTaggert is currently occupied with Muir Island's repairs, I thought it wise to not pressure her.\" He said. Kitty nodded and finished her breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, Kitty was in her room when Cannonball, Sunspot, Wolfsbane, Warlock, Magma, Mirage, Karma and Cypher came in. \"Hey guys. What's up?\" Kitty asked, looking up from her final paper due that term as summer was starting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magik told us about your... condition. She said since the other X-Men knew, it was only fair to let us know too.\" Dani explained. Kitty nodded, accepting this. \"So, do you guys have a problem with it?\" she asked. \"Nope. We don't have a problem with it.\" Sam smiled as the others all shook their heads as well. \"Self- Pryde's undergarments intriguing.\" Warlock remarked with interest as he eyed Kitty's diaper. Then, a nasty smell filled the air. \"Oh mah God!\" Sam yelped covering his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did that?\" Magma asked in equal alarm as she held her own nose in disgust. \"Who do you think, Amara?\" Countered Mirage, nodding to Kitty's now very lumpy and full diaper, causing the 14-year-old to blush in embarrassment as she looked and saw her diapee's current state.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I think you need a change.\" Sunspot remarked as he pinched his own nose while the others, excluding Warlock, did so. \"Sorry. I guess I shouldn't have had those bean burritos for lunch.\" Kitty blushed as she waddled into her bathroom to change her yucky and full diaper.</span></div></div>",

Storm gestured to her breakfast and then to a mirror.

A whole pitcher of orange juice was there to help wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty suddenly remembered that this was actually her second course of everything. White Queen had angered her so much that she'd felt compelled to eat her feelings. It certainly showed as in the mirror, she now sported a massive gut that strained her outfit and pushed against the table, a just as large butt and a fat face topped off with puffy chipmunk cheeks. But the most eye catching thing was the big fluffy diaper she now wore that looked and smelled like it had already been used more than once.

Of course, the entire X-Men outright objected such a forced notion, but it wasn't something that even the famed heroes could do a thing about, for it was the choice that Kitty's parents had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with sorrow in her heart, Kitty was left with little alternative but to say a saddened farewell to the people she fondly referred to as her \"second family\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Present Day ==<br>\r\n== Two Weeks Later ==<br>\r\n== England ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding just outside of the local airport, Kitty, dressed in an overcoat with a fashionable hat, holding her suitcase in both hands, as the stereotypical English rain downpour around her.

Aren't you such an adorable cherub?\" She chirped, taking note of the young Pryde's adorably petite physique, a subtle twinkle in her sapphire blue eyes. Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, Kitty took a substantially long moment or two, gazing over the entire physical appearance of the woman standing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn appearance, the blonde woman had this air of <i>\"Nobility\"</i> and <i>\"Elegancy\"</i> to her, especially with her all-white ensemble and flowing ivory cape with the fur collar around her shoulders. However, in contrast to the woman's choice of attire, there was a far more notable aspect about her:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight and overall size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what Kitty would guess, the woman had to at least weigh in at approximately the four-hundred pound mark, with nary a sign of dimpling or unsavory blemish in sight. The woman had these wealthy plump breasts, which pressed against her corset-like one-piece clothing, which was only surpassed by the woman's substantial yet matronly boulder of a belly. However, Kitty couldn't help but feel like something felt...<i>off</i>, regarding what she was wearing underneath such expensive clothing, but it was a mere thought for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...E-Excuse me? Are...A-Are you Miss Emma Frost? The headmistress of the, um...\" Kitty stammered, looking back at the brochure to properly ascertain the school's full name then continued, \"...The Academy of the Order of the Friars of Saint Francis of Wycombe? ...I-I'm sorry if I'm mispronouncing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> It is quite alright, my dear.\" Emma retorted, reassuring the younger woman of her shyness, to which she then performed a small curtsy and elaborated, \"...And to answer your question, I am indeed Emma Frost. Headmistress of Wycombe Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like a lioness circling it's prey, Emma Frost looked over Kitty  from nearly every angle with eyeing curiosity, to which she then asked, \"...And if I must wager a guess, you must be the lovely Katherine Pryde, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yes. Yes I am, Miss Frost. B-But...M-My friends call me \"Kitty Pryde\". If, um...I-If that's okay with you.\" She timidly answered, obviously feeling a little tense due to being examined in such a manner by a person she had no familiarity with. Of course, Emma Frost couldn't help but become quite amused with the young woman, to which she then reassured, \"Quite the adorable name, my dear. And please...You can call me \"Emma\", if it makes you feel more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...O-Okay.\" Kitty complied, and like a mother coddling her child, Emma Frost calmly and gently guided Kitty towards the limousine as she said, \"...Do not fret, my dear Kitty. I'm most certain you will be quite at home in Wycombe Academy. Now, what do you say we get out of the rain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I would like that.\" Kitty answered, being personally escorted by the rotund Emma Frost. However, she couldn't figure out what exactly was making all these <b>*rustling*</b> and <b>*crinkling*</b> noises, despite being in close proximity with said sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost allowed Kitty to enter the vehicle first, only to then enter inside herself, making sure her elegant ivory cape was not caught when the door was closed. And with that, the chauffeur proceeded to return to the driver's seat to escort his charges back to the illustrious Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Kitty couldn't believe how...extravagant, it was inside the limo.

Though, it was there that Kitty Pryde soon caught a gaze at the newest individual in proximity within the luxury vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from her appearance and vocal accent, Kitty could very easily tell that this person was undoubtedly Scottish, sporting a short mane of fiery red hair, as well as an equally heavyset physique, albeit not as vast as the headmistress, but enough to be distinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, instead of a lavish ensemble like Emma Frost, the Scottish redhead wore a one-piece schoolgirl-esque uniform, complete with a plaid skirt. Speaking of the lavishly dressed Emma Frost, she soon sat beside Kitty, just as the limousine began to move, to which the rotund blonde then quipped, \"Come now, Rahne. Surely, you haven't forgotten about the arrival of your new roommate already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roommate?\" Kitty questioned, initially flabbergasted at how she was going to have a roommate, only for the ivory-dressed woman to compensate, \"My sincerest apologies, Katherine! I should've told you sooner! Anywho, allow me to introduce you to your new roommate-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rahne Sinclair's me name! So...\" Rahne interjected, to which she then got really close to Kitty, whilst the sudden <b>*crinkling*</b> filled Kitty's hearing once more, as the feisty redhead then blurted, \"...Whit kinda d'you hae?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" She rebutted, becoming quite confused as to what exactly she was talking about. Meanwhile, Emma Frost couldn't help but chuckle some from Rahne's feisty curiosity, obviously finding amusement towards the Scot girl's child-like wonder. Of course, she soon stepped in and retorted, \"Again my apologies, Katherine. Though, to put it simply...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Emma Frost began to use her telepathic abilities to converse with Kitty, as she telepathically continued, \"...She is simply curious about your Mutant abilities is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reaction, Kitty was completely taken by surprise, quickly putting two and two together, which ultimately culminated in her gleefully yelping, \"You...Y-You're Mutants! You're just like me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> Indeed we are, Katherine.\" Emma replied, a plump gloved hand gesturing over towards Rahne, only for Kitty to bear witness to a surprising metamorphosis. In appearance, Rahne's body began to take on more lupine features, as reddish-brown fur began to grow and sprout from every part of her body, which gave her short fiery red hair to look more akin to an exaggerated wolven mane. Her teeth sharpened into a pair of lupine fangs, as her fingernails became a pair of claws on each hand, along with a short canine tail floofing out from behind, with her legs becoming digitgrade to cap it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Kitty couldn't help but be amazed by the sight before her, as Rahne mock howled at an imaginary moon to sell the look, to which Emma then coyly teased, \"Down, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever ye say, Teach!\" Rahne complied, just as swiftly reverting back to her human form, where it was soon Kitty Pryde's turn to speak, with only astonishment in her voice while she asked, \"This is amazing! But...I-I don't understand, Miss Frost. Are you like Professor Xavier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>*giggle*</b> ...In a way. I suppose you can say I am England's equivalent of Charles Xavier, my dear Katherine. Right down to being the proud owner and headmistress of an illustrious academy, no less. Now...\" She explained, laying the truth the bear before Kitty, to which she then presented a bountiful spread of cuisines before the brunette and politely asked, \"...Would you like something suitable to eat? I have a guess that the food provided to you on the plane wasn't as substantial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I guess it would be rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty chirped, grabbing a few steaming scones, taking a bite out of them one after the other. \"Mmm! These are pretty good!\" She chirped, her tastebuds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, whilst Kitty was busy stuffing her gullet, Emma Frost watched as the baked treats began to slowly work on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, <i>\"Hmm... She has begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become...\"acquainted\", with the new meat on your bones in due time, along with a surprise or three as well.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Emma Frost blocked her mind off from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who appeared as if she was in a gluttonous trance, scarfing down several handfuls of sweets at a near breakneck pace. Of course, such binging was bound to show itself on the young Pryde's physical form, as her stomach began to slowly but surely bloat and expand outwards, yet not enough to stick out a great deal to be conspicuous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Emma contemplated how this school year will be quite...<i>\"unique\"</i>.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wise men would say that <i>\"A lot can transpire in the span of a week\"</i>. Though, she certainly didn't expect THESE kinds of changes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of it good, while some of it was legitimately bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she first arrived at Wycombe Academy, the first thing she noticed right off the bat was how...<i>\"Substantially endowed\"</i> all the female students and some of the female staff were, along with unsubtle hints of what could be underneath their specifically designed attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't all bad. After all, she and Rahne quickly became fast friends, not just outside of class. Plus, Kitty soon found out that she was transferred into a school for Mutants, similar to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, but in England. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, much to her own personal shame, Kitty began to experience this bad case of bedwetting, always waking up with soaked bedsheets. At first, she tried to disguise this source of shame from her new best friend/roommate out of attempting to preserve her personal dignity. Of course, having the abilities of a wolf, Rahne was easily able to discover her bestie's wetting predicament. In fact, they made a deal regarding Kitty's \"issue\", as the young Pryde recalled her friend's words:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look, Kitty. I understand the shame of wetting the bed, so I'm not going to judge ye. However, if it starts getting bad, we're gaunnae hae to blether this to Headmistress Frost aboot yer...\"issue\". Okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the bedwetting wasn't the only change in her daily regiment she had undergone, as Kitty stood before her pee-stained bedsheets, now sporting a somewhat chubbier physique, complete with a small but developing potbelly, fuller breasts, plumper butt, and the subtle beginnings of a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there in her nightgown, with her panties dampened some in the front. Suffice to say, it felt rather embarrassing for her. Fortunately, her new best friend was there to console her, to which the redheaded Scottish Mutant then asked, \"Dae ye want to head to Miss Frost's office, lassie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Headmistress Emma Frost's Office ==<br>\r\n== 10 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, within the bowels of her personal office, adorned with numerous trophies and shelves full of works of literature, Emma Frost was looking over some of the student records, inspecting to see if their educational grades were up to snuff, a plump gloved finger tapping against the mahogany oaken surface of her lavish study. That is until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*<br>\r\n*Knock!*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a series of rattling knocks at her double doors, to which she promptly answered, \"You may enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with such permission granted, Rahne and Kitty soon entered their Headmistress's proverbial lair, with Rahne hauling in the rolled-up bedsheet from Kitty's bed slung over her shoulder. From there, the duo swiftly closed the doors behind them to allow some privacy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Emma Frost soon diverted her full attention upon the two roommates, keenly gazing upon them with intent, to which she chirped, \"Ah, Miss Pryde and Miss Sinclair! To what do I owe the pleasure from you two lovely ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Teach... We hae to blether to ye aboot something. It's important.\" Rahne retorted, her Scottish slang prevalent as ever. From there, she then unfurled the bedsheet before the heavyset headmistress, thus revealing the full truth to the leader of Wycombe Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see your point, Miss Sinclair. I take it that this is your bedsheet, Katherine?\" Emma calmly hypothesized, to which Kitty reluctantly and timidly nodded her head in confirmation, obviously quite embarrassed by her current predicament, meekly uttering, \"...Y...Y-Yes, Miss Frost. I...I-I-I don't know wh-what's going on w-with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing her newest student feeling so ashamed of herself, Emma calmly stood up from her wheeled chair, waddled over towards the embarrassed Kitty, to which the <b>*crinkling*</b> sounds filled the air once more. From there, she placed her plump gloved hands upon Kitty's shoulders, then quickly pulled her into a matronly embrace, akin to a mother coddling her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I am terribly sorry for this, my dear. You have my utmost sympathies.\" She caringly whispered, showing her sympathy towards the young girl. But then, as if it was preordained in her mindset, the bloated blonde, now with a reassuring smile across her lips, looked back at Kitty and said, \"...You know, I believe I may have a solution to your <i>predicament</i>, my dear. ...If you are willing to make a few necessary changes to your lifestyle, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that, Kitty swiftly looked back at the headmistress, a glimmer of hope in her eyes, to which she instinctively hugged Emma Frost, despite her arms not fully reaching around the woman's body, and chirped, \"Thankyouthankyouthankyou!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, if it will allow you to be more at ease, please follow me.\" The larger woman quipped, to which Kitty followed suit, unaware of what the headmistress had in mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== 5 Minutes Later... ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, after waiting out in her study, Rahne was soon re-greeted by the return of Emma Frost and Kitty Pryde. However, the Scottish redhead easily noticed what was newly different about her new bestie, as Kitty fidgeted a bit in her new puffy undergarments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...M-Miss Frost? Are...A-Are you sure about these...<i>things</i>? They're very bulky.\" She asked, noting with clear clarity at how thick and padded the diaper she now wore actually was, as she could easily feel how the padding positioned between her legs forcibly pushed her legs apart some, giving her a semi-noticeable waddling gait, as well as making her butt appearing to have doubled in size.</span></div></div>",

Indeed ye will, Kitty!\" Rahne quipped, obviously trying to reassure her bestie that wearing such bulky diapers wasn't all bad as she thinks it will be, to which she cheekily handed Kitty a more <i>fitting</i> Academy uniform. Of course, Kitty then reluctantly shrugged, as she then began to undress out of her nightgown in order to don her school attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...With all due respect, Miss Frost, but...A-Are these REALLY necessary? Something feels...<i>off</i>.\" Kitty asked, as she began to equip the one-piece uniform shirt onto her body, still feeling a bit uneasy considering what was transpiring. However, becoming rather sympathetic towards the younger brunette's apprehension of the whole situation, Emma let out a empathetic sigh, then inevitably confessed, \"<b>*sigh*</b> ...Well, I suppose it won't do harm to tell you the truth, my dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...What are you talking about?\" She questioned, becoming rather confused as to what exactly Emma was going on about, only to then feel the bloated blonde waddle over to her to do up the button flap on her onesie-like uniform shirt. From there, while she carefully and properly dressed Kitty, Emma Frost then calmly elaborated, \"Now, I'm not entirely sure how to properly put this into words, but...Katherine; This school...has a curse attached to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cursed? Come on, Miss Frost. There are no such thing as curses.\" Kitty scoffed, as she felt the larger woman button up the diaper flap on her onesie-esque shirt, thinking that the headmistress was pulling her leg. However, it was Rahne's turn to chime in as she chirped, \"I'm afraid it's naw wee ghost story laddies and lassies tell each other around the campfire. What dae ye think we're wearing under our uniforms?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what her best friend and roommate just told her, Kitty was struck with a surprising revelation, her noting the crinkly bulges around the waistlines of both the headmistress and her bestie, hearing the enciting <b>*rustle*</b> and <b>*crinkle*</b> noises from the motions made by both individuals chafing about. Finding the right words to say to them, Kitty eventually spoke up and questioned, \"...H-How long has it been like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Emma looked back towards the diapered Kitty Pryde, to which she promptly responded to her question via plainly answering...</span></div></div>",

Finally, she looked at Emma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So is that why we gotta wear-\" she began, nodding to her thick diaper. Emma and Rahne both nodded. \"I'm afraid so, Katherine. Ever since new students arrived, we have been plagued by bedwetting and messing ourselves, myself included.\" Emma confessed gently, nodding to her large diaper. Kitty didn't say anything as she poked her diaper through her onesie uniform. Then, she turned to her roommate, classmate and bestie. \"R-Rhane, was it this bad for you?\" She asked. Rahne smiled and nodded gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye. I was barely here for two weeks a'fore me bladder stared actin' up. In fact, I wet meself five times in classes a'fore I came ta Miss. Frost here for help. I've been in these nappies for a year now since I started attendin' this school.\" Rahne confessed, her diaper crinkling loudly. Kitty just looked at the duo, clearly still trying to figure things out. While she still didn't fully believe in curses, she did know this one was apparently all too real. \"W-will it remain after I leave here?\" She finally asked. Emma and Rahne both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am afraid so, Kitty. I thought when we leave for holidays and whatnot, it would fade away. But I was proven wrong after Christmas my first year here when the girls and teachers all revealed that they had wet and pooped themselves repeatedly, forcing them to keep their diapers on at all times, unless they managed to reach the loo or were already in it.\" Emma explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but curses can be broken, can't they? W-what if we learn how the curse came to be and if it can be destroyed?\" Kitty offered. But both Rahne and Emma shook their heads. \"I fear it would not work, Katherine. We have been trying for a year to figure out the curse and it's weaknesses, but have come up with nothing.\" Emma confessed gently. Kitty honestly felt like bawling her eyes out. She was just 13 and a half, she couldn't need diapers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Emma looked at the clock. \"And on that note, girls, I do believe it is time for breakfast. The cafeteria is making lots of good food and I cannot stand missing a meal.\" she smiled kindly, putting a hand on Kitty and Rahne's shoulders and steering them for the cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh goody. I'm so starved I could eat a horse!\" Rahne smiled eagerly. Kitty nodded in agreement, her potbelly gurgling in equal hunger. Though, secretly, Kitty was wondering about the curse and how worse it would get as she stayed at Wycombe.</span></div></div>",

I mean... I'm going to be turning fourteen. I shouldn't be needing to wear diapers. Why is this happening?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi! Earth to Kitty! C'mon lassie!\" Rahne chirped, quickly noticing how much her roommate was involuntarily spacing out, to which she responded by shapeshifting her hand into a lupine claw-like hand, using her now canine fingernails to emit an even louder finger snap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it was more than enough to easily snap the distracted Kitty Pryde back to terra firma, as the chubby diapered brunette instinctively blinked twice and thrice in initial confusion and stammered, \"Huh? Wha?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ye alright, Kitty? Ye were spacin' out on me.\" Rahne asked, showing obvious concern toward her bestie, placing a hand on the girl's shoulder. In response, with the audible <b>*crinkling*</b> noises emanating from her own bulky diaper filling her ears, Kitty blushed and ultimately confessed, \"...I-I'm sorry, Rahne. It's just that-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-You're naw used to what's gonna happen? <b>*sigh*</b> Aye, I ken whit yer sayin', lassie. If it helps, ye willnae be alone when ye hae to gang.\" She answered, giving off a rather reassuring posture towards her friend, which seemed to be quite effective in putting Kitty at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Thank you, Rahne.\" Kitty spoke, thanking her friend in the process, to which they wen on their merry way towards the Cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>== Wycombe Academy Cafeteria ==</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver at the Cafeteria, amongst the rabble and gossip of the other round pamper-wearing schoolgirls, one student sat by her lonesome, as if she was waiting for some friends of her's. In appearance, much like the headmistress herself, the teen girl sported a flowing mane of straight golden blonde hair, with shimmering blue eyes. However, much like the entire student body and school staff, she too wasn't spared from sporting a more chubbier physique and equally padded undergarments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, she was in the midst of devouring a platter full of jelly-filled sprinkled donuts for breakfast, only to then hear an all too familiar voice, \"Oi! Illy! Yoo-Hoo!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few tables across from her, she easily became aware of a certain Scottish Mutant's greeting, to which she responded by turning her head briefly as if to non-verbally say, <i>\"Get over here.\"</i>, to which they complied with such an answer, waddling their way over to where she was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, they sat before the heavyset blonde, carrying their own assortment of sweets and edibles upon two trays for each of them. Of course, during her first week here at Wycombe, Rahne first introduced Kitty to one of her other friends, Illyana Rasputin. However, Kitty soon found out that Illyana was actually the younger sister of one of her friends back at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters; Peter Rasputin, also known as \"Colossus\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, upon hearing of this, Illyana was relieved to hear that her brother was doing quite well over in America, which garnered a great deal of respect towards the young Pryde. Obviously, Illyana gave off a warming smile towards Kitty, which showed how close they've became as friends, only to then resume her binge assault on the small hill of cuisines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an attempt to strike up a friendly conversation with her, Kitty spoke towards Illyana, taking a bite out of some blueberry pancakes as well, and said, \"So, Illyana...How's it going with your training? Learned any new skills?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Not much, Kitty. Though, I did learn how to deflect energy blasts with my sword...\" She replied, bearing a thick Russian accent, which made Kitty feel a little nostalgic in regards to Colossus. After all, despite the man's Mutant abilities of Super Strength and being to turn his skin into a flexibly hard steel-like tissue, he was a rather \"Gentle Giant\" as it were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus, Kitty was actually surprised when she first saw Illyana's Mutant ability to harness and use magic, thus garnering her the now-famous nickname \"Magik\", with the word having a \"K\" instead of a \"C\" in it. Overall, much like her nickname's namesake, Kitty became rather curious with Illyana's more supernatural abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the trio conversed for about half an hour, including the part where Kitty was now in diapers just like them, to which Illyana offered her sincerest sympathies.

The three girls headed to the school's large gym where Betsy was waiting for them. Like most of the staff and girls, Miss. Braddock was rather obese, weighing in around 350 pounds, though she still had somewhat of a hourglass figure. She had purple hair and, like most of the staff, wore a thick diaper under her uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class. Today I've decided we would go for a mile jog around campus. Don't worry, I won't be keeping time so if you need to stop, you may and as long as you at least run most of the mile, you'll get your points.\" Betsy smiled as she grabbed her clipboard and led the girls out. Once they'd warmed up, Psylocke blew her whistle to start the mile. At first, Kitty did surprisingly well, despite her slightly cumbersome waddling run due to her new diaper. However, by the half mile mark, she was wheezing and panting heavily, sweat rolling down her face. By the time the mile was finished, Kitty was among only three girls to have made it all the way. The other two being Rahne and Illyana. The second they finished, the trio flopped onto the ground, gasping, panting and moaning in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tha'... was... bloody... hell!\" Rahne gulped, her tongue lolling out like a wolf as she panted heavily. \"I... agree. I... wish... Miss. Braddock would... let me... just teleport with... my... portals.\" Illyana groaned, laying on her back. \"Man... I probably... shouldn't've eaten... those last... 10 blueberry... pancakes. My belly's killing me.\" Kitty moaned in agreement. Psylocke waddled over with a smile. \"Well done, lassies. You completed the mile in good time.\" She said. Then she turned to the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies. Tomorrow we'll take an off day as most of you did manage to do most of the mile today. Let's head back in and get ready for your next class!\" She called. Huffing, puffing and groaning, the girls all started waddling to the locker room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it lunchtime yet?\" Rahne asked hopefully. Kitty looked at her watch. \"Nope. It's only 7:50, Rahne.\" Kitty confessed with a smile as Illyana laughed as they waddled after their classmates. \"Blast. I was hopin' ta sink me teeth into a juicy hamburger with cheese, pickles, ketchup, mustard, onion and bacon!\" Rahne groaned. Both Kitty and Illyana moaned in delight at the thought, their bellies rumbling in equal delight. \"Now you've done it, Rahne. How're we gonna focus on our next few lessons while we're waitin' for lunch?\" Kitty playfully teased her bestie as they changed into their uniforms, having reached the locker room. \"Sorry Kitty.

Nicknamed \"Domino\" due to her black and white hair and white face with a black spot over one eye, she was a fairly cool teacher in Kitty's eyes. Similar to Emma and Psylocke, Domino was obese and diaper clad. Unlike most of the teachers and students, she wore only a t-shirt and her thick diapers in class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Rahne and Illyana all found their seats at the front of the class and Domino waited until the other girls were ready before beginning her lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning girls. Today we'll be covering basic geometry and algebra. Don't worry if you don't get it, I'll be happy to help you.\" she smiled kindly as she wrote a few problems on the board. The hour passed fairly quickly, with Kitty and the girls working on the problems Domino had written down for them. Finally, the bell rang and the girls got ready for their next class. \"Okay, remember girls, there'll be a quiz in two weeks so study hard!\" Domino called as they left with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty waddled with Illyana and Rahne to her next class, she let out a giant fart. \"Och! Kitty! That reeks!\" Rahne protested playfully, shoving her bestie's shoulder. Kitty blushed as she then froze, a look of pain on her face. \"Kitty? Are you alright?\" Illyana asked with concern. Kitty bent over, clutching her stomach as she squatted and started straining and grunting. A second later, with a very loud *POOOOOOOTTTTTTTTT!!!!* she pushed a large, hot, sticky and smelly load of poop into her diaper. After she finished, Kitty stood up and, upon noticing several girls looking at her aside from her besties, she went deep red. Without a word, she turned and raced away, tears of humiliation pouring down her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't stop running until she reached her and Rahne's dorm room and, not even bothering with her full diaper, flopped face first onto her bed and started bawling her eyes out with loud sobs. After a few minutes, there was a knock on the door. \"Katherine, may I come in?\" Emma Frost's voice asked gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty sniffled and sat up, whining as she felt her poop squish against her plumper butt. \"C-Come *hic* in, Miss. Frost.\" she hiccupped sadly. Emma slowly waddled inside and smiled gently as she saw Kitty's bulging, poopy diaper. \"W-what's wrong?\" Kitty asked. Emma smiled as she sat down next to Kitty. \"Miss. Sinclair and Miss. Rasputin just told me what happened on your way to your next class. Are you alright?\" she explained with concern. Kitty hiccupped again before shaking her head in dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no. I'm s-so e-embarrassed! I-I haven't pooped my pants since I was three! And now I j-just took a major dump in- in front of e-everyone!\" Kitty sobbed, burying her face in her hands as she kept crying. Emma gently rubbed Kitty's back reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitten. Everybody here has had a similar accident in or before a class since this curse began. I actually anticipated you would poop your diaper before or during lunch today.\" She confessed. Kitty looked at her, tears still rolling down her chubby face. \"R-really?\" she asked with one more hiccup. Emma nodded and gently hugged Kitty like a mother would a daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be alright, Kitty. According to Miss. Rasputin, everybody was only staring out of sympathy. Not amusement or anger at you.\" She revealed. Kitty smiled despite her teary eyes. It cheered her up that her friends weren't laughing at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why don't you change your nappy and take a nap? Tonight, I would like to have you eat with me in my private quarters.\" Emma smiled. \"Okay.\" Kitty sniffled as she got up and took her full diaper off and started cleaning up. \"I will tell your next few teachers that you wanted to lay down after your accident. They will understand since, like I said, this has happened before.\" Emma said reassuringly as she waddled out. \"Thanks, Miss. Frost.\" Kitty said as she taped her new diapee on and got dressed again. She then sunk onto her bed and decided on following Emma's advice about taking a nap before dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, Rahne and Illyana came in to check on Kitty as she woke up. Rahne's diaper was bulging and smelly while Illyana's was soaking wet and bulging with poop as well. \"'Ow're ya doin' Kitty?\" Rahne asked her bestie. Kitty smiled at her friend's concern. \"I'm doing much better. Thanks.\" she smiled. \"Miss. Frost told us you were having dinner with her tonight so we should make sure you don't eat too much. She said she's having the chiefs make a really big dinner a'fore the two o' ya.\" Rahne added with a smile. Kitty grinned as she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how was lunch?\" she asked, having slept through it. \"It was good. Turns out Rahne's prediction about it being hamburgers was right. She pretty much licked her tray clean and you can smell the result in her diaper!\" Illyana joked with a smile. Rahne smirked and stuck her tongue out. \"Well, at least I didn't flood me nappy with pee like you did after a-drinkin' four cans of lemonade and soda!\" she retorted. Illyana blushed slightly. \"Yeah, that might not have been a good idea.\" she agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just giggled at her two besties playful jeering of each other. \"When did Miss. Frost say I should head down for dinner?\" Kitty asked after a moment as her two besties started getting changed into cleaner diapers. \"She said ye could drop in at anytime, lass.\" Rahne smiled as she finished putting a clean diaper on. Kitty nodded and, upon looking at her alarm clock, saw it was 5:56 P.M. \"Guess I should probably go now.\" she smiled nervously as she stood up. Rahne and Illyana both smiled assuredly to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinna fast yerself, Kitty. We've both had dinner with teach a'fore an' it's actually very nice.\" Rahne said as she hugged Kitty, their diapers crinkling loudly as they were pressed together.

Kitty nervously sat down across from Emma, her face stating that she was clearly nervous. Emma just gently patted Kitty's hand with hers. \"It is alright, Katherine. I am not going to bite your head off. I have dined with students before.\" she pointed out. Kitty blushed and nodded sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry, Miss. Frost. I'm just a little jittery.\" Kitty apologized. \"Perfectly understandable, Kitty. Now, I hope you enjoy our dinner tonight.\" Emma smiled as the chiefs came out with several trays of food. Hamburgers, fried chicken, steak and lobster. As well as desserts such as cake, pie, doughnuts, eclairs and all kinds of yummy treats. Kitty was so hungry, she feared she was going to start drooling over the food. Emma giggled slightly at Kitty's reaction, causing the brunette to blush deeply again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's eat!\" Emma smiled as she grabbed a large plate and started piling food onto it. Kitty quickly did the same. Once she had loaded her plate to overflowing, she used her knife and fork to cut a piece of chicken. However, to her surprise, Emma was eating a drumstick with her hands, loudly tearing chunks of meat off the bone. Upon noticing Kitty's surprise, Miss. Frost swallowed and belched loudly before smiling kindly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not hold you against eating like you normally do, Kitty. You must be hungry.\" Emma smiled sweetly. Kitty thought for a moment and then, dropping her fork and knife, grabbed her own drumstick and began tearing equally big chunks off it, sauce and grease smearing her face as she did. After that, she grabbed a large scone and crammed it into her mouth, chewing loudly as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it taste so far?\" Emma smiled. Kitty swallowed loudly before answering. \"This has gotta be the best meal I've ever had!\" She smiled truthfully. Unknown to the young girl, her belly was now beginning to expand more, slowly forming into a large potbelly. \"I am glad to hear it, Kitty. Now, let's eat it all before it gets cold.\" Emma smiled as she went back to stuffing her mouth with scones, burgers and other foods. Kitty nodded and quickly followed suit, cramming 3 cheeseburgers, four doughnuts and 6 scones into her mouth at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo didn't have speak anymore as they scarfed down the mountain of food like crazy. Manners were tossed out the window as they chugged, chomped, belched, hiccupped, slurped and licked their way ahead , slowly shrinking the feast down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the entire table was littered with empty plates, pie tins, pitchers and glasses. \"Well *BBBURRRRPPPP* that was a very fine meal.\" Emma smiled with a large burp as she rubbed her enormous tummy, which gurgled and sloshed happily. \"And how was your meal, Kitty?\" she asked the equally stuffed and happy 13 and a half year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP* Definitely... really yummy... Emma...\" Kitty panted after letting out an even bigger burp than Emma just had. She gently poked her now genuine gut as it gurgled in delight at being so full. \"Do you feel better?\" Emma asked Kitty as, huffing and puffing, the duo managed to stand up, sweating slightly as they did. \"Yeah I do.\" Kitty grinned.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo then slowly waddled to the door of Emma's office. \" You should probably get back to your dorm, Kitty. It's nearly curfew and I doubt you want to be in detention on your second week here.\" Emma smiled. \"Thanks *Buuuurrrraaaappp* again for the *hic* meal, Miss. Frost. It really was awesome!\" Kitty smiled with another loud burp, this time with a hiccup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *urp* glad you *hic* enjoyed *burp* yourself Kitty *hiccup*. Now, head off to your dorm please.\" Emma smiled back, giving Kitty a fleeting hug before gently pushing Kitty towards the hallway. Kitty smiled, gave a wave, and waddled back to her dorm, burping loudly most of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRahne and Illyana were both waiting up for Kitty when she finally came in. \"Well, how'd it go, Kitty?\" Rahne asked kindly. \"It went really *uuuurrrrrpppp* well.\" Kitty smiled, unleashing another rumbling burp. \"We can see that.\" Illyana smirked, playfully poking her friend's tummy, causing poor Kitty to fart loudly again. \"Och! Seriously, Kitty. I think ya need ta see the nurse 'bout yon stinky booty!\" Rahne giggled teasingly. \"Maybe I should've passed on the baked bean burritos.\" Kitty agreed sheepishly, rubbing her belly as it gurgled and rumbled, happy to be full of such good food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio then talked for awhile before Illyana went to her dorm for the night. Rahne and Kitty got into their nightgowns, crawled into bed, bade each other goodnight and were soon sleeping soundly, Kitty often burping loudly in her sleep as she dreamed about food all night long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

A plate piled high with scones, a tray of doughnuts, a platter of pies, a giant platter of cinnamon rolls, a large chocolate cake, a tray of cupcakes and other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... w-what is this, Miss. Frost?\" Kitty asked nervously as she eyed the banquet. Emma smiled as she sat down across from Kitty. \"This, my young lady, is a welcome present. I figured that that airplane food wouldn't be substantial. Would you like a bite?\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess it would be pretty rude to refuse. Sure, I'll bite!\" Kitty smiled, grabbing a few steaming scones. Upon tasting the first one, she started inhaling one after the other. \"Mmm! These're pretty good!\" Kitty chirped, her taste buds soaking in the delectable taste of the scones. Once she had licked the plate clean, she grabbed two chocolate glazed doughnuts and, ignoring Miss. Frost, shoved both into her mouth at once. With a rather loud gulp, she swallowed them almost whole before grabbing six more. Just as she started to inhale them, she noticed Emma watching with a smile. At this, Kitty blushed red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um... I-I'm sorry, Miss. Frost. D-Do you w-want some?\" She asked sheepishly. Emma chuckled and shook her head. \"It is alright, Kitty. I already had lunch and I'm quite sure you can handle this banquet on your own.\" She smiled kindly. \"Okay.\" Kitty shrugged as she then stuffed the six doughnuts into her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kitty, however, Emma Frost watched as the banquet started working on Kitty's systems, mentally noting to herself, \"Hmmm. She's begun to eat them. Excellent. And don't worry, my dear. I'm sure you'll become... 'acquainted' with the new weight on your bones in time. Along with a surprise or three as well.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, Emma had blocked her thoughts from having her agenda revealed to Kitty Pryde, who now seemed to be in a gluttonous trance, loudly scarfing down giant handfuls of sweets at a surprising pace. Of course, such binging was likely going to reveal itself on the young Pryde's physical form as her belly started to bloat and expand outward, not enough to stick out to be conspicuous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Emma anticipated this school year to be... \"interesting\". </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty just calmly eyed the laughing Emma. Unknown to her or the others, Emma had altered Kitty's mind overnight to make it seem like she'd always been big, fat and diaper dependent since infancy. \"I don't know why you're laughing, Frost. You know I've always been like this since I was in preschool.\" Kitty told the laughing Emma, completely unphased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then bolted down her second enormous helping of eggs, pancakes, waffles, french toast, sausage and the pitcher of orange juice. She burped loudly and then headed for her room, her diaper sagging considerably. Emma wasn't chuckling for long however. The second the plumper Sprite had left the dining room, the other X-Men (Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Colossus and Storm) all turned on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you do to her, Frost?\" Logan snarled, his claws inches from Emma's pale face as he pinned her to the wall with the other hand on her shoulder. \"I merely made her what she is: A big, fat baby. Miss. Pryde is now compelled to eat her feelings and use diapers until I lift it from her.\" Emma smirked, despite the clear life/death situation she was currently in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will it last?\" Storm demanded, her eyes flashing warningly. Usually she was calm and polite, but she did have a temper that, when unleashed, was alarming. Emma seemed to notice this as her smirk finally faltered slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least a week.\" She admitted. \"Then, since you see Katya as an infant, we believe it is only right you be responsible for her.\" Colossus said with a glare. \"What do you mean, boy?\" Emma asked with a small snarl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He means you're gonna be like the kid's wet nurse. Yer gonna change her an' feed her for the week.\" Logan explained with a slight smirk at the look on Emma's face. Emma considered her options and discovered there weren't any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she tried to fight, the others would easily subdue her as she still hadn't recovered from her and the Hellfire Club's recent battle with the team at the mansion a week ago and if she tried to run, they'd easily capture her. Her only option was to serve as Kitty's nanny for the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" Emma spat reluctantly as Wolverine freed her. \"We knew you'd see it our way, Frost.\" Cyclops said with a smirk at her glare of resignation. \"You may start by helping Kitty with her diaper.\" Storm ordered with a barely indifferent expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma stomped upstairs to Kitty's room in annoyance. The 13 and a half year old girl was on her bed, playing with her belly fat by poking her finger in it with a smile, her fluffy diaper bulging with Kitty's recent bowel movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty noticed Emma standing in the doorway and frowned slightly. \"What do you want, Frost?\" she practically spat as she heaved her plump body up. The White Queen growled quietly and forced a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For at least this week, I am to serve as your nanny of sorts. I will change your nappies and give you anything you wish to eat.\" Emma explained with a strained smile. Kitty thought about this for a moment and then smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. First, you can get me a big plate of bean burritos.\" Kitty smiled. Emma looked at her in shock. \"But it's only,\" she glanced at Kitty's alarm clock, \"9 in the morning. Surely you would prefer breakfast foods like doughnuts or cinnamon rolls?\"  Emma offered. Kitty simply smiled and shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Bean burritos is what my big tummy's cravin' right now.\" She said firmly, her belly rumbling hungerly. White Queen sighed in defeat and went downstairs. After a while, she came upstairs with the large plate of burritos. Kitty smiled and leaned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, feed me.\" she ordered. Emma snarled but, upon seeing a glaring Colossus behind her in the hallway, reluctantly sat down  by Kitty's bedside and began putting each burrito into the 13 and a half year old's eager mouth. Kitty only chewed each one once or twice before swallowing them. After a time, the plate was empty and Kitty was rubbing her tummy in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma sighed and stood up. \"<i>At least this wasn't so tedious. Maybe now that brat will shut up until lunch.</i>\" she thought to herself as she started for the door, only to hear a fart and a putrid stench hit her nose. \"Miss. Frost... I made another stinky!\" Kitty called in a mimicking baby voice. Emma's eye twitched and her lip trembled in dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly she led Kitty over to her desk and laid her on it. Holding her breath, Emma slowly un-taped Kitty's diaper and nearly fainted from the massive stench from it. Kitty giggled as Emma tossed the very full diaper into the trash can beside her before starting to clean Kitty's poop covered butt and legs. \"That tickles, Frost.\" She giggled as she felt the wet cloth rubbing her large butt and meaty legs clean.  Finally, Emma had taped Kitty into a fresh big, fluffy diaper and Kitty was on her bed, reading a comic book. \"Is that all for now?\" Emma asked through very gritted teeth. \"Yeah, you're good, Frost. I'll call if I make another poopy or wee-wee.\" Kitty smiled as she went back to her comic book. </span></div></div>",

The girl seemed to be on her own as there weren't any adults with her. \"Excuse me, little girl? Who're you?\" she asked politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the 13 and a half year old's voice, the girl turned. \"My name's Claire. I'm six years old.\" she said with a smile. \"Where's your mommy and daddy?\" Kitty asked. \"Mommy's working in the kitchen and Daddy's overseas on a business trip.\" Claire replied. She then eyed Kitty's diaper. \"Why're you in a diaper like me?\" she asked, causing Emma to smirk to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been like this since I was younger than you.\" Kitty replied, still believing these altered memories of Emma's. Then, Kitty farted quietly and pushed a normal sized load of poop into her diaper. Claire smirked at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can make a bigger poopy in my diaper.\" she smiled. Kitty frowned at that. \"I don't think so, kid. I poop a lot bigger than this so I really don't think you can.\" Kitty smirked. Claire frowned now. \"Uh huh. Mommy says I'm the biggest pooper she knows!\" she snapped. \"Maybe in your kindergarten class, kiddo. But not against us big kids.\" Kitty retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma, who still been smirking at Claire's question, started to frown as she read Kitty's mind, realizing what was going to happen next.  \"<i>Don't you dare, Katherine! No! Don't you dare! As your forced nanny, I am firmly forbidding you to-</i>\" Was all Emma managed to get out to Kitty before Kitty did exactly what Emma had tried to prevent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, little girl. You wanna prove it, then let's have a pooping contest.\" Kitty decided as she stood up and stood in front of Claire. Thankfully, most of the crowd who'd been watching Kitty had left after she'd finished her meal so the buffet was mainly empty now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty smirked at Claire and squatted down into a sitting position. After doing so, she began grunting and straining hard, her face reddening slightly at the strain. After a few seconds, she felt something coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!! !* A bigger load of poop entered her diaper. Kitty smirked at Claire, who merely smirked and squatted down now herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRR RCCCCCCCCCCHHHH!!!* A bigger load of poop entered Claire's diapee, bulging it out at the bottom. Kitty frowned in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top that, you big bully!\" Claire smirked. \"Oh, it's on now!\" Kitty snarled as she squatted deeper this time, her diaper bulging slightly. With a bigger fart, a much larger load entered her diaper, causing her to smirk in delight while Claire frowned. \"Good thing I ate all those spicy foods during lunch.\" Kitty smirked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, Kitty and Claire farting and pooping their diapers, each fart and poop bigger than the last one, their diapers bulging and sagging more and more. Emma just groaned and bowed her head in dismay at Kitty's humiliating performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!*&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTT!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two girls, their diapers full to bursting, ended their pooping competition. To Kitty's dismay, Claire had won the contest. \"Told ya I'm a bigger pooper than you.\" She giggled as she went over to her mother, who was ready to head home. Kitty just stared after the girl in absolute dismay and rage. \"Katherine, you-\" Emma began, only for Kitty to cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S NOT FAIR! I'M SIX AND A HALF YEARS OLDER THAN HER! I SHOULDA BEEN THE BIGGER POOPER! IT'S NOT FAIR! NOT FAIR! NOT FAIR! NOT FAIR!\" Kitty screamed as she stomped her feet and began screaming at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may be the older girl, but right now you are acting like an insufferable brat like her!\" Emma scolded, raising her own voice in fury. Kitty just glared at her reluctant nanny in anger and hatred. Then, she grabbed a piece of cake and threw it at Emma's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLAT!* The huge slice hit Emma in the face and then plopped onto the ground! \"Nyah! I think I've made my point, you big bully!\" Kitty huffed with a smile as she grabbed another slice and stuffed it into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, c'mon Frost! Time for you to change my diapee!\" she ordered. The frosting covered Frost snarled as she stormed after Kitty into the ladies room, Kitty had already got the changing table ready and was laying on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You will pay for this, you insufferable brat. Tonight, you will feel very ravenous at midnight and eat all the food in the kitchen as your snack. You will also become hungrier than you are now for the remainder of this week.</i>\" Emma snarled telepathically since Kitty was still pouting over her loss to defend herself from this newest command. </span></div></div>",

I gave her some medicine and changed her.\" Storm smiled in assurance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Emma came in and noticed the mess caused by Kitty's pig out. \"Oh my. What happened here?\" she asked in mock surprise. \"You tell us, Frost. You're the one who made the kid hog out.\" Logan snarled, getting into Emma's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, Wolverine?\" Emma demanded as she kept a weary eye on his claws, inches from her throat. \"Knock it off, Frost. We know your handiwork. You caused Kitty's hunger to increase and made her eat herself sick last night.\" Scott snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She deserved it, Cyclops. That brat humiliated me at the buffet yesterday, first by eating like a messy infant, then by getting into a vulgar pooping contest with a little girl and pitching a temper tantrum when she lost!\" Emma snarled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be, White Queen, but you are to act as her nanny until the end of the week when your hold on her concludes. I believe this calls for us to worsen your punishment.\" Storm replied in fury. Emma stared at the angry mutants in front of her. She could try to use her mental powers on them, but she knew they would come for her after recovering and make her continue her punishment anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" She demanded. \"For the rest of this week, you will also wear and use diapers in addition to being Kitty's nanny. You will not change yours until she is changed or if she allows it. You will also serve as she personal feeder if she is hungry and/or wishes to eat in her bed.\" Ororo ordered as Emma frowned. \"And you'll do what 'Roro says, Frost, or there'll be trouble.\" Logan smirked as he released Emma.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quiet snarl, White Queen went to her room and changed into a thick fluffy diaper of her own. She then waited for the X-Men to tell her when Kitty woke up while fuming over her newest humiliation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kitty was awake and sitting up in bed, feeling pretty hungry despite her massive tummy ache that morning. When Storm came to see her, she found Kitty talking with Colossus' little sister Illyana, who was visiting them for the time being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"&lt;Why are you in diapers, Katya?&gt;\" Illyana asked in her native Russian. \"&lt;'I've always been like this, Illyana. I don't know why it's so new to you guys.&gt;\" Kitty replied, having learned a great deal of said language from Colossus. The six year old frowned thoughtfully but didn't say anything. \"Excuse me, Illyana. I would like to talk with Kitty for a moment.\" Storm smiled at the little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllyana nodded and left to find Peter and ask him why Kitty was fatter and in diapers since it was clear to the young child that Kitty wasn't aware anything was off. \"What's up, 'Roro?\" smiled Sprite as she sat up straighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Emma came waddling up to Kitty's room holding a massive tray of chili burgers and chili cheese fries for Kitty. \"Here you go, Pryde.\" She spat as she placed the tray on Kitty's lap. \"Thanks, Frost. Wait here and you can take the tray down.\" Kitty smiled as she began loudly and sloppily scarfing down her meal at top speed, to Emma's disbelief as she watched the younger female eat like a pig again.</span></div></div>",

Kitty quickly got dressed into her blue costume with the eye mask while Wolverine got dressed in his shirtless orange-yellow and brown outfit and Rogue dressed in her green and black costume. Once done they headed out to save the Councilman. In Kingston's office, two of the Morlocks were standing gaurd a couple of feet away from the Councilman, when suddenly Wolverine burst through the wall, sending the two Morlocks flying but they quickly recovered Wolverine quickly attacked the largest of the two Morlocks cutting him cross the face while Rogue flew through the hole in the wall and attacked the other Morlock, knocking him down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty get the Councilman \"ordered Rogue. Kitty nodded and headed for the Councilman, slowly at first but, upon not seeing the third Morlock, Kitty sprinted over to the young man, who was wearing a black suit. But before Kitty could reach him a female Merlock stepped out of the shadows she had black hair and scars running across her face. Kitty was about to attack her when suddenly the Morlock's blue eyes turned in to hypnotism-like swirls. Kitty felt her mind became foggy. Then she started to hear a voice inside her head while she started swaying side to side, her eyes becoming colorful swirls as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to Scar. You will do whatever I say \"said Scar inside Kitty's head. Kitty could feel bits of her mind fall away from her. Suddenly the connection was broken by Rogue kicking Scar in the head, knocking her a few feet away. She quickly got up, was grabbed by the two other Morlocks and teleport away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok?\" asked Rogue, helping Kitty up <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine \"said Kitty shaking her head. It still felt a little funny but Shadowcat decided to keep that to herself. They quickly went to Wolverine and made their way over to the Councilman, who was hiding behind a desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, councilman?\"asked Rogue helping the man up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you so much for saving me \"said the Councilman as they escorted him out of the building and into the hands of the medics. Later that night Kitty was lying in bed and her stomach suddenly rumbled. She thought it was strange since she was never hungry at this time but quickly gave into her rumbling stomach and headed down stairs making herself three peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and a couple of slices of leftover pizza. After a few minutes, she left the table, feeling rather bloated and happy, letting out a rather deep burp as she did. </span></div></div>",

She removed the covers to see a huge pee stain on her orange PJ bottoms and a large wet patch in the middle of the sheets. Figuring out what had happened, she blushed, clearly embarrassed. \"Oh my god! Well... it's a one time thing.\" said Kitty quickly grabbing a pair of clean clothes and jumping into a shower. Once she cleaned herself up, she quickly got dressed, grabbed her urine soaked PJ bottoms and removed the sheet from her bed. She made her way to an old closet at no one used much anymore and shoved them inside. She knew she should probably just put them in the washing machine but she didn't want the others to know while she was doing this. Kitty was unware that her belly was a little rounder than usual as she made her way to the kitchen. She saw Rogue Phoenix and Wolverine each having breakfast. \"Morning \"said Kitty walking over to the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning. Now hurry up and make your breakfast.\" said Phoenix as she eat a a slice of toast. Wolverine just grunted in response and Rogue was busy making a bowl of cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok \" said Kitty as she went around making herself breakfast. She ended up making herself a whole stack of pancakes covered in maple syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to eat all that. It's quite a lot \"said Rogue, suprised by the amount of pancakes Kitty was going to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I'm just really hungry this morning.\" said Kitty as she kept eating the pancakes, manging to finsh all of them while having maple syrup covering her face when suddenly the TV came on saying a bank robbery was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You know the deal suit up.\" ordered Wolverine. Everyone got up, Kitty having a little difficulty due to her being bloated and got ready with the others after wiping the maple syrup off her face, licking the parts her tongue could reach off as well. </span></div></div>",

Here's the plan: Kitty, you go through the wall and get the hostages while we get the robbers.\" Ordered Wolverine. Kitty nodded and made her way to the back of the bank and walked through the wall. As she did so Kitty felt something grow very heavy in her pants and an awful smell. As she looked at the big bulge in the back of her suit, Kitty realised that she had pooped herself. She was slightly embarrassed, but was brought out of thoughts by gunfire and quickly went to the hostages. \"Quickly, come with me \"said Kitty. The hostages scrunched up their faces at the smell, but did as they were told and Kitty quickly got them out of the building and to the safety of the police. After a couple of minutes, the rest of the group came back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did getting the hostages go?\"asked Phoenix, but before Kitty could answer, she was interrupted. \"And what's that smell?\" asked Rachel looking around, trying to find the source of the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I farted.\" lied Kitty, not wanting them to know. \"But yeah it went fine.\" she said with a shrug, not noticing that Rogue was giving her a \"I don't believe you look\". Later that afternoon,Kitty was changing out of her outfit, desperately wanting to get rid of her poopy outfit, she was suddenly suprised by Rogue's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So were ya plannin' on tellin' us ya pooped your pants or...\" said Rogue, making Kitty blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it's a one time okay? So don't tell anyone.\" begged Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine but to make sure it doesn't happen again, Ah'm puttin' ya in diapers.\" said Rogue with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!? No!\" shouted Kitty, refusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't than Ah'll tell the others.\" said Rogue. Kitty nodded her head, not wanting the others to know and so she followed Rogue to the supermarket and Rogue grabbed a pack of thick, white Pampers diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're gonna make me wear them, can you at least get the one with flower patterns on them?\" asked Kitty with an annoyed look. Rogue just shrugged, grabbed the flower ones and paid for them. When they got home, Rogue helped sneak the diapers up to Illyana and Kitty's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do ya need help putting them on?\" asked Rogue with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" said Kitty, slamming the door on Rogue's face and quickly got changed into the first diaper. She had to admit it was pretty comfortable and she was sure she wouldn't have to wear them for long </span></div></div>",

Plus she could spend time eating instead of going to the bathroom and a big change had happened to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had became chubby. Her belly being big, round and jiggly and her appetite had also grown, causing her to sometimes have three servings each meal. One morning Kitty woke up late and quickly got up, her orange pjs stretching over her belly. She quickly got changed into her way too tight clothes before she walked to the kitchen to see it was empty and saw a note on the table. It read \"Kitty an emergency popped up. We tried to wake you but you wouldn't wake up so we left you. Be back soon \" it read in Illyana's somewhat messy hand writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" said Kitty as her stomach let out a loud rumble. \"Better feed it.\" said Kitty, patting her belly, not notching how big it was and went over to the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her options, she took out a box of left over pizza and made many different types of sandwiches to peanut butter to ham and cheese and went into a feast eating them all, getting some on her clothes. She was so busy eating, she didn't notice herself wetting her diaper until it was completely soaked. After an hour of eating, Kitty sat back rubbing her bloated belly and burped loudly just as Rogue and Illyana walked in and looked at Kitty, surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty what happened?\"asked Rogue walking over to the fridge to see it empty. \"Did you actually eat all the food?\"asked Rogue, a little upset that her teammate and friend had done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I was a bit hungry.\" replied Kitty with a shrug, rubbing her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that smell?\" asked Illyana, holding her nose as the stench of Kitty's pee reached her nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kitty's wearin' diapers now \"said Rogue with a smug smile on her face <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue!!!\" shouted Kitty a little embarrassed as her chubby cheeks turned bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Do you need help changing your self  ?\" Asked Illyana, a little awkward that the information she had just learned about her best friend and roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can do it myself \"said Kitty struggling to get up and waddled away, leaving the two concerned girls.</span></div></div>",

Their conversation was interrupted by Kitty walking into the room, her belly jiggling as she walked over to the table and made herself a stack of pancakes covered in syrup and whip cream and strawberry on top and sat down <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what're you guys talking about?\" Asked Kitty her mouth already filled with pancakes, syrup running down her double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much \" replied Rogue. \"So has anything strange happened to you lately?\" Asked Rogue, rising her eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" said Kitty digging into her pancakes.

She turned around to see Rogue and Illyana looking at her, making Kitty blush, her belly jiggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need a little help with that?\" asked lllyana with a small smirk, making Kitty blush even more. Kitty thought about it for a few seconds. she was having trouble seeing what she was doing thanks to her belly but getting changed would be embarrassing but she decided it was best. Kitty simply nodded, laid down on the bed and lllyana started to change her, removing the soaked and poopy diaper and throwing it over her shoulder, with it landing in the bin with a rather big PLOP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kitty about all the strange things at been happening to you lately... can you think of anything strange that happened to you before this all started?\" asked Rogue watching as lllyana put on a fresh diaper on Kitty.

It was a bit of a struggle for Kitty to fit her massive belly, getting stuck a bit. She had to use her ability to get through the window though when she got through, she let out a massive fart, causing her diaper to sag. When they walked around the hid out it wasn't long before they came across Scar. \"Hey Scar, you got to fix our friend she since you infected her mind. You can do it the easy way or the hard way.\" said Rogue, getting ready to fight just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I don't want any trouble \"said Scar putting her hands up in surrender just as she started to use her mind abilities. Suddenly Callisto and two other Morlocks teleport in to the hid out and instantly attacked. Rogue and Illyana quickly engaged two of the Morlocks. Callisto sneaked past them and grabbed Kitty before grabbing another Morlock that could teleport and before they could teleport away she looked at Scar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll deal with you later traitor \"said Callisto as her and the Morlocks teleported away leaving the three women alone  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well looks like we are going to have to rescue Kitty.\" said Illyana, rolling her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you.

What they said seemed to make sense at the time.\"  said Scar which made Rough and Illyana feel sorry for her half an hour later they end up at the main hid out and saw Callisto and the other Morlocks surrounding Kitty. All three women instantly started to attack the Morlocks. During the fight Kitty got a surprise making her mess her diaper even more and was pushed down by one of the Morlocks, making her fall in her very full, messy diaper, smearing poop all over her hippo butt. After an hour of fighting,  the Morlocks realized they where hopelessly out matched and teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" asked Illyana, helping Kitty up with a lot of effort to get Kitty on her feet <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah apart from messing my diaper.\" said Kitty. Scar quickly used her abilities to remove the mind control from Kitty's brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should do it \"said Scar as they went back to the mansion  Kitty still wore the diapers as she grew used to them and she was still pretty fat, not being bothered to lose the weight and scar now joined the team and lived with them becoming Kitty and Illyana's best friend.</span></div></div>",

Still, as time went on and within a seemingly period of calm he started to reflect about some tests and projects he had thought about in the past but, had never the opportunity to make them real. Specifically, he had been tinkering with the idea of seeing the effects in human/mutant relationship when physical changes were to be applied to determinate people under a specified set of condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that fateful day, as he was sitting behind his desk in the empty classroom, waiting for the next class to arrive, he saw through the window on the garden three particular persons that were chatting between themselves and thought about bringing that project to life using those girls as test subjects. The more he looked at them the more he realized they would be perfect for that personal project of his. The girls under his scrutiny were Storm, which was an omega mutant and so a major threat to most and a most useful ally to others, Rogue, a being powerful enough with her capability to drain powers and abilities from her opponents, and Shadowcat, that while not as powerful as her two friends, she still could be an annoying adversary to face with her ability to make herself insubstantial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hidden smile he opened his mind, making sure that no others around the mansion could feel what he was doing and began tampering with their minds, starting to input into them thoughts and subconscious feelings that would bring them to his ultimate goal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor X had thought long and hard on what changes he could actively promote in his test subjects and reached the conclusion that, for the best results, all he had to do was to promote a sensation of well being toward being overweight in the minds of his \u2018guinea pigs\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Yes, girls. You shall be part of a marvelous experiment indeed. <br>\r\nNothing harmful will come to you. I\u2019ll make sure of that. Just follow my voice and do as I say\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were sitting in the garden, enjoying a moment of peaceful quiet, Ororo, alias Storm, was currently meditating trying to relax a bit after her last classroom teachings. It had been a particularly difficult one since some of her students seemed to be interested more in her body than in her teachings. For that she told herself to talk with them singularly to let them understand their mistakes. Rogue, instead was laying down on a bench, reminiscing about her past, still battling internally with the desire to be freed of her powers and the need to protect and support her allies. Still, since she couldn\u2019t have any direct contact, she wondered what she could do to enjoy life a little. Finally, there was Shadowcat, the bubbly young girl had matured somewhat and while still being a bit immature, she was getting her bearings toward being more responsible, although, she took some time to just be herself. As she was doing currently, phasing through the tree in the garden joking and kidding as she made only a portion of her body emerge from within the tree bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Xavier worked his \u2018magic\u2019 on them, none of them actually realized something was happening but, some thoughts began to circulate within their minds, changing their focus on life as it should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, conflicted on how to deal with her students began to tinker with the idea of changing herself a bit, to see if with a less distractive body, her lesson could proceed more smoothly. True, she didn\u2019t want to end up unable to perform her duties but, maybe, if she were less toned her students could become more focused on what she said, instead of what she looked. It wasn\u2019t a conscious thought, it was more like a whisper carried by the wind that she managed to hear with her mind that, strangely enough, remained stuck within her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, instead, as she depressed herself about her future and the need to enjoy something in life seemed to reach the conclusion that noting she could do was actually going to change her life majorly, still she could try to be less strict in certain aspects of her life, not when it came to covering her body, of course. She didn\u2019t want to have her friends in danger but, maybe, if she could act less rigidly from that moment on, she could actually find something to make her life more\u2026pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third girl, instead, began to feel strange, it wasn\u2019t the first time that something or someone tried to tamper with her mind, so she appear to be more focused on the sudden thought than her two friends but, still, after the briefest sensation of having someone else there with her, she seemingly forgot about that and a strange new thought seemed to snake its way into her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I wonder\u2026what'd happen to my powers if I were to occupy more space than I currently do? Could it be an advantage when I\u2019m needed to disable electronic instruments? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what if I have more mass to make my martial arts capabilities more effective?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm\u2026this might not be a bad idea after all.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three girls became more enraptured with these strange and yet, so alluring, new ideas, one of their stomachs growled, making all three of them blush simultaneously. Storm, the more motherly of them, was the first to blame herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, girls. All the stress in my classrooms is apparently getting to me. I think I\u2019ll go prepare myself something from the kitchen, just to tide me over till lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ororo stood up, both Rogue and Shadowcat agreed to the idea, joining their friend, still blushing a bit, since each thought of being the one responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah Storm\u2026\u201d Rogue stammered a bit \u201cI totally agree with you. I mean, I could use a small snack right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, girls! Alright! I mean\u2026I think I may join you for a bite\u2026must've had a too light breakfast this morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls left the garden and moved into the house, Xavier kept following them in his mind, he hadn\u2019t do anything to effectively change their behavior yet, but as he had simply put some subconscious thoughts into them he was amazed by the results. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I wonder if they\u2019re so susceptible to my thoughts due to my powerful abilities or if they were already having some inner thoughts of their own that simply helped my suggestion to stick through?<br>\r\nStill, it\u2019s an advantage for me, so that I can bring forward my social experiment and with them I\u2019m sure it will be a success.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs they walked through the mansion they barely met anyone around, most students were either in class or elsewhere in the garden, enjoying the wonderful weather outside. While most of the teachers were either in class or, as in Wolverine case, doing some odd jobs around. As they entered the empty kitchen, each of them seemed to move with absolute decision toward a certain destination, as if it hadn0t been a simple, momentary thought that had brought them there, but a very essential need.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nStorm quickly went to the fridge, opening it and getting out from it a tub of Vanilla Ice cream, with that she filled almost completely a small bowl she took from one of the cupboards. Once the bowl was filed, she slowly placed the tub into the fridge and with spoon simply began to dig in into her small-ish snack, enjoying the taste of the cold ice cream on her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, instead, opted to open one of the many cupboard, taking out a half liter bottle of soda and a bag of chips, helping herself with few handfuls from it, before washing them down with a few sips from her bottle. In truth, she didn\u2019t really wanted to eat but, since she was convinced her body had different ideas she thought to comply with it as she waited for lunch time to roll around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadowcat, making use of her powers, simply walked through a cupboard and emerged on the other side holding a jar of chocolate chip cookies, quickly bringing one of them within her lips, stopping from pushing a second one only when her friends shot her a glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Began Storm, as she cleaned the last spoonful of ice cream. \u201cThat is why cookies are so scarce in this kitchen, lately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmf. And to think that I was being suspicious of Nightcrawler. Should have known it was you, all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadowcat, already one hand within the jar, turned suddenly toward Rogue, with an embarrassed and angered look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRogue! Th-That\u2019s just not fair! Wh-Why both of you are ganging up on me? I-I like these cookies, true. B-But I\u2019m no thief!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadowcat then, still holding the jar, simply let herself phase through the floor, leaving the room offended by the accusation from who she believed were her friends. As she appeared in her room, feeling anger and embarrassment, she began chowing down on the cookies as if there was no tomorrow, trying her hardest not to start crying. The other two girls, seeing Kitty\u2019s reaction, soon felt guilty and, after quickly polishing their snacks, went after her. Storm, in particular, was feeling deeply sorry for her negative outburst toward the younger girl. She knew that even the less malicious rumor could hurt others and so wanted to amend to her friend. Rogue, too was a bit ashamed of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was she to negatively comment on what the others do, especially when she hadn\u2019t any evidence?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two stormed out of the kitchen, a figure suddenly popped out into it, making sure that the coast was clear, before opening the cupboard and grabbing a few containers of cookies from there. Nightcrawler, hugging within his body the few containers he had snatched from the cupboards, simply vanished into thin air, teleporting himself away from there. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As both girls reached Shadowcat's room, they heard her sniffling inside and this pushed even more heavily on their hearts. Both of them knew they'd acted horribly toward Kitty, it had come out of their mouth almost immediately, the negative comments, but they didn\u2019t actually mean it. Still, their younger friend seemed to have taken the accusation rather personally and now refused to talk with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how hard they knocked or how loudly they asked to enter the room, Shadowcat refused to listen to them. This went on for a few minutes until, with no more patience to spare, Rogue kicked the door open, revealing the sniffling figure of Kitty, crumpled on her bed. Both girls slowly walked in until they were stopped by the crying 14-year-old girl, who assaulted them with fiery words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat now!? What more do you two want? Want to accuse me of something else? What've I done to you to deserve to be treated like this? I thought you were my friends, that I could trust you\u2026instead all you wanted was to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, moving closer to the frantic girl, quickly grabbed her arm, with her gloved hands, forcing her to turn toward them, to see the tears streaming down of her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Kitty, we didn\u2019t want to hurt you. We\u2026we talked without thinking. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026are sorry.\u201d Added Storm moving forward and kneeling beside Shadowcat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have said such mean things to you. I\u2019m truly sorry for what happened in the kitchen. I wish I could return back and take back my words but, I cannot. That is why, to ask you to forgive us, we would like to treat you to lunch. What do you say? We can go wherever you want to go, no fuss about the location. What do you say, Kitty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe youngest girl, sniffling less than before, before saying anything, jumped forward, closing her arms around both Storm and Rogue, this last one making sure not to get in contact with her skin, hugging them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, guys! I just felt so angry, so\u2026betrayed. But it warms me knowing you didn\u2019t really mean those words\u2026Although, I gotta confess something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, Shadowcat broke the hug and sat on the edge of the bed, before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm kinda addicted to those cookies so I may've taken a few out the jar during the past few nights\u2026heh heh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a minute there was silence in the room, until all three girls burst out laughing and joking with each other, revealing that each of them had snuck a few in the past, avoiding notice from the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the tension gone within them, Kitty suddenly sprang up from her bed, as she began walking around the room, a finger on her chin as if deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, Kitty?\u201d Said Storm, curiously watching the youngest girl deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. Just thinking about where you two are going to treat me to lunch.\u201d Replied the girl, grinning widely, as the two older girls scowled jokingly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor X had followed the events with his mind and decided once more that the three friends were just the perfect test subjects for his project. He had only to nudge them a bit more in the right direction, before starting to input a more definite sets of planted thoughts in their minds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shadowcat pondered where to go, a sudden idea sprang in her mind, she wasn\u2019t really sure where she took that notion, but it suddenly seemed the perfect way to close up the situation they were all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got it, girls! I\u2019ve heard of this new buffet style place that opened recently. Anyone who's gone there's been talking about it as a cool place. And, most importantly, the owner isn\u2019t against mutants at all, so we could go there\u2026so you two can also enjoy a good meal. What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, both Storm and Rogue agreed that, indeed, it was a good idea. What they didn\u2019t know was that the place wasn\u2019t as normal looking as it seemed. Indeed, any customer who went there, left the place giving the best review they could of the place. It could have seemed strange that an all-you-can-eat place that had opened up by barely a week, already had better reviews than most other restaurants in town. Still, people seemed blind to this strangeness, and kept returning to it, unaware of what was happening right under their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already lunchtime when the three X-girls entered the restaurant and, just as soon as they passed the entrance a smiling waiter reached to them, showing them around a bit, before taking them to their table, explain to them the rules of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome ladies, welcome to The Food Heaven. Are you all together? Good, follow me. I\u2019ll accompany you to your table.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked the waiter showed them how the place was built, not only there were the massive isles where food could be collected by bringing the plates but, all around the hall there was a mechanical moving belt that let food circulate around the various tables, giving the customer the chance to pick something from it without the need for leaving their seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go, ladies. Now, we have a strict no leftovers policy so whatever you carry to your table have to be eaten if you want to include it inside the All you can eat Menu. Selected packages and offers can be chosen from to decide your meal, and you can see all the details from the interactive menu here at your table. Mainly, the Buffet style menu includes beverages and food, no limit on the number of refills you wish to do, for the price of 10 dollars per customer. As I said before, due to our no leftovers policy, the plate left with food in it will be charged at full price. Single plates prices can be consulted with the menu. Hope you\u2019re enjoy your meal and stay. For any need, don\u2019t hesitate to call one of us waiters and we will assist you as best as we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter politely excusing himself, the guy left them on their own, as he went to greet more customers entering the restaurant.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe three friends looked around ecstatic, checking out the place and enjoying already the heavenly aroma\u2019s coming from all around them. Quickly, they sat and began scrolling through the various options but, in the end, they decided to just pick the buffet style menu and start from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly they separated and each went to a different section of the place, carrying a few plates with them. After a while, upon returning to their table, each could see that the other had decided to treat this occasion as if it was a cheat day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was the first to return to their table, bringing with her two plates full of different kinds of pasta. One was a common looking mac \u2019n' cheese while the second one was a plate of fried Chinese noodles with pork and eggs. Both plates were quite larger than what they usually used at the mansion but, she told herself that it wasn\u2019t the end of the world if she let herself go for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her, was Ororo. The African girl returned balancing three plates with her, the first two filled with different kinds of Chinese noodles, while the third one was some kind of tasty looking stew she had found while walking around. Last one to arrive was Shadowcat, she returned holding with both hands a massive bowl of Japanese ramen which, compared to the rather short teenage girl, appeared to be even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Kitty\u2026pretty hungry, today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Rogue, I gotta confess I\u2019m starving but I see you\u2019re no less hungry than me, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two half joked with each other, Ororo broke the building tension with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome, ladies. Let us just enjoy some freedom today\u2026and, if someone is going to have the prize for hunger\u2026it should go to me, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the other two laughed at that, the three friends began to eat and, as soon as the first bite passed within their lips, they began to literally tear at the food they had brought with them. It was so delicious that all of them couldn\u2019t stop from shoveling more and more of it within their lips. In less than twenty minutes, all three of them had cleaned their plates, almost licking the plates. And yet, as much as their bellies had bloated quite a bit, neither of them felt full, nor satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, who'd even drank all the soup from her bowl, simply stood up, albeit a bit slowly, and turned toward her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll go for round two. Girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue stood up along with her and quickly they walked away, searching for something to catch their eye, while Ororo, sat there, feeling as her, usually tight, abs had been replaced by a itty bitty bloated belly. Still, sitting there she noticed the mechanical beltway just bringing plates loaded with cuts of meat and fried mix ups. Interested she quickly grabbed a few out of it and placed them right under her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a bit, due to the amazing smell coming from her plates, she noticed that for once, she maybe had taken more than she could possibly consume. In front of her, in fact there were now two plates with quite large portions of beef stroganoff and the third platter filled with a mix of fries in all shapes and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before she could delve into her meal, her friends returned to the table with their choices and she noticed that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty was coming back to the table, carrying four plates full of meat and BBQ sauce. Kitty hummed happily as she placed each one down in front of her before sitting down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kitten... are you sure you can eat all that?\" Ororo asked gently. Kitty rolled her eyes. \"C'mon, Ororo. Gimme a break. I can eat as much as I want here. Besides, your meal isn't exactly small itself.\" She retorted as she eyed Storm's two plates loaded with beef stroganoff and the tray loaded with fries. Ororo blushed as she realized Kitty did have a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are right, Kitty. My apologies.\" Storm said with an embarrassed smile. Kitty grinned. \"It's okay Storm. You're just hungry like me.\" She smiled as she patted her friend's hand assuredly. Then, her stomach growled hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay already! Geez belly, gimme a minute!\" She fumed, causing Ororo to smile and chuckle slightly. Kitty then grabbed a BBQ sauce drenched drumstick and tore a giant chunk of meat off, getting sauce on her face and fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm just smiled as she began eating her own feast of stroganoff and fries. The duo kept eating and eating, unaware of their stomachs bloating even more. As she ate, Storm wondered what was taking Rogue so long to come back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, did you see Rogue while you were grabbing your current meal?\" she asked. Kitty, sauce smeared around her mouth and now dripping onto her uniform top, shook her head as she swallowed the latest mouthful of meat she had packed into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Sorry, 'Roro. I thought I saw her near the farther part of the conveyor belts, but I could've imagined it.\" Kitty replied as she began attacking her fourth plate of ribs, loudly tearing the meat off and licking and smacking her lips and fingers as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro frowned as she looked up at the belts but then her stomach gurgled with hunger and she returned to eating as well, while still trying to keep an eye for Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two X-Ladies kept wolfing down their newest meals as they waited for Rogue to return with her next meal. Finally, the duo leaned back slightly and sighed in contention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was the best barbeque I've eaten in a long time.\" Kitty sighed, sucking on her BBQ sauce coated fingers as she lounged in her seat, patting her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree Kitten. Though, for some reason, I still want... more.\" Ororo remarked as she rubbed her own bloated belly as it bulged against her t-shirt. Kitty nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes it unanimous.\" she giggled, stifling a big burp a second later. Ororo just rolled her eyes in amusement and chuckled as Kitty kept going on and on about the delicious food here. She had to agree with Kitty. The food was very delicious and she could see why it was so recommended after only a few weeks of operations. At the same time, she was wondering about Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,</span></div></div>",

Ororo turned and, sure enough, there was Rogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer, Ororo and Kitty couldn't believe their eyes. Rogue had gotten quadruple the amount of food she'd just eaten. Rogue's plates were overflowing with mega sized burgers, hot dogs, bacon strips, corn on the cob, what seemed to be an entire turkey, blueberry pie, chocolate cake and a honey glazed ham. Ororo's belly rumbled at this beautiful sight and she heard Kitty's tummy mimicking hers. Neither of the duo spoke as Rogue managed to place each meal down as she sat down again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we know now why you took so long to come back.\" Ororo smirked at Rogue, who smiled sheepishly. \"What can Ah say, 'Roro? Ah'm a hungry gal today.\" she smiled as she tore a drumstick off the turkey and began chomping on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, Kitty. Let us go get some more food.\" Storm smiled at Kitty, who nodded eagerly and was already standing up in delight. With that, the duo headed to the conveyor belts and started looking for tasty treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro soon began loading her tray after reaching her decided location. Soon, it was overflowing with a large ham, biscuits, corn on the cob, more beef stroganoff, fries, bacon, ham and cheese sandwiches and a huge pumpkin pie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, went to a different part of the belts and was soon loading her own tray. Soon, it was heaped with mega sized burgers, doughnuts, eclairs, a giant heap of bacon, death by chocolate cake, chocolate chip, sugar, peanut butter and molasses cookies, hot dogs and other sugary/greasy foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue eyed the two X-Ladies' trays when they returned with a smirk. \"So, Ah ain't the only one who's takin' advantage of our cheat day, huh?\" she joked, patting her big belly as it bulged against her black costume and green sleeve-less top. Kitty stuck her tongue out at Rogue playfully as she sat down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gimme a break. You're not exactly one to talk yourself, Miss. Piggy.\" She giggled, poking Rogue's gut with her finger, causing Rogue to let out a gentle burp as she blushed sheepishly. Kitty just smirked and then plopped five cookies into her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I do feel peck-ish again, Rogue. Though, I do not know why.\" Storm admitted thoughtfully as she sunk her teeth into the first large ham and cheese sandwich, moaning in delight at the taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, placed three large doughnuts on her index finger and then inhaling them. Swallowing them in one giant gulp, she smiled and then crammed three large hot dogs drenched in ketchup and mustard into her mouth, smearing said condiments and the grease around her mouth as well with some of them dribbling onto her uniform's top too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three X-Ladies kept eating and eating their massive meals, unaware of what was happening to their bodies as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she inhaled all the corn on the cob she'd gotten, Rogue's large gut slowly shrank, the fat moving mainly to her hips, butt and boobs. While her belly still resembled a boulder, it was considerably less round while said body parts were much bigger/heavier and her arms, legs, fingers, feet, toes, hands and face were also softer and chubbier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, loudly slurping/guzzling an extra jumbo chocolate milkshake, also seemed to plump up in her legs and hips while her booty grew even larger. Her hips began getting even bigger while her already huge booty cheeks strained at her pants. She'd also developed a round face and bigger boobs, fatter arms, hands, fingers, feet and toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty's body was starting to chub itself out as she devoured her cake. Her thighs widened slightly as pudge covered her arms and legs. Her boobs and butt also plumped up, though not as much as Rogue's or Storm's. Her face also became soft, with a double chin soon appearing as her belly, arms, legs and other body parts plumped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio just kept eating and eating, oblivious to these changes as they kept wolfing down their unhealthy meals. They seemed to have grown addicted to eating, regardless how much they'd eaten before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was obvious because as soon as a new thing of food was reached, the trio completely dove into it, tearing chunks of whatever it was. The waiters soon caught on to this and began bringing the large plates to the X-Ladies' table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, the plates were brought in with some type of logic, but they gradually became more and more chaotic. Massive cheeseburgers, dripping with grease, were soon followed by very huge piles of glazed doughnuts, which were soon joined by massive pots of chili and rightly followed by large, frosted cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Storm handled the burgers, Rogue the chili and Kitty the doughnuts and cake. Storm stuffed three burgers into her mouth at once before swallowing them and cramming another three in. Rogue was busy loudly gulping down the chili, getting quite a bit of it on her clothes and face, but like Storm, she didn't care a bit. She just smiled, burped loudly and kept on a-chugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was having the time of her life with the doughnuts and cakes. First she poured half the first tray into her mouth, bulging her cheeks like a chipmunk's as she chewed away. After swallowing that, she grabbed two large slices of a seven layer pound cake and crammed those into her mouth. Then she repeated this until the first doughnut tray and cake were gone before she inhaled a big, plump red velvet cake, burping loudly after doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the girls switched. Kitty took the hamburgers, Rogue took the cakes and doughnuts and Storm the chili. Kitty actually managed to stuff five of the mega cheeseburgers into her mouth at once as she did so. Storm did what Rogue had done with the chili and slurped it straight from the pots, also getting chili on her already grease stained clothes and face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue gulped down two stacks of doughnuts at once before eating an entire four layered chocolate cake with chocolate pieces on it in just two monster sized bites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Storm was given the doughnuts and cakes, Rogue the cheeseburgers and Kitty the chili.  Storm poured 15 different doughnuts into her gullet as she moaned in delight at their tastes before stuffing a fistful of cheesecake into her mouth as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue crammed six cheeseburgers into her gullet at once before swallowing loudly and downing another six while Kitty guzzled the remaining pots of chili even more sloppily than her friends did, dripping big globs of it onto her uniform top, which was already covered with frosting, powdered sugar, grease, BBQ sauce, ketchup and mustard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the three X-Ladies leaned back in their seats and burped loud and long as they massaged their large bellies in delight at their gorge. Storm's belly was poking out from under her shirt, now resembling a brown boulder and her whole body was soft and doughy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue wasn't much better as her gut was straining against her costume more than ever. Her face looked like a ball of dough and her whole body jiggled with fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was just as bad as her friends were. Her belly was big and round, her body resembled a boulder in roundness and she was almost bigger than her two older teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter came up a second later. \"Excuse me, ladies, but the buffet is closing soon. However, if you would like to continue eating, I'll speak to the chief. What would you like to do?\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trio stared at each other for a moment. Then, Ororo slowly turned back to the waiter. She stifled a very big burp, bulging her cheeks as she did before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no *burp* thank *belch* you. We *urp* have *burp* eaten *hic* enough for *burp* today. Thank *hic* you. We will take the... check... now... please...\" she gasped in between burping and hiccupping from her fullness. Rogue nodded in agreement, her double chin jiggling as she did while Kitty merely let out a giant burp while massaging her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter nodded and walked off to get their check, leaving the three bloated and pooped out X-Ladies to catch their breaths. After a few minutes, Kitty, still rubbing and poking her ginormous gut, spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *burp* gotta say *urp* that was the best *belch* food I've *hic* eaten in *hic-urp* a long time *booorrrppp*. Man, is my tummy full.\" She groaned in delight, despite her bloated belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm with ya sugah. We really gotta come back here again sometime.\" Rogue agreed as she stroked her bulging belly in equal delight as she eyed her fat and youngest teammate with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit I too feel happy from eating so much. Normally I would disprove of eating so much in one day, but, I shall make an exception for this yummy and delicious food.\" Ororo admitted with a grin as she poked her belly, watching a sausage sized finger sink into the squishy, warm and brown flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the waiter came back and, after Ororo paid the check, he and two other waiters helped the bloated girls to the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio started for the mansion, but it soon became apparent that, despite it not being far away, the walk was doing the trio more harm than good in their bloated forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes, Storm was leaning against a lamppost, clutching her side as she wheezed and panted heavily, sweat running down her greasy and plump face as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had sat down on a bus bench, also wheezing and panting, sweat running down her own doughy face as she leaned back, her massive boobs and belly raising and falling as she tried to get oxygen back into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, had simply belly flopped onto the ground and was now laying on her massive belly, gulping like a beached trout, her tongue nearly touching the pavement as she wheezed, gulped and panted loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... so... pooped...\" She groaned. \"So... am... Ah... sugah... mah feet... are... killin'... me...\" Rogue groaned in equal exhaustion as she managed to lift her head up to eye her younger teammate and friend sprawled on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely... the... mansion was... not... that... far... away... when we... walked... here?\" Ororo gulped after a minute, wiping her sweaty and greasy forehead off with a large meaty hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... we... should... just... call.. a... cab?\" Kitty finally wheezed. The other two nodded as they kept trying and failing to get enough energy and oxygen into their large bodies. Kitty managed to pull her phone out of her tights and, after trying and failing to type the number in with her own sausage sized fingers, used voice command to call a taxi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the taxi pulled up and the fat, sweaty and greasy X-Ladies heaved themselves into it. They were cramped in the back together, but merely assumed the taxi was out of date enough to be or feel cramped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the trio arrived at the institute and waddled inside. Rogue was the one who broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gals? If... we... go back... soon... we'd... better... use... the... cab... ta... get... too an'... from it...\" She remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Ororo both agreed and the trio waddled to their bedrooms, cleaned themselves up and plopped into bed, dreaming about food and how nice it was to let go and eat like they'd done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this happened, the fat they'd gained, slowly worked its' way around their bodies, fattening them up even more in their hips, boobs, butts, faces, arms, legs, toes, feet, fingers and hands during the night.</span></div></div>",

He could see that his action had led the mutant woman to let herself go, reducing the standard of physical perfection she usually went by. He also noticed that he was getting some weird vibes from the restaurant they were in but discarded the thought. Roaming through the restaurant it didn\u2019t take him long time to find Rogue and Kitty, the two were currently standing next to a few containers of food, unable to choose what they wanted to pick. Since they all made part of his experiment, he smiled within himself and gave them a little mental push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Kitty, it\u2019s a cheat day\u2026nothing harmful will come from it. Enjoy yourself to the fullest\u2026Can\u2019t you feel your stomach grumbling? It need food to work properly. Satisfy it.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Rogue, why not trying to live life as much as you can? One plate? Two or even four? Follow your hunger\u2026and you\u2019re getting pretty hungry, aren\u2019t you?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he closed the connection he tiredly crashed against his chair, yet, he was smiling. The three test subjects were showing a great promise already\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the restaurant, Ororo had already cleared the first plate of Strogonoff, her belly bloating already a bit, as a small sliver of her skin began to emerge between her long tight pants and the sleeveless top and jacket, she was wearing. Besides, she didn\u2019t feel full, yet, so she placed the empty plate aside and brought the fried mixed plate in front of her when she saw her friends returning. As soon as she spotted them, she gaped open mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Kitty and Rogue were closing on their table with a massive platter on their hands, she couldn\u2019t believe in seeing that both massive platters were literally overfilled with food. As the two girls finally seated the table trembled for a moment with the added weight of their plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKitten? Rogue? What\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr\u2026maybe Ah took a bit too much? But it\u2019s okay\u2026Feelin' ravenous today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rogue began to literally assault all the food in her platter, mostly massive double decker hamburgers and huge hot dogs, with the sparse presence of fried greens and salty fries. As she started munching through those she quickly grabbed the ketchup and mayo, as she began to literally cover the entire platter with those sauces, making it even more greasy and with a higher calorie content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, instead had filled her own platter with an immense selection of junk food and confectioneries. The massive palter was indeed choked full of hot dogs and greasy, multi dickered, hamburgers. Right between that huge carb fest, there were also mounds of bacon strips right along with at least a dozen donuts, a few \u00e9clair and even a couple of slices from a Devil\u2019s food cake. She too began attacking the plate with a ferociousness that Storm had never seen before, as the greasy sauce began to smear her lips and chin, slowly dribbling even on her clothes. Kitty, seeing the interrogative stare of Ororo, simply smiled, swallowed and replied to her as if it was the most normal of the things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m just hungry\u2026and I was dying for both fast foods and sweets\u2026so, that\u2019s perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, seeing her two friends enjoying their meal so much, decided to let herself go, and so she started imitating them, taking plates from the conveyor belt, filling herself up as she too began to feel a rising hunger coming from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, all three of them managed finally to demolish whatever they had brought to the table. Needless to say, the girls who had entered that buffet, were very different from those that were now seated at that table. Storm was belching quietly, as she caressed her bloated belly which had definitively opened the gap between her pants and her top, the globular stomach rested on her thighs, a boulder like belly, round as a ball and yet, not filled up to capacity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue too, was in a similar situation, her clothes, already tight when she entered the restaurant, were now on the verge of ripping apart on the torso, as her round belly pushed mightily against her black outfit, making her sleeveless green top appear more like a makeshift bra than anything else. She was laying on the back of her chair, caressing her bloated tummy and yet, she still was feeling quite a bit hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, of all of them, was the one most impacted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the shortest and the youngest, the results of her binge were the most dominant on her figure. Her belly had grown massively in size, pushing tightly against her clothes, as it weighed her down, and yet, both her face and her clothes, drenched in grease and powdered sugar, were evidence enough of just how ravenous she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept she was still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio breathed slowly, regaining their energy from all that time spent eating, they suddenly noticed one of the cute waiter boys coming toward them. As he stepped up to their table, he smiled seeing that all plates on it had been emptied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI take it you ladies have enjoyed your meals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yes\u2026*Belch*! Pardon me\u2026.It was all very good\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter, not at all impressed by the belching, smiled at the girl with the white dyed mohawk hair as he turned toward the other two, complimenting each of them and informing them of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, I\u2019m sorry to say this but it\u2019s almost closing time. Still, if you wish to stay here and have some more, we will inform the chef about it. This is an \u2018All you can eat\u2019 buffet\u2026if our Guests return home hungry, we haven\u2019t done our job well. So, what is gonna be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three friends looked each other in the eyes, as a grinning smile appeared on their faces, before turning all three toward the waiter replying with a definite \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll having some more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on, for their enjoyment, the waiters began to bring platefuls of food directly to their table, as they were the only customers still present in the restaurant, meaning that whenever one of them cleaned a plate, another filling meal presented itself under their eyes. The three girls began to be so engrossed in the act of eating that they barely noticed the effects that all that food was having on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kitty was already cleaning out a plateful of baked corns with glazed ham slices, when her bloated belly began to shrink, the weight and fat slowly distributing itself overall on her body, chubbying it out. Her curves began to soften as fatty rolls began to make their appearance on her front and on her back, her thighs widened a little bit, as a small layer of jiggling pudge covered her arms and legs. Her face too softened up, with a second chin starting to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, just as she had cleaned a massive platter with an entire roasted turkey, also began to soften up, although she began to grow mostly I her breasts, which began to grow larger and heavier, and on her hips, widening hip quite a bit. Her belly, although it had softened up was still quite small. Ororo, instead, as she finished guzzling a massive milkshake offered by one of the waiters, seemed to be expanding mostly on her hips and legs, as her ass seemed to grow out of control. Her already wide hips began to wide up hugely, with her ass check that started to wobbly overflow the chair she was sitting on, pushing to their stress limit the pants she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them seemed to have become addicted to eating, no matter how much they had eaten before, as soon as a new plate was placed before them, they totally dived in it, taking huge chunks of whatever it was. At first, the plates seemed to be carried over with some kind of logic but, after some time, everything seemed to grow more and more chaotic. Massive hamburgers, drenched in grease, were soon followed by huge piles of glazed donuts, which were then replaced by large pots of chili, rightly followed by large frosting covered cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls kept gorging on the amazing food that was being presented to them, unaware of what their bodies were experiencing, just as if a trigger had been activated within them turning them into human waste disposal machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as they gorged and guzzled, three things happened at the same time. First, Professor X checked on them, smiling in seeing how his project was already providing good results. Then, from the kitchen doors the Chef watched with admiration and fascination as those guests kept on eating his food and, finally\u2026.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the chef was sure that the three new guests were too engrossed with their food, he let out a small cackling laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in his plan seemed to be going steadily. As he closed the door and returned inside the kitchen he couldn\u2019t stop smiling. He was an honest man, he hadn\u2019t any superpower to call his own and that had made him jealous of the mutants, at first. Then he realized that with those superpowers, the mutants could wipe out mankind and humanity wouldn\u2019t have stand a chance. So, to his jealousy, it soon began to appear hate for the mutants. Still, he was a peaceful man and he knew he couldn\u2019t fight them directly so a plan hatched within him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no power, but he had his culinary skills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding to that some hunger stimulants and metabolism suppressors, he concocted his personal plan to stop the mutants from destroying the world. Once hey were going to be all so fat that all they wanted to do was eat, he could have called it a victory for mankind. That was why he had spent so much on those mutagenic tracer installed on the entrance of the restaurant, once he could know which of his guests was a mutant he could stuff them full of food, changing them in the eating machine he needed them to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Sure\u2026</i>\u2019 he thought to himself a he prepared the next batches of blueberry pies to be brought to his current victims \u2018<i>\u2026A few humans will end up as big, if not bigger, gluttons than them\u2026but it\u2019s a small price to pay for everyone to be freed of the mutant threat.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, he knew he couldn\u2019t push it too much in one day. Already he had stopped providing stimulants to the food of those three mutant girls there. Still, he already had made preparation to have them back in his restaurant soon enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls though, were still gorging gluttonously with all the food brought to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them knew how long they had been staying there eating and yet, as the stimulants in their bodies began to fade, they too began to slow down in their consumption. Rogue was the first one to stop. With her now exaggerated hourglass figure, her breast had become more of a hassle than anything else. Weighing her down as they had grown massively, losing almost all of their perkiness, they were kept somewhat lifted up only by the small-ish potbelly she had developed. Her hips too had widened hugely, forcing her to seat with her legs spread apart a bit. As she swallowed the last cupcake on her platter, the last of three dozen she had been given, she burped a bit and simply crashed on the table, unable to continue, feeling completely stuffed and yet, happy for once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm followed her example ten minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe African girl had grown hugely during the almost endless lunch they had, her ass cheeks were now hugely wobbling masses of lard. Piling heavily on her enlarged thighs and legs, her poor pants hadn\u2019t managed to resist during her binge, ripping apart in several places. She was still covered for the most part but, several gaps had opened letting several inches of fatty ass to spill out. As Ororo managed to swallow down the last taco she had been given, she too almost collapsed on the back of her chair, as she massaged a bit both her massive ass and globular belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty Pryde was the last one to give up. While rogue crashed, she managed to eat a whole pot of lentil stew. Burping and farting away trying to make some more room. As Storm collapsed, she cleared out a large plate filled to the brim with cookies and ice cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, just as she had cleared out that last plate, her clothes seemingly exploded off her, ripping into shreds, leaving her almost naked but she didn\u2019t seem to notice anything apart form the fact that she was finally feeling contently full. As she swallowed down her last morsel she smiled and turned toward the waiter standing beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I think\u2026we\u2019re\u2026done\u2026now. Could you\u2026bring us\u2026the check?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she, too, collapsed, using her humongous belly as a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the three, she seemed to have bee growing the most. With her forms growing apple shaped, her belly was massive, it hung bloated, down on her legs, almost up to her knees, as did similarly her ass. As it almost overflowed her chair. Her face too had softened up quite a bit more, with a second chin definitely there, and the hint of a third one starting to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waiters cleaned the table, and them, they also gave to the three girls some time to rest a bit, before waking them up telling them that it was time to close the buffet. The three mutants didn\u2019t seem baffled to have spent most of their day in that restaurant, nor of how their bodies had grown. But that was simply because nether of them could see herself truly. Charles Xavier, since he had followed their descent into gluttony, had made so that their minds couldn\u2019t see the physical changes within themselves. This was made to make sure that no false data was going to be collected as his experiment went on. Also, because he wanted to see what reaction would the others have in seeing their friends so much fattened. As he broke the contact, he couldn\u2019t wait to see the three girls waddle slowly through the halls of the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered briefly if someone would have the courage to approach them asking the dreaded question.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAs Kitty, Storm and Rogue woke up and stood from the table, each of them felt as if there was something that wasn\u2019t quite right but, unable to see how vastly each of them had changed, they simply dismissed the thought. As Rogue paid for their meal, since it was a treat that they had decided to offer to Kitty, one of the waiters reached to them, smiling gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, please to wait a moment, before you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYe\u2026*burp*\u2026es?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, feeling definitely stuffed, turned as a burp escaped her lips, although the waiter didn\u2019t seem to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to let you know that, since you\u2019re first timers in our restaurant, and since you\u2019ve enjoyed so much our products, the Owner would like to offer you a special discount within our establishment. In this case, we offer you a fifty percent discount on all your expenses if you come here to eat at least four times a week, while a thirty percent discount if you should decide to hire our personal catering service directly to your home. I must admit you must have made quite an impression on the Boss, we have only a handful of Clients to which this deal has been offered to. Also, with the discount, the no leftover policy is removed. So any residual can be brought home or home delivered, as you would prefer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, without even waiting for her friends' response, greedily nodded several times, just before Storm slapped her lightly on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse my friend's eagerness. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t think before speaking. Anyway, we will think about it, if possible, and let you know the earliest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the waiter nodded gently, with small smile on his lips and helped the three fattened beauties out of the building. As they were outside, swollen bodies shown to the world in their largeness, the three mutants slowly began the hard trek home, although it had took them only few minutes to get there in the first place. As a few meters passed, with their overburdened bodies getting completely drenched in sweat, the three girls stopped suddenly, completely out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Huff*\u2026didn\u2019t seem\u2026to be\u2026so far away\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, huffing and puffing, stood against a lamp post trying to regain her breath. Her huge ass, shaking and wobbling as she tried futilely to calm her heartrate down. Rogue and Kitty didn\u2019t fare that much better. Rogue was currently seated on a nearby bench, completely collapsed on it as her potbelly bobbed up and down, as she breathed heavily. Kitty, instead was sitting down on the street, trying as hard as she could to recover her energies. As time passed and neither of them could recover enough to start moving again, it was Rogue who first piped up with a proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls\u2026what if\u2026we call\u2026a cab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, trying hard to find air enough to speak, simply nodded, barely breathing out a yes, just as Kitty took out her phone and tried vainly to call a taxi with her sausage like fingers, until she simply went on internet and spoke with a trembling voice asking for a cab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited there, Storm finally managed to pipe up, having recovered some much-needed oxygen in her overburdened, overstuffed, body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust remember\u2026for tomorrow\u2026to go there with\u2026the cab.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few minutes, the cab Kitty had ordered rolled up. The cabbie looked shocked at the three bloated women, but didn't say anything as they opened the door and started to climb in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty got in first, sitting by the other door. Rogue went next, followed by Storm. \"Oomph!\" Kitty grunted as she was pressed slightly against the door by Rogue's girth. \"Rogue, do you mind scooting over a bit? I'm pretty much wedged to the door.\" she said, wriggling around uncomfortably. \"Sorry sugah. But Ah'm jammed between you an' Ororo.\" Rogue replied apologetically as she rubbed her big tummy with her fat, gloved hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, excuse me. I cannot help it if I am squishing you two. This cab is probably so worn down, it is possibly too small for us.\" Storm retorted as she also put a chubby hand on her brown boulder of a belly. The cabbie didn't seem to hear this comment. He just looked at the trio as they wriggled and jiggled, trying to get some degree of space between their large, fatty bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where to, ladies?\" He asked calmly. \"Westchester.\" Storm grunted as she managed to cross one of her salami sized legs over the other so Rogue could have at least a little more leg room as Rogue managed to wriggle over slightly so Kitty could move away from the opposite door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cab driver nodded and set off. The three X-Ladies didn't say anything as they just kept catching their breaths and rubbing their full bellies. Storm was burping slightly as she breathed in and out, patting her tummy as it poked out between her shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was smiling as she rubbed her large orb of a belly with both hands, hiccupping slightly as she ran her hands over the bloated flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, was grinning broadly as she lightly drummed on her rather big orb of a tummy. After a moment, she froze, a gurgling noise coming from her belly. Rogue and Storm noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten... are you alright?\" Storm asked. Kitty didn't answer as her cheeks swelled up. It looked like she was gonna be sick, which was somewhat understandable, given how much the trio had eaten over the last several hours. Her belly gurgled even more now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *BBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Kitty belched loudly.  \"Excuse me.\" she giggled, blushing furiously. Rogue and Storm looked at her with weird expressions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty. That was good, but that ain't how ya burp. This is how ya really burp.\" Rogue smirked, pressing on her belly and sloshing it slightly. Then, *BBBBBBUUUUUURRRRAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!* She let out a long, rumbling burp. \"Neat, Rogue.\" Kitty smiled as she kept rubbing her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you do not know how to burp.\" Storm smiled as she strained hard, the large brown orb of a tummy gurgling and sloshing. After a few minutes, *BBBBBBUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* She let out the biggest burp yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Rogue eyed each other mischievously. \"Why, Storm. If Ah didn't know any better, Ah'd say y'all are challengin' Kitty an' me to a burp off.\" Rogue smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm grinned in equal mischievous amusement. \"Why, Rogue. Why would I do that?\" she chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is on, sugah!\" Rogue declared. \"Yeah. I was burping champ at Deerfield Middle before I joined the X-Men, Ororo! I'm gonna kick your guys' tushies!\" Kitty giggled in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue, you are so confident with your belching abilities, why don't you go first?\" Storm suggested with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank ya, sugah.\" Rogue giggled as she began straining hard while pressing on her squishy bloated tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!* A large belch escaped her lips a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. But I can do better.\" Storm smirked as she began sloshing her brown belly with her hands, moving it up and down and side to side as it started gurgling and rumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!! !* A bigger burp flew out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*YYOOOOOOOUUUUUU CCCAAANANNNN'TTTTTT BBBBBEEEEAAAAATTTT MMMMEEEEEEEEEE.* Rogue burped with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*WWWAAANNNNNAAAAA BBEEEEETTTTTTT RRROOOOOOGGGGGGGUUUUUEEEE* Storm belched back with an equally big grin as she patted her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"My turn.\" Kitty giggled as she began violently jiggling, sloshing and pounding her belly. After a moment, it burbled, it gurgled, it jiggled, it wobbled. Kitty's cheeks puffed up more and more with pressure and then... it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRPPP!* Kitty let out the biggest burp of all, shattering the cab's windows and nearly sending it into a ditch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SSSEEEEEE? TTTTHHHHAATTT'SSSS HHOOOOWWW YOOOUUU BBUUURRRPPPP!* Kitty belched in victory as she then giggled and rubbed her tummy in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Kitty. Ah guess Ah shoulda taken your burpin' stories more seriously.\" Rogue admitted with a smile as she and Kitty high fived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree Kitten. Your burps were pretty impressive.\" Ororo smiled as Kitty blushed at the compliment. Then, \"We're here.\" the cabbie said as he pulled up to the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Sorry 'bout your windows.\" Kitty apologized as she handed him a few dollar bills extra than what Storm had paid him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls started to climb out, only to run into a slight problem: Storm was stuck due to her wide hips and booty. \"C'mon, 'Roro! Pull!\" Rogue said as she began helping her teammate and friend out. \"Yeah. With all that chili she ate, I don't wanna be behind Rogue's big butt anymore than I already am!\" Kitty joked, eyeing Rogue's large hippo butt cautiously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah wouldn't talk sugah. You an' Ororo both ate the same large amount of chili Ah did.\" Rogue reminded her as Storm finally managed to wriggle out with Rogue's help. Rogue also got stuck slightly but she was able to pop free quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it was Kitty's turn. She only got her head and arms out before she got stuck herself. \"Hold on sugah.\" Rogue smiled as she grabbed Kitty by her plump hands and began to pull. But even with Rogue's super strength, Kitty was just barely budging. Being the shortest and youngest, her girth was bigger than Rogue and Storm's, even with her fat having moved to other areas of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'MON!!\" Rogue grunted as she kept pulling. \"Any harder Rogue, and you'll pull my arms off!\" Kitty protested. She did feel bad for getting stuck too and she was doing her best to help.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like me to aid you?\" Storm asked Rogue as the latter finally took a moment to catch her breath, wheezing and gasping, sweat rolling down her soft, plump face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... that'd be... great.... Storm.... thank.... ya...\" Rogue managed to gulp out between wheezes and gulps of air. Storm smiled and wrapped her arms around Rogue's large belly while the southern gal took Kitty by the hands. \"Hold on now, Kitty!\" Rogue said as she and Storm began pulling hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use. Even with Storm helping, Kitty only slid a little bit more. Then, \"I... believe I have... an... idea... we... could try.\" Ororo wheezed as she and Rogue took another break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kitty asked, hoping she was going to be freed soon. The cab's doorframe was digging into her sides and was actually starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Rogue and myself pull, you use your powers to phase free.\" Ororo explained. \"Okay. Let's try it.\" Kitty agreed. So, Rogue and Storm retook their places and began pulling again. \"OKAY, KITTY! PHASE NOW SUGAH!\" Rogue grunted as the two older X-Ladies kept pulling. Kitty closed her eyes, took a deep breath and phased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, she popped free and belly flopped right on top of Rogue due to her girth and momentum being more than both had expected. Storm had managed to stumble back in time. The two younger X-Ladies blushed sheepishly as they realized where Kitty was and managed to heave themselves up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three X-Ladies didn't say a word as they waddled into the Mansion and went to their respective rooms. They barely had enough energy to clean themselves up and squeeze into their pajamas before flopping into bed and drifting off to Dreamland.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three la(r)dies sat in the cab, squishing each other\u2019s flab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as uncomfortable as it was for each of them, they yet had to understand why they were feeling so perturbed. In the end, each of them simply thought that the cab had to be so run down that they were forced to sit tightly against the other. As the ride progressed, suddenly Rogue piped up, asking the driver to stop even though they were almost there at the mansion. Storm, massaging her widened hips, not really understanding how big they really were, turned a puzzled look to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRogue? Why did you ask the driver to stop? We\u2019re almost home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty Pryde, instead, having seen what had picked the interest of her white streaked friend, eagerly nodded making her chins wobble slightly and her arms too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ororo, since we\u2019re almost there Ah thought maybe we could pick up a donut or two\u2026you know, for later?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fattened, white haired mutant smiled a bit within herself. She didn\u2019t want to be the first to admit it but, even though they had finished lunch just a couple of hours before, was feeling rather famished. Still, trying to be the mother Hen as she usually did, she accepted but adding a remark for her two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but just a couple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the cab was quite the feat for the three newly fattened ladies, yet, after a bit of prodding and pushing, they managed finding themselves short of breaths but right in front of the bakery. Waddling slowly, one by one, they entered the place finding themselves suddenly surrounded by a treasure trove made of sweets and treats. As they waddled toward the counter, though, Professor X was checking on their progress with quite an interested mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I see\u2026No matter that they\u2019ve eaten more than enough to satisfy their normal intake two or three times over. But, they still are growing hungrier yet. Mmm. This must be studied further. I have to try and let themselves go just as they did at the Buffet. <br>\r\nThe more their exterior changes, the more effective will be the results of the experiment. </i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe professor, then, did something he normally wasn\u2019t fond of doing. He entered the mind of the clerk at the shop and imprinted into it the idea that the three new customers were their millionth customers and so they could have all they wanted for, almost, free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the professor did that, he felt his energies dwindle and so had to abruptly cut the link, taking care to rest, while promising himself to check on them as soon as they returned into the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three bloated beauties had managed to reach the counter, although each of them was feeling rather down in energies, so they actually thought that a load on sugary things was just what they needed. But, as they reached the counter, the clerk looked at them and quickly showed them to a table near the counter, while providing, especially for Storm, wide seats for them to seat on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere ladies, have a seat here. You\u2019re our millionth customers of the month so, you\u2019re awarded with a discount of the ninety-five percent to our store wares. Let me know your order and I\u2019ll bring them right here to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn\u2019t make any fuss about it, ordering immediately a dozen jelly filled donuts, followed suit by Rogue which instead went for an extra large milkshake and three pieces out of a chocolate sheet cake. As those two ordered, Ororo tried to contain them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls! We said just a couple of donuts\u2026haven\u2019t you eaten enough already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLighten up, 'Roro\u2026\u201d said Kitty thickly as she massaged her massive belly rolls, anxiously waiting for her order. \u201cIt\u2019s a cheat day, isn\u2019t it? Plus we\u2019ve got this deal they\u2019ve offered to us. If we don\u2019t use it it will be a shame.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026*slurp*\u2026\u201d Reinforced Rogue, as she began drinking from her massive milkshake, her already overburdened belly starting to bloat out eve more. \u201cWe should definitively take advantage of that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her two friends seemed to have gone all hog, Ororo finally decided that if they were to act like pigs, she should then be the one out eating all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026if you put it that way. Sir? May you bring me a Devil\u2019s food cake? No, not a slice. A full cake, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, under the surprised stares of Kitty and Rogue, both girls decided that if that was the game to play, they could compete too. Right after that thought the girls began to guzzle and munch all the way, letting out all they had to show each other that they could eat more. It soon began some sort of competition within them. With Storm taking huge chunks of the cake, smearing her face with it, just as Rogue began to chug milkshake after milkshake, downing them one after another almost as fast as Kitty was downing donut after donuts. As the girls lost themselves once more into their gluttony, their bodies began to expand once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm practically exploded out of her outfit, her pants completely ripped in two, leaving her in her, tighter than ever, panties. And even though her jacket was still, somewhat, wearable the same could not be said for her top. This one had in fact turned into a make-shift bra, pushed up by her quickly bloating, and filling up, belly. Rogue was right beside her, although, since her hourglass shape couldn\u2019t grow much larger, the rest of her seemed to be catching up. Especially her belly that began growing out and about, getting wider and hanging lower on her thighs as she kept clearing whatever was offered to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the real deal was with Kitty. Shadowcat was growing hugely, her already massive stomach seemed to be outgrowing even her diminutive body, filling up on sugar treats as she kept eating and eating. Her overall shape blossomed out soon, with her arms getting fatter and fatter, as bingo wings began to form under her arms and her legs began to bloat out so wide to resemble tree\u2019s trunks. And yet, as if blind to how big the three ladies were getting, the clerk kept bringing more and more from pastries to pies, and even full cakes to each of the lardy ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if a beast had awakened inside their bodies, even though they were starting to feel full, and they heard their clothes ripping apart, not one of them found herself able to stop from having more. Within themselves they reasoned that they were going to have one more pastry, then it became one more slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil they reached the limit at one more cake, just another one and we will stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that limit was reached, even though they were blinded by the mind tricks of Professor X, each of them began to wonder how they could eat so much. Rogue, as she grabbed a Bundt cake from the table, bringing it to her lips, wondered if they were, maybe having too much of it. That didn\u2019t prevent her from consuming it whole, but it still gave her some doubts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, too, was having these issues. Especially since she could feel her ass cheeks overflowing the chair she was seated on, and yet, she almost inhaled the thirty six chocolate glazed donuts that she had been served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Shadowcat, the most gluttonous of them, was having doubts. Not because she couldn\u2019t see her feet anymore, since all that stood within her and the floor was now a round belly, but because her grabby arms were trying futilely to grab at the next sheet cake and she wasn\u2019t even close to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Girls\u2026? I\u2026I think\u2026maybe\u2026we should\u2026stop. Ororo\u2026Rogue\u2026don\u2019t you think\u2026we\u2019ve had\u2026enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Storm felt like rejecting the idea, but, as she felt herself stuffed, once more, over the brim she had to concede, while nodding in defeat as she felt herself getting tired and tired, even though she thought they had to feel pretty energetic with all the confectioneries eaten. Rogue, as she inhaled the last morsel of cake, feeling it slowly travel from her throat into her vastly overburdened stomach, stopped too, while slowly nodding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they rose from the chairs, wobbling all over, they paid what was due and left the place as they began to waddle at a crawl\u2019s pace toward the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026We didn\u2019t\u2026overate\u2026too much\u2026didn\u2019t we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waddled slowly, bloated like overinflated zeppelins, and yet blind to their massively fattened bodies, Rogue was the first to speak, as her tired and breathless voice spoke slowly, whit huge intake of air between each word, almost. Her two friends, in an equally overfilled state, took their time to respond, although only Ororo actually spoke, as Kitty was far too pooped to even speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026don\u2019t\u2026think\u2026so. A\u2026good\u2026night\u2026sleep\u2026 and we'll feel\u2026better\u2026tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they finally managed to enter into the mansion, the three bloated beauties slowly separated to go each in their own bedroom. Rogue, as soon as she was in her room, simply collapsed on her bed, as her body digested the massive amounts of food she had consumed in that day, letting her body slowly deflate quite a bit, while gaining a serious poundage yet.  Kitty did almost the same. As she reached her bedroom she went to her bed and soon fell asleep, as her humongous belly began to shrink once more, spreading the fat gained throughout her entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, even though she felt completely drained of energies, still managed to get into the shower, to clean herself a bit. After both the buffet and the bakery, she had managed to get herself pretty much covered in food stains and frosting. Finally clean, although she noticed to have taken much more time than usual, she finally went to bed letting her body, too, digesting the massive amount of calories received that day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as she began to fall asleep, she realized with a smile that it was nice to let herself go like that, occasionally.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning came and the three friends woke up feeling refreshed and restored. Storm was the first of them to wake up, and to shower herself. While in the shower she inspected her body but, although she felt like she had put on weight, she herself couldn\u2019t see any exterior damage ad so simply discarded the idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth was very different.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheat day she had with her friends had brought quite a few pounds on her frame but her mind, due to Xavier manipulation, wasn\u2019t really able to pick up such changes. And so, Ororo, finished showering and began to put on her clothes, finding out that they were feeling tighter than they had ever been, and yet he didn\u2019t recognize this as a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Must have shrunk in the wash\u2026mmm\u2026yes, that must be it</i>\u2019  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue and Kitty had the same issue and yet, neither could face the issue at hand. Both deciding that it was probably old clothes or washing malfunction that prevented them to wear their clothes properly. One thing all of them shared, though. As if planned, their three bellies began to rumble noisily, asking for food and since it was breakfast time, the three ladies left their rooms and walked toward the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was the first to find out that walking seemed way more tiring than it ever was, still, she marched on although her chubby belly wobbled at her every step making her feel weird, especially so since she couldn\u2019t see it herself. Rogue, instead, seeing that walking was definitely a chore, lifted herself into the air and began to float slowly through the hallways. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was the one that had gained the most between them, while Ororo had a small potbelly and a wider ass, and Rogue seemed to bring out an inflated hourglass shape, Shadowcat had apparently gained almost everything in her overall form making her squishier and softer in her body and on all of her appendages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so that when she tried to leave her room, she found herself unable to pass through the door without a hitch. Having instead to use her powers to phase through it, as she also did when she realized she would have to walk all the way to the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short time, the three ladies met in the kitchen and, as soon as they were there, each of them received dubious, and one interested, stare from the other X-Men there with them. As Jean Grey cooked and prepared breakfast, dutifully helped by Wolverine, the other X-Men whispered among themselves as they watched their three friends come into the kitchen looking rather zaftig than what they usually appeared. Cyclops was the first to try and break the ice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOroro, Kitty? Do you\u2026Do you feel alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean, Scott? I feel great today\u2026a bit hungry, but still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, Cyclops\u2026Me and Storm are feeling wonderfully. It\u2019s such a good morning\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat I meant is\u2026err...Have you gai\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSCOTT! Could you come over here and give me a hand, please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean interrupted Cyclops and forced him to leave the question at that, as Ororo, Kitty and Rogue shared a wondering stare, as they waited for the breakfast to be prepared and served.  Cyclops though wasn\u2019t the only one who had noticed the additional inches on each of them, and yet, every time somebody tried to make a remark about their figures, Jean was there shushing them up. In a short while, although most had tried to say something the three friends had remained as clueless as they had been waking up, what they noticed was that Jean seemed to act a bit strangely toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost half an hour, as their other friends had left, one by one, in the kitchen there was only Jean and the three chubby ladies. The psyker then, finished preparations and soon left quite the platter to each of the three friends, leaving each one of them stupefied by the sheer mass of food awaiting them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro looked in disbelief as she had in her plate six donuts, two slice of shortcake a couple of muffins and some milkshakes. She tried to politely refuse but, after being rebuked that breakfast was important, she didn\u2019t discuss it anymore and went at her meal with gusto. Rogue, instead, was facing a junk food fest in her plate. In fact, Jean had left in front of her four hotdogs drenched in ketchup and mayo, two cheeseburgers and two massive double decker hamburgers, all of this accompanied by three XL sodas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rogue tried to replay, jean simply shaked her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou need your carbs to start the day in the right way.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, instead, was the only one who accepted her platter without a fuss, as she received it from Jean she simply dived in with gusto, enjoying the two bowls of fried chicken, the massive mound of fried bacon strips and the surrounding fried chips. <br>\r\nAs Jean watched the three girls going at it at the massive, unhealthy, breakfast, she couldn\u2019t stop herself from feeling excited. It had been always a fantasy of hers to be able to cater to girthier people and now, with Storm, Rogue and Kitty growing themselves to that size, she couldn\u2019t help but assist them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Breakfast was over, as Jean cleaned the dishes and left the three bloated beauties to recover, the three friends tried to discuss what they were going to do in that day. Kitty, although appearing the most exhausted by the meal just consumed was the first who piped up and proposed to return to the All You Can Eat Buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI tell you, guys\u2026We should totally go there\u2026it was so good\u2026and the\u2026discount! We\u2019ve gotta accept it\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro moved slowly the head from side to side, as she massaged her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026*urp*\u2026We went yesterday...since it was a \u2026 cheat day. We can\u2019t\u2026 go back there\u2026today\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, as she stifled burp after burp, having downed her three sodas almost one after the other, was having difficulties to speak but, as she managed to release some more gas, she joined the discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m with\u2026Kitty this time\u2026\u2019Roro. We\u2019ll\u2026just have\u2026a bite to eat\u2026and return. No big\u2026Deal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their discussion progressed, Professor X tuned in on them to see their progress and was ecstatic to see them talking about food, right after such a massive meal. For a moment he thought about the strange behavior of Jean but in the end, he let it at that. There was going to be time to investigate in that direction. Now he wanted to focus on his three test subjects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, by sending out subliminal messages, he eroded Storm defenses, making her more susceptible to side with what the majority of the group decided to do, while he also increased Rogue confidence in her superior genetics, as well as boosting up Kitty\u2019s desire for more. In this way, his three guinea pigs surely would have gone down the path that he wanted them to pick. Exiting from their minds he stood silently around them, watching as the discussion proceeded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Said Storm \u201cWe either go to the buffet\u2026or we go to the mall and, after, to the buffet, is that correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, already licking her lips, nodded eagerly. No matter that her bloated belly almost touched the table, she was already feeling hungry for more and, although she wondered what would happen if she asked Jean to prepare her something, she also wanted to go straight away to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much so she could barely wait her friends to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, thought about it for a bit. She had been against returning to the buffet so soon, for one this was no cheat day and then, she was afraid that even with her heritage, her genes couldn\u2019t resist much more food before turning her into a fattie.  Poor Storm, if only she could see herself. Right after her meal, her belly and hips had already gained a few more inches and yet, she was blind to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the idea to go back to the buffet was also enthralling. The food there had been so good that she still seemed to remember the taste of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was the second most decided of them, she too wanted to go back at the buffet. She had noticed that her girls seemed to have grown larger since her last visit and was clearly excited by the prospect. Although she had still the no touching issue, having curves on her otherwise lean body, couldn\u2019t be but a plus, in her book.  Still, as much as she wanted, she also wanted to try and go to the mall, to try and see if something interesting was there to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls digested their meals they had almost reached a decision when, suddenly, Jean appeared at the doorway with a smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girls! I see you\u2019re still here\u2026How about I prepare you a mid-morning snack? You girls may need the energy if you wanna go out again today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this new proposition hung in the air, the girls decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment of thinking of the new proposition, Kitty, Storm and Rogue all decided to stay under Jean's care for the morning, then hit the mall for the afternoon and then the buffet for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jean. We shall take this mid-morning snack.\" Ororo decided with a smile as Kitty and Rogue both nodded in agreement. Jean smiled as she then set to work, preparing the 'snack' for her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she returned with the first few trays for the trio. For Kitty, she had whipped up a massive stack of flapjacks drenched in maple syrup and butter, a heap of chocolate doughnuts, a huge pile of bacon and a tall glass of chocolate milk. Upon seeing it, Kitty's tongue practically flopped out of her mouth and she began drooling at the sight. The second Jean had placed it in front of her, Kitty tore into the unhealthy breakfast foods. First, to Jean, Rogue and Ororo's shock, she crammed five doughnuts into her mouth, followed by six flapjacks, bulging her cheeks out a great deal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a few quick and loud chews, Shadowcat then swallowed the entire mouthful of food with a long, loud gulp, the giant bulge sliding down her neck. Then, she chugged half her chocolate milk down, gaining a milk moustache on her upper lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's yours Rogue.\" Jean smiled as she gave the southern belle her massive tray. Rogue moaned in delight. Hers had several jumbo burgers drenched in grease, along with fried chicken, five slices of Jean's homemade chocolate cake and a heap of corn dogs. Rogue immediately tore into her snack as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for you, 'Roro...\" beamed Jean brightly as she handed Ororo her massive tray. Ororo's eyes nearly popped out of her head at it. Because on this tray was five massive double decker cheeseburgers, ten normal hamburgers, six slices of apple pie and a XXXL soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean I could not possibly-\" Ororo began gently. \"Ororo, I'm hurt. I thought you would enjoy such a nice meal. After all, you did just eat six doughnuts, a couple of muffins, two slices of shortcake and some milkshakes.\" Jean said, clearly dismayed by her friend's clear attempt to turn down her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, blushing slightly as she realized Jean had a point, nodded and then started inhaling her food as well, causing Jean to smile as she watched the trio keep eating like beasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was busy loudly inhaling her food, getting chocolate frosting, grease and syrup on her face as she did, her belly bloating more and more with each bite. Not that it mattered to Shadowcat. The youngest X-Man just burped and hiccupped as she kept it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue wasn't any different. She tore through her burgers with ease, grease and ketchup dribbling down her chin, only for her to lick it up upon feeling this. After licking the plate her burgers had been on clean, Rogue then grabbed six corn dogs in each hand and then plopped them into her mouth at once, chewing loudly, her cheeks bulging as her belly also slowly bloated out as she then plopped a plump slice of her cake in as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, meanwhile, was also going to town on her feast. Instead of eating her massive double decker burgers in normal or large bites, she simply stuffed them whole into her mouth, one at a time before she chewed and swallowed them. The same went for her pie and normal hamburgers as she inhaled those, her brown belly also starting to bloat and plump up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this meal, Jean brought them more food. Kitty received a tray filled to the brim with 6 slices each of apple, blueberry, cherry, raspberry, pumpkin and banana cream pie, 9 slices of chocolate cake and red velvet cake respectively, three double decked burgers and 10 large, warm and gooey chocolate chip cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue meanwhile, received 20 triple cheeseburgers, 15 large soft pretzels, 17 cupcakes and 22 ham sandwiches on white bread with tomato, cheese, pickles, relish and mayo with an olive on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was given a large banana split with four bananas, 10 scoops each of strawberry, vanilla and chocolate ice cream, a big spray of whipped cream, a generous helping of hot fudge topping and a plump cherry on top, a whole Devil's pound cake, 2 trays of chocolate eclairs and a big bowl of butterscotch pudding.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the three X-Ladies leaned back in their chairs, stuffed and very happy. Jean then approached them with a wide grin. \"Had enough for now?\" she asked as she eyed the licked clean plates and trays in front of her friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* Yeah... Jean. I'm... stuf-urp-fed.\" Kitty groaned after burping loudly while patting her round belly, which gurgled quietly under her blue blouse. Out of the trio, she was once again the bigger bellied. She had put on some weight around her body again as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm with Kitty, Jean. Ah think Ah'd explode if Ah eat anything else right now.\" Rogue agreed, stroking her bloated tummy with a chubby hand, occasionally burping slightly, her cheeks bulging as she cover her mouth with her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... are... both... right... Jean... I am so... full... wild horses... could not... move... me...\" Ororo panted in agreement as she massaged her own big, squishy, warm and soft brown boulder sized gut.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear it. Since you three seem pooped, why don't you rest before going to the mall?\" Jean suggested with a kind smile as she began clearing the plates, bowls and trays away using her telekinesis to do this chore.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty didn't need to be told twice. She rested her head on her arms and began snoring softly. Rogue just leaned back and closed her eyes, smacking her lips slightly while nodding off herself. Storm just smiled at her two bloated friends and teammates as she mimicked Kitty and, resting her head on her soft, flabby and squishy arms, fell asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean smiled as she watched the trio sleep off their massive 'snacks'. She was excited to see how big they were getting every time they ate and she couldn't wait to keep feeding them. Especially Kitty. Out of the trio, Shadowcat seemed to be the biggest eater. Of course, that was probably her metabolism growing like her body and thus needing more food for fuel, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Kitty really seems the most interested in eating until she either pops like a balloon or is sick to her tummy. Feeding her is going to be rather fun. Of course, I wouldn't exactly put Rogue and/or Ororo out to pasture either</i>.\" Jean thought to herself as she watched her snoring friends, their new fat going to other areas of their bodies yet again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, Jean woke the trio up and, after they stretched and yawned, they went to change their clothes to go to the mall. This, of course, was easier said than done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her and Illyana's bedroom, Kitty struggled to get into a pair of jeans that could fit her hippo butt and hips. After five pairs all failed, she just tugged on a pair of stretchy sweatpants that were okay to wear in public. She just barely managed to squeeze herself into a t-shirt before going downstairs to wait for her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue wasn't fairing much better. Her boobs had swollen considerably both overnight and during her nap and so most of her bras were pretty small. Finally, she managed to squeeze them somewhat comfortably into a bra that still worked well. After going through the same ordeal with her shirts and pants, Rogue finally managed to squeeze into a pair of jeans and a tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was having the same trouble. Most of her leather clothes were too tight or pinched her fat somewhat painfully. Finally, Ororo just pulled on her original pair from that morning and walked downstairs to see Kitty and Rogue's own clothing problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we may need to pay a visit to a clothes store at the mall.\" Storm simply said as the younger two X-Ladies nodded in agreement. \"They probably just shrunk in the wash and we didn't notice it.\" Kitty shrugged, still oblivious to her and her friends' girths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the taxi Storm had called to take them into the city arrived and the girls squeezed into the back together. Not long after, they pulled up to the New Salem Mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls quickly went to the nearest plus-sized store and after a while, came out in new, larger clothes. Kitty wore an XXXL blue t-shirt, plus-sized jeans, bigger panties and an also bigger bra. Rogue and Storm had also picked out larger clothes of their likings as well and were currently wearing one set. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had on a nice plus-sized t-shirt, along with large pants and a bigger bra. Despite the dangers of her wearing a t-shirt, Rogue decided as long as no one touched her, she'd be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, meanwhile, had chosen a larger version of her current leather costume and clothes in general. Though a sliver of her belly was still visible, her new black shirt covered it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another hour of walking around the mall, the girls swung by the food court. After choosing a table, the trio sat their bags down and then began ordering from different booths. Soon, the trio staggered back to their table, carrying numerous takeout trays containing pizza, fried chicken, burgers, fries, milkshakes, sodas, Chinese takeout, and others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter scarfing those down, the trio headed home to get ready for their night at the buffet. After squeezing into their snug uniforms, the trio climbed into another cab and soon arrived at the buffet. Upon entering, they were greeted by the same waiter from the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies. Welcome back. I trust you have come to back for more of our fine food, correct? Also, have you thought about the discount we offered you yesterday?\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Storm and Rogue had talked about it over the ride and Kitty had finally convinced Ororo of the discount's usefulness. As the waiter listened, the trio accepted the offer. \"Splendid! Now, follow me.\" He smiled as he led them to a different area of the restaurant. </span></div></div>",

Kitty, Rogue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited for her friends she tried to look as inconspicuous as possible. It wasn\u2019t she didn\u2019t like Jean it was only that she didn\u2019t trust her own senses around the woman. At the buffet, at least, she could use her will to stop eating if she was going to eat too much. Kitty and Rogue, seeing Ororo standing up looked at each other for a moment, until each decided what to do for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing \u2018Roro!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh think Ah\u2019ll pass guys\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue herself was surprised in hearing herself saying that. She had wanted to go to the buffet once more but, after hearing Jean and knowing that the woman was as lean as her, she thought that maybe she could give her some advice on how to grow more voluptuous. Kitty and Ororo, too, seemed shocked for a moment but, without wasting any time, they simply accepted their friend's decision and moved on toward their decided location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Storm and Shadowcat, although feeling quite snug in their uniforms, left the mansion opting to take a cab to go at the buffet, Rogue remained seated in the kitchen, watching interested as Jean slaved away at the stove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Rogue\u2026I see that there is someone here who knows how a proper diet has to be followed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well\u2026 To tell you the truth Ah wanted to go too but, Ah think you could help me with something\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, as she cooked, turned an intrigued stare toward the bloated mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see, Ah\u2019m tryin' to get some more curves on mah lean body and, since you\u2019ve got a perfect shape Ah thought\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay no more. I\u2019ll coach you and you\u2019ll see that you\u2019ll be the most curvaceous girl in the mansion. I so vow it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Jean quickly grabbed a plate and, after having it filled with a dozen donuts and a few pastries, slid it in front of Rogue, inviting her to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, Rogue, I\u2019ll help you achieve your dream as much as I can but you\u2019ll have to do what I tell you. You will need lots of carbs, proteins and some sugar for this to work so, leave the cooking to me and dig in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, seeing as the other woman seemed to take her request so seriously, decided to follow her new Curve-Coach directives and, without further ado, began to chow down on the plate she had in front of her. As she munched on the donuts she realized that Jean had to be a great cook, cause those were the best she had ever tasted. As she cleared treat after treat, unnoticing of how her belly seemed to bloat out more at her every bite, she saw that more was soon going to come as Jean was already placing in a plate a few burgers and even a steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>Jean seems to know what she\u2019s doing\u2026Ah better follow what she tells me to do\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ororo and Kitty had just left the cab which had brought them to the buffet they loved. Upon entering, a little surprised it was already open by mid-morning, they were greeted by one of the waiters, which recognized them almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, welcome back. I see you\u2019ve come to enjoy our fine foods once more, isn\u2019t it? Well, that\u2019s truly good. As you can see there is already a few people in here but, we will find you the perfect table for you all. On and, by the way, have you thought about the discount offer we\u2019ve proposed yesterday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm and Kitty had discussed it during the trip and, finally, Kitty managed to convince Ororo about the usefulness of the offer. So, as the waiter accompanied them toward a table close to the buffets, and within range of the finishing beltways, they both accepted their offer, making sure that also her missing friend, Rogue, was inserted into the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSplendid! Now, here\u2019s your table. Should you need anything, please to let us know. Enjoy your meal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the waiter moved off, Kitty was already standing and closing in toward the buffet, under the stupefied gaze of Ororo. Still, spurred by her Kitten's actions, also she rose from the table and moved closer to the buffets, searching for something that intrigued her. After a few minutes, both girls returned to their table, each with her fair share of plates. Kitty was first with just a couple of plates filled with apple fritters and a smallish tray with buttery cookies and a tall glass of chocolate milk. Ororo, instead, returned with two small trays filled by \u00e9clairs and jelly filled donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls seated, both began enjoying the food, unaware that the kitchen staff had been already informed by the owner and filled each of their portions with appetite stimulant and metabolism suppressors. As the two mutants ate with abandon, each could feel her own hunger rising the more she ate. Until both stopped tasting their food but simply swallowed it as fast as they could. Leaving their plates almost licked clean, both Ororo and Kitty shared a look of ravenous hunger and, same as before, both rose from their seats to fill their plates once more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs time passed both girls made trip after trip toward the buffet lines, bringing more and more food each and every time they rose, due to this their uniforms, already snug to begin with began to get tighter and tighter across their bodies. Storm, as she had already a dozen plates under her belt, could feel her pants cutting tightly in her mid-section, so much so she began to unfasten her belt and opening them up, to give her growing belly more and more room to expand. Kitty, instead, didn\u2019t seemed fazed by the fact that her uniform was stretching out to accommodate her bloating figure. She was feeling so ravenous that even when the spandex like cloth began to tear at her belly button, she still kept shoveling food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the mansion, Rogue wasn\u2019t faring much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder Jean care, for the last two hours, she had kept eating whatever the other woman brought to her, making short work of burgers, hot dogs and chicken wings by the pound as Jean seemed an indefatigable cooking machine. The once lean mutant was looking quite bloated already, her belly ballooning out under her very eyes and yet, as she was presented with yet another platter, this time  filled with ribs almost submerged in BBQ sauce, she still leaned forward to munch at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was feeling ecstatic. Rogue seemed to be insatiable, and yet, she knew that sooner or later she had to slow down. Otherwise all that her growing buddy had eaten was going to be wasted when she would feel sick. But, for sure, she was going to give her another round of burgers before stopping. And then, maybe, it could be the case to use the special medicine she had bought just for similar cases?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, instead, was already feeling quite sated, and yet she kept going, knowing that Jean had only the best interests toward her. Still, as she cleared ribs after ribs, she couldn\u2019t lie to herself that she wasn\u2019t enjoying all that food. In truth, it wasn\u2019t as good as the one from the buffet but, it still was good enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept going, her belly still bloated up more and more, already filling her lap and starting to mash against the table, as her uniform too began to stretch way too much and a slight sound of stitches under pressure could barely be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter countless trips to the buffet line, both Kitty and Ororo were feeling stuffed and pooped, and yet, both were still quite famished. Their figures had bloated out even more, with Storm almost bursting out of her clothes. For which she decided to get her jacket off, leaving herself with just her top, now used mostly as a bra, and her pants, left wide open with her belly pooching over it. The African beauty had lost count of how many plates she had consumed. Last number she remembered had been plate sixteen. Yet, as full as she was feeling, she still felt a powerful hunger begging her to get more food. But she was way too tired to simply move from her seat. Her body had, once again ballooned in every direction, although her hips and ass seemed to have absorbed the most from her meal. Already she was slightly overflowing the chair on which she was seated, and her hands were rather busy kneading and massaging the large, bloated, belly that protruded in front of her.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty wasn\u2019t faring any better, she was even in worse condition. Last plate she remembered taking was plate twenty-three, but after that her hunger had been too much to control and she soon found herself in a whirlwind of gluttony that now left her speechless, breathless and as mobile as a beached whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suit had ripped apart all around her midsection, leaving her bare belly to jut forward, filled up to the max with delicious, fattening food, and yet, she too was feeling still rather famished for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the two bloated la(r)dies were unable to move, one of the waiters approached providing a solution to their problems\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ororo and Kitty were hungry but could not manage to move an inch of their bodies. Not even for a moment this event worried them, as they both were too filled up with food to think clearly but, as much as stuffed they were, they still were hungry for more. Which was quite a predicament for they couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the waiters, though, seeing as the two that their boss wanted to get as round as possible, noticed the situation they were in and moved closer to them to propose a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLadies, I see you\u2019ve enjoyed your meal\u2026but are you done or would you rather keep going after a breather?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-More\u2026still\u2026so hungry\u2026but, so\u2026tired\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Storm was surprised by how easily and rapidly she had answered back to the waiter and yet, it was the truth. Kitty, opposite to her, couldn\u2019t answer but, as she hiccupped, she nodded in agreement to her friend statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ladies, since you\u2019re Special Guest, we have a solution to your problems. A few of my colleagues will help you go to a private room we have in the back. There, you shall be able to continue your meal without the need to move a finger. Would that be ok with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls nodded, a fleet of young waiters moved toward them, assisting them into standing and accompanying them toward the private room where they could resume their meal. As the two were moved away, the main waiter looked at them and wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>They\u2019re already this big and it\u2019s only lunch time\u2026True, for the most part is bloating but\u2026how big will they get in the feeding room?</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mansion, Rogue was feeling just as her friends were at the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was stuffed full, completely filled up to the gills, and yet, Jean was still seemingly cooking more. The once lean, now resembling more of a ball with arms and legs, mutant, could only stare with desperation as the other woman kept preparing more and more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jean\u2026? I\u2026I think\u2026I\u2019ve had\u2026enuff\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other woman though seemed deaf to her pleads, until she turned around and cleaned away the last remnants of the massive midmorning \u2018snack\u2019 she had provided to her friend, which had lasted up to almost lunchtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I know Rogue. You silly, we can\u2019t have you eating all the time...\" '<i>For now, at least)</i>' \"...You may rest a bit and take a nap\u2026I\u2019ll wake you up as soon as its lunch time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing those words Rogue blessedly fell almost immediately asleep, but as she slept away her humongous meal, Jean moved closer to the bloated heroine, caressing her filled up body, where the suit hadn\u2019t ripped yet. As she inspected her friend, heavily snoring, Jean wondered dreamily at how larger and girthier she could manage to make her before she would realize it. In truth, she had a way to ensure Rogue growth but, she was afraid of using it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u2018<i>I could use those drugs I bought\u2026But would it be fair? And yet, when another occasion like this could present itself to me?<br>\r\nIf I don\u2019t use it now, when will I?<br>\r\nNo, there isn\u2019t time to be picky. Don\u2019t worry Rogue, will manage to bring you blimp sized before you may have time to say Cake\u2026</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, then, as she kept preparing the lunch she had promised Rogue, while making sure that their fellows X-Men weren\u2019t going to intrude on them, she simply added a few drops of one of the drugs she had brought on the black market, this being a powerful appetite enhancer. The other, she had acquired through a common enough store, being bulk-up powder to be used through gain shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs lunchtime approached, barely an hour later, Jean began to sweetly prod Rogue awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWakey, wakey. It\u2019s time for Lunch, AnneMarie\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm\u2026How much\u2026have I\u2026slept?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue felt groggy and, still, a bit stuffed. Yet, her stomach getting used to be fed such massive portions, already began to grumble a bit asking to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean smiled innocently and, shamelessly, lied to her friend, telling her that she had slept way over the real thirty minutes that it had been, then, without further ado, she began giving to her widening friend what was going to be only nominally considered lunch. The woman began by leaving a plate with two Double Bacon Cheeseburgers, with bacon and fries to the side, along with two tall glasses of shakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go, Rogue. You may start with this\u2026I\u2019ll bring next course in a few.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, shaking away the last of her grogginess, leaned forward and, feeling more comfortable, she moved closer to the plate and grabbed the first double burger with both hands, giving it a big bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the enhancer went to work within her system and Rogue felt herself growing hungrier and hungrier by the bite. She still, didn\u2019t worry though. Between the subliminal orders from Professor X and the fact that at the buffet she had felt the same, she didn\u2019t worry herself about it. Preferring instead to simply let her hunger and gluttony drive her from there. Jean kept providing plateful after plateful, slightly increasing the portions she was giving to her friend, and yet Rogue kept cleaning each and every plate she received. Her body working overtime to process all those calories it was receiving, quickly storing them as fat in order to speed up the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue\u2019s body seemed to literally balloon as more and more food went eaten, her hourglass figure quickly changing in a more rounding shape. Sure her breast and ass still were growing massively but, her belly too had begun growing larger and larger. Her ass soon began to overflow the chair she was seated on, while her breasts started to move to either side of her, pushed away by the dome of a belly she was getting. Jean, seeing this development, began to try cooking faster and faster, wanting to enjoy the show as much as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the buffet, instead, both Storm and Kitty had been finally moved to their special private room, this one was as luxurious as it could be. Extremely comfortable couches, massive stout tables, there were even two massive 52\u201d flat screens, one in front of each of the girls. Both girls were ecstatic about the location but, as their hungry bellies rumbled, they still were feeling quite hungry. Yet the waiters quickly positioned them on a massive, comfortable, couch and soon left, replaced by a few guys dressed as chef\u2019s which moved closer to the two ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one closest to Kitty, brought forward an iPad, on which there was represented which way the meal was going to be served. As Kitty scrolled through the menus, her new double chin slightly squished against the other, she finally decided to go with the option called \u2018\u00e0 la carte\u2019 which meant that food was going to be brought to her by one of the waiters there, until she asked for it to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, which also was checking through a similar booklet, was undecided. Each choice seemed good but, in the end, her belly decided for her. With a grumbling sound louder than the usual, her finger stopped on the \u2018Beltway\u2019 method. <br>\r\nAt that, Storm\u2019s waiter nodded and in no time a portable mechanical beltway was mounted and directed toward the African mutant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her was given a small remote through which she could select the speed of the belt transporter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, both girls began to go back at their meals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, quickly cleaned plateful after plateful, almost uncaring toward what was brought to her. Her waiter moved each plate to her, letting her clean it out completely before getting a new one from a trolley stationed nearby. Shadowcat suit\u2019s began to rip more and more, tearing apart not only at her mid-section but also at her thighs, as her entire body was seemingly filling up. And yet, the girl couldn\u2019t stop herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger she felt was pushing her to have more and more, as she started to act more and more piggishly, with smears of food on her face and uneaten bits falling on her bloating breasts and belly. Her plates soon began to be overfilled with fried up concoctions of chickens, burgers, sausages. At a certain point even ice creams and cakes that were given to her had been previously fried, granting them this crunchy fried cover to their cold insides. Kitty enjoyed each plate to the fullest and seemed unstoppable in her consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, instead, at first had started to regret her chosen method. Food was brought forward though the transporter directly into her mouth, all she had to do was to open up her lips and munch and swallow. Yet, also she was making a mess of herself, with bits of food falling all over her breasts and shoulders. That happened until a waiter noticed and simply adjusted the output of the transporter, making so that it would go perfectly into Storm open mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that point, the weather controlling mutant simply abandoned herself to the pleasure of filling her gut up, feeling her hunger getting sated and, yet, increased at her every bite. As Kitty was filling out nicely, getting herself quite rounded, Ororo was getting fuller mostly in her ass and hips, as they began to grow wider and larger, as more calories entered her body. But she didn\u2019t care or noticed, all of her focus was on the next mouthful she was receiving, be it a massive triple patty hamburger, a whole pizza pie, in slices, or even a massive cake. As she gulped down each item, she could almost feel it heaviness falling int her overfilled gut, rapidly being converted into fat to make room for more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rogue seemed to wake up suddenly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast thing she remembered was to be in the kitchen where her friend Jean was helping her with her lunch. Now, though she found herself in an empty, endless, hall. Everything in there was of a pristine white and yet, it was a place that gave her serene and peaceful thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around, she suddenly spotted a figure walking toward her. She blinked several times noticing it was the Professor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cProfessor? Is that you? Ah can\u2019t believe it\u2026where are we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRogue, relax. I have invited you into my own mind. This is a place of peace. I sensed that you were starting to worry about something and so I decided to bring you here so that we can talk about it in privacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026Ah don\u2019t know wha\u2019 you are talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you do, Rogue. I can see it in you. There is this fear\u2026this worrying within you. Tell me all about it. I will help you as much as I can.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnneMarie, slowly began to open herself up. The Professor was saying the truth. She was worried about something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAh\u2026Ah know you\u2019re right. I\u2026I\u2019m afraid of mah body. I can feel mahself getting\u2026bigger. And more body means more danger\u2026for me.\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure of the professor laughed a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThere is nothing to be worried about, Rogue. Just listen to my voice\u2026you\u2019re not growing\u2026you\u2019re just skin and bones\u2026 Why worry about such foolish things\u2026be merry\u2026eat freely\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue could do nothing to stop the psionic assault, her mind was suddenly invaded by these images of her living a happy life, in a fit and toned body, enjoying whatever pleasure there was to be taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the real world, though, Jean stared deeply at her friend sitting at the table. She was the one using her abilities to convince the southern belle that nothing was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat everything was ok, and still the southern girl, submitting to the mental assault, kept gorging at whatever there was in front of her. AnneMarie, completely subdued by the psionic attack to her mind, began to see what the figure of the professor was saying to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAh\u2026Ah understan\u2019. Ain\u2019t got no need to starve mahself\u2026Ah\u2019m in perfect shape\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Rogue\u2026you can freely move\u2026you don\u2019t have any issue with your body\u2026eat and be merry.<br>\r\nNow\u2026Open your eyes and see the truth surrounding you\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the figure said that, Rogue felt herself being grabbed and moved away from the empty, endless, white room. Blinking her eyes repeatedly she found herself back in the kitchen, between her hands a massive triple bacon cheeseburger, half eaten as a morsel was still in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing she looked around for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Jean busily cooking something at the stove, she saw the table in front of her still covered in plates and platters full of foodstuffs, there were hot dogs covered in ketchup and mayo, burgers as big and stuffed as the one she was eating, mounds of fried bacon strips, alongside with deeply fried onion rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, there was still more on the back of the table, in the forms of minced meat pies, blueberry pies, even a massive three-layered devil\u2019s-food cake. As she grabbed an extra-large milkshake at her side, slurping out half of its content in one sitting, she wondered since how long she was there sitting at the table but, it didn\u2019t matter in truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Moving back her chair, she slowly managed to stand up, her bloated body jiggling and wobbling at her every movement. Yet she managed, albeit slowly and, on a whim, she moved closer to Jean, hugging her from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Rogue? What\u2019s\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing\u2026Ah just feel like Ah\u2019m a new woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, was only feigning surprise. She knew what her southern friend was thinking, she had been into her mind, after all. As she watched AnneMarie waddle around, a smile on her fattened face, she gave herself a pat on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>I was right. The mind is stronger than the body. Now that Rogue is utterly convinced of being toned and fit, she won\u2019t have any issue in moving around\u2026whatever her weight is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, she may be moving a bit slower but, she will move and walk. Now, I only need to let her grow some more\u2026she could use to put on a few more pounds.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026Good for you! Now, get back at your seat\u2026there\u2019s still so much more for you to have, before finishing lunch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAye Aye, Ma\u2019am!\u201d Replied Rogue laughing a bit as she waddled back to her chair, plopping down and returning to stuffing herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she grabbed the half-eaten burger and bit off half to eat, smearing her face with grease and sauce, and yet she munched on it happily, even though her inflated gut grumbled angrily as it tried to digest the massive calorie influx it was receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, at the Buffet, Ororo and Kitty had completely lost the sense of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls were still gorging on the food brought to them, their bodies showing exactly how long they had been at it. Kitty had been moved to a couch, as the waiters kept bringing her delicious plates rich of heavy calories placing such platters and bowls directly onto Shadowcat's torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm instead was still seated under the automatic beltway she had chosen, although the food coming from it had switched from fast food to pastries and small cakes. The African super mutant actually was enjoying more these kinds of treats, they were often so small she could simply swallow them whole without wasting time on chewing, letting then her stomach to work on them, making room for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mutants were in an eating trance, their bodies were so stuffed and full and yet, the taste of the food, and the enhancer hidden within it, were forcing them to keep asking for more, even though their own bodies were seemingly at their limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles Xavier, although still in the mansion, was there with them, soothing them, whispering to them suggestions, making them forget about trifling things like duty and the need to stay fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis powerful abilities were being used to change both girls, to make them more pliable to become what he needed for his project. And so, he kept pouring his powers over them, forcing them to believe completely in what he was saying to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>You are at your top physical form. There is no gorging, this is only snacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can freely move, there is no weight keeping you down. Yet, you\u2019re hungry for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need more. You deserve it.</i>\u2019 <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe knew that his pupil, Jean, was doing a similar job to Rogue and, although normally he would have reprimanded her for that, he didn\u2019t say anything. It was all in benefit of his experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his powerful suggestion, both girls kept stuffing themselves, without a worry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when Kitty\u2019s costume completely ripped apart, leaving her bloated gut completely visible, she didn\u2019t seem to mind that much. All she was focused on was the next platter that one of the waiters was bringing her. A massive Thanksgiving turkey surrounded all around by deliciously fried potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit slowly, she managed to snatch one of the legs as she began to tear chunks of meat from the bone, moaning in pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was in a similar situation. With the new suggestions received she actually managed to lift herself from the chair on which she was seated, although her massive ass and widened hips forced her to move at a slower pace than what she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, although her pants had completely ripped from the thighs down, leaving her wearing a sort of Daisy Dukes shorts, she completely ignored that as she placed herself more comfortably on the ground, using her own fattened ass as a cushion, while she opened her mouth wide to get as much pastries she could from the beltway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiters surrounding them were all watching mesmerized the spectacle in front of them. Each of them had had his, or her, share of gluttonous clients but, seeing the two bloated beauties with their bellies bloated and stuffed so tightly, that more than resembled overfilled balloons, as they kept stuffing themselves was a shockingly experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach waiter, though, knew that the one rule of the place was to let their guest leave only when completely stuffed and so they kept bringing more and more toward the girls. As one, a couple of waiters, decided to join in the action, moving each closer to one for the two ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty was devouring the left breast of the turkey, she suddenly found a large spoon, filled with mashed potatoes in her way. Without even thinking she simply opened her mouth, still full of turkey meat, and let the spoon feed her the potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trend continued for quite a while, even when the turkey was completely cleaned, and a large taco was brought to her lips. Right beside this treat, a handful of fries was being shoveled into her mouth, and yet she accepted the gift heartily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm too was seeing this happening to her, as she was just sitting there, mouth open, swallowing pastries from the beltway, a waiter approached her and pushed into her mouth a whole slice of cake, forcing her to swallow more and more frequently than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder such a deluge of treats it was obvious that\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty and Storm couldn't really hold much more food in their very big bellies. Storm's face was smeared with frosting, crumbs and glaze from the pastries she'd been eating. Her belly resembled a big boulder as it hung over her shorts, rumbling and gurgling quietly as she rubbed and messaged it. She had never felt so stuffed in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, was feeling just as full and stuffed. Her belly was full from all the wonderful fattening and greasy food she had been given to eat. She sat there, her tongue lolling out as she panted and burped, a big, goofy grin of delight on her face as her tummy rumbled and gurgled in approval of her fattening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mansion, Rogue was feeling very pooped out from the feast Jean had given her. Her belly was just as swollen as Storm and Kitty's and it was very happy from being stuffed. Jean, who was cleaning up the kitchen by now, turned to notice a droopy-eyed Rogue yawning loudly as she sat in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you take a nap, Rogue? It'll help you regain your strength.\" She suggested with a smile. \"Okay, Jean.\" Rogue said as she let out a giant yawn and slowly rested her head on her arms on the table and was soon snoring softly. The redheaded telepath smiled as she turned the lights off and left the kitchen, leaving the obese southern gal snoring peacefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty and Ororo were waddling to the entrance of the buffet, being aided by two waiters. Ororo had contacted the cab from before to bring them back to the mansion and it was already waiting for them. The waiter from before smiled at the duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you again ladies. I hope to see you again, next time with your friend.\" He added with a grin as he saw them off. Ororo turned and smiled at him. \"I'm sure she will be glad to accompany us then. Thank you again for a delightful meal.\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, grinning in delight, nodded excitedly. \"Yeah. Thanks for all that food! It was really *UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRPPPP!*  yummy in my big tummy!\" she smiled as she put a hand on her massive gut. The waiter smiled at the 14-year-old's antics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was our pleasure, young lady. Have a safe trip home and enjoy your evening.\" He told them as Kitty and Storm slowly managed to climb into the cab, this one much roomier than the one from the night before. The duo didn't say anything as the cab drove them home. They just sat there, smiling in delight as they digested their massive meals all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in his office, Professor X smiled as he had mentally tracked the trio's progress. Though he knew he would likely need to end the experiment soon before the trio really did become too obese to even move, he wanted to try one more thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that while the trio were able to eat massive amounts of food every meal, he noticed that they still needed to stop every so often to use the bathroom, forcing them to delay finishing their meals until this was taken care of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There must be someway for me to help them in this regard</i>.\" He thought to himself as he mentally viewed the cab bringing  Kitty and Ororo to the mansion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he smiled as an idea came to him. \"<i>Of course. It is so simple, I nearly overlooked it! I will advise them to do so in the morning as they wake up</i>.\" Xavier thought with a grin as he wheeled into his room to get ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main hallway, Kitty and Ororo had just entered the mansion. Both of them were smiling as they kept rubbing their large bellies. \"Man, that was great, 'Roro. But I'm really pooped now.\" Kitty remarked with a large yawn as she stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree Kitten. Besides, it is fairly late. We'd better get some rest now.\" Storm said with a big yawn of her own as they both waddled to their rooms, unaware of the suggestion Professor X would soon put in their minds the next morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they slept, Kitty, Rogue and Storm all dreamed of food. Kitty dreamt she was standing in a field and it was raining double cheeseburgers, which she eagerly gobbled down. In reality, she was actually munching on her spare pillow, which, upon noticing, she quickly spat out while still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumb burger pillows. Not as tasty.\" she mumbled as she laid back down and went back to her meaty and cheesy paradise dream with a smile and a sigh of delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her attic bedroom, Ororo was dreaming she was in a world filled with different pastries that she began pigging out on, her belly swelling more and more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Rogue was dreaming she was eating all kinds of deep fried southern foods as she kept getting heavier and heavier herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three X-Ladies moaned in delight at their dreams, their massive tummies rumbling and gurgling as well as the night wore on with food related dreams and cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, the trio slowly woke up one by one. As they did, Professor X began his plan to help the girls increase their eating time. He started with Kitty.  The 14-year-old was just starting to get dressed when she sensed something in the back of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Shadowcat, I have a suggestion for you to increase your eating time. Why not wear and use diapers? They will allow you relief from needing the bathroom during meals. Believe me, they will be easier than having to repeatedly needing to use the loo during your eating</i>.\" Professor X told her mentally. After a few minutes, Kitty accepted this as she realized that the voice did have a point about diapers saving precious eating time by having her simply peeing and pooping them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon succeeding with Kitty, Professor X then set his thoughts on Rogue and Storm as the duo also barely managed to squeeze into their snug uniforms, the only thing aside from their bras and panties that could fit them at this point. In her attic, Ororo was finishing squeezing into one of her remaining pairs of pants when Xavier's voice made itself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ororo, you have become very healthy now. But all the same, you should wear and use diapers in order to ensure more eating time. Think of the time saved from needing to use a bathroom during your meal. Kitty is planning on doing so and I am sure Rogue will as well</i>.\" He told her. Ororo was quiet as she considered this. Sure, needing to take a potty break during a meal was annoying for the trio nowadays but still, this seemed rather surprising. But, in the end, she decided it couldn't hurt to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room, Rogue was busy barely managing to squeeze into her tight costume when Professor X began talking to her mentally, causing the southern girl to pause in tugging on her lime green sleeveless t-shirt over her black one piece. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rogue, you and the others have been becoming very healthy over the last few days. Yet, you have to waste time using the toilet when you could be eating. Therefore, I suggest you try wearing and using diapers. It'll be quick and easy to relive yourself then.</i>\" He said. Rogue, like Kitty and Ororo, was quiet as she thought about the suggestion and ultimately agreed to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later found the trio going downstairs for breakfast and finding only Jean present. \"Hi, guys. Scott and the others've already had breakfast. I've just finished preparing yours.\" she smiled as the trio sat down. She then came up with Kitty's breakfast tray. It was choked full of bacon, doughnuts, eclairs, pancakes and scrambled eggs. Kitty licked her lips and began wolfing down the food at breathtaking speed, her belly beginning to bulge even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now yours, Ororo.\" Jean smiled as she handed Ororo her tray, which had pancakes, waffles, scrambled eggs, eclairs and bacon on it. Like Kitty, Storm hungerly licked her lips and began scarfing her food down to her belly's delight as it too began becoming bloaty.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, received a tray full of pancakes, eggs, waffles, doughnuts, bacon and eclairs, which the southern gal began inhaling at top speed as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they'd finished, the trio all leaned back and belched in unison, big grins on their food covered faces. Jean then came up with a grin. She held three big diapers in her hands and a rubber mat under her arm. \"I read your minds during breakfast and learned you guys're considering wearing and using diapers to help with getting more eating time. I think that's a good idea.\" she explained with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I went out last night while you were sleeping and bought a few boxes of extra-large diapers.\" Jean added with a smile. \"Who wants to be diapered first?\" She asked. Kitty rose her chubby hand and arm, the fat jiggling slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean helped Kitty onto the mat, which she'd placed on the floor and helped pull Kitty's leggings, tights and panties off. Then, she gently taped the thick diaper on and helped Kitty back into her leggings and tights. Kitty's diaper was bright pink with a unicorn and a big rainbow on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro went next. Her diaper was grey with thunder clouds on it. \"<i>A perfect match</i>\", Ororo thought to herself as Jean taped it on her. \"<i>as my codename is Storm after all</i>.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue's, meanwhile, was bright white with a flowery pattern on it. Jean carefully helped Rogue get diapered, being careful not to touch Rogue's crotch or other bare body parts as she did. Now, all three big X-Ladies were snugly in diapers, the bottoms of their costumes bulging somewhat visibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels kinda nice and cozy.\" Kitty admitted as she waddled around, mainly due to her diaper's size as her weight gain from the previous night had largely vanished, leaving only her bloated body from its' result, the same with Ororo and Rogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue agreed. \"They feel like a very fluffy cloud ya can use as a potty.\"  she agreed with a laugh as she poked hers through her costume. Ororo smiled as she adjusted to her bulky diapee as well. \"They truly do feel comfy, Kitten. These should help us considerably during our feast at the buffet this afternoon.\" she smiled as the trio set off to relax before going to the buffet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that afternoon, Kitty, Rogue and Storm arrived at the buffet via taxi. Upon entering, they were immediately whisked to the room Kitty and Ororo had gone to the day before. Once again, the iPads were brought out and Kitty chose the 'a' la carte' again while both Storm and Rogue went and decided on the 'beltway' option. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to them, the chef was watching with a wide grin as the trio's stuffing began. After watching them become obese both here and at Xavier's due to small drones he'd bought, he knew that he could now capture the three mutants and force feed them into immobility. With that, he moved to prepare the machine that would help him do this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the special room, Kitty was happily clearing plate after plate of food, smears of it getting on her round doughy face and bits of it landing on her boobs and belly. Once again, she was enjoying each meal to the fullest and almost didn't give a care to what it was as her belly and body filled up more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, once more, her plates became overfilled with fried chicken, burgers and sausages. The waiters even brought out the deep fried cakes and ice cream again. Kitty just smiled as her fattening meals kept on coming like crazy as she kept filling up like a ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro, meanwhile, was loudly munching on the pizzas, cakes and pastries that were coming into her mouth. She moaned in pleasure and delight as this happened, her brown belly expanding more and more as the food was made into fat, similar to Kitty's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, at the same time, was enjoying her own beltline of fried foods and desserts, loudly chewing and swallowing them quickly as they poured into her mouth. The southern girl moaned with great pleasure as she did this over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kitty was moved to the same couch as yesterday and began receiving the same platters and bowls of heavy calorie filled food placed on her belly while Storm and Rogue's belts switched from fast foods to pastries and small cakes, which they merely gulped down without chewing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef chuckled evilly as he kept watching. Soon, it would be time for him to have the three girls brought into the kitchen and into his feeding machine. Now, he'd placed sleeping pills into Kitty's turkey and mashed potatoes, Ororo's cake and Rogue's burgers, which were now carried to the trio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty almost drooled upon seeing that wonderful and delicious turkey being placed on her tummy again. Grabbing a drumstick, she tore a giant chunk off and moaned in pleasure as she then allowed a big spoonful of mashed potatoes to be stuffed into her maw as well, despite it being stuffed with turkey meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm and Rogue were now also undergoing the feeding process in addition to their pastries and small cakes still pouring in as well. Finally, the trio were allowed to stop. They all sat there, panting and moaning in delight. Kitty spoke first as she rubbed her now boulder sized belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Guys... *hic* I... don't know about you... *burp* but I'm really pooped. I need a *hic-urp* nap.\" She yawned, the sleeping pills taking effect. Storm and Rogue looked equally droopy eyed and tuckered out from what they thought was their feast as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, the trio slowly went to sleep where they were, Kitty using a pillow on the couch to rest her head while Rogue used Ororo's shoulder and Storm used her own pillow. As they slept soundly, the chef signaled his lackeys to roll them to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the trio were strapped into large chairs, their fat arms and legs strapped down to the arms and legs of said chairs. There were even belts strapped over their tummies. Slowly, as they kept snoring, Rogue woke up first. \"Dang, that was a good nap.\" She mumbled as she tried to stretch... only to find she couldn't. Confused, the southern girl looked at her strapped down arms and legs. Slowly, her brain woke up completely. \"Hey! W-What's goin' on, here?!?!\" She asked, realizing her strength wasn't working in breaking either her arms or legs free, Professor X's messages (excluding her mobility and hunger) fleeing her mind as she struggled to break out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro woke up now. \"Rogue? What's goin' on?\" she mumbled as she slowly fully awakened as well. \"Ah don't know, 'Roro. Ah jus' woke up and mah powers don't work on these here straps.\" Rogue admitted as Ororo eyed her bounds as well. Curious, she tried to fire up her powers, but met the same result as Rogue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My powers do not work on them either.\" She realized in equal concern and panic. \"Ah think we'd better wake Kitty.\" Rogue said, nodding to the snoring 14-year-old blubber butt next to Storm. \"Kitten! Kitten, wake up!\" Ororo ordered. \"Mmmmm. Not now 'Roro.\" mumbled Kitty, still dreaming. \"Yeah, I'll be a model for your edible diapers.\" she mumbled a second later, mimicking eating said diapers in her sleep. \"Kitten, wake up now!\" Ororo shouted. \"Huh?\" Kitty mumbled as she slowly opened her eyelids reluctantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... what's goin' on, guys? Where are we and why're we tied down?\" She asked, becoming more awake now. \"We do not know, Kitty. But our powers do not work on the straps.\" Ororo admitted. \"Wait a sec... Ah think we're in the kitchen of the buffet.\" Rogue realized as she got a better look at their surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. And it's where you'll be fattened into immobile blobs by me.\" the chef said as he came out of the shadows. \"Who're you?\" Kitty asked. \"Name's Seymour Arbuckle. I'm the owner and chief of this establishment.\" the chef smirked. \"Why are you making us immobile?\" Storm demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply because I hate mutants.  There was a time when I was jealous of them but then I realized that you could wipe out humanity with your powers. So, I decided to use my cooking skills to make you so fat, you can't destroy the world. I've been adding hunger stimulants and metabolism suppressers to your food to make you as big as you are now.\" He smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a madman! Our friends will notice our absences and come for you.\" Storm snarled. Seymour smirked and activated the feeding machine. Kitty's chair went to it first. Out came a giant plate filled with cookies and ice cream. Kitty tried to fight her still present hunger, but finally gave in and allowed the machine to stuff the cookies and dairy treats into her mouth nonstop before switching to cakes and other desserts, with frosting, crumbs, pie filling and other food debris beginning to land on her middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm then found herself being stuffed with tacos nonstop nearby. She tried to resist her cravings as well, but couldn't and so allowed taco after greasy large taco to be crammed into her maw, spilling lettuce, meat, tomato and other taco fillings onto her boobs and gut as it swelled up, Ororo barely having time to scoop said crumbs into her mouth in between each taco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was brought over to a large meatball sub which immediately began cramming itself into her mouth, smearing tomato sauce around her mouth and her costume. Once it was gone, a huge roast beef sandwich with swiss cheese began forcing its' way into her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dealing with this for a bit, the girls switched. Kitty went to the tacos and chimichangas, Ororo went to the sandwiches and Rogue was sent to the desserts. \"I'll leave you freaks to your well deserved fate.\" Seymour chuckled as he left the trio behind in the kitchen, ballooning up more and more as they were forced to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys *munch, gulp* I... I *burp* can't take... *mmmph* much more food...\" Kitty moaned as she was stuffed with both a taco and a chimichanga at the same time. \"I *urp* agree with *munch* *chew* *burp*  with *belch* you, Kitten. My own tummy is *mmph* getting very full as well.\" Ororo admitted as she kept getting stuffed with sandwich after sandwich, sauces and other condiments littering her face before a large ham and cheese sandwich was stuffed into her maw with a sound of protest from Ororo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a very awful smell reached their noses. \"Uh, guys? Ah *burp* *munch* *munch* *chew* *chew* *gulp* think Ah just took a poop in mah diaper.\" Rogue admitted sheepishly as she was force fed a large slice of a eight layer wedding cake. Then,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRCCCCC CCCCCHHHHHHHHHHH!!!* Kitty let out a massive fart and pooped her own diaper. \"Well, I'm *munch* *humph!* in the same *mmurph* boat as you, Rogue. I just used my diapee.\" She confessed as they switched again, Kitty to the sandwiches, Ororo to the desserts while Rogue went to the Mexican foods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely, *munch **gulp* *burp* the others will notice our absence soon. Otherwise, we will pop like oversized parade balloons!\"  Ororo said as she was force fed a very big pumpkin pie as Rogue found her mouth being stuffed with six tacos and chimichangas at the same time while Kitty was nearly choked by a massive peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  </span></div></div>",

They knew the trio had gone back to the buffet after their large breakfast but the trio still hadn't returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could Katya, Rogue and Ororo be? I know they enjoy staying at the buffet late, but the buffet should've closed up an hour ago.\" Colossus remarked as he looked at the wall clock. Kitty had told him that on Sundays, the buffet closed at 9 in the evening. It was now 10:01. \"Something must've happened to them. That could be the only reason they aren't here.\" said Cyclops. True, he and Jean were only visiting the X-Men, but he did care for the three missing X-Ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Rachel went rimrod straight. \"What's wrong, Rachel?\" asked Nightcrawler upon seeing her do this. \"Shhh!\" Rachel hissed as she listened to the telepathic message Kitty was putting out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Rach! It's *mmmmppph* Kitty! Me, 'Roro and Rogue're *gulp* trapped in the buffet's kitchen! The chief's taken *munch, gulp* us hostage! He's planning on fattening us up to immobility! He wants to do the same thing to all mutants! You *urp* gotta tell the others! We can't hold much more food!</i>\" Kitty desperately pleaded as she was stuffed with more food by the feeding machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're still at the buffet. The chief's taken them hostage and he's fattening them up. He wants to do the same thing to all mutants.\" Rachel told the others. \"Sounds like he an' I need ta have ourselves a little talk.\" Logan snarled, popping his claws out and snarling viciously. He was close with the trio, especially Kitty, having a father/daughter friendship with her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better tell Professor Xavier.\" Scott said promptly. \"There is no time for that, Cyclops! Kitty and the others need our help now!\" Kurt protested. \"Nightcrawler is right, comrades. If we don't hurry, Katya and the others will pop like balloons!\" Colossus agreed in equal concern for his friends, especially his ex-girlfriend Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the six were racing to the buffet. Upon arriving, Logan used his claws to cut into the doors with a snarl. Unknown to them, Seymour was watching them on a security screen. \"So, the ladies' friends have come to rescue them, eh? We'll see about that!\" He smirked as he nodded to the waiters loyal to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dining room area, \"So where's the kitchen?\" Scott asked. \"I'm trying to pinpoint Kitty's location now.\" Rachel replied as she began doing so. Then, \"Got her! The kitchen's near where the bathrooms are in the back.\" Rachel said after managing to pinpoint Kitty, Rogue and Storm's location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, several waiters arrived. \"If you wanna get your friends, you're gonna have to go through us first.\" smirked the head waiter. \"Bub, I was hopin' you'd say that.\" Logan smirked, popping his claws out. With that, the fighting began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLogan tackled the head waiter, who grabbed a nearby broom to defend himself, only for Logan to slice it in half with his claws. Frowning in rage, the guy grabbed a chair and tried to smash it against Logan's head, only for the shorter man to grab it and then shove it sideways, knocking the guy off balance and giving Logan a chance to knock him out with a punch to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Colossus was fighting six waiters at once due to his size and strength. He threw two of them against the wall, another into a booth, two others onto the conveyer belt and the final one outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was using her telekinesis to deflect and/or return hits being aimed at her by three other waiters. Finally, she defeated them all at once by sending them flying into the men's room with her telekinesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightcrawler was doing pretty well himself as he was teleporting to dodge hits while also returning his own while teleporting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyclops and Jean were working together to take out their opponents with ease. However, one waiter got a lucky shot in on Scott, knocking the former X-Man down. \"Cyclops!\" Jean shouted in alarm, only for her opponents to get the upper hand on her as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, *CLANG!* One of Jean's opponents crumpled with a groan. Shocked, Jean saw the young waiter who had often served Kitty, Rogue and Storm during their last few visits standing above her wielding a frying pan. \"Are you alright?\" He asked, helping her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Why'd you-\" Jean began. \"Because I'm sick of being against mutants like my uncle.\" the young man replied with a smile before using his frying pan again as another of Jean's opponents went for them. \"Your uncle's the chief?\" Jean asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Dad owns this place and he's pro-mutant like me and Mom are.\" confirmed the man. \"Did you call your dad when Shadowcat, Rogue and Storm were kidnapped?\" Jean asked. \"Yeah I sent him a text. He's on his way. I'm Justin Arbuckle.\" the man replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a young brunette waitress, wielding a large tray, appeared and smashed it against one of Scott's opponents' head. \"Oh, and that's my fiancee Josie.\" Justin smiled, nodding to said girl as she helped Cyclops up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you. Big fan of you guys.\" Josie smiled to them. \"Where are our friends?\" Colossus asked, the fighting having briefly stopped as all the waiters were defeated. \"They're this way.\" Josie said as she and Justin led the X-Men to the kitchens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty, Rogue and Ororo were still being stuffed full of food. Kitty whimpered in pain as another chili burger was crammed into her mouth while Storm was forced to eat a giant cheesecake and Rogue ate a huge bean burrito. Kitty, Rogue and now Storm's diapers were full to bursting. Without a word, Logan cut Kitty's arms free, allowing the obese 14-year-old to undo her belly's restraints while Justin helped her free her legs as Jean helped Storm and Rachel and Kurt helped Rogue and Josie shut the machine down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys okay?\" Josie asked them once the trio had shakily managed to stand up on their own fat legs and feet. \"Sure. As *UUUURRPPP!!!* long as you define 'okay' as 'suffering a bellyache'.\" Kitty moaned as she rubbed her poor tummy while it gurgled and rumbled in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *BBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAPPPP!!!* agree with Kitten. I am very full and feel like I may burst.\" Ororo agreed with an equally pained moan as she rubbed her big brown orb of a middle. Rogue merely burped and hiccupped in response, her own face full of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you outta here.\" Logan said. Then, \"Well, well, well... so my captives' friends got past my servants, eh?\" Seymour smirked as he stood in front of them, some of the waiters having recovered from the previous fight. He noticed his nephew and nice-in-law to be standing by the X-Men. \"Justin... Josie... move aside. You've disappointed me enough today.\" He warned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Uncle Seymore. We've had it with your plans. I looked up to you when I was a kid. Dad also admired you. You were his big brother. Why'd you change so?\" Justin demanded. \"Because I knew mutants like these fools can destroy the world if they choose. I wasn't about to let that happen.\" Seymore snarled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no excuse, Seymour.\" said a voice. Surprised, Seymour turned to see a man, not much younger than him, standing in the doorway. \"I couldn't believe it when Justin told me that you'd captured these three fine heroines and what you planned for them, simply because they were born different. It's like Justin said, you were my idol when we were growing up. I don't know how you could've let your jealousy and then paranoia take over but it stops now. I've called the police and they're on their way to arrest you and your men.\" said Mr. Arbuckle firmly, but sadly. At that, Seymour took off running while his men raced for the X-Men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Cyclops... allow us.\" Storm told Scott as he, Logan, Kurt, Jean, Colossus and Rachel got ready to fight. Without another word, she, along with Rogue and Kitty, took off for their opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the X-Men's shock, the obese Storm and Rogue soon proved to be very capable against the waiters. Storm used her big brown belly to have one bounce off her, allowing Rogue the chance to take him down. Rogue then used her big butt to sit on two other waiters, smothering them into dreamland before using her super strength to put two more into a wall while Storm used a controlled twister to knock the remaining ones out cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dining room, Seymour was running for the door as fast as he could, when suddenly, \"CANNONBALL!!\" Kitty's voice was heard about him. Shocked, all Seymore had time to see was a massive boulder sized belly plummeting towards him before Kitty belly flopped on him just as Mr. Arbuckle, Wolverine, Cyclops, Rachel, Nightcrawler, Jean, Colossus, Josie, Rogue and Storm arrived. \"Nice one, Kitty.\" smiled Rachel as Kitty rolled off the knocked out Seymour and managed to climb back onto her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much girls. If it hadn't been for you and your friends, I may've never known of my brother's plans.\" Mr. Arbuckle smiled. \"To make it up to you, starting tomorrow, you can have all the food you want for free.\" He smiled. The trio smiled in thanks at the offer. \"You got it.\" Kitty smiled as Storm and Rogue nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at the mansion, \"So... let me get this straight, Professor... this was all for some kinda social experiment?\" Kitty asked as she, Rogue and Ororo talked with Xavier in his office, clad in only their bras and thick diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid so, Kitty. I know it almost put your lives on the line tonight and I am very sorry for that. I will do whatever I can to make it up to you.\" Xavier replied calmly and sincerely. \"Well... Ah guess bein' this fat really ain't too bad. Sure gives me an excuse ta not keep exercising.\" Rogue shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must agree with you Rogue. I'm so plump now, my students will likely focus more on their lessons instead of my body.\" Ororo agreed. Kitty also nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who knows? Maybe this extra blubber'll help when I need my powers to short circuit big electronics and help my martial arts.\" Kitty agreed as she poked her big belly in delight, thinking about it.</span></div></div>",

They'd discovered, thanks to experiments from former X-Man Beast, that, while still sumo sized, they were also stronger, despite quickly becoming fatigued easier while moving too much or exercising too hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also discovered that Professor X's messages to them from that first day were also coming true. Storm discovered that, due to her body being more plump, doughy and basically, fat, her students did focus more on their lessons instead of her body, though some did like her new obesity, even bringing her cakes, pies and cookies to snack on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, had discovered something that helped her act less rigidly than before: eating. She realized she enjoyed her massiveness and the fact that it increased her strength. So, she began lazing around more and spent most of that time gorging herself on junk foods. Beast had made a suppressing pill that, when consumed, meant you couldn't gain anymore weight despite eating more unless you wish to put on said weight, which all three X-Ladies had taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Kitty had discovered her new girth did help her with disabling electrical grids and it did improve her martial arts. She was very happy with her blubber like Rogue and Storm and enjoyed many an hour gorging out with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jean had decided to stay at the mansion and serve as the girls' personal chief for breakfast, snacks and occasionally lunch and dinner, as the girls had obviously taken Mr. Arbuckle up on his free food offer every day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Kitty woke up clad in only her extra large pink bra and panties. She, along with Rogue and Ororo, had decided to go back to wearing panties after Professor X had stopped the experiment following the fight with Seymour.  Though they did occasionally miss their diapers, the trio felt it was a good idea. With a smile, Kitty rolled out of bed and stood up, smiling at her big 400 pound body in the mirror. Humming happily, she pulled on her new extra large Shadowcat costume, which was now much stretchier thanks to modifications made to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked downstairs and entered the kitchen to find Jean cooking up a storm as usual as Rogue and Ororo also came in, garbed in extra large versions of their own costumes. Upon hearing them, Jean looked up and smiled at the trio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, girls. I've got breakfast already for you three.\" she smiled as she began handing over their trays. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a restful night of sleep, the three X-girls digested all that they had consumed at the restaurant. Their bodies, bloated and filled with food, began to deflate as all they had consumed was digested and processed. As Morning came the three beauties woke up, each in her own fashion, finding out that although they weren\u2019t as big as the day before, they still had seemed to grow somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was the first to wake up, getting out of her bed wearing her soft white PJ, immediately noticed that her body had deflated somewhat from the previous day. Encouraged by the fact that she could see her feet again, she quickly disrobed and looked at herself in her mirror. Both her white panties and bra seemed a bit constricted on her dark chocolaty skin and her belly still pushed out in front of her a fair bit, but she couldn\u2019t actually see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that everything was ok, Storm quickly began to wear her skintight pants, with the tank top and light-colored jacket but realized almost immediately that they didn\u2019t seem to fit very well on her frame. Her pants wouldn\u2019t go over her thighs, pulling as much as she could, she couldn\u2019t make them rise of another inch. Her top and jacket didn\u2019t seem to fare any better.  The top wasn\u2019t covering much over her belly button, pushed up by her still fattened belly and her jacket seem unable to close over it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled she quickly tossed those clothes aside, remaining in her white undies and tried to figure out what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty woke up second. On the previous day, she had indulged way more than her weather controlling friend and, as she went straight to sleep, she hadn\u2019t noticed the toll that her blue costume had taken during her binge. As she slowly woke up, she soon saw that her costume was completely ripped apart. Large gashes in the fabric were all over it. Especially at belly and ass height. There the costume had simply teared itself apart in the futile tentative to keep its wearer covered. Shadowcat, although pouting over the loss of her costume, didn\u2019t put too much though on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, shrugging her shoulders, she removed it standing in her room clad only in her panties and bra, both pink, as she tried looking at herself without a mirror. Her body, although it had largely deflated, still had a thick layer of fat all over it, making even her undies feeling tight over her skin.  Yet, Kitty, even though she could barely see the tip of her toes over her fattened middle, didn\u2019t seem to care that her clothes weren\u2019t wearable anymore, as she felt her tummy grumbling in hunger, deciding that she could think about her issue after a nice breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue woke up in a similar situation, her suit hadn\u2019t hold up to her engorged frame, quickly ripping apart, leaving her body mostly naked as it changed from a cool looking suit to a tattered rag of dark colored cloth. Still, as she rapidly woke up, she immediately saw the danger she was facing. For she couldn\u2019t let any inch of her skin to be touchable and so she began to try and fashion something out of the bedsheets to cover herself up. In her haste to cover herself, she never thought about looking at herself first, so it went unnoticed to her how her hourglass figure had expanded even more, as her body digested all the calories, she had ingested the previous day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknowingly to each other, both Ororo and Kitty, left the safety of their rooms to go in the mansion kitchen. The first, feeling rather secure since she knew that most of the mansion residents would be away on mission, the latter instead, didn\u2019t seem to worry about it at all. She was just too hungry to care what others could think of her waking around in her pink undies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both reached the kitchen, they greeted each other, slightly thinking that the other was still in a great shape, and yet both looked surprised when they saw that on the table there were some massive treats waiting for them. On the table, in fact, there were two massive platters, each with a name tag on it. Both girls seated near their own platters and quickly unveiled them looking surprised, in Ororo\u2019s case, and happy, in Kitty\u2019s case, on the contents left for them. Along with the platters, both found a note from the Professor, asking them to enjoy the treat on the table since both of them seemed to having been too focused on missions lately, and in dire need of enjoy some time off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty couldn\u2019t believe her eyes, right in front of her, towering over her in height, was a massive ten-layer chocolate tower cake. A huge thing, usually seen only at weddings, and yet her tummy grumbled in pleasure as it requested her to have a go at it, demanding Kitty to quench their hunger. Storm, instead, as she unveiled her plate stared shocked and with open mouth to the humongous burger awaiting her. It was a massive thing, easily the size of a car wheel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she inspected it, she noticed straight away that it was a massively large triple cheeseburger with pickles, ketchup, slabs of bacon, tomato and other veggies and sauces, making it a massive greasy treat. She also quickly red the note and, although being surprised by the Professor request, she was too engrossed in seeing, and smelling, the huge burger under her eyes to think of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kitty began by standing up and taking slice after slice from the highest layers, Ororo tried time and time again to lift the massive burger, finally managing to balance it in her grasp, before biting into it, taking a huge chunk of meats and sauce. As she did so, though, not only she smeared her face with sauce and grease, but also some of it fell from the burger, landing directly on her naked skin and undies. And yet, as she was enjoying the flavor so much, she didn\u2019t even think to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to take more and more out of it, as she began to crave all that massive thing inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, instead, had managed to restrict herself on the first, topmost, layer of the cake but, as her taste buds were assaulted by the deliciously tasty flavor of the cake, she gave in, letting out all the pretense of education, as she began to scoop up pieces of it directly with her hands, stuffing her mouth more and more as icing and pieces of cakes began to fall all over herself. As they gorged, so their bellies began to expand anew and, while this was securing their panties from being dirtied, their bras began to be covered in cake and greasy sauces, with the occasion glob of missed food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls, as they kept eating, began to lose all control over themselves, something within them and in the food turned them into food addicted monster, as they kept gulping ad munching, unaware of the toll this was taking on their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When the two had finished gorging, as the food in front of them had been completely erased from existence, both girls felt pleasantly full and yet, something seemed to bother them. Ororo, laying back against her chair, was a complete mess. Her face was smeared with mayo, ketchup and grease, as equally dirty were her hands and most of her swollen top portion gut. Yet she had managed to finish the entire burger, as a slightly drunken smile was on her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurping out as she cleared some space in her bloated belly, she looked down and noticed that a few remnants of the burger were stuck in the middle of her cleavage. Still feeling somewhat hungry she began scooping them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, instead was laying belly up on the table. Unable to move and feeling just like a beached whale would, she had managed in clearing the massive tower cake and yet, as she still licked her hands, finger by finger, as they were completely covered in chocolate, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking at how good it had been. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, her body too was covered in chocolate since, during her frenzy she had moved onto the table pushing herself against the cake like a feral animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as the two bloated girls lay there, panting and burping\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As both Storm and Shadowcat were resting in the kitchen, their bellies apparently satisfied for the moment, the two girls noticed that they had a similar problem in common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026Kitten\u2026seems you forgot to wear your clothes\u2026today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u2019Roro\u2026You seem to have done the same\u2026haven\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh\u2026right. I don\u2019t know what to think\u2026My clothes don\u2019t seem to fit anymore\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeh\u2026mine too. Must have shrunk\u2026We\u2019re eating healthy so\u2026it can\u2019t be \u2018that\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u2026Guess so. Still, we need new clothes. Wanna come\u2026with me\u2026to the mall? We can go there\u2026in normal clothes\u2026so to not be\u2026recognized.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, \u2018Roro\u2026will be a pleasure. Just\u2026lemme\u2026stand up\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both ladies slowly rose from their resting, they quickly went back to their rooms and changed in somewhat more normal clothes, although, both still had some issues with those. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, first to reach the entry of the mansion was, surprisingly, Shadowcat. Replacing her Blue costume with a more normal looking pair of jeans and an oversized t-shirt which looked rather tight on her still full belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited a bit, her stare fell on a seemingly misplaced plate with a few donuts nearby. Without really feel hungry anymore, but simply bored, she snatched a few as she waited, enjoying their taste. As she was munching on the last one, Ororo appeared in the hallway, moving rather quickly toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, was dressed somewhat differently from her usual, having changed her leathers with a rather large pair of sweat pants and jacket, although both were still white in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady to go, Kitten?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026*gulp* Let\u2019s go. Er, did you\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Already called a cab.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rogue had just finished covering herself with her bedsheets as she came out of her room. Moving slowly, she managed to reach the kitchen but instead of finding her two friends having breakfast she found Nightcrawler trying to take some cookies from a cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it was You who stole the cookies so frequently!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch! Ya\u2026it was me. Yet, I could share\u2026if you keep silent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, still covered in her bedsheet, smiled a bit thinking that there wasn\u2019t going to be really any harm in it, as she accepted the deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright but, on a few conditions. First, you shall deliver my share of those in my room\u2026and second\u2026Could you go and buy some clothes for me? I\u2026I can\u2019t really get out dressed like this and I don\u2019t want to risk hurting anyone due to\u2026my powers, you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt, understanding the situation nodded for both requests, especially since he could see a profitable way of getting rid of a troublemaker for his cookie stealing habit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could manage to have a \u201cmeatier\u201d Rogue around, for sure she would be blamed first. Plus, as he noticed how the bedsheet fell on her curvier body, he could see that with a slightly bigger Rogue, he could ogle her and enjoy the spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAch so! Will buy you clothes\u2026but first deliver your share of cookies\u2026Auf wiedersen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saluted in his German dialect, he vanished into thin air, quickly re-appearing in Rogue\u2019s room, swiftly depositing a large cache of cookies packages, about two dozen\u2019s of them, each holding thirty or so cookies, on her bed, before vanishing once more to buy her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he had actually forgot to ask her the size. Shrugging his shoulders, he decided to go with what he would think was going to fit her better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a very short trip in their cab, the two bloated X-Ladies in disguise, instead, arrived at the local mall, enjoying the respite of being completely hidden within the sheer amount of people wandering in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, although both hadn\u2019t changed that much, their bodies still had grown a bit fatter than usual so the chance of being recognized were, ironically, very slim for them both. As They went from shop to shop, both were growing sincerely depressed. No matter the shop they went, all clothes they could find were either too small or wrongly labeled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not even an hour, the two decided to rest a bit on a bench, as they discussed about their misfortunes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you believe it, \u2018Roro? All clothes had the wrong label on them! Some shirts were marked as XL and yet I couldn\u2019t even pull them down enough to cover my belly button. It\u2019s insane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI feel you, Kitten. I tried all the shops where I usually buy my leathers and yet couldn\u2019t find any in my size. It has to be a mistake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth ladies, still influenced by the Professor, couldn\u2019t see the truth under their own eyes. It wasn\u2019t the shops that carried the wrong size or label but it was that their bodies had gotten fatter, although they couldn\u2019t see it. Still, after a few minutes rest, and a few milkshakes downed to restore their energies, both girls decided to try one more time, going to a new shop that neither had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was called \u2018Gordo\u2019s\u2019 and it seemed to be the answer to their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both entered a young, lithe, woman hurried to them offering them her aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello and Welcome to Gordo\u2019s. I\u2019m Stacy, may I be of assistance?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, yes. We were looking for a\u2026wardrobe upgrade. Lately our clothes\u2026seemed to have had a mishap\u201d Replied gently Storm as Kitty, piping up from behind her friend, added \u201cYeah, they must\u2019ve shrunk.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Stacy rolled her eyes for a moment, knowing exactly which kind of clients these two were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018<i>So you\u2019re the type of fatties that doesn\u2019t recognize yourself as fat, uh? Well, we\u2019ve got clothes also for you...don\u2019t you worry.</i>\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure we will manage to help you in finding the perfect dress for any occasions. Would you mind following me? I\u2019m a good judge of shapes and sizes and I think I know exactly the section in which you may be able to find what you need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Storm and Shadowcat followed the girl, they soon found themselves surrounded by racks upon racks of clothing which seemed to fit perfectly on their bodies, although they hadn\u2019t any labels on them. As Kitty enquired about this strange thing, Stacy seemed to reply as if it was a question, she was asked a million times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe at Gordo\u2019s manufacture our clothes by hand through the assistance of many seamstresses, for this reason you will never find a label on our clothes. Still, since we produce a huge selection, you will be able to find something to suit your tastes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning passed, both girls managed to find many clothes and dresses into which both could fit perfectly, although, following the advice from Stacy, they both purchased a few bigger sizes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, since you\u2019ve told me that your previous clothes shrunk during washing, I\u2019m sure a few clothes of one or two size bigger could only work at your advantage, wouldn\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, both Ororo and Kitty were feeling happy in having found clothes that were finally, perfect for them. Storm had even managed to find an ensemble that was mostly similar to her old clothes, with a leather jacket and leather pants of a light gray color, which she finally managed to close on her still quite bloated paunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty too, managed to snag quite a few clothes and dresses for herself but, as lunchtime approached, both girls began to feel a bit of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, \u2018Roro. Now that we have solved our clothing problem, what do you think of having a bite to eat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Kitten, to tell you the truth\u2026I\u2019m feeling quite famished. Where would you prefer to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they looked around, they grossly restricted their choices to two options:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither Having lunch there at the food court or going back to the buffet they had gone the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEither way\u2026\u201d finished Storm \u201c\u2026For me is the same. Wonder how AnneMarie is doing though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end Kitty decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kitty and Storm kept laying in the kitchen, panting and burping after their large gorge, Rogue was trying in vain to find clothes that could fit her inflated hourglass body. So far, aside from her costume, Rogue had tried on six different shirts and seven pairs of pants. Of all those, she'd ripped one pair of pants, and two of her shirts. Her bras were rather tight now due to her bigger boobs as well. Rogue was currently naked as she grabbed a pair of red panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, she began tugging the panties up. She made decent progress until she reached her chunky thighs. There, the panties could go no further. Rogue tugged and tugged in desperation but they remained wedged where they were, refusing to budge an inch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuugghhh!!! C'mon! Just a... little... more!!!\" Rogue groaned as she kept tugging and pulling. Then, *RRRRRIIIIIIPPPPPPPP!!!!* Rogue's panties ripped loudly in the middle and fell to the floor, leaving the shapely southern belle naked again. \"Aw man! None of mah clothes fit now!\" she pouted in dismay. Then, she noticed her bedsheets. \"<i>Ah wonder...</i>\" Rogue thought to herself with a smile as she grabbed the sheets and set to work. After a few minutes, her makeshift clothes were ready. \"Now Ah can get some breakfast.\" she smiled aloud as she waddled slightly downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came down and found the bloated, food covered and clad in only bras and panties Shadowcat (who was trying very hard to lick her chocolate covered tummy) and Storm (who was loudly sucking her mayo, ketchup and grease covered fingers) still panting and burping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you two?\" Rogue asked as she sat down between the duo. \"We *urp* just ate *burp* the most awesome *hic* chocolate *belch* cake and *urp* triple cheeseburger ever!\" Kitty replied between large burps as she kept trying to lick her big belly. \"Kitty is telling the truth, Rogue. Professor Xavier left us these meals and told us to take some time off.\" Storm grinned as she finishing sucking her fingers clean, letting out a big burp of her own behind her hand. Kitty then noticed Rogue's makeshift clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had fashioned a makeshift t-shirt and panties out of her spare bedsheets. \"Uh, Rogue... you know that your homemade panties look like a diaper, right?\" Kitty asked gently. Rogue looked at her sheet panties and blushed as she realized Kitty had a point. Her makeshift panties were somewhat diaper looking and she had even used a big pin to hold them up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah know. It's just that Ah couldn't fit in any of mah normal clothes so Ah used some o' mah sheets.\" Rogue explained. Ororo and Kitty eyed each other knowingly. \"My clothes did not fit either this morning.\" Ororo admitted with a sheepish grin. \"I didn't even bother trying any of mine.\" Kitty confessed as she finally gave up trying to lick her tummy and laid on her back again, panting and wheezing slightly at her hard work. Rogue and Ororo both grinned at their teammate after sharing a look with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten, would you mind if we licked your belly?\" Ororo asked. Kitty blushed at the thought but then, after thinking it over, smiled and nodded silently. Without another word, Storm and Rogue began running their tongues over Kitty's chocolatey belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-S-Storm! R-R-R-Rogue! That t-t-t-t-t-tickles!\" Kitty giggled as the duo cleaned her tummy up, despite Kitty's writhing and wriggling . Soon, Shadowcat's large belly was cleaned up and she was on her feet again. \"So, what should we do next?\" she asked the duo. Rogue and Storm looked at each other thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, we can eat... watch TV... relax in the pool... or maybe... go to the mall and get some new clothes and then hit the buffet for dinner?\" Kitty offered with a grin. Storm and Rogue didn't say anything as they considered Kitty's offers, especially about the buffet. They had greatly enjoyed their meal there yesterday as well and were looking forward to their next visit. But still, yesterday had been their cheat day and the food was slightly fattening in calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, was hoping they would chose her idea of going to the mall and then the buffet. Like the older X-Ladies, she had greatly enjoyed her feast there yesterday and was hoping to go back again, hoping the duo would agree to take the discount offered by their waiter the night before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then realized she was drooling slightly at the thought of the buffet's wonderful and delicious food and quickly wiped her mouth with her arm. Luckily, Rogue and Storm were too busy discussing Kitty's offer to notice their teammate's embarrassment at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the duo ultimately decided to...  </span></div></div>",

He was a demon who, years earlier, had been summoned to said planet by the shamanic technopathic mutant Forge after his company was slain during Vietnam. However, Forge had then came to his senses and banished the Adversary, though not before Adversary managed to get a foothold to said planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, he was summoned again, this time by Forge's mentor Naze after the latter was killed by an alien parasite called a Dire Wraith, only for him to be defeated by Forge again, this time with help from Forge's new friend Storm. After that, he managed to escape again and fought with the X-Men and Freedom Force in Dallas, Texas. But that had also resulted in his recent defeat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, he was planning to spread chaos in the human world. Using his powers to search the globe for the key figures who could stop his plan, he finally found them. Three female members of the X-Men: Rogue, a southern belle with the ability to absorb a person's personality, skills, powers, memories and so on via skin contact. Storm, who could fly and manipulate the weather, hence her name. And the youngest member, Kitty Pryde, alias Shadowcat, a computer genius who could phase through solid objects, including people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio didn't know they were being watched by the team's enemy. They were too busy talking and laughing after a day of training. Kitty was goofing around with her powers by phasing through the furniture in the room with the trio as Storm and Rogue both laughed in amusement. In his current dimension, Adversary smirked at the trio's unknowingness as what was going to happen to them. Using his powers, he began to use his powers to effect the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Xavier's the three X-Ladies were still talking and hanging out when Rogue heard something in her head. \"<i>Rogue, you shouldn't starve yourself. You're skinny like a twig and should fill out more</i>.\" the voice told her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty heard something in her brain. It sounded like a little voice in the back of her own head. \"<i>Shadowcat, you are so skinny for a teenager your age. You're a growing girl and surely would like to eat more food. You should start eating more fattening foods and extra helpings at meals</i>.\" it told her. Kitty seemed to dwell on the idea after the voice vanished and it looked like Rogue was giving the same thoughts to the 'advice' from her own little voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was next. \"<i>Storm, as leader of the X-Men, you shouldn't be letting yourself or your two friends go hungry. Take my advice and start eating more and more every day. Starting right now</i>.\" Her tiny voice told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three girls stayed in silence, thinking about what their 'voices' had ordered, Adversary smirked evilly as he watched. After a moment, he heard the low rumbling of Kitty's thin tummy. The 14-year-old blushed and put a hand on her skinny twig belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno about you guys but I'm starving.\" Kitty told Rogue and Ororo. \"But we have already had lunch, Kitten. Besides, it is only four more hours until dinnertime.\" Ororo said. Then, her own tummy gurgled and rumbled in protest. \"But all the same, I too admit I am feeling rather peck-ish.\" she admitted as Kitty giggled. Rogue's belly followed suit a second later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eu tu, Rogue?\" Kitty asked innocently. \"Yeah. Me too, sugah.\" Rogue admitted with a sheepish smile and blush. Without another word, the trio headed for the kitchen to grab some snacks to tie them over, all while being watched by Adversary, who just smirked evilly as he watched his victims doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the kitchen, Ororo grabbed a large tub of vanilla ice cream and started filling a giant bowl with it. Rogue, meanwhile, grabbed a large bottle of soda and a huge bag of potato chips while Kitty simply phased through the cabinet and grabbed a whole package of cookies, which she started to inhale like crazy as Rogue shoveled handful after handful of potato chips into her mouth and Storm shoveled giant blobs of her ice cream into her gullet, dripping some on her costume and on the table in front of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing those snacks, the X-Ladies kept eating. Kitty began eating a massive amount of candy while Rogue scarfed down more chips and Storm didn't stop eating the ice cream until she had licked the carton clean. Their bellies, while somewhat full, still seemed empty and so the trio kept eating until an hour later when they had finished the 3rd large snack beige in a row.</span></div></div>",

Empty ice cream cartons, potato chip bags, candy wrappers, soda bottles and cookie packaging littered the table. \"Man, we really were hungry.\" Kitty remarked as she patted her full tummy in delight. She didn't want to admit it, but she had really enjoyed pigging out like that on her favorite foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit that was very delicious.\" Storm smiled as she rubbed her own stuffed belly blissfully. \"Ah think we'd better clean up our mess. At least we should be good until dinnertime.\" Rogue smirked as she began cleaning up her half of the mess, followed by Kitty and Ororo. As they worked, they still didn't notice Adversary watching them with an evil grin. \"<i>That's right, you little fools. Just keep listening to the 'advice' I planted in your heads and soon you'll be very fat and too pooped to fight me</i>.\" He thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up the mess, Kitty, Rogue and Ororo went to their respective rooms to relax before dinner. Kitty decided to read a new <i>Star Wars</i> comic she'd bought while out shopping with Ororo yesterday while Ororo went to water her plants and Rogue simply sat on her bed and thought about her powers. Eventually, it was time for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Rogue and Storm arrived after the others did. What they saw they couldn't believe. A massive feast stood before them. A giant roast turkey, large bowls of mashed potatoes, a huge basket of biscuits, corn, green beans and other foods stood before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... guys? Are you okay?\" Rachel asked, eying the trio's glazed expressions. Hearing the question, the trio snapped out of their trance. \"Uh, yeah  Rach. We're fine.\" Kitty said as Ororo and Rogue both nodded in agreement. At this, their teammates and the New Mutants eyed each other but didn't say anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kitty, Ororo and Rogue all sat down, however, it was like they were possessed by beasts. They loaded their plates to overflowing and began eating like savages. Kitty shoved an entire drumstick into her mouth and pulled a completely sucked clean bone out of her mouth a second later. She then did the same thing to the second drumstick a few minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue shoved spoonful after spoonful of mashed potatoes into her mouth, bulging her cheeks before she swallowed loudly with a grin. Ororo, meanwhile, was viciously attacking the numerous cobs of corn on her plate. Bits of corn flew everywhere as she mowed through each cob loudly. Magneto, Rachel, Colossus, Wolverine, Nightcrawler and the New Mutants all watched in shock at their friends' lack of table manners as the trio kept pigging out on the food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed the biscuits and, after letting Rogue and Storm take a giant handful, poured the remaining ones into her mouth, bulging her cheeks as she swallowed with a gulp. Rogue, meanwhile, just grabbed the bowl of mashed potatoes and started eating from that while Storm, following Rogue's example, grabbed the green beans and Kitty took the stuffing and corn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing we got our dinners before they sat down.\" remarked Illyana, Colossus' little sister and Kitty's best friend and roommate from beside Peter and Cannonball. \"Yeah. They've never eaten like this before.\" remarked Cypher with concern as he eyed Kitty loudly chugging a big bowl of gravy, spilling it onto her uniform slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, *UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!* Kitty, Rogue and Storm all belched loudly, their bellies noticeably chubbier. \"Oh man. I think I ate too much.\" Kitty moaned, putting a hand on her potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I concur, Kitten. My own stomach is rather upset from all that food as well.\" Storm confessed as she rubbed her own gut. \"Mah belly ain't doin' much better either.\" Rogue agreed, her own potbelly rumbling in protest at the massive meal inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you three should go lay down.\" Nightcrawler advised. \"You're right, 'Crawler. Maybe a good night's sleep can help us.\" Rogue agreed as she, Kitty and Ororo all stood up and headed for their rooms, leaving the others watching in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in their rooms, the three girls didn't both getting changed into their pajamas. Instead, they simply flopped onto their beds and were out like a light as soon as their heads hit their pillows. All night, they dreamt of food and becoming fat.</span></div></div>",

But he had one thing that made him different from other humans: he was a mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis powers included increasing people's appetites and fattening them up however big he desired, plus some super strength and agility. This made him an Omega Level Mutant. Despite this, he'd never joined the X-Men or any other hero or villain team during his life. That was more or less just as well since he favored peace over conflict. That's why he made a plan: to fatten anybody who might be a key figure in any group that could threaten his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis case, it happened to be one Ororo Monroe, alias Storm of the Uncanny X-Men, a team of fellow mutants who fought for human/mutant rights under Professor Charles Xavier, the world's most prime telepath, who Andreas set his sights on. As the X-Men's leader, Storm could fly and control the weather, hence her codename. Andreas knew that these powers might cause a hitch in his plans should he and the X-Men cross paths soon. But if he made Storm fat enough to be too pooped to fly or winded to use her weather powers, he likely wouldn't have an issue fighting them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind, he began tracking Ororo's every movement outside the Xavier Institute. On this one day, she was accompanied by two fellow female teammates. One was Rogue, who had the ability to absorb people's personas, memories, abilities, etc. via skin contact, as well as super strength and flight, which she'd gained by using her powers on the Avenger known as Ms. Marvel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was Kitty Pryde, alias Shadowcat, the baby of the main X-Men team. She had the ability to phase through solid objects, including people. She was also the team's computer genius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the trio were talking and laughing as they carried their shopping bags, having evidently gone to the mall. Ororo was in the middle, Kitty on her left and Rogue on her right. All three of them seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited, Andreas smirked to himself as he eyed Ororo. She was fairly tall, with brown skin, blue eyes and white hair in a mohawk style. She was also dressed in black leather clothes and boots. Aside from the mohawk, she was fairly pretty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But still,</i>\" he told himself mentally as he waited for the trio to come closer to where he was hiding. \"<i>she still poses a threat to my plans. But, if I make her big and plump, she'll be too out of shape to help her friends stop me</i>.\" At that thought, Andreas chuckled to himself as he imagined the obese Ororo trying and failing to stop him, first by flying, only to belly flop onto the ground, then by trying to fight him physically and with her powers, only to become too winded and pooped out to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this thought and image in his head, Andreas aimed his hands carefully at Ororo. As she started to pass, he fired a yellow beam at her, hitting her very lightly in the back. However, he was so excited, he accidently fired two more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hit Kitty in her butt and the other hit Rogue in the back of her neck. Both girls shuddered slightly but merely thought they'd suddenly had a quick shudder on their spines. Andreas, though unsure of how his plans were going to go down now with Kitty and Rogue also likely going to be affected, merely shrugged and slipped away unseen and unheard into the alley's shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three X-Ladies kept walking back home, unaware of what'd happened, Ororo's stomach suddenly rumbled rather loudly. She froze in surprise as she gently touched her trim and lean tummy in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue and Kitty turned to look at her. \"Sugah, are ya alright?\" Rogue asked in her usual southern accent. Ororo was quiet for a moment, and then she nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, Rogue. I am quite alright. I must need something to eat is all.\" Storm smiled assuredly. Then, Kitty's own tummy rumbled loudly, causing the 14-year-old Jewish mutant to blush. \"Guess you're not the only one, 'Roro.\" She said sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Rogue's own belly grumbled hungerly, causing the southern belle mutant to blush as well. \"Ah guess Ah'm kinda hungry mahself.\" she agreed. \"We might as well try to find something to eat before going home.\" Storm decided as the trio looked around hopefully. As she did, Kitty noticed a new restaurant not too far away. \"Hey, I think I found one!\" she called, pointing to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'The Bellybusting Family Styled Restaurant. Mutants welcome'.\" Ororo read aloud thoughtfully. It seemed like a good place to grab a bite to eat. And she, Kitty and Rogue were starving, as evidenced by their rumbly tummies. With that, Ororo led the duo into the the restaurant for their lunch, unaware that Andreas was watching with an evil smile. </span></div></div>",

Yummy smells filled the air as waiters and waitresses carried delicious looking meals to their diners, causing the trio's bellies to rumble even more. After a moment, a young man came up to them. He was roughly around Rogue's age, with sandy brown hair and dark eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello and welcome to the Bellybusting Family Styled Restaurant. I'm Jack Powell, owner and manager. Would you follow me please?\" He smiled as he led the three X-Ladies to a scanning machine. \"What's this for?\" Kitty asked in bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's to help us determine if you're mutants or not. If you are, it entitles you to our 'Anything on the menu free' deal.\" Jack explained. \"Alright.\" said Ororo as she, along with Rogue and Kitty, bravely walked into it and allowed the green light to scan them, their tummies rumbling in protest at having to wait even more for food. After a few minutes, the machine brought up their powers and codenames on a large screen. Upon seeing these, Jack's eyes widened in shock and awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You three are X-Men?!?!? I'm honored to have you in my restaurant! I've been following your adventures for the last three years! You guys are my heroes!\" He exclaimed in delight as he shook each of their hands. \"Well, thank you. We appreciate any support we can get.\" Storm smiled. \"Yeah, yeah. Enough talk, let's eat!\" Kitty said, her belly rumbling in agreement. At that, Ororo lightly bopped the youngest X-Man on the back of her head. \"Kitten, that was very rude.\" Storm scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, 'Roro. But Ah think the gal's got a point. Mah belly's rumblin' up a storm and Kitty's ain't much better.\" Rogue admitted with a slight smile. Jack simply smiled at the trio. \"It's alright, Miss. Monroe, I understand your friend's eagerness.\" he told her as he led them to a big booth. It was so large, you probably could have put the entire X-Men team into it and still have some room for a few of the New Mutants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, remember, whatever you order is on the house whenever you come in here.\" Jack smiled as he handed them menus. The trio took a few minutes to read through their options, but all of them looked or sounded so yummy, it was hard to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have whatever that great smell is.\" Kitty said. \"Oh that's our bacon and cheese hamburgers. There's also our Yankee pot roast with chestnut stuffing, our deep fried chicken with our secret BBQ sauce, along with our honey glazed ham and... apple cinnamon pie!\" Jack smiled. At that, Kitty Rogue and even Ororo's tongues flopped out of their mouths and almost onto the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly recovering, Ororo spoke first. \"That sounds delightful! Give us two orders of everything!\" she requested as Kitty and Rogue also nodded in delight. \"Ah. I love people who love to eat.\" smiled Jack as he went to place the order while the three X-Ladies excitedly tied napkins around their necks and eagerly awaited their massive feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the food had arrived and the three mutants were going to town on it like a pack of wolves. Within minutes, they had the attention of every costumer and employee in the restaurant as their plates and bowls began stacking up and their bellies began expanding. Kitty poured a whole basket of buttermilk biscuits into her mouth while Rogue devoured an entire honey glazed ham on her own and Ororo loudly inhaled a triple cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce, tomato and pickles. Kitty then shoveled a very big amount of fries into her mouth, causing some of them to poke out of her mouth, though that didn't discourage her. She simply crammed them completely into her full mouth by using her hand to smoosh them in before swallowing and chomping down on a normal hamburger with ketchup and mustard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shocked diners kept watching, Jack came out, carrying even more food for the three X-Ladies, this time including a large deep fried butterball turkey. Upon him setting it down and them noticing it, Kitty, Rogue and Ororo all began tearing into it like crazy, sending bits of the turkey and crumbs flying. \"I've never seen anything like this!\" Jack remarked, actually sounding impressed. \"But are you at least tasting the food?\" He asked curiously as he eyed the three bloated yet still ravenous X-Girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Rogue and Ororo, their cheeks bulging with a giant amount of food in them, food stains on their faces, all nodded. Then, loudly gulping her giant mouthful down, Kitty answered. \"It's the best food we've ever had. Right guys?\" she replied as Rogue also loudly swallowed her big mouthful. \"Yeah. Delicious sugah.\" she told Jack as she licked her chin, cheeks and nose clean of the food stains on them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Ororo noticed a big bowel of gumbo. Without a second thought, she grabbed the bowl and, neglecting the ladle or an smaller, empty bowl next to it, started guzzling and slurping up the gumbo, getting some of it onto her face and clothes. After draining the bowl, she set it down and noticed a young woman around her age watching in disbelief. Ororo simply smiled at the girl, gumbo dribbling down her chin and on her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made the poor woman burp in disgust and quickly leave after leaving the money for her meal while clutching her mouth. Just as she left, Magneto, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus and Phoenix, Kitty, Storm and Rogue's teammates, came in. When the trio didn't return from their shopping trip, the five got worried and decided to look for their friends. Upon hearing the trio's chomping, slurping and overall sloppy eating, they went over to the booth to find Shadowcat, Rogue and Storm still pigging out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how's the food?\" Nightcrawler asked with a slightly raised eyebrow. Kitty wiped her mouth with the back of her hand after eating some pot roast before answering. \"Pretty darn yummy.\" She smiled. \"Is there even anything left in the kitchen?\" Rachel asked in amusement. At that moment, Jack walked past. \"I'll be right back, ladies. I just need to go to the market.\" He told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is getting rather late, Ororo. Might I suggest you three wrap this up and get home?\" Magneto told them after this. Ororo, Kitty and Rogue all looked at each other in slight dismay. Sure, they were starting to feel full, but they still had 10 more courses and dessert. \"We'd love to, Mags. But, we ain't had dessert yet.\" Rogue explained as Kitty and Ororo nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. But come straight home after that.\" Magneto ordered as he and the others left. \"No problem, Magneto. If there's a crime in progress before then, ya know where to find us.\" Kitty smiled as she and the others waved goodbye, Kitty holding a large drumstick. Once their friends had gone, Rogue tried to chomp on Kitty's drumstick, only for Kitty to quickly pull it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" she protested, only for Ororo to tear a large chunk of it off due to Kitty forgetting about her. \"Sorry Kitten. Could not resist.\" Ororo smiled sheepishly as Kitty playfully glared at her mother figure teammate as Rogue just laughed in amusement.  </span></div></div>",

Especially those last 16 pies.\" she added as she briefly poked her head back inside. \"Glad you liked them.\" smiled Jack as Kitty then exited again, leaving the staff to deal with the massive piles of plates, bowls, trays, glasses and other items on the trio's table to clean up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was really good eatin'. Right, guys?\" Kitty remarked to the equally bloated Rogue and Storm. \"Ya got that right, sugar.\" Rogue smiled back. Then, *UUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPP!!!* She burped loudly. \"Excuse me!\" she blushed with a giggle. Ororo rolled her eyes at her younger friends' antics, though she was smiling as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, it's kinda funny that we ate so much since we usually try to stay thin.\" Kitty pointed out as she poked her belly as they staggered back to the mansion. \"I agree with you, Kitten. It does seem rather funny. Maybe we should let ourselves go a little since it brings us pleasure.\" Ororo remarked thoughtfully as she scratched her big brown boulder of a gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the girls, Andreas was watching them as they headed for the mansion. He was very excited upon seeing the trio's bloated bellies as well as their delight at their new gluttony. Especially Storm. He could just picture facing the X-Men once the trio had ballooned to at least 400 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was facing the X-Men at the mansion, trouncing each of them with ease. Then, came a 410 pound Storm, flying towards him... only to belly flop in front of him, wheezing and sweating heavily as she struggled to get up. Then, a 400 pound Shadowcat came waddling towards him and tried to throw a punch, only for him to easily sidestep her weak hook and then push her onto her back, causing poor Kitty to end up like a turtle stuck on its' back, her fat arms and legs waving pleadingly. Then a 406 pound Rogue lumbered in, only to meet the same defeat as her friends due to her massive blubber</i>. Andreas smiled evilly at this image as he used his powers so that the three ladies would feel ravenous the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, the trio had reached the mansion. \"Man, if we keep eating like this, we're gonna be pooped before we even leave the buffet or wherever we pig out at.\" Kitty wheezed slightly as she, Storm and Rogue all caught their breath inside the main hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think... you're right, Kitty. Ah'm so... pooped...\" Rogue wheezed in agreement as she leaned against the doorframe. \"A good... night's... sleep... shall... do us... good.\" Storm panted in equal fatigue as the trio lumbered upstairs. Once in their respective rooms, the three girls all flopped onto their beds and were out like lights upon touching the pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Kitty woke up, feeling ravenous. Her still somewhat large belly rumbled and gurgled hungerly.  \"Need breakfast.\" She remarked as she got up and headed downstairs. Rogue and Storm were already downstairs waiting for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio came in to find a massive breakfast for them. Kitty's side had pancakes, doughnuts, eclairs, biscuits, bacon and sausages. Rogue's had pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, toast and sausages while Ororo's had doughnuts, pancakes, eclairs, biscuits, bacon and eggs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. The others musta known we were starvin'!\" Rogue remarked as she, Kitty and Storm all licked their lips hungerly. \"I don't care where it came from... I just want it IN MY BELLY!\" Kitty declared, running up and starting to scarf down her massive pile of food. Rogue and Ororo looked at each other, shrugged and then joined in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then, using two forks, managed to shove an entire stack of pancakes into her mouth at once, smearing maple syrup and butter on her face. \"Kitten, are you sure you can swallow that much? You may choke.\" Ororo remarked in concern. Kitty, cheeks bulging like a chipmunk's, didn't answer at first. Then, with a massive gulp, she swallowed the whole stack with no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think I can.\" She smiled as she then began forking piles of bacon into her mouth at top speed. Rogue, meanwhile, was using her hands to stuff her scrambled eggs into her gullet nonstop. She just gulped them down loudly and kept stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro rolled her eyes at her friends' lack of manners, but then began doing the same thing with her own mountain of food a second later, causing Kitty and Rogue to smirk in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the trio had licked their plates and things clean. \"That was a really yummy breakfast.\" Kitty sighed in delight as she rubbed her bloated tummy. \"Ah'm with ya, Sugah. That really was good.\" Rogue agreed with a slight burp as she drummed on her own gut. Ororo simply smiled and then, *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPP!!!* Let out a massive burp, causing her to blush and the other two to giggle in amusement. \"Guess Kitty and Ah ain't the only ones lackin' manners this mornin'.\" Rogue smirked playfully as Storm blushed even more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After breakfast, the trio went upstairs to try on their new clothes. However, they ran into a problem with them. Ororo went through all six of her new t-shirts, discovering none of them even came close to covering her orb of a belly. Finally, she tugged on a stretchy t-shirt she occasionally used during workouts. She then tried her new leather pants, only to discover the same problem. They either stopped halfway up her big meaty thighs or refused to button and zip if she did successfully pull them all the way up, as well as feeling extremely tight in her privates. Giving up, she tugged on some stretchy sweatpants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her and Illyana's room, Kitty was having the same problem. Her new shirts barely covered her bellybutton and her pants were extremely tight on her butt, thighs and lower body as a whole. Like Storm, the 14-year-old finally gave up and tugged on a stretchy old t-shirt and spare pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had the worse of it. Due to her powers, she couldn't touch people without absorbing their memories, powers and so on. Right now, her clothes were too tight on her hippo body. Sighing, she too pulled out some sweatpants and a sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio met in the living room. \"I can't believe it. We just went shopping yesterday and now we need new clothes again!\" Kitty remarked, poking her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Kitten. We must've overindulged last night and this morning.\" Storm remarked as she eyed her own boulder sized middle in dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're we gonna do?\" Rogue asked as she pinched her belly fat. Kitty and Storm were quiet for a moment and then Kitty had an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I got a solution. Yesterday I happened to see this new store. It's called Big Plump Girls and it looks like a clothing store for big, meaty girls like us.\" She explained eagerly. Storm and Rogue were quiet and then Storm nodded thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might as well look there. I highly doubt our normal stores will have plus sizes for us.\" She remarked as Rogue nodded in silent agreement. Soon, the trio arrived at the mall and found Big, Plump Girls. Like Kitty said, it was a clothing store and there were quiet a few heavyset females shopping there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm felt awkward shopping at a plus sized store. She was always so healthy and fit but now, she had put on a large amount of weight in just several hours and had no choice but to shop here. The weather witch was also shocked by some of their fellow shoppers' sizes. In fact, one girl had to be around Kitty's age and yet was as big, if not somewhat bigger than Shadowcat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a chunky employee came up to the trio. \"Hi and welcome to Big Plump Girls. I'm Gloria Steinman. May I help you ladies?\" She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio quickly explained their personal interests in clothes and Gloria led them to each section one by one. Soon, the girls were inside the fitting rooms, trying on their new clothes, taking turns showing each other their choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kitty, Storm and Rogue were leaving Big Plump Girls, each holding several shopping bags and wearing some of their new plus sized clothes. Despite themselves, each of them had greatly enjoyed their trip to the plus sized store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome. They have really cool things there.\" Kitty smiled as she peeked at some of the plus sized pants, t-shirts, bras, panties and even a few x-tra large dresses and bikinis she'd bought. She currently wore a big red t-shirt that read \"<i>I'm A Big, Fatty Girl and Proud Of It</i>.\" and navy blue jeans sized XXL. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Against my better judgement, I must agree with you, Kitty. That store truly does have some... interesting bargains for young women of our sizes.\" Storm agreed with a slight smile as she eyed her own massive clothes. They were much like her current leather clothes/costume, though considerably larger so she could fit them. She'd also bought bras, panties, dresses, bikinis and more normal clothes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' they really seemed nice, even after they learned Ah can't touch people without absorbin' 'em.\" Rogue agreed, wearing a large version of her own clothes as well, having also bought the same clothes as her two friends and teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they climbed into Ororo's car after putting their bags in the trunk, Kitty's large tummy rumbled loudly. \"Uh oh. Someone wants food.\" She told the others, rubbing her doughy belly sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GURGLE* *RUUUMMMMMBBBBLLLLEEE* *GGGLLOOOORRRRPPPP* Went Ororo's big brown gut as it too longed for food. \"You are not the only one.\" She blushed as Rogue's own belly let out an equally longing rumble for food as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm soon pulled into the parking lot of an restaurant a few minutes later and the trio climbed out and went inside, unaware that Andreas was still watching them from his own car farther in the parking lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That's right, Storm. Keep eating and fattening up. Soon, you and your two friends will be too fat and pooped to try and stop my plans for world peace. Then, I'll do the same thing to every hero who poses a threat to me</i>.\" He chuckled as the obese X-Ladies headed into the restaurant and were almost quickly seated in a large booth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside the restaurant, Kitty, Rogue and Storm were looking over their menus thoughtfully. Once again, everything looked so good to the overweight trio that they found it hard to decide. At that moment, their waitress arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, are we ready to order?\" she asked with a smile as she took out her notepad and pencil. \"Everything looks so tasty, we can't decide!\" Kitty apologized. \"Just bring us three orders of everything.\" Ororo decided with a smile as she, Rogue and Kitty handed over their menus. The waitress nodded and went to place the order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the girls were once again loudly and messily scarfing down food like crazy as the diners watched in disgust, surprise and/or delight. Kitty stuffed a large cheeseburger into her mouth, smearing mustard around her lips as she did upon noticing their fellow diners' reactions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Onder why they're staring?\" she remarked through her bulging cheeks. \"I bon't bow.\" Rogue mumbled through her equally stuffed cheeks, some crumbs flying from her mouth. Ororo just smirked at her friends' antics as she munched loudly on a big pickle that'd come with her very big club sandwich. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, it seems we're always trying to stay thin, but now, we're eating like the Blob and becoming plump, chunky girls!\" Kitty giggled as she squirted whipped cream onto a massive hot dog. \"Yeah.\" Rogue smiled as she picked up the whipped cream can and began shaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then took a shark sized chomp out of her hot dog, smearing some whipped cream on her nose. \"It's a good thing villains and other creeps don't care about lunch.\" she remarked as she ate. \"You sure said it, sugar.\" Rogue smiled as she finally finished shaking up the whipped cream and aimed it for her own wiener, licking her lips eagerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Rogue, I wouldn't use the whipped cream right now if I-\" Storm began, upon seeing the build up of whipped cream bulging out the can due to Rogue shaking it too much. But it was too late. Rogue gently pressed down on the nozzle and she went flying as whipped cream squirted over the table and seemingly herself only. \"Woah. Guess Ah shook it too hard.\" She laughed as she sat up, her face coated in whipped cream. Then, she saw her friends. Kitty looked like she'd grown a beard and Storm's face was just completely covered in the stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys.\" Rogue blushed as she sat down beside them again. \"It's okay, Rogue. It's not like it's not edible.\" Kitty giggled as she licked her face off and then began licking Ororo's after her face was cleaned while Rogue did the same with her own face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the trio had eaten almost every bit of food in the building. \"Man, *URP* am I full.\" Kitty remarked as she rubbed her big belly in delight. Rogue smiled as she too rubbed and patted her massive gut in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah don't think Ah could eat another bite if mah life depended on it.\" She joked as Kitty giggled in amusement at the joke. Ororo just rolled her eyes and picked up the bill, only for her jaw to drop in shock and alarm. Kitty noticed this a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, 'Roro?' she asked. Still keeping her mouth open, Storm merely handed over the bill as her face remained frozen in shock. Kitty took one look at the final count for the bill and she nearly passed out. The same happened with Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio's bill was very expensive and, due to their shopping sprees today and the day before, they had only half of said amount left. \"What're we gonna do?\" Kitty asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had an idea. \"Ah got it. When we were lookin' at our menus, Ah saw a thing that says if we eat the Mega-Super-Duper Ice cream sundae, we'll get our meal for free. We'll just order it and eat at least most of it.\" She offered eagerly. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The X-Man known as Rogue was walking through New York City one summer afternoon wearing a t-shirt and jeans. Usually, due to her power of being able to absorb people's memories, personalities, skills, etc. via physical contact, she would refrain from wearing said former type of clothing since she was unable to control her powers. Due to her absorbing Ms. Marvel during a mission, she now had said Avenger's super strength, flight and durability in addition to her normal abilities.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, she decided it would be okay to take that chance since, due to the rather muggy day, few people were out in the heat. Coming from the South, Rogue wasn't too bothered by the blistering heat. She was just walking along with she swung her arm and it  lightly brushed a guy walking next to her, also in a t-shirt so his arm was exposed to hers. He shuddered and crumpled to his knees but didn't seem too shaken up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah'm sorry. Ah guess Ah wasn't watchin' where Ah was goin'.\" Rogue apologized to him. The guy merely smiled and assured her it was okay before they went their different ways. However, as they walked away from each other, Rogue began feeling odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to her, the guy she had absorbed was what is called a \"feedie/foodie\", which meant someone who has a desire to make oneself and/or someone else bigger weight wise. As she headed home, deep within her subconsciousness, Rogue felt a desire she'd never felt before. She looked down at her very thin, trim and attractive body as this desire bubbled in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dang. Ah'm a skinny twig. Ah gotta get some meat on mah bones. Ta do that, Ah'm gonna need more junk food to mah diet. Like maybe I'll eat some ice cream when Ah get home. After that, there's bound ta be some more greasy, fattening and sugary goodies for me ta eat</i>.\" she thought to herself as she kept walking for Xavier's, her stomach rumbling in anticipation of her new diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for Rogue, there was no one home at the mansion except for Ororo Monroe, alias \"Storm\", the X-Men's team leader who could fly and control the weather, hence her codename and Kitty Pryde, AKA \"Shadowcat\", the youngest of the current X-Men at 14 years old who could walk through soild objects, including people and use this power to also walk on the air. Kitty was also the team's computer genius. The other X-Men (Magneto, Phoenix, Nightcrawler, Wolverine and Colossus) had gone to Muir Island for a vacation, leaving the trio behind should there be a problem in New York. The New Mutants, meanwhile, had been allowed to visit their families for the next month as their own vacation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the kitchen, Rogue grabbed a carton of chocolate ice cream and grabbed a large bowl. She sat down and began scooping five very massive scoops out of the large carton, humming to herself as she did. After closing the carton's lid and putting it back in the freezer, Rogue grabbed her spoon and began eating the ice cream at top speed. Once it was done, Rogue leaned back after dropping her spoon into the bowl, sighing in contentment. \"<i>That sure hit the spot! Wonder what Ah'll have for dinner tonight since Ah offered to do the cookin' while the others're gone</i>?\" Rogue thought to herself as she got up and rinsed her bowl and spoon before putting them back and heading to her room to think about what the trio would do for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Why didn't Ah think about that before?!?!? If Ah'm gonna put more junk food in mah diet, its' only fair Ah share it with them as well</i>!\" Rogue thought excitedly to herself as she set to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kitty and Storm had finished up a Danger Room session. They were walking to the kitchen after getting dressed, talking about their session when a delightful smell reached their nostrils. It was a greasy, delicious smell they'd never really smelled at the mansion before. Upon smelling it, Kitty and Ororo's tummies rumbled with hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever Rogue's cooking, it really smells yummy.\" Kitty smiled, licking her lips. \"I agree, Kitten.\" Ororo smiled as she followed Kitty to the dining room. When they got there, they couldn't believe their eyes. Rogue had whipped up a massive feast consisting of hamburgers, french fries, pizzas and homemade pies for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys! Y'all are just in time for dinner!\" Rogue smiled at them as she came in. \"It really looks great, Rogue!\" Kitty smiled in delight as she sat down. Ororo, however, was hesitant. \"Rogue... what is with all the junk food?\" she asked. \"Ah decided we need some meat on our bones.\" Rogue answered as she sat down and grabbed a burger for herself as Kitty eagerly gobbled hers down and went for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro watched for a moment, still torn. On one hand, she wanted to remain thin and wasn't sure of all these extra food, but on the other, it really did smell yummy. So, with a shrug, Ororo sat down and began eating as well. The hamburgers really were tasty and the fries were crispy and delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the trio had eaten everything on the table. \"Man, Rogue. That was really tasty.\" Kitty smiled as she rubbed her belly. \"Yes, Rogue. It was quiet delicious.\" Storm agreed with a smile of her own. Rogue smiled at her two friends and teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome guys. Ah'll go ahead and clean up while you guys go ahead and start the movie.\" She smiled as the duo stood up and went to the rec room to do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wishing the dishes, Rogue came in the rec room with a very big container of popcorn for them. Though Kitty and Storm had eaten quite a bit during dinner, they couldn't resist the popcorn and, along with Rogue devoured it by the end of the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they went to bed, Rogue smiled as she watched her friends. \"<i>This is gonna be fun to do. Ah can't wait to see how big we all get soon.</i>\" She told herself as they went to bed. That night, the trio all dreamed of food as they slept soundly in their beds.</span></div></div>",

By the time, Ororo and Kitty came downstairs, it was to find a massive breakfast for them. Stacks of pancakes drenched in syrup and butter, slabs of bacon sizzled to perfection, scrambled eggs and toast with butter and jam and a big pile of doughnuts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue, I know you said you wanted us to put more meat on our bones, but I think this is overdoing it.\" Storm said with concern. \"C'mon, 'Roro. Rogue went through a lotta trouble to whip this banquet up. The least we can do is eat as much as we can.\" Kitty protested as she eagerly popped a powered doughnut into her mouth whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was quiet for a moment and then nodded as she placed a few pancakes on her plate along with some eggs and bacon. Kitty, meanwhile, loaded her plate with the food as did Rogue. The trio had soon made quick work of the massive breakfast and were now leaning back in their chairs in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhh... that was delicious, Rogue. I love your cooking.\" Kitty smiled to Rogue as she patted her stuffed belly, before stifling a big burp behind her hand. \"Once again, Rogue, I too agree with Kitten. Your cooking is very delicious.\" Ororo smiled to her friend. Rogue smiled at the two. \"Thanks, guys. It's nice ta see that y'all appreciate some good ol' homemade cookin'.\" Rogue said as they stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Kitty and Ororo both offered to help, Rogue insisted again that she do the dishes on her own. As she did, Rogue could barely contain her excitement. \"<i>This is great. At the rate we're goin', we're gonna be big bellied in at least two weeks! Still, Ah better help 'em pick up the pace if that's gonna happen.</i>\" she thought to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon after a big lunch, Kitty was reading a comic book on her bed while wearing a lime green t-shirt and blue jeans. As she finished the issue, there was a knock on her door. \"Coming!\" she called as she got up and went to the door. When she opened it, to her surprise, there was no one there. Instead, there was a big tray in front of her feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Kitty bent down and picked it up. She took it into her room and lifted the lid. There, on the tray, was a huge pile of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. \"Wow! Where'd this come from?\" she wondered. Then, she noticed a note on the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'<i>To Kitty. Just 'cause Ah know chocolate chip's your favorite cookie. Hope ya enjoy these. Love, Rogue</i>'.\" she read aloud. \"That was pretty cool of her.\" Kitty smiled as she picked a cookie up and took a bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned in delight at the warm, gooey chocolate chips' taste and eagerly began scarfing the cookies down eagerly, starting to smear chocolate on her fingers and face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ororo was finishing watering her plants with her powers when she heard a knock on her door. Confused, she went to the door, only to find no one there. Instead, she found a tray similar to the one Kitty'd gotten. Confused, Ororo picked it up and took it with her. Once back in her room, Ororo lifted the tray lid and found a freshly made apple pie. She found a note and read it. \"'<i>To Ororo. Hope y'all enjoy this apple pie Ah made. Ah know how much ya like it. Rogue</i>'.\" Ororo read aloud with a smile. She picked up the fork Rogue had placed with the pie and eagerly began eating. </span></div></div>",

This, after two weeks, proved to have consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.\" Kitty said one day as she stood on her bathroom scale. Not that she could completely see it, though. Her fattened middle pooched out enough that she had to lean slightly to see the scale's numbers. Originally, she'd been 110 pounds. But now, two weeks of massive junk food meals and snacks had ballooned her up to 220 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in addition to her round belly, Kitty had a larger butt, chunkier thighs and hips, fat legs, arms, fingers, hands, toes and feet. Her face was also round and doughy, with a double chin forming. She was clad in pink panties and a pink bra as she checked her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept pinching and poking her bloated and plump body, Ororo came in. The weather witch had also grown considerably huskier. Originally a healthy 145 pounds, Ororo had since ballooned up to 230 pounds, making her ten pounds heavier than Kitty. Similar to Shadowcat, Ororo was also currently wearing only her bra and panties. Her big brown belly sagged over the waistband of her panties. Her arms, hands, fingers, feet, toes, hips, thighs, butt and face were all also puffed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starving. Where is Rogue?\"  she asked Kitty. \"She went to the store, 'Roro. I think she said we're gonna have ham for dinner.\" Kitty explained as she stepped off the scale. \"Ooh! Ham for dinner?!? Yay!\" Ororo smiled, clapping her hands in delight like a little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty rolled her eyes as she brushed her bushy brown hair. \"Y'know, Storm. For all your complaining about Rogue's unhealthy cooking lately, I can't help but notice you haven't missed a single meal like me.\" She pointed out with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you? Then you would have the whole ham for yourself.\" Ororo snorted. \"Not that you need it.\" She added, eying her youngest teammate's gut. \"Oh yeah? You're one to talk, porky.\" Kitty retorted, poking Ororo's own big belly. <br>\r\n\"Who's the one who took Rogue's lasagna to her room so we wouldn't see her eat it?\" She added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, who was the one who used four slices of cake to make a cake-witch?\" Storm snarled back. \"I was tryin' to cut back on carbs.\" Kitty replied as she returned to her and Illyana's bedroom. \"That may be, but be honest, when was the last time you could even see your either of your feet completely?\" Storm replied, following Kitty. \"How about you? Your belly's bigger than mine.\" Kitty retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright. I apologize, Kitten. I'm just ranting because I haven't eaten anything in... 7 minutes.\" Ororo apologized as she sat on Kitty's bed. \"You want some of Rogue's fudge?\" Kitty offered. \"You have fudge?\" Storm asked eagerly. Kitty smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes.\" she smiled as Ororo did so. Kitty then reached into her underpants drawer and pulled out a napkin with large chunks of fudge wrapped in it. \"Okay.\" she smiled as she brought it over. \"Oh boy.\" Ororo smiled as she and Kitty both grabbed a big piece and bit into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOOOOOOOOOOOOhhhhhh!! So creamy and fudgy.\" Kitty moaned in delight, her mouth full. \"Y'know what'd be great? Ham flavored fudge.\" She remarked to Ororo. \"Or,\" Ororo said as she chewed her mouthful of fudge. \"fudge covered ham.\" she remarked with a swallow, causing Kitty to moan in delight at the thought.   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One afternoon, Shadowcat, Rogue and Storm were hanging out at the mansion together. They were trying to think of something to do to pass the time. As they sat in the living room, Kitty's thin belly grumbled hungerly. This gave her an idea. \"<i>I wonder if...</i>\" She thought with a sly grin as she turned to Rogue and Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys... I think I know something we can do for fun.\" she said slowly. Ororo and Rogue looked up upon hearing this. \"What is it, Sugar?\" Rogue asked, looking away from her magazine. \"How about an eating contest?\" Kitty offered. The two older X-Ladies eyed each other in surprise. \"An... eating contest, Kitty?\" Storm asked slowly. \"Yeah. I bet I can eat more than either of you combined.\" Kitty smiled. At that, Rogue snorted in amusement. \"Kitty, Ah don't know if ya forgot or not, but Ah come from the South. This little southern gal knows a thang or two 'bout eatin' contests.\" She smirked at her friend and teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Rogue. I know you've got a high metabolism, but I'm no pushover with eating either. Remember, I'm 14 years old and we usually get increased appetites starting at that age.\" Kitty retorted. \"Ah know, sugar. Ya make enough trips to the refrigerator durin' the day!\" Rogue said. \"Gimme a break, Rogue! Just because I graze a little doesn't mean I'm instantly a candidate for the Fat Farm!\" Kitty fired back. Ororo sighed and moved between the two friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you need to stop it right now! You are both getting out of line.\" Storm said firmly. \"Sorry, Storm. But Ah do think that eatin' contest's a good idea. It'll knock Kitty back a few pegs when Ah win it!\" Rogue smirked. \"Oh yeah?!?!? Well we'll see who's laughing when <u>I</u> win and you're busy barfing in a toilet!\" Kitty fired back. Storm sighed in dismay as she eyed her younger female friends and teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are both acting like little children. If you wish to do an eating contest, fine. But leave me out of it.\" she told them. At that, both Kitty and Rogue smirked at each other. \"Gee, 'Roro... kinda sounds like ya don't think ya got what it takes ta beat us.\" Rogue said slyly. \"Rogue's right, Ororo. You do sound like you're chicken.\" Kitty giggled. Ororo frowned indigently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a chicken. I merely do not wish to take part in your silly squabbling.\" she fumed. \"Bawk, bawk, bawk, ba-kaw!\" Kitty clucked playfully, flapping her arms like a chicken. \"Kitty's got a point, sugar. If you ain't a big chicken, then join us in the eatin' contest.\" Rogue smirked as Kitty kept clucking and flapping her arms. Storm was about to protest when Kitty began clucking even louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BAWK! BAWK! BAWK! BAWK! BA-KAW! BA-KAW! BA-KAW! BAWK! BAWAK! BAWAK! BA-KAW!!! BA-KAW!\" She clucked loudly with a naughty smirk at her friend and mother figure while Rogue laughed in amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Ororo couldn't take it for another minute. \"ALL RIGHT!!!! I'LL JOIN YOU!!! JUST STOP ACCUSING ME OF BEING A CHICKEN RIGHT NOW!!!!!\" She shouted, startling Kitty mid-cluck. Both younger X-Ladies smirked in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we got that outta the way, should we have the eatin' contest here or at a restaurant?\" Rogue asked. \"We'd better have it here, Rogue. That way, we do not embarrass ourselves during it.\" Storm said promptly as Kitty nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how 'bout food? Are we eatin' everything we have in the mansion or a certain kinda food?\" questioned Rogue. \"Let's go with junk food we can find.\" Kitty decided. \"That sound good, Ororo?\" The weather witch leader of the X-Men nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it!\" Rogue shouted as the trio set off for the kitchen. Soon, the trio were sitting at the dining room table, a massive pile of food stacked in front of them. The other X-Men (Magneto, Colossus, Phoenix, Nightcrawler and Wolverine) and the New Mutants (Cannonball, Karma, Warlock, Sunspot, Magik, Cypher, Wolfsbane, Karma and Mirage) were all watching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOroro was going to handle the pies. Large Apple, peach, pumpkin, cherry, blueberry, strawberry, lemon, banana cream and chocolate cream pies were all stacked in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, was going to eat hot dogs and hamburgers. Regular sized burgers and triple decker ones towered in front of her. A stack of hot dogs slathered in ketchup, mustard and relish were beside them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was covering doughnuts, cake and cookies. Five large cakes (chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, carrot and marble) were in front of her. So was a big tray of large-as-her-head doughnuts (chocolate, glazed, plain, powered and jelly filled) and an equally big tray of peanut butter, sugar, chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookies, the cookies piled high in the air like the doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, remember. Eat as much as ya can. No stuffin' the food into your clothes or any other kinda cheatin'.\" Rogue reminded the girls as they squared off. \"You guys're goin' down!\" Kitty vowed, licking her lips in hunger. \"Was gonna say the same thang to you, Sugar.\" Rogue retorted with a smirk. \"You are both 'going down'. I will eat the most of you two.\" Ororo vowed as she picked up her fork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagneto, who was the referee, looked at his stopwatch. \"On your marks... get set... BEGIN!!!\" He shouted. With loud yells, the trio immediately began inhaling their respective piles of food as the New Mutants and X-Men cheered their respective friend on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIllyana, Doug, Rachel and Colossus were all cheering Kitty on, while Cannonball, Dani, Rahne and Nightcrawler cheered Rogue and the others cheered for Storm. Magneto and Logan, however, stayed neutral as they watched as well. </span></div></div>",

BUUUUUUUU-RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!\" This burp was much louder than Kitty's and shook the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue shot a challenging look at the younger mutant, who returned it alongside a far louder burp: \"BBBBBBBBBEEEEEEELLLLLLCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was impressed.

Ororo took a deep breath and began grunting and straining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she felt the fart coming. Her belly gurgled from all the gas buildup. Kitty and Rogue watched as Ororo doubled over, clutching her massive tummy in agony. \"Uh, Storm? Are you okay?\" Shadowcat asked nervously. \"Y-Yes, Kitty. I-I-I-I-I am... fine.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One evening, Mary Jane Watson was alone in her friend Peter Parker's apartment. Peter was away on assignment for the Daily Bugle newspaper, where he worked as a photographer, taking pictures of his alter ego Spider-Man fighting criminals. MJ sighed as she lounged on the sofa. Her apartment was being debugged so Peter had offered his place until he came home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, MJ had revealed she had known about Peter and Spider-Man being one in the same for years since the night Peter's beloved Uncle Ben had been killed by a burglar Pete had failed to stop days prior during a television appearance and she had seen him leaving as Spider-Man after hearing the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough unable to cope with it at first following Spider-Man's recent encounter with Puma,  MJ had since come to terms with it and had opened up about her troubled past a few days after her confession to knowing Parker's secret. This seemed to be bringing them closer together, but there was still a bump in the road: Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeter had first met Felicia when she sprung her ailing father, Walter Hardy, out of prison to spend his final days at their family's house. Originally, Black Cat's powers of bringing bad luck were props engineered by her. But after a near death encounter with Doctor Octopus and the Owl during their gang war, she had accepted a offer from the Kingpin himself to obtain genuine superpowers that did what her tricks had done: bring bad luck to opponents in battle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she met Peter, Felicia had began following in Walter's cat burglar footsteps. However, after her first and second meetings with him and falling in love with Spidey, Cat began going straight and had briefly dated Peter before he revealed his true identity to her. Despite this, they were still friends and Felicia had recently decided to try and win Pete back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, MJ heard someone on the rooftop and opening the skylight leading into the bathroom. \"<i>Pete? Nah, he said this assignment should take a few days since he's been sent to cover a new science expo in Mexico. But then who-</i>?\" MJ wondered as she stood up and grabbed a baseball bat in case she needed a weapon. Slowly, the door opened and MJ prepared to swing, only to stop when she noticed the young woman in front of her: Felicia Hardy herself, garbed in her Black Cat costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia seemed just as thrilled at seeing MJ as MJ did with seeing her. The two women eyed each other for a moment and then MJ broke the standoff. \"What're you doing here, Felicia?\" she nearly spat in annoyance. Felicia smirked slightly as she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was looking for Spider. I haven't seen him since two weeks ago.\" she explained. \"He's at a science thing in Mexico for his job. I'm staying here since my apartment's being fumigated.\" MJ replied, still fighting the urge to swing her bat. \"Oh? Well then, I'll be going. Tell him I'll see him when he comes back.\" Felicia smiled sweetly. \"Wait a moment, Hardy.\" MJ spat, fury on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Cat asked as she faced the furious redhead. \"I've had it up to here with you trying to get back with Pete. He doesn't want to date you anymore. Why can't you see it?\" Mary Jane demanded. \"Because I know it's not true!\" Felicia snarled. MJ was so pissed, she seriously considered swinging that metal baseball bat at Felicia's head. But she knew Hardy would likely use her powers to make MJ either miss or fall off balance, giving Felicia time to escape or counter. Then, she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I have an idea. We'll make a bet: whoever eats the most food and burps the loudest or biggest, can be Pete's girlfriend. That sound fair?\" she offered. Felicia was quiet for a moment, as she considered the bet. Then, \"You're on.\" Felicia smirked as they shook hands. With that, MJ began calling up a pizza joint, a hamburger restaurant, a Chinese takeout place and a KFC, placing big orders at each one as she shot glares with Felicia, who simply smiled as innocently as she could or knew how to.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the massive order was before them. MJ had ordered six large pepperoni, sausage and cheese pizzas, 10 orders of noodles, tangerine chicken and beef with mushroom, 9 Big Belly Burgers with ketchup, mustard, pickles, onion and cheese and 10 family dinners from KFC. \"Ready to loose, Hardy?\" MJ smirked as she and Felicia sat down on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreams, Red.\" Felicia smirked playfully. \"On your mark... get set... GO!!!!\" MJ shouted as she and Felicia began attacking the food with great force.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few hours, empty wrappers, buckets of chicken, pizza boxes and take out containers littered the table and floor. A very bloated MJ and Felicia were leaning back on the sofa, their tummies swollen to the size of pumpkins. MJ had had to unbutton her pants and loosen her belt to make room for her large gut. \"Ooohhhhh gooooddddddd!!!\" she groaned as she rubbed her bloated middle in agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia didn't seem to be much better. Her costume was stretched out considerably and the zipper had been pushed down by her own big belly, revealing her bra and massive midsection as she also panted and groaned in equal misery. \"Maybe... we... overdid... it...\" she panted in between each pant and moan. \"Don't... forget... we still. gotta... have our burping... contest.\" MJ panted in response with a smirk as Felicia's eyes bulged behind her mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first.\" MJ smiled as she took a deep breath and started straining, her jumbo tummy gurgling and sloshing as she began feeling a burp coming up. After a few minutes, her cheeks swelled up and she opened her mouth. *UUUURRRRPPPPP!!!!* She belched loudly. \"Your turn, Hardy.\" she said with a grin. Felicia groaned in response as she began feeling the gas raising up in her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, *BBBUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!!!!* She burped a little longer and louder than MJ. \"Good enough for you, Red?\" she smirked as Mary Jane frowned in determination. \"Oh yeah? Watch this one!!!\" she snarled and began pressing on her gut, forcing more gas up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* MJ burped loudly, shaking the room slightly. Felicia glared at her opponent and smacked her belly very hard to get the gas going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAP!!!!* Now, both girls were doing whatever it took to get ahead of the other. They smacked, shook, jiggled and jostled their poor, bloated and stuffed tummies as hard as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOORRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLCCCCCCHHHHH!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SSSSUUUUURRREEEENNNNNDDDDDEEEERRRR TOOOOOOO MMMEEEEEEEEE!!!* MJ burped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*NNNOOOOOTTTTTT  AAAAAAA CCCCHHHHAAAANNNNCCCEEEEE, RRREEEEEEEDDDDDDD!!!* Black Cat belched back with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then. Have it your way, Hardy.\" MJ smirked as she grabbed a large bottle of soda and shook it up. Quickly she opened it and stuffed it into her mouth as the shook up soda started shooting out. Slowly, her cheeks bulged out as they filled up with the fizzy soda and then, with an effort, she swallowed the giant mouthful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls watched as MJ's belly swelled up even more from the soda's foam and then it let out a large rumble. MJ smirked as she felt her cheeks ballooning up from the pressure. \"Oh shit.\" Felicia managed to say before her foe opened her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ's burp shook the whole apartment, knocking books, a vase and other items over and causing Felicia to fall off the couch in shock. MJ smirked as she stood over her opponent. \"Yield?\" she asked with a grin. \"Yes.\" snarled Black Cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Felicia hated to admit it, MJ had won the eating and burping contest. With a sigh, Felicia heaved her massive body up and headed for the skylight in the bathroom to leave. \"Good job on the contest. I'm sure you and Pete'll be very happy together.\" Felicia muttered as she got ready to leap up. But just as she did, *OOOMMMPPPHHH!!!* Felicia groaned as she plopped onto her massive booty, to MJ's surprise and slight amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Felicia tried again, only for the same thing to happen, this time Felicia landing on her flabby back. \"What the hell?!?!\" She asked as she heaved herself up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh. Seems like Garfield had too much food and now can barely move.\" giggled MJ as she watched. Felicia stuck her tongue out in response and then headed for a window. \"I'll just use the window.\" she huffed and began climbing out it. But when she got to her middle, she stopped. Felicia wiggled, jiggled and strained, but she was stuck. \"Damn it!\" She cried in dismay, kicking her legs in vain. MJ just smirked and went to work cleaning up Peter's apartment, still burping slightly while she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Felicia, she had to wait five hours until her bloating had gone down so she could slip through the window. Though she still retained a big red mark on her tummy as a result of her embarrassment for some time. </span></div></div>",

Now, Felicia was considerably fatter and gassier as she'd been training for a rematch against Mary Jane. Now, she was heading to Peter's apartment to challenge MJ to the rematch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving, she managed to squeeze through the skylight despite her boulder belly. As she came into the main part of the apartment, Felicia couldn't believe it. There, on the couch, was a very fat Mary Jane Watson. MJ's belly had swollen to boulder size as well, her face was big and round, with a double chin, fat arms, legs, fingers, toes, feet and a large ass. Due to her size, MJ was currently clad in only her bra and panties. She was also eating a massive pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and anchovies pizza by rolling it up and then stuffing it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she swallowed with a giant gulp, MJ noticed Felicia. \"Well, well, well... look at who waddled in.\" she smirked as she licked her greasy fingers off. \"You're one to talk, porky.\" Black Cat retorted, poking MJ's giant gut with a finger, her own chubby finger sinking into MJ's rolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why're you here?\" MJ scoffed as she grabbed a massive slice of pound cake and stuffed it sloppily into her mouth, chewing loudly as she then slurped a massive cola. \"I'm here to challenge you to a rematch.\" Felicia replied. \"You really wanna lose again?\" MJ smirked. Felicia chose to ignore that as she then explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also thought we could try a farting contest as well as our burping contest.\" She told the obese redhead who was scarfing down junk food nonstop. MJ stopped and thought about it. She only did so for a second as she then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on.\" She said as they went to grab food for their pig out/burp off and fart offs. Soon cookies, cakes, pies, doughnuts and things were sitting in front of them. \"Ready to lose again, Hardy?\" MJ asked with a smirk. Felicia didn't say anything for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to MJ, Felicia had made sure all of MJ's food was expired, thus would likely give her a tummy ache after eating all of them. \"You bet.\" Felicia smirked back. \"On your mark... get set... EAT!\" MJ shouted as they set to work doing so, Felicia smirking as MJ ate the first expired pie, looking puzzled by the taste, but shrugging it off and kept eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all the food was gone, leaving two stuffed girls. \"Ohhh gooooodddd...\" MJ groaned, rubbing her stuffed belly. She did look slightly ill, but, to Felicia's shock, that was mainly due to being stuffed to the gills with food. MJ was still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But how? I made sure to grab the expired foods for her. Maybe they haven't fully digested yet? In any case, might as well try to win the burping and farting contest</i>.\" Felicia thought to herself as she rubbed her own stuffed gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for the burping and farting contest.\" MJ smirked at Felicia, who nodded in silence. MJ, once again, went first. She grunted and strained and then, *BBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP!!!* Out came a giant burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try this one on for size!\" Felicia smirked as she grunted and strained, gas racing up her throat. Then, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPP !!!!* Her burp was bigger and longer than MJ's. The obese redhead snarled in fury at this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contest went on, with both MJ and Felicia letting out bigger and/or longer burps than the other each time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE EEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Felicia frowned in concentration after this last burp of MJ's. Then, her mouth opened as her cheeks puffed up with gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!*&lt; br /&gt;\r\n<br>\r\nMJ frowned in dismay as, evidently, Felicia had just won the burping rematch. \"Alright, wise girl. Time for the farting contest.\" she snarled. Felicia smirked at this. \"You really think you can win this one too? Well, I don't think you can.\" MJ jeered as she smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia frowned as MJ took a breather before starting the farting contest. \"<i>Okay. If the expired foods aren't gonna work anytime soon, I might as well give them a hand.</i>\" she decided as she began using her powers so to speed up MJ's tummy ache during the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This time, I'll go first.\" Felicia told MJ. \"\"Go right ahead.\" MJ smirked as Felicia began grunting and straining, her face turning slightly pink from the straining. Then, *PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTT!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia let out a massive fart into MJ's face. The obese redhead snarled in rage at this. \"Oh yeah? Well, taste this!\" She spat as she began grunting and straining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOORRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* MJ's fart topped Felicia's by quite a bit. Felicia growled in annoyance at her opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on and on it went, both girls farting loudly, each one smellier and/or louder than the last one they'd emitted just beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL LLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHH!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, MJ was just about to let another fart rip when suddenly, *RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUMMMMMBBBBLLLLEE!* Her big belly let out a deafening gurgle, causing the redhead to wince in agony. Felicia noticed this and smirked, knowing why MJ was in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Red?\" she asked innocently. MJ winced as another massive belly cramp hit her, causing her to double over in agony. \"Y-Yeah, Hardy. I'm *burp* fine. Just a little... queasy.\" MJ admitted as her face went bright green. Then, she burped ominously and ran for the bathroom, just barely making it before she finally gave into her queasiness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HHHHHHHHUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!* She vomited a second later into the toilet as Felicia watched in amusement from the doorframe. \"You probably ate some bad food or something.\" Felicia offered innocently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... wait a minute. You were the one to handle my food. Did you give me expired foods to eat?!?!\" MJ snarled. \"Nope.\" Felicia lied quickly with a smirk. MJ was about to say something when she let out a massive, smelly fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god! Now I think I've got dirreria!\" MJ whimpered as she sat there in dismay, too weak and sick to bother trying to stand up so she could take a dump in the toilet. At that, Felicia took it as her cue to leave and did so via the window, smirking as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A half hour later, MJ and Felicia were both very bloated and stuffed to the gills with food. MJ had had to loosen her belt and unbutton her pants for her massive tummy to have room while Felicia had merely allowed her own gut to push the zipper of her costume down. Now that they had stuffed themselves silly, it was time for the burping contest, but MJ was feeling queasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to MJ, Felicia had used her powers to have MJ's chicken from KFC be spoiled and thus give her an upset tummy. Right now, it seemed to be working as MJ had a slight greenish hue to match her lime green t-shirt, which was stretched over her bloated belly, exposing her bellybutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, MJ?\" Felicia smirked innocently. \"Y-Yeah, Hardy. I'm (hurk) fine.\" MJ mumbled, gagging slightly as her tummy rumbled somewhat ominously in response. At that, Black Cat smirked evilly as she then turned her eyes to MJ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's do this burping contest.\" she smiled. \"I'll go first.\" Before MJ could say anything, Felicia took a deep breath and then opened her mouth after feeling the gas coming up from her big, blubbery tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BBBBBBUUUUUURRRRRPPPPP!!!* Beat that, Red!\" she smirked after letting a big burp escape her lips. MJ swallowed somewhat nervously, still not feeling good, and then felt the gas rising from her own massive gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUURRRRRRAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* She burped loudly, barely keeping the bile rising in her throat from escaping her mouth as well. \"Your turn, Felicia.\"  she smirked despite the cramp that suddenly flared in her tummy, causing her to whimper in agony as she clutched her poor belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia smirked and shook her giant belly hard, causing it to rumble and gurgle loudly. Still smirking, she glanced at MJ before she opened her mouth upon feeling the belch coming fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRPPPPPPP!* She burped loudly and then gestured to MJ for her turn. Gulping nervously as the urge to toss her cookies grew even more urgent, MJ timidly jiggled, jostled and shook her gut to get a burp to appear. After a second, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP!!!! * She burped loud and long, to Felicia's dismay and shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Let's see you top tha-\" she began when suddenly, *RRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUMMMMMMBBBBBBLLLLEEEEEEEE!!!!* Her large tummy gurgled more ominously than before. \"Oh crap. I think I'm gonna be...\" MJ began when she gagged again, even louder this time, causing her cheeks to swell up as she raced into the bathroom and barely got in front of the toilet in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HHHHUUURRRRRRKKKKKKKK!!!!* Mary Jane barfed loudly as Felicia giggled to herself from the couch as she listened to her rival puking her guts out. \"Oh god... I think I ate some bad chicken or something... my belly's killin' me!\" MJ moaned before more queasiness returned, forcing her to bend over the toilet again as she began urping up more of her feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think... you won... Hardy... oh god... my belly's so sore...\" MJ moaned a second later from the bathroom after raising her head again and wiping her mouth. Felicia smirked and took her leave, leaving poor MJ with a bad tummy ache and a very bloated belly. It took MJ two hours to get her tummy to calm down again and she ultimately fell asleep on the bathroom floor.</span></div></div>",

Peter was away for an assignment for the Daily Bugle and so won't be back for a few weeks. Originally, MJ and Gwen had both vied for Peter's affection, but they'd moved past it and were now fairly close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gwen,\" MJ said after a few moments. \"Hmmm?\" Gwen asked, looking up at the redhead. \"How'd you feel about having an eating contest with me?\" MJ offered. Gwen was surprised by this idea. Usually, given her desire to be an actress, MJ usually tried to stay thin and now, she was willing to have an eating contest that would surely add some decent poundage on the redhead's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, Mary Jane?\" she asked. MJ nodded with a smile. \"No conditions. Just a friendly eating contest.\" MJ smiled assuredly. After thinking it over a few more minutes, Gwen smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. You're on.\" She smiled as MJ grabbed the telephone and dialed a nearby pizza joint. \"Yes, hello? I'd like to order 10 large pepperoni, cheese and sausage pizzas with a large size of breadsticks. Yes, that'd be fine. Thank you.\" MJ smiled as she placed the order and hung up before dialing another restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, a massive pile of junk foods were on the coffee table in front of them. Aside from the 10 large pizzas, MJ'd also ordered 12 large buckets of fried chicken, 5 orders of Chinese food and 6 orders of tacos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Gwen?\" MJ asked with a smile to the blonde next to her. Gwen smiled and nodded her head. \"I'm ready, MJ.\" she replied. \"Alright. On your mark... get set... GO!!!\" MJ declared as both girls began to devour the massive junk food feast in front of them at top speed.</span></div></div>",

In order to prepare for the role, MJ had been stuffing herself with junk food and acting slobbishly for a month. She'd also taken to wearing and using thick diapers <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now 300 pound actress slowly walked in, munching loudly on a huge bucket of fried chicken, grease dribbling down her double chin as she slurped and smacked her fingers. She wore a thick Pampers diaper underneath her tight looking pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed for her dressing room, MJ noticed a large actress who was to serve as her co-star on the new show. This girl was blond, with blue eyes and looked considerably plumper than MJ. Like the fat redhead, this actress also wore a big diaper under her pants and was currently eating a large chocolate cake sloppily, frosting and crumbs sticking to her round face and full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ slowly walked over to her. \"Hi, there. I'm Mary Jane Watson. What's your name?\" she asked. The girl turned to face MJ and then, opened her mouth. *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a massive burp into MJ's face, causing the redhead to cough and gag slightly at the stench. \"Name's Breanna Mobley. I'm your co-star.\" she grunted to Mary Jane as she loudly gobbled down the rest of her cake before licking the plate clean and then tossing it into a nearby trashcan with a massive fart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane didn't know what to think. This girl had clearly been a slob for a long time, probably a lot longer than MJ, given that she was fairly bigger and seemed more adapted to slobby living. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanna slowly waddled around MJ, eying her carefully. \"You don't look like you've been a slob for very long.\" She remarked, poking MJ's boulder-sized belly, causing the redhead to feel gas coming up. She winced slightly at the pressure and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRPPPPPP!!!* She belched right into Breanna's face. Breanna was very surprised by this burp. \"You're still somewhat small weight wise, but you burp like a true slob.\" she complimented. \"Um... thanks?\" MJ replied, unsure how to respond to this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna have a burping contest?\" Brenna asked after a moment. MJ was surprised by this question. \"Um... alright.\" she finally decided. Brenna led her over to where the food and things were for the cast and crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two had several bottles of soda in front of them. \"We drink as much pop as we can and burp as big and as loud as possible each turn. Whoever burps the biggest, wins.\" Breanna told MJ, who nodded in understanding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreanna went first, grabbing a bottle and chugging it with ease. She wiped her mouth as she tossed it aside. A second later, she opened her mouth. *OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big burp flew out of her mouth. Breanna finished the burp and then nodded to MJ with a smirk. \"Your turn, Red.\" she smiled. MJ took a deep breath and loudly gulped down a big bottle of root beer. Upon finishing it, Mary Jane felt the gas bubbling up in her belly as it began moving for her mouth. Soon, her cheeks puffed up and she opened her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLL LLLLLCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHH!!!* She belched loudly. At that, Breanna frowned in fury. \"Oh, it's on, bitch!\" she snarled as she grabbed a big bottle of Sprite and loudly chugged and guzzled it in seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* She burped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, MJ and Breanna chugging down soda after soda, their burps getting bigger and smellier than the last one each time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLL LLLLCCCCCCCCH!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!! !!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the duo were down to their last sodas. Breanna went first, chugging down a large Pepsi. Her soda logged belly sloshed and gurgled loudly as it filed up with this soda as well. With a smirk at MJ, Breanna opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belch shook the studio floor, nearly causing her and MJ to take a spill. \"Top that, you fake slob!\" She laughed at MJ. Mary Jane frowned as she grabbed her final bottle, a bottle of Mountain Dew, and very loudly chugged it down at top speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, her belly rumbled and gurgled. It jiggled and bounced from all the gas inside it. Slowly, MJ felt the gas building up. Then, she opened her mouth as her cheeks bulged like a chipmunk's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMJ's big bomb of a burp shook the whole studio this time. Several of the show's producers and crew fell onto the floor as a result of that giant burp. MJ smirked at the shocked Breanna. *FFFAAAACCCCEEEE IIITTTTTT, TTTTTTTTTIIIIIIGGGGGGEEEERRR, YYYYOOOOUUUU'VVVVEEEEE JJJJJJUUUUUUSSSSSTTT HHHHHIIIITTTTT THHHEEE JJJAAACCCKKKKPOOOOOTTTT!* She belched loudly to them as they stared at her in shock and disbelief. After a moment, the crowd all clapped and cheered for her.    </span></div></div>",

Quickly stuffing the rest of her steak into her gullet, Kamala ran outside, her belly bouncing and jiggling. Upon entering the street, Kamala saw Shocker using his gauntlets to brake into the bank's vault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Shocker was one of Spider-Man's foes, but Kamala had fought him before and she was sure she could do it again. Quickly, she ran into the bank, her belly bulging visibly. Taking a deep breath, Kamala then leapt from behind a pillar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there, Shocker!\" she shouted, stifling a burp as she did. Shocker whirled around... and stared at the bloated teenage Inhuman superheroine in front of him. Needless to say, Shocker was quite surprised by how much Kamala seemed to have let herself go since their last encounter as he eyed her boulder sized gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think you can stop me? You're just a big butterball.\" He smirked. Kamala frowned. Sure, she looked like she'd been hitting the snacks hard but she hadn't made herself <u>that</u> fat! \"That was way outta line, creep!\" Kamala snarled as she squared off. Shocker smirked and sent a large blast from his gauntlet at her, Kamala couldn't get out of the way in time and it slammed into her new belly. To her shock, Kamala didn't feel the blast like she would've had she remained thin. Instead... it tickled and felt good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocker was just as surprised as Kamala was. \"How'd you-?\" He began when, \"EMBIGGEN!!!\" Kamala shouted, enlarging her fist to the size of a wrecking ball and smashing it into Shocker, knocking him back into the wall. Unfortunately, Shocker's padded suit, in addition to protecting him from his own weapons, could also protect him from blows delivered by opponents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna have to d better than that, kid!\" He jeered as he began to run away with his loot. Kamala smirked and got an idea. Taking a deep breath, Kamala began running full speed for Shocker. Confused at first, Shocker then got his answer as to what Kamala was planning on when she scrambled up a fallen pillar and leapt off it and fell towards him, belly first. \"BELLY FLOP!\" She shouted, squishing him under her just as the police arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slight effort, Kamala rolled off the knocked out Shocker and stood up as the officers came up and handcuffed Shocker. \"Great job, Ms. Marvel.\" said one officer, his eyes only slightly eyeing her gut. \"No prob, officers.\" Kamala smiled as she watched them take Shocker away. Then, she went back to the restaurant, where the owner was waiting for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, Ms. Marvel! You won the challenge before leaving to stop that villain! You've won a month of free meals!\" He told her, causing Kamala to smile in delight. \"<i>This month is gonna be wickedly awesome.</i>\" she thought to herself with a grin as she rubbed and pinched her belly fat.</span></div></div>",

Large cakes, numerous pies, cookies, doughnuts and ice cream sundaes all stood on the table, waiting to be devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Kamala, with a slight waddle, moved to the table. As her fans watched, Kamala grabbed the first chocolate cake and stuffed it whole into her mouth, stretching her cheeks and mouth considerably. She chewed for a few minutes and then swallowed with a giant gulp, a large bulge going down her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamala then turned back to the table. \"Dessert time!\" She cheered as she began inhaling the food like crazy as her fans cheered her on. As she did, the owner watched in delight as Kamala dumped an entire Boston cream pie into her mouth from the tin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, aren't you worried, her appetite'll put us out of business?\" asked the chief. \"No I'm not. Besides, with her here for the month, we'll likely get twice as many costumers.\" The owner smiled, nodding to several people who were filming Kamala's pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamala kept eating and eating. She plowed through the cakes in minutes, the pies were inhaled soon after and the doughnuts disappeared down her gullet within minutes of being plopped in. The same held true for the cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamala's brown belly kept getting bigger and bigger as she kept eating and eating. Finally, she licked the last ice cream sundae's bowl clean and tossed it onto the pile of empty and licked clean trays, plates and bowls, her tummy the size of a wrecking ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* She belched loudly a second later, her stomach grumbling from both delight and dismay of being so full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your meal, Ms. Marvel?\" the owner asked. \"Yeah. It *UUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!!!* was really, really good!\" Kamala smiled after burping loudly. Then, her belly grumbled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think I got a tummy ache now.\" she added sheepishly. \"See you tomorrow.\" Kamala said as she waddled out of the restaurant, her belly jiggling and sloshing loudly as she headed for home, burping and farting loudly while she did.</span></div></div>",

After a few weeks, she went to a buffet and saw something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, with a massive tray of food, was She-Hulk, a former member of the FF. Upon seeing all the food on her friend's tray, Sue smirked to herself. <i>This was going to be fairly easy.</i> She thought to herself as she slowly made her way to Jen's table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen was just about to sink her teeth into a large turkey leg when, to her surprise, it rose up by itself and something began eating it as it hovered. Slowly, the turkey leg was chomped clean until only the bone remained. It then dropped onto her tray with a clatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird.\" Jen remarked as she calmly grabbed a slice of cake, only for that to be yanked from her hand and that same strange unknown thing began munching on it until it was all gone. It was then that Jen slowly began to put two and two together. With a sly smirk she watched as her invisible thief began devouring the entire ham she had taken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder if Sue would be willing to take me on in a belching contest?\" She began aloud. The ham paused mid chomp, now almost completely devoured as a massive chunk was missing from the middle. \"Nah. Sue really isn't the kinda girl to take part in something like that. She's too much of a lady.\" Jen continued, grateful she was the only one in the buffet aside from the workers in the kitchen and Sue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sue still didn't expose herself, Jen smirked. \"In fact, I'll bet she's a big chicken who wouldn't even wanna try and take me on in a burping contest!\" She added. Finally, Sue couldn't stand it for another moment. She willed herself to become visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, Jen's eyes went wide. Sue had doubled in size weight wise. Her face was round and doughy with a double chin. Her body was big and plump. She had a large belly and a fairly jumbo butt. Sue glared at her jade green friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer Walters, I accept your challenge! I will prove I can out-burp you!\" She snarled as she kept chomping on the hambone in her meaty hand. Jen smirked as she allowed Sue to plop onto the chair beside her. \"Bring it on.\" she chuckled.  </span></div></div>",

Curious, she clicked on the site's webpage to read the rest of said article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, 'The Wearing and Using the same diaper for one week challenge. Wear use a diaper of your choice for one week and you could, like, totally win $50,000 dollars! Just send us either pictures of you in your diaper each day, Monday through Sunday or you can send daily videos via this website' webcam. Remember, you cannot use the toilet until after the contest and you are not to remove the diaper until then. This includes if you take a bath or shower. If you wish, you may have a family member or friend help you. Good luck and hope to see your stinky diaper on the site soon'!\" she read aloud, her eyes wide in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, 50 million dollars for just wearing and using the same diaper for a week?!? That's totally kinda cool.\" she smiled. With that, Kitty quickly went to the grocery store and headed to the diaper section. \"Like, if I'm gonna end up in the same diaper for a week, I'd better get a brand that can hold that long.\" she remarked as she eyed the different options very carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuvs. Goodnites. Huggies. All of those were good brands, Kitty knew from the ads from over the years. Then, she noticed the Pampers. \"Like, these should be good. I've heard they're, like, totally absorbent and have heavy duty protection.\" Kitty remarked as she picked up the jumbo sized box of Pampers diapers and went to the checkout line. The cashier seemed shocked a teenage girl was buying diapers, but said nothing as Kitty paid for them and went back the institute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her room alone, Kitty took off her pants and panties. Carefully, she taped the thick Pampers diaper on and stood up, watching it. It really did feel comfy with the thick padding. Kitty experimented walking by taking a few steps. She waddled slightly due to her new diaper's thickness, but it wasn't really visible right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let's totally get started.\" Kitty smiled as she found the webcam's features and pushed 'Record'. \"Like, hi there. This is Kitty Pryde. I'm 15 years old and I'm, like, totally going for that $50,000 by taking part in the 'Wearing and Using the same diaper for a week challenge'.\" She smiled. Then, she felt a rumbling in her lower tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh. Like, looks like I totally gotta go poopy.\" Kitty giggled as she squatted and began grunting and straining, her face turning lobster red as she did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen,</span></div></div>",

They bulged a bit, but, to Kitty's relief, this didn't seem too obvious. \"<i>Like, the last thing I want is Scott and the others to totally see me in a diapee. They'll totally laugh at me. I'd, like, so totally better be careful until Sunday</i>.\" Kitty told herself as she patted her diapered butt thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Rogue came in. \"Hey, Kitty.\" she said to her roommate, teammate and best friend. \"Like, hey Rogue.\" Kitty smiled, trying to keep cool and grateful she'd stuffed her other Pampers under her bed. \"What're ya doin'?\" asked the southern goth girl as she picked up a horror novel and began reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like, totally nothing.\" Kitty said quickly. Then, Rogue wrinkled her nose as an odor hit it. \"Oh mah god! What died in here?\" she asked. Kitty blushed in embarrassment. She'd had so much fun playing in her diaper, she had forgotten to mask the stench with the air freshener she'd bought as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I... uh... totally farted Rogue. That's all. I probably had too many baked beans last night.\" Kitty said quickly, thankful she had eaten two helpings of said beans at last night's cookout. Rogue was quiet for a moment and then nodded and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ah guess you're right. We told ya they're bound to make ya gassy as a balloon.\" she smirked. \"Like, you guys totally did.\" Kitty agreed as she sat down, being careful not to squish her poo loudly and picked up a magazine to read as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, Kitty couldn't help but wonder something, \"<i>Like, I totally wonder what'd happen if I load up on burgers and baked beans at Sunday's cookout, which'll celebrate the start of summer break? How much will I poop then</i>?\" she wondered with a thoughtful smile as she and Rogue kept reading their respective choices until dinnertime.</span></div></div>",

Once she'd stripped to only her bra and still full and somewhat wet diaper, she turned on the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hi there diaper lovers. Kitty Pryde here again and today I'm gonna make a poopie in my still full diaper for you.\" Kitty giggled as she squatted down and began grunting and straining. Slowly, the 15-year-old mutant felt the pressure building up in her backside. After a few more seconds, *PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTT!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that massive fart, Kitty felt the poop enter her diaper. Thankfully, thanks to her first poop the day before, Kitty was expecting the big dump. Sure enough, once again, it completely filled her hand. With a grin, Kitty turned to face the camera. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, looks like I totally made a big stinky-winky in my diapee like a wittle girlie.\" she giggled like a baby girl as she showed off her even bulgier diaper to the camera. Then, Kitty began to waddle around the room, her diaper bouncing and jiggling behind her as she babbled like a toddler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Rogue was coming to their room when she heard Kitty's baby talk. \"Baba doba gloobie globa poopie dapa.\" Kitty was babbling. Frowning, Rogue peeked through the keyhole and saw a surprising sight. There, laying on her back in only a bra and a full diaper, was Kitty. The brunette was showing her full diaper off to her laptop's camera, to Rogue's bewilderment and shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Kitty decided to wrap things up. \"Like, that's all from me today. Tune in tomorrow for more of 'Poopy Kitty'!\" She giggled as she farted in her diaper before signing off. She was just tugging her pants on when Rogue came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey Rogue. Like, um... what's up?\" she asked innocently. \"Ya can cut the hemming and hawin', Kitty. Ah saw ya through the keyhole.\" admitted Rogue. Kitty blushed bright tomato red. \"What were ya doin' that stuff for, anyway?\" Rogue wanted to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty took a deep breath and began to explain. \"Like, yesterday I found an ad that offered $50 million for just wearing and using the same diaper for a week and so I totally decided to enter it.\" Kitty confessed. Rogue was quiet for a moment. Then, she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ah'm in.\" she beamed. \"Uh, what?\" Kitty asked in surprise. \"Unless y'all want me to tell the others 'bout your diaper exploits.\" Rogue offered with a smirk. After a moment, Kitty sighed and nodded. \"Okay. Starting tomorrow, you're, like, totally my partner.\" She agreed as Rogue smiled happliy.</span></div></div>",

This caused Kitty to giggle in amusement as she did it again, a little more forcefully to get an extra jiggle in her poop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I totally made a big poopy in my diapee like a baby girl!\" She giggled, covering her mouth with her hand as she shook her butt at her mirror again. As she stood up, still giggling, Kitty got an idea as she logged off after posting her first video on the site. She knew that none of the X-Men or New Recruits were present in the mansion. Professor X had gone to Washington for the week to meet with government officials while Wolverine took the other X-Kids and NRs on a survival training session during that same amount of time. Storm and Beast, meanwhile, had accompanied Xavier. Kitty had been allowed to hang back due to having a cold until yesterday evening. The others had decided to let her stay home to be on the safe side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I totally have the whole mansion to myself!\" Kitty squealed, jumping up and down, her full diaper bouncing with her. After a second, Kitty, clad in only her diaper and a t-shirt, went downstairs. She reached the den where a flat screen TV was waiting for her. Quickly, the 15-year-old plopped onto the sofa and turned the TV on. Finding a cartoon she liked, Kitty snuggled into the sofa and her full diaper, and began watching it. After a half-hour, Kitty's stomach rumbled loudly, causing her to remember she should grab dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, tummy hungry. Me gotta fill belly welly.\" she giggled like a toddler as she stood up and headed for the kitchen. Upon reaching it, she found a massive chocolate cake with a note on it. Noticing the note, Kitty grabbed it and read it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, '<i>Dear Kitty. I made this chocolate cake for you as dessert for this week. I also made sure to pick up your favorite foods during my shopping trip the other day while out picking up your cough syrup. Hope you enjoy the cake. See you in a week, Love, Storm</i>'.\" She read aloud. \"Like, that was so totally cool of Ororo.\" Kitty smiled as she went to the refrigerator and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kitty had whipped up a normal sized meal consisting of a medium steak with steak sauce, fries, a soda, salad and a slice of the plump chocolate cake. \"Attention Diaper control: stopping to pick up supplies for a very hungry tummy.\" Kitty giggled as she picked up her fork.</span></div></div>",

Slowly she rubbed her eyes and looked around her own room. <br>\r\nWhen she first got here she did't really knew what to think. She was a mutant. Most people were't too fond of mutants. They made that very clear. Then she went living here. But to be honest it was't so bad here. This was her new home and to be honest she felt very good here. It felt like home. All other persons here felt like... well family. Sure there were rules, and if you broke them there was a chance you were punished but that's everywhere. <br>\r\nBut what was the best thing was that her powers were here not strange or different. Everyone here had powers. Perhaps not the same like her but still they had something special that made them 1 force. The X-men.<br>\r\nSlowly the young teen sat up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah that was a good night sleep. Now I would like some breakfast. I gotta admit I'm pretty hungry. Like, don't you agree Rogue? Rogue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look at the bed of her roommate and saw it was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she up already? Ah well. Like, it doesn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly grabbed some clothes, got dressed and walked downstairs. She walked right through the kitchen door and looked around. No one was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one here. Probably enjoying their free day. But breakfast totally is, like, the most important meal of the day, and I'm starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon grabbed some bread and made four peanut butter jelly sandwiches and a big glass of orange juice for herself and started her breakfast. The tasted pretty good. Soon the sandwiches disappeared in her belly. She let out a soft girly: \"burp!\" and giggled. But for some strange reason she noticed she was still hungry. She grabbed the box of cereal and poured a big bowl full of cereal, whole milk and also poured some sugar over it. She just liked cereal more when there was a lot of sugar on top of it. Some others told her that there was already sugar in the cereal but telling her that was a lost cause. She just liked it more with sugar. And with no body else around she could do all she liked without receiving criticism. But after her first bowl, she noticed she still didn't feel full and took a second bowl before she was really full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Guess I was more hungry then I thought. Ah well I'm a growing girl after all.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe lifted her shirt a bit and looked at her belly and slowly rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hmm. That feels good. Well I'm really full now.\"<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Problem was that a lot of others thought that those shows were a bit childish and rather watched something else. Still she wondered why she suddenly was so hungry. She was so lost in thoughts she bumped against Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch were you're going half pined.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry Wolverine. I was a bit lost in thoughts. What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take my bike for a ride. Sometimes a man just wants to be on his own without kids around him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked over her shoulder while Wolverine walked further. She had sometimes mixed thoughts about him. He sometimes acted a bit grumpy and sometimes had a bit of a temper, but at the same time she knew he could be very nice. He would never hurt her or the other kids around here. If someone would attack her or one of the other kids, she would almost feel sorry for that person. Wolverine would go totally berserk at that that person. So he was nice and friendly but did't always show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached the living room . No one inside. She wondered why all the others were. Maybe outside playing. Well better for her. Then she could watch T.V without anyone else asking to change the channel. She watched T.V for about one and a half hour but suddenly noticed she was hungry again. She did't understand why. It was't like she did anything other then normal. She did't used anything. So why did she suddenly had such a big appetite. Perhaps puberty? Growth spurt? She must admit she would like it to grow a bit taller and got some more female curves.<br>\r\nShe walked into the kitchen and after looking around for some time she found three bars of chocolate, on box of cookies, two family sized bag of chips and a two liter bottle of coke. She carried it all back to the T.V. As soon as her butt hit the couch she started stuffing the first chocolate bar in her mouth. She quickly finished him and started on the second. After that one was gone she devoured the third one in a record time and drank some of the coke. after that she started on the cookies. Eating them one by one taking sips of coke every now and then. After they were gone she ripped open the first bag of chips and pushed them in her mouth. To much focused on the T.V shows to really notice how full she was getting. She even finished the second bag of chips. After that she emptied the bottle of coke and let out a huge belch.<br>\r\nThe teen laid lazy on the couch. Crumbs of cookies and chips around her mouth. Her belly a bit bloated thanks to her current snacks. She Finally turned the T.V of and looked at the empty box, two empty bags, some empty wrapper and one empty bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men did I eat all that? I did't even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe she suddenly felt how full she really felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Now I believe I ate it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly lifted her shirt a bit showing her bloated belly. She pushed with her finger a bit in her belly button but finally started rubbing her belly and it did work. Slowly the full feeling got less. She lazy kept laying at the couch slowly she closed her eyes and fell asleep.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She fast stuffed the empty bags and wrappers in the empty box of cookies and threw it in the garbage bin. <br>\r\nShe'd really made a pig of herself. But no one had been around to see it so it didn't really matter. She brushed the crumbs off her face. She suddenly noticed all the crumbs on her shirt and a few chocolate stains. While she stuffed the chocolate bars in her mouth, some small pieces fell of and had melted causing some brown stains. She walked upstairs straight to her room. She pulled off her shirt and looked for a new clean one. A minute later she walked back downstairs in a clean shirt. <br>\r\nSuddenly Nightcrawler appeared in a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kurt! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kitty. I just wanted to tell you we gonna have lunch. It's such nice weather so we decided to eat lunch outside. Do you come too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty thought about her recent snack. She really shouldn't. If she kept eating like this she would turn into a blimp in a few days. At the other hand she would like a bite to eat. How was that possible? She should have a tummy ache from eating so much food. Was something totally wrong with her? Perhaps she should ask Charles Xavier, or else Hank McCoy. <br>\r\nThey were both the two smartest people she knew. Or the smartest mutants. But according to Charles Xavier mutants were people who were just a bit more evolved. Perhaps one of them knew what was going on with her.<br>\r\nShe thought again about the lunch. Lunch did sound good and she didn't had a weight problem yet so one day of overeating wouldn't change that. Would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I'll come too. Lunch sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later she came outside. Everyone was sitting at a table or on the field. One mutant ran around in her dog form with a sandwich between her jaws. She went sitting next to Kurt and grabbed two sandwiches and a glass of orange juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you been doing all day? I have't seen you?\" Rogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much. Watched some T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also made a total pig out of myself, she thought but she didn't say that. She stopped thinking that quickly since Jean or Xavier could hear that thought in her mind. However they probably wouldn't tell anyone. But still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Wolverine?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I've seen him. Don't go bother looking for him. He went away on his bike. If he doesn't want to be found... you don't find him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you have someone who's good at following tracks. Like Sabretooth.\" Spyke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I really hate that guy. He's so scary and mean,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hate him?\" Kurt asked. \"That goes double for Wolverine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or even triple,\" Spyke said. \"Those two really hate each other.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty already finished her first two sandwiches and grabbed two more. She hoped no one would notice how much she consumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her side and saw Scott and Jean in the shadow of a tree. Eating and kissing. She felt a bit jealous. She would also like it to have a boyfriend. Well you had Lance who seemed to like her. But she didn't like him. Every time when Lance was in a bad mood he made an earthquake. And his friends weren't really people she liked to hang out with. Especially Toad. He ate insects and had the hygiene of a dead pig. Also the place they lived looked like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. What probably was the case.<br>\r\nShe sighed and grabbed another two sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Kitty. That are you fifth and sixth sandwich,\" Kurt said. \"Are you feeling all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess I'm just a little bit... hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I would touch you long enough\u2026 would I then also gain some of your weight, or only your appetite?\" Rogue asked with a naughty grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never find out, you rechargeable battery,\" Kitty said grinding her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after her sixth sandwich she stopped eating. She must admit she did start to feel full.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty walked to her room and sat on her bed. She was a bit angry at what Rogue said. Maybe Rogue just made a joke, but she said what Kitty was scared of. If she did keep eating like this she would lose her body for sure. She liked her body. Sure she would like it to have some more rounder female curves and to grow a few inches but she was slender and she was proud of that. She didn't want her flat stomach to turn into a overinflated beach ball. Then Rogue would really have something to laugh about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell down on her bed and looked at the ceiling, thinking about what could have caused her hunger. Puberty? Sure that could cause some hunger but not this much. Did she ate anything strange or drink something strange? She couldn't think of anything. Not anything she didn't had before. At least not that she could remember. But she wasn't sure. Of course if she knew this would happen she would have put a little more attention to what she had been eating and doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly her hand went right through her drawer and came back with a bag of candy. She liked it to chew on something when she was thinking. She kept pushing one piece of candy in her mouth after another and didn't notice how much she ate. At least not until she noticed the bag was empty. Had she eaten the entire bag? It had been pretty full. She looked at her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This late already?  Better get down or I'll be late for dinner. Hm I could of course....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she faded right through her bed, through the floor and dropped out of the ceiling landing perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I can go down being perfect on time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly all other members gathered at the table for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for dinner?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turkey, mashed potatoes and green beans.\" Storm answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked with open mouth. She loved Turkey, and mashed potatoes. Green beans were fine but not special. Suddenly she knew the growing rumbly feeling in her belly. She wanted to eat. No! She wanted to pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPull yourself together Kitty she said to herself. You can't go making a pig of yourself. You're a human not a pig. She smiled a second at the thought that her name Kitty was also the name of a animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she did grab a lot of food. She was able to eat well mannered. Ate without dropping anything on her clothes. But the food went down pretty fast.Turkey with greasy gravy and mashed potatoes went down so fast she barely had time to chew.  After her first plate she took a second, and even a third. During her third plate she started noticing others were looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She asked. \"Do I have something on my face?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling all right?\" Storm asked. \"This is already your third plate. Normally you never eat so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just love Turkey and mashed potatoes,\" Kitty mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You maybe do but your clothes don't,\" Rogue whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty wanted to give her a mean look but saw she had been right. Her belly was, thanks to all snacking and not yet digested food, pretty round and poked out between her pants and shirt. She blushed and hoped no one else had seen it. <br>\r\nAfter the last piece of food went past her lips she decided she was full for now. But she had't counted that Storm came with cake. She cut the cake in perfect slices. Kitty couldn't help herself. She grabbed with both hands a slice of cake and pushed them in her mouth. Suddenly she realized what she had done and looked around. Most people looked a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I don't think I'm feeling well. Sorry I... I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she ran to her room she noticed she really didn't feel good. She had a terrible tummy ache. No wonder if you realized how much food  was in it. She felt terrible. Her belly made gurgling noises in protest of being so incredibly full. She was in so much pain. In her room she quickly unbuttoned her jeans. At least it took some of the pressure off her belly. But still she was in a lot of pain and was hearing constant gurgling noises from her belly. Suddenly she remembered how good it felt if she rubbed her belly. She put both hands on her belly and started rubbing. Her belly felt kind of hard, like a bag of wet cement. Probably because of all the food inside it. She started rubbing her round belly. It did feel good and the pain did become a bit less. She continued rubbing her belly. It felt so good she didn't even notice that she fell asleep.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Her belly rumbled and wanted food. Even after having a terrible tummy ache last night. But that was yesterday. That food had digested by now. She wanted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I be this hungry? I don't understand. I really need to ask the professor what's wrong with me. Or else Mr. McCoy. He's smart. But I'm so hungry. What should I do first? Hmmm, guess talking with the professor is easier on a full stomach. Besides it's not like he's going anywhere. I can take a breakfast and ask him afterwards. Good idea.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked downstairs. She hoped she didn't see anyone. She didn't liked her sudden hunger attacks but still she ate. But no body else needed to know that. She walked further and listened. She heard a lot of voices outside. Well it was a nice sunny day. Perhaps she could go swimming. If the water was warm enough. It would be a nice chance to wear her new bikini.<br>\r\nIn the kitchen she saw Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hi Wolverine. How was yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fine. Sometimes I just need to blow of some steam kiddo. But I need to work on my bike. If anyone needs me I'll be in the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon if he left, she grabbed bread and peanut butter and jelly and made five peanut butter jelly sandwiches just for herself. She also poured in a tall glass of orange juice and fast stuffed the sandwiches in her mouth. They tasted good. She must admit that. That was why she was sad they were gone that fast. She decided to finish it with a few bowls of cereal with a lot of sugar. But instead of the two bowls from yesterday she ate three entire bowls. It seemed like it only got worse and worse everyday. This way she soon would be a blimp. <br>\r\nSuddenly she saw her belly poking out between her pants and shirt. She sometimes wore shirts that showed her belly but not in this way. And those times her belly was flat. Not round. She tried to pull her shirt down but it rode up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid shirt. I wish someone washed it in too hot water. But I know that's probably not what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran back to her room and looked in her closet for a bigger shirt. She soon found one made sure it hide her belly. She brushed her hair a bit and decided she looked presentable enough and ran downstairs.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She saw professor Xavier behind his desk and also Storm. Storm looked doubt full at her like if she knew something was wrong with her. She also saw Beast. It was sill a bit strange for her to see her old teacher with blue fur and claws but knew very well he had a heart made of gold and would rather fight with words and science then with his muscles. But if he needed to do that he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Kitty. Nice to see you. Why do you come to see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's about the cake don't worry,\" Storm said. \"I've made plenty more. Besides you seemed to feel bad after\u2026\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not that. But I did feel bad afterwards but that's not it. I seemed to have suddenly since yesterday a huge appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's something to worry about Kitty. If you're hungry you just need to eat. You're a growing girl.\" Professor Xavier said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No professor! It's not just a bit more. It's a lot more! I seem to don't have control! It started yesterday,\" Kitty said and started a list about what she all had consumed yesterday until the two slices of cake and the terrible tummy ache afterwards. \"And today I woke up with a terrible hunger. I already ate five peanut butter jelly sandwiches and three bowls of cereal. Being a bit hungry I can understand that but this is not normal. Not for me. I have a small appetite. Now I have a appetite like The Blob.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. That is strange. It seemed you can suddenly eat about three times what you normally eat. Just suddenly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since yesterday morning. Could it have something to do with my mutant powers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never heard mutant powers effect someones appetite. Except maybe like someone like The Blob. I don't see any reason why your body would suddenly want more food. Did you do or eat anything strange?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I can think of no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it might have something to do with her mind,\" Beast said. \"When your stomach is full it gives a sign to your brain so it knows it's full. If your appetite suddenly is so out of control it might be that someone is playing a trick at you. playing with your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean a telepath? Like professor X?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or Jean,\" Professor X said. \"But I did't do anything and I know Jean would't do anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Emma frost? The white witch?\" Storm suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could do that,\" Professor X said. \"But I seriously doubt it. Why would she do that? give Kitty a bigger appetite or making her gain weight I don't see how that would help her. That's not her style. But perhaps another telepath. This seems like just teasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just teasing?\" Kitty yelled. I'm at risk of losing my body. I already have one shirt that's to small and\u2026 I don't wanna get fat.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe other three looked at her<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But at the moment I'm not sure I or anyone can do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what can I do now. I just\u2026 can't control myself when I'm getting hungry. Like I'm two Kitty's. This one I'm now, and one that only wants to fill her belly. Not really caring about anything else. Not really caring what it is as long if it's edible. That's gonna ruin my perfect figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand you don't want that but what do you want us to do?\" Storm asked. \"Change your appetite back to normal? We would love to but we don't know how. But we will look if we can find anything until then\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty walked out with a bowed head. Like someone who had been sentenced to death. She know what soon would happen. Soon she would be hungry again and ate a large meal. She could try to stop it, but was aware that it wouldn't do any good. She knew her hunger kept growing and growing until she couldn't control it and she stuffed herself. She might as well just eating large meals. Eating large meals would make her gain but maybe keep her hunger enough under control so she didn't made a total pig of herself. Otherwise Rogue would really have something to tease her with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is how it all started. Kitty did what she could trying to eat enough so her hungry side wouldn't take over. It did work most of the time. Lucky for her it was summer vacation. At school she wasn't allowed to eat during classes. However the eating of large meals did take a toll on her body. Slowly she started gaining all over her body.   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Kitty hadn't told anyone else about her hunger attacks except for Kurt. Professor X, Beast and Storm did their best to not let anyone else notice her problem by giving her some extra food she could consume in her room without anyone else knowing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did this happened to her?  Who did this. Was it really a telepath?  Then where was he? At school? Or was it a telepath or something else? Perhaps a mutant? Maybe just a disease? That would probably be the best option. In that case she wasn't alone and it was obvious it wasn't her fault. And who knows? Perhaps they would find a cure. If there was a cure.<br>\r\nShe stretched herself once and looked in her mirror. She really liked her mirror. She took it from home. It was a full length mirror so she could see her whole body in it. When she was a little girl she could spend hours in front of it. Dressing herself up. Many times in her mother's clothes, wearing her mother's make-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off her night shirt and looked at her naked body. Her new potbelly. But when she looked higher she noticed some thing. Her boobs. She slowly put her hands on them and squeezed softly a bit. They were bigger. A least a entire cup size. She looked carefully at her body. The extra weight at her butt made it more curvy. The same went for her thighs. Even her arms gained some of the weight.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe know some people gained around their waist and other in their butt and thighs but it seemed she gained all over her body. Well that wasn't so bad. But the more she looked at her body, the better she felt. Those extra pounds. It didn't look so bad at here. Gave her a bit more female look while her face was still as pretty as before giving her something\u2026 cute. All that eating made her gain weight but had that been a bad thing? It didn't look that bad at her. She never would have realized this if she would't have gained. Perhaps she would look even better with even more pounds. Would she really gain on purpose? That was crazy. On the other hand why not? She realized it didn't matter at all. She would gain anyway. On purpose of not. The calories of those huge meals need to go somewhere. She would gain anyway. But perhaps that wasn't so bad. Was fat unhealthy? Well tell that to those girls who smoked a dozen cigarettes each day. Or the boys who drank half a dozen beers each day. Or the ones who used drugs. It was all wrong. Well those beers weren't really bad as long if you didn't drink to much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides those health problems only come when your dangerously overweight. I'm not near that. I'm just a bit chubby. Well I won't be for long. I'll gain weight everyday. I might as well enjoy it. Why is becoming fat so bad? I mean, like, there's anorexia everywhere or people totally starving in Africa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe softly stroke with her hands over her new curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's decided. I'm gonna gain weight. Well I was gonna do that anyway but now I'm gonna like it.\"   <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty was sitting on her bed, softly poking her finger in her belly. She really had gotten fat the past week. She kept eating huge meals, not really caring what it was. At least it stopped her from losing control and eat everything in sight. Some of the others thought it was a bit strange. It was obvious she gained a lot of weight in a short amount of time. But at the other hand she liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer wobbling butt, and her rubbing thighs. Also her upper arms got flabby. Her cheeks were now pink and puffy and she had a second chin now. Her chest was bigger and of course her belly had taken a lot of the weight. She stuffed her belly swollen, bloated and round at every meal. It always shrunk a bit after the food digested, but then there was more fat added to the rest of her body. And her belly was bigger then before the stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoftly she poked her belly button. Her deep belly button. Before she started gaining she didn't had such a deep bellybutton. She enjoyed her new deep belly button and her new flab. It was soft and squishy. Also were warm and felt kind of nice. It was even fun to play with. She liked playing with it but that was only after the food had been digested. That meant she would soon be hungry again. After she had eaten her belly was round and stuffed like a balloon and kind of hard and less fun to play with since it was usually too full to bounce up and down rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and Storm walked in with a bag and got out three big pizzas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go,\" Storm said. \"This should be enough to keep you full until dinner. I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Storm. I really appreciate it. But I really need to eat. I mean if I don't eat my hunger takes over. And then another Kitty takes over. The only way to stop her from taking over is eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so bad for you. Before Professor X found me I lived on the street. I was hungry a lot of the time. I know it's not fun to be hungry. But what you have is even worse. You're hungry and gaining like crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do Beast and Professor X have any idea what happened to me what caused this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they did they would have told you. Don't you think? They don't have a idea. Perhaps you're right and it does have something to do with you mutation. Being able to pass through walls and things. I never heard of something like that but at the other hand how many people can go through walls? But it does't make sense. Why would you mutation cause you to get a huge appetite, while all others have a normal appetite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Do you think I like it?\" Kitty asked with a very full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no. However you do seem less stressed and less sad about your weight gain. Perhaps it is possible someone else is doing this. The question is: who is it? and : Why does he do it? I don't seem why he would do this. Or perhaps it's just a prank. Did you make some enemies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I know of,\" Kitty mumbled with her still full mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I got some work to do. See you later.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later Storm. And thanks for the pizzas.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe happily munched on her pizzas. She was fine with gaining weight now, but Storm didn't need to know that.</span></div></div>",

The next moment her zipper was forced all the way down, letting Kitty belly flow out like a river. Kitty smiled seeing how fat she had gotten she massaged her belly. This wasn't the first button she lost. She lost another pants button a day or two ago and a few on her blouses. She knew there was one thing that she needed to do. Go clothes shopping. She looked in her wallet. Just enough to buy about two outfits. But just to be sure maybe it was better to buy them a few sizes bigger. Then she had some room to grow. That was a good idea. Perhaps also look for some elastic clothing. That would, at least, last longer. She normally didn't wore much elastic pants but back then she was a skinny twig. It would be a part of her new lifestyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she looked in the closet. She found one elastic pants that would fit around her tummy. She put her new pants on and walked out of her room. Downstairs there was suddenly a cloud of smoke and Kurt appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Kitty. What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing special. Just going out. You know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really are in that gaining thing. If I wouldn't have been here the past weeks and I saw you, I would think you would be Kitty's twin sister who has troubles with her weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt you know I can't help it. If I don't eat enough I going totally crazy eating anything I can get my hands on. I emptied the entire fridge one evening. If I don't eat enough, at dinner I would eat my food and that of everybody else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why didn't you tell anyone except me, Beast, Storm and Professor X?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because\u2026 Well... they're adults. They're looking out for us. They wanna help us. Besides they're trying to find out what's wrong with me, and help me. But to do that they need to know about well the hunger. And as for you\u2026 well... you're my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that. I just don't get why you didn't tell the others. They will understand. Everyone has their problems. Now they just think you're a gluttonous pig. Not that you can't help it. However you are now fine with the wei...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Kitty slapped her hands around his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want the whole institute to hear us? I don't want anyone else to know that. Now I going to the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty froze. Then she turned to him with a playfully mean grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna come with me... a girl... to the mall\u2026 to buy clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I guess so. I just offered that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Why not? Sure you can come. But believe me. It's better if you put another face on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt pushed at his watch and his blue skin turned into a normal skin color. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we can go.\"     <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Nothing strange about that. Just being normal for once. Fine, the reason that she needed new clothes wasn't normal. But she really needed new clothes. If she didn't get bigger clothes soon, she would need to start wearing bed sheets and/or sumo sized diapers. And with her still gaining with no end in sight, that might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before they reached the clothing store, Kitty felt the familiar rumbly, gurgly feeling in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" She mumbled. \"Please not now. I just ate several pizzas. Come on... hold on. Oh crap I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't believe it but... I'm hungry. Kurt I really need to eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt looked around and saw a fast food joint. He grabbed Kitty by her hand and dragged her in. He pushed her down on a chair went away to get some food. But Kitty's hunger started to take over. Suddenly she saw some other people left leaving a half eaten burger and some fries. Normally Kitty wouldn't think about this but this wasn't normal. She wolfed down the burger and the cold weak fries. Barely taking time to taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw some other people looking a bit shocked at her. She smiled weakly, waving at them with mustard and ketchup smeared around her lips. They slowly waved back.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty looked pained. That small bite didn't even came close to stopping her hunger. That was slowly starting to take over. She looked around. There must be a way. She couldn't just start eating the food of someone else. Where was Kurt? She saw him standing at the counter. She ran over to him. Kitty reached him just as the first food item was put on his tray. She grabbed it and pushed it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Sorry kid. But this man...\" The man behind the counter started but Kurt stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. She's with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pulled up one eyebrow and lifted his shoulders and put the other food on Kurt's tray. Kurt walked back to their table with their tray while Kitty already started eating. He put the tray down and Kitty started eating like she hadn't eaten in days. Her gut told otherwise, while she ate all the food on the tray.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This problem was of course was totally different from most teenager problems. This had nothing to do with money, boyfriends or clothes. This was something totally new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still hungry,\" Kitty mumbled softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still? Are you really still\u2026\" Kurt started but stopped when he saw Kitty's face. \"Fine I'll get some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was really still hungry. But with some food in her belly and knowing Kurt would soon be back with more was probably enough to not start eating everything in sight. But if she wasn't totally full the hunger would probably start again. Hopefully this would be enough for her. Hopefully the next hunger attack would be at the institute. She had peace with her weight gain but the hunger attacks were still a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are,\" Kurt said. \"I hope it's enough because I have no more pocket money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt bad when she heard this. She realized Kurt has been paying for this food with his own pocket money. That you would pay for your female friend was fine but not when she was eating like a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry Kurt. I'll totally pay you back. I promise! But that might take some time. I need to use the money I have now for new clothes because I'll, like, soon outgrew these. Then I need to wait again before I have more pocket money but I promise you I'll pay you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Kitty started stuffing her face. Kitty didn't leave a single crumb but when the last bite of food went past her lips she must admit she felt\u2026 full now. She slowly opened her mouth and\u2026. \"BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRP!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked up disturbed by the very loud and big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Excuse me.\" Kitty mumbled with a red face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bowed her head and saw that part of her tummy was poking out between her pants and shirt. Her shirt rode up a bit. It gave a good view at her belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"10,\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said: 10. You ate 10 large meals. I'm not sure Kitty but it looks like that hunger of yours gets bigger each day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right. Well better go get some clothes now. Now my belly is so totally full, I can, like, be sure the clothes'll fit around my big belly when it's full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out, getting some strange stares from other people as Kitty burped loudly every few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do *BBAAAURRRAAAPP* people maybe *OOOOUUUURRRRPPP* think I'm, like, pregnant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. People who are pregnant have big round bloated bellies. Also bigger boobs because they're gonna be filled with milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a big *UUURRRRAAAPPP* round belly. My boobs also got *BBBBURRRRRPPPP* bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like your thighs, butt, arms and face. Those don't get bigger with pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the clothing store. Kitty fast walked to the part she normally went but soon realized that those clothes wouldn't fit her anymore. But after looking a bit they found clothes for bigger woman. Kitty grabbed several clothes and took them to a dressing room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to stay here Kurt,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand you don't want me to see you undress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too but you need to tell me which outfits look best at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026. Do I need to look at you in all those outfits and tell you which one looks best? But that's gonna take...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to go to the mall with a girl shopping for clothes.

Either they were too tight that they nearly ripped open upon starting to go over her tummy or weren't big enough. Finally, Kitty decided to try the new pants she'd picked out, hoping they wouldn't be an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wrong. The first pair didn't even make it to her hips before becoming too tight. She bounced up and down, trying to force them up, only to make her belly and boobs jiggle in the process. The second pair did slightly better, but were too tight on her big plump butt while the third pair was similar to the first. Finally, Kitty just pulled on her old clothes and came back out to Kurt, who'd been waiting for her to show him the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, nothing totally fits me!\" Kitty groaned in dismay. \"Really? Nothing at all?\" Kurt asked with concern. \"No! Like, either I'm too big or they're not big enough or both! I'll, like, totally have to use a bedsheet and sumo-like diapers as clothes!\" Kitty sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a saleswoman came up. \"Are you having a tough time sweetie?\" she asked the sobbing Kitty. Kitty merely nodded and let out a hiccup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try a new plus sized store that opened two doors down? It's called Big, Plump Girls. They should have some clothes that'll fit you there.\" the woman smiled gently. \"Like, thanks.\" Kitty smiled as she handed the clothes over to the woman before she and Kurt went over to said store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gainer part of her liked that she was to fat for normal clothes. But there was another part of her that felt a bit embarrassed that she was to fat for regular clothes. However there was also a clothing store for fat girls. That was a good thing. When she was thin, she sometimes saw fat girls trying to squeeze themselves in the biggest clothes they had in the store. The only reason they took that clothes were because they were the only ones that fit them more or less. But to be honest Kitty didn't even would be found dead in those clothes. Perhaps they had some nice clothes for fat girls here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're in the right place. I'm sure we can find some clothes for you here,\" Kurt mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked around. She realized Kurt was right. There were a lot of fat girls around them.

If you really want a girlfriend Kurt then You need to do this with her... or me,\" Kitty said with a giggle and a jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt sighed and went sitting on a bench knowing that he would be sitting here for a long time. Telling himself that he would never agree on going to a clothing store with a girl. But finally, after trying on many outfits, Kitty bought the ones that looked best. She probably would come back here again. She needed clothes for her growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kurt I would say the shopping was, like, totally a success. I found a lot of nice clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for us to go back to the institute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. We need be in time for din\u2026\" Kitty's voice trailed of when there came a loud rumbling sound from her belly. \"Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Kitty this is a problem I don't have any more money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. What am I gonna do? If I don't get some food soon, I'm gonna eat everything in sight without caring.\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But neither of us has anymore money.\" Kurt protested with concern. Kitty whimpered as she eyed the food court. All that greasy, fattening and yummy food! Her belly rumbled and gurgled pleadingly. But she and Kurt didn't have anymore money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can find a free samples cart.\" Kurt offered. Kitty nodded and they went over to the food court. Then, they noticed a large sign. \"'All-U-Can Eat Day. All the food you can eat absolutely free'.\" Kurt read. \"Vell\u2026 I guess you can get something to eat after all Ki-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kitty was already at a burger stand. \"Like, I'll take five double cheeseburgers, six jumbo chocolate milkshakes four extra large fries and, like, an extra large basket of onion rings.\" She told the girl behind the counter. Soon, she was carrying the large tray of food to a table and, as Kurt watched in disbelief, devoured everything single handedly. Kurt tried to take a french-fry, only for Kitty to nearly bite his hand. Soon, Kitty was slurping up the final milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBURRRRAAAPPPP!* She burped loudly. \"Like, excuse me.\" she smiled sheepishly. Then, she got up and went to a taco stand. Within minutes, she came back with four jumbo burritos and eight grande sized tacos. Kurt just watched in disbelief as Kitty devoured the next meal with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on and on it went. Kitty, following her Mexican food gorge, went to a Chinese stand, ordering a large amount of said food and destroyed that. Then, she ate about a month's worth of pizza from a pizza stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her pizza feast, Kurt thought for sure that Kitty would be stuffed, but was proven wrong when Kitty got up and, much more bloated now, staggered slightly over to a fried chicken place and ordered a Super Mega Jumbo bucket of fried chicken. Finally, after eating the last piece (not leaving a piece of meat on the bones), Kitty leaned back, rubbing her now evidently full tummy as it bulged against the table, now covered in remains from the feast. Empty Chinese take out boxes stacked in each other, greasy wrappers from her burgers, empty milkshake cups and more now littered the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Kitty?\" Kurt asked, watching his stuffed friend and teammate with concern. Kitty nodded after a moment. \"Yeah. Like, I'm totally fine, Kurt...\" Then, she stopped and her cheeks puffed up as her belly rumbled and gurgled ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\" Kurt said. Then, Kitty opened her mouth. *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPP!* And let out the biggest belch yet. Everybody turned to look at her in disbelief, awe and disgust respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, excuse me.\" Kitty mumbled in embarrassment, her cheeks turning bright red as she kept rubbing her tummy. \"Vell, at least you shouldn't  need to eat dinner.\" Kurt pointed out as he helped Kitty stand up. Kitty nodded and grabbed her shopping bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I think we shouldn't tell anybody about this pig out, Kurt. I'll just say I ate dinner at the burger joint we stopped at.\" Kitty decided as she staggered slightly, still getting used to how full her now very big belly was, grateful she had gone with a very stretchy extra-large t-shirt and her elastic pants for the pig out as she and Kurt left, leaving only two things behind: very shocked employees and costumers plus a very dirty table.   </span></div></div>",

Do you have any idea how much you ate?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty bit her lip. She must admit that she didn't had a single clue what or how much she had eaten. The only thing she had cared about was feeding her tummy. The only thing she did remember was eating food. Well it was more wolfing down food then eating. She also knew that it was a lot. Her swollen belly was a proof of that. It was a good thing the clothes she bought were a few sizes bigger or else they might probably be tight already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Kurt I don't. There're two Kitty's inside me. The one I am now, also the one that bought clothes, and then there's the Kitty that thinks about nothing else then food and stuffing her face. Like well you know. I don't like that other Kitty. Most of the time I'm able to make her shut up by eating large meals. By the way did it look bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um you mean how you ate and left the table. In both cases... it was bad. Very bad. Most people there were shocked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Kitty moaned. \"How could I embarrass myself like that. That's another thing about the other Kitty. She totally doesn't care about anything else except feeding her tummy. She doesn't care about what other people think of her. Nor does she care of other people go hungry. Just as long if she isn't the one who goes hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a problem. But you ate a lot this morning and when we arrived at the mall. How is it able you were so hungry afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Kurt! All right?!?! I don't know. Perhaps the fact we walked to the mall. I mean that must cost some energy, right? I guess that made my body totally think that it might need some.extra fuel. But instead of a bit more, it became a lot more. Man if I keep this up, I won't be able to fit through the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later they arrived at the institute. Kitty went straight to her room with her bags. She plopped down on her bed which made cracking noises under her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may need a new bed too soon too. Well I have some nice clothes but all that walking did, like, totally poop me out. I'll just close my eyes for a few seconds...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she was out like a light. Kurt saw her and decided to let her sleep and poofed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't Kitty coming down for dinner?\" Professor X asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no. We went to the mall and ate some there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't have any problems?\" Professor X asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... no not... \" Kurt started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt you know I'm a telepath. I know when you're lying.  I rather have you tell me the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt sighed and knew lying wasn't a option. So he told everything what happened. Exactly how much Kitty ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Professor X said. \"It seems like her hunger attacks are getting worse. We still have no idea what's causing this. I will talk with Hank and Storm after dinner.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Slowly, she sat up, rubbing her belly. \"Like, what time is it?\" She wondered, noticing it was dark outside and that Rogue was asleep in her bed. Looking at her alarm clock, Kitty saw it was currently 12:02. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, midnight? I guess that totally makes sense since I ate a lot and fell asleep.\" Kitty decided. Her belly gurgled again, a little louder this time. \"Okay, belly. Like, don't worry. I'll totally put some food in you.\" she whispered to it, patting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Kitty got up and phased through the floor, straight into the kitchen. \"Like, I'll just totally have a tiny snack...\" Kitty told herself as she opened the fridge. And then, her hunger took control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a box of doughnuts and poured them into her mouth at once. Chewing nosily and rudely, she grabbed a loaf of bread and started shoveling slice after slice of it into her gullet, almost before she'd finished her doughnuts. After the bread, Kitty poured 7 jars of jelly into her mouth, getting some on her face and a few globs on her new t-shirt. Without pausing, Kitty then grabbed a large container of potato salad and devoured that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty kept eating and eating, not slowing down. Her belly grew rounder and rounder as she cleared each shelf of the fridge. A huge head of lettuce was next, with Kitty chugging an entire bottle of ranch dressing to wash it down. She also devoured the apples, oranges, cucumbers, cabbages, peaches and other foods like ham, bacon, eggs, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was just finishing the last of some leftover mac and cheese when she noticed a new cake Storm had made. It was five layers, with chocolate frosting. Kitty knew Storm wanted to save it for a cookout dinner they were having on Saturday, but the cake just sitting there was just torture for her. \"Like, Storm probably won't notice if I take, like, just a tiny, eensy weensy bite...\" she thought as she grabbed the cake and a fork. Needless to say, she didn't stop after the first bite. She inhaled the entire cake and licked the tray until it was spotless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kitty was sitting with her back against the fridge, panting heavily, the debris of her pig out littering the floor and fridge shelves. Her face was a mess of dressing, jelly, frosting, butter and other foods. Her t-shirt was also messy. Upon noticing some frosting on her shirt, Kitty promptly used her finger to lick it up. Then, after a moment, she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!* Kitty burped so long and loud, she honestly expected everybody to come downstairs within seconds. To her surprise (and relief), they didn't. She then looked around and seemed to notice what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, oh crap! I totally did it again! Ororo's gonna kill me when she finds out I ate her cake before the cookout! Not to mention I'm in deep trouble cause I, like, totally ate everything in the fridge!\" Kitty whimpered, one hand on her large belly, which was now poking out from under her t-shirt, exposing her bellybutton as she managed to haul herself up and managed to clean most of the debris up as well as wash/lick her face and t-shirt off. Then, fatigue completely slammed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, there's totally nothing more I can do about it now... I'll have to wait until morning... Maybe Storm and the others'll understand. Storm did seem to be okay with me when I ate those two slices of cake awhile back.\" she thought as she phased back into her and Rogue's room and got changed into her pajamas, her pink t-shirt barely covering her bellybutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, like, so totally pooped now. That pig out totally wiped me out...\" Kitty mumbled as she fell asleep again, her belly gurgling and grumbling quietly as it digested her enormous pig out, causing her to occasionally burp, hiccup and even fart in her sleep.</span></div></div>",

She felt a bit bad about what happened. Especially about the cake from Ororo. She worked so hard to make it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit it tasted delicious,\" Kitty mumbled. \"Maybe Ororo fells better if I tell her that\u2026 but I seriously doubt it. Well I can at least wear some of my new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling she crept out of bed and pulled her new clothes out of the bags and put them on. At least they still fit her. But she was worried that they would soon be to tight. To be honest that store had more nice clothes but she didn't have enough pocket money to buy new clothes every few days. To be honest she didn't wanna go back to the mall. Suppose she got another hunger attack? She'd already more or less ate all the allowance from Kurt. That all you can eat free was just luck. But she didn't thought that would be the same next time<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nShe walked downstairs straight to the kitchen. She wasn't alone. In the kitchen were Storm, Wolverine and Spyke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want breakfast kiddo you're out of luck. Someone ate everything we had in the fridge,\" Wolverine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He also ate the cake Auntie O made for the cookout,\" Spyke added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Kitty mumbled, stifling a large burp by turning her head and putting a hand over her mouth. \"Any idea who was behind it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well according to everything that has been eaten it was more then one person,\" Spyke said. \"That or the Blob. But I don't think he would come here just to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that would be very unlikely,\" Kitty agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But nothing else is gone,\" Wolverine said. \"There's not a trace that anyone broke in. So the people who have done are probably students here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty can you come with me for something?\" Storm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty got a hollow feeling in her belly and that wasn't only from her developing hunger. Slowly she followed Storm. When they were far enough from the kitchen Storm looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say anything Kitty. I know it was you. Don't worry\u2026 I'm not angry. If someone under normal circumstances would have eaten my cake and everything in the fridge I would be angry, but that hunger of yours is everything but normal. I still have time to bake a new cake as long if you don't eat that one also.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry Storm. It's just that I can't\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt told us what happened yesterday at the mall. He also told about everything what you ate. Don't be angry at him. Professor X asked him and you can't lie to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er... Storm where are we going?\"    </span></div></div>",

Storm knocked after a moment. \"Do not worry, Kitty.

Storm. Kitty.

Professor X quickly understood upon seeing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? Could you please look at me?\" He asked. Slowly, Kitty did this. \"How much did you eat?\" Xavier questioned gently. \"Like, the entire fridge. I totally even ate that five layer cake Ororo worked so hard on for the barbeque this weekend! I'm so sorry, Professor! I went downstairs last night to get a light snack but then Hungry Kitty took control and I stuffed myself like Blob! I didn't mean to!\" She sobbed, burying her face into her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty. It is alright. Kurt told me about your excursion to the mall last night and how you went overboard then as well. Despite the fact that you had just eaten 10 meals beforehand.\" Xavier said gently.

If I keep this up, I'm gonna, like, totally need to phase through the walls to get into a room cause my tummy'll be so round I'll get stuck!\" She hiccupped before blowing her nose after accepting a tissue from Storm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, please listen to me. We will all help you with this. From what we've seen over the last few weeks, your plan to overeat has somewhat restrained your otherwise enormous appetite. I believe you may need to step it up slightly.\" Xavier said kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty couldn't believe her ears. \"But, like, what'll the others say?\" she asked. \"I am sure they will be willing to help you Kitty. I will talk with Scott, Jean, Kurt, Rogue and Evan once you leave. I am certain even Rogue will be alright with helping curb your appetite more.\" Xavier smiled kindly. Kitty nodded and smiled as she stood up. \"But, like, what'll we do for breakfast in the meantime?\" she wondered. \"I just sent Logan out to pick up groceries. He should be back before the others fully awaken.\" Storm smiled, coming back into the room. \"Kitty, I will contact Scott and the others now.\" Xavier added as he began doing so.

Using her fork, she managed to shovel five of her 10 pancakes into her mouth whole, bulging her cheeks out like a chipmunk's. None of the others said anything as they watched her with wide eyes. Kitty chewed and then swallowed loudly before doing the same with the remaining pancakes. \"I can't believe that the K-girl can eat like that and not choke or anything, man.\" Evan whispered to Kurt as he ate a biscuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me. You should've seen her last night during the food court's All-U-Can-Eat thing. I thought she vas gonna eat the table at one point.\" Kurt replied with a slight smile as he drank some orange juice while they watched Kitty devour all four cinnamon rolls and then chug her big glass of milk, leaving a milk moustache as she forked all five pieces of bacon into her mouth before inhaling the large pile of scrambled eggs with record speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ate, Kitty felt the awful feeling bubbling in her belly. Hungry Kitty was coming out. \"Oh no! Like, not now!\" She thought pleadingly. However, it was too late. Before she could even think about what she was doing, Kitty grabbed Rogue's plate and poured it's entire contents into her mouth. \"Woah! Hey Kitty!\" Rogue yelped in surprise as Kitty licked the plate clean and then went for Scott's plate. Scott was so surprised, he couldn't say or do anything but watch his friend stuff her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, take it easy! You're loosing control again!\" Kurt warned with concern. Kitty just grabbed his plate and scarfed down the remaining contents before grabbing both Spyke and Jean's and doing the same thing. The X-Kids watched in disbelief as Kitty then went back to the breakfast bar and started reloading her plate, even more this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kitty felt very stuffed. Panting heavily after her 19th plate, she looked at her surprised friends and the pile of plates next to her. Slowly, what happened hit her as she eyed these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Like, I totally lost control again, didn't I?!?!?\" She wailed in dismay as she started bawling for the second time that day. \"It's okay, Kitty. We know you didn't mean to. That's what we're gonna help you control.\" Jean smiled gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Kitty hiccupped as she wiped her nose with a napkin. \"Sure, Kitty. We agreed to help you before breakfast didn't we?\" Scott smiled. Kurt, Rogue and Evan all nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks guys.\" Kitty smiled as she rubbed her large belly. Then, her belly gurgled and rumbled. \"Uh oh. I think I totally have a tummyache now.\" she groaned, clutching her big tummy. \"I think I better lay down for awhile.\" Kitty told the others as she staggered to her room, burping and groaning as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing the professor told us about her hunger. I still can't believe it. Bet she could even out eat Blob.\" Scott remarked in shock. \"I know. I think I have an idea for us to help her get her hunger back in control.\" Jean smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Evan asked. \"Well, what if we each split into groups and, whenever Kitty's hungry, we either make her an enormous meal here or we take her to a buffet. We'll keep doing that each day or so until Kitty's so full or sick to her stomach, her appetite will go back the way it was.\" Jean offered. \"It might work, but Ah think we should probably tell Ororo an' the other instructors first.\" Rogue advised as Scott and the others nodded in agreement.</span></div></div>",

Beast and Storm where there too and Scott told them their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does that sound? We take shifts to help her,\" Scott ended their plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I see the plan,\" Professor X said. \"But I don't think this will work. It's good that you want to help her. Don't get me wrong. But those hunger attacks more or less appear suddenly. Don't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they do,\" Jean admitted. \"I mean one moment we were just talking with her and the next moment everything was stuffed in her mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point,\" Professor X said. \"I'm afraid that when her hunger attacks start you don't have enough time to make a large meal or take her to a buffet. How are you planning to take her there in a few seconds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Nightcrawler can teleport\u2026.\" Evan tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That teleporting isn't as easy as it seems!\" Kurt said. \"Getting her there is a great distance and anyone could see us. Then they'd know we're mutants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That don't matter,\" Rogue said. \"They already knew we're mutants. The only reason they don't know you're a mutant is thanks to that device on your wrist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that how do you think Kitty might feel when she devours a entire buffet?\" Professor X said ignoring what the others said. \"How would you feel Jean if you would be Kitty's new size and devour a entire buffet in front of all other people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be embarrassed,\" Jane mumbled. \"Of course! We only thought about the problem. We didn't thought about Kitty's feelings. Or how to solve the problem. Only doing something when the problem already started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean is right,\" Kurt said. \"We're a joke. We think simple, but don't thought about the other part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid it's better Kitty doesn't leave the institute,\" Professor X said. \"Here everyone knows what's going on. That's better then getting nasty looks from other humans. However if you do make a huge meal then Kitty can eat it and perhaps get her hunger under control. So we'll make a extra big meal for her for breakfast, lunch and dinner. That might help stop her from getting a hunger attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand but aren't those huge meals gonna ruin her figure?\" Jean asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she doesn't eat huge meals she gets a hunger attack and eats everything in sight,\" Evan said. \"That'll ruin her figure anyway so that doesn't really matter.\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wished I knew who or what is the reason for those hunger attacks,\" Professor X said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, Kitty was laying on her bed. She'd taken a long nap and felt a lot better now that all that food was digested. Her belly was now much rounder and bigger looking. Curious, she poked it, her finger sinking into her soft, warm squishy blubber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling slightly, Kitty pulled her finger out and rubbed her big fat tummy lovingly. Then, she looked at her alarm clock. It now read 12:00. \"Wow. Like, I must've been sleepy. I totally slept until lunch!\" Kitty remarked while stretching. Then, her belly gurgled hopefully. \"Yeah belly. Like, totally time to go fill you again.\" Kitty giggled as she lovingly patted it. She then slowly phased into the kitchen again. To her surprise, no one was there making lunch or anything, though there was quite a few pots, pans and other items in the sink, so someone had to've been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that's weird. Where is everybody? Usually the kitchen's, like, totally full at lunch. I mean, I know the New Recruits are out for the day, but Scott and the others aren't here.\" Kitty remarked with concern. Then, she smelled something. Something tasty, greasy and deep fried. Her belly rumbled and gurgled in delight at the smell. \"Yeah I totally smell it too, tummy.\" Kitty told it as she followed the smell to the dining room. Kitty couldn't believe it. The long table was covered with food. Fried chicken, hot dogs, French fries, hamburgers, corn on the cob, crawdads, biscuits and at least 16 pies. Kitty was drooling just looking at the deep fried feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, who could've totally made all this?\" Kitty wondered, wiping her mouth. \"Ah did, sugah.\" Rogue said from behind Kitty. Kitty turned and saw Rogue wearing an apron. Scott and the others were beside her. \"Why?\" Kitty asked. \"Well, we had an idea ta help ya curb your hunger. We were plannin' on either stuffing you here or takin' ya to a buffet until your attacks quit. But the professor said we shouldn't take ya in public for awhile an' we weren't exactly thinkin' about your feelings 'bout your hunger attacks.\" Rogue explained with a genuinely sympathy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he did say we should make you big meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner.\" Scott added. \"Rogue offered to make you lunch since she's been cooking since she was four.\" Jean added with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Where Ah'm from, ya kinda learn to cook either durin' or after you begin toilet trainin'.\" Rogue explained with a smile. \"Well, like, thanks guys.\" Kitty smiled as she grabbed a large drumstick and took a bite. Flavor burst into her mouth and she began tearing into the food. \"Good thing we ate beforehand. Otherwise I don't think we're gonna need anymore.\" Scott remarked as Kitty stuffed more chicken into her mouth, grease and sauce covering her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty kept eating, each piece of food inhaled within seconds. Finally, Kitty reached the pies and, skipping the knife and forks, buried her face into each one, loudly gobbling it down. On and on it went, with Kitty eating each pie like she was a pig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Kitty leaned back, panting and very stuffed. Her face was a mess of sauce, grease, butter and pie fillings. \"That... *BBBBUURRRRRRPPPPP* was so totally yummy, Rogue! Thanks for everything! Especially, like, those last 16 pies!\" Kitty smiled as she managed to stand up and stagger out, burping and hiccupping loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. I don't believe it. She ate everything on the table!\" Jean gasped as she eyed the huge stack of plates, trays, pie tins and other items. \"Yeah. And she didn't even blink an eye!\" Scott agreed in disbelief. \"Vell, at least it vas not Hungry Kitty this time.\" Kurt pointed out gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But still man. K-girl's gotta cut back on the eatin'.\" Evan said with concern. \"That's why the Professor's having us make her enormous meals for each course, Spyke. The question is, who's gonna make dinner?\" Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can. I know a few of my grandmother's recipes that may help fill Kitty up more quickly.\" Jean offered. \"Alright. Just remember to sit a few of them aside for us first.\" Scott advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Teasing someone because he or she is fat and eats a lot, that happens a lot. But teasing someone because of their weight while they can't help it... that's just low. Very low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now I at least don't have to hide my huge meals anymore. That's a good thing. And the other help me by making huge meals. At least this way I don't have to worry hungry kitten is gonna appear. Well even if she does the others would't make a problem of it. I just wish I would know why I have this huge hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner Time!\" She heard Jean yell from downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just faded through the floor entering the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are,\" Jean said. \"I decided to cook. I used some of my grandmothers recipes. They're very filling. I thought it would be good for you. Since they are filling, you probably need to eat less to get full. When you eat less you won't gain so much weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I really gained a lot of weight didn't I? Well it's not all bad. I mean my boobs did grew a few cup sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean smiled. She was comfortable with her own cup sizes but understood very well that young kids of Kitty's age sometimes were very ashamed because of their body and wanted bigger boobs. She knew very well that some girls stuffed their bra with socks, toilet paper or tissues. She once met a girl that used chicken filet. Sadly enough enough for her people found out when she went to the swimming pool at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also got some more female curves, it does gives me a bit more female look,\" Kitty continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty... don't get this the wrong way. It did gave you maybe some female curves... but It also gave you some curves at places\u2026 that shouldn't be curved. No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some taken,\" Kitty mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others walked in looking at Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jean cooked for you. All food that's on the table is for you,\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about you?\" Kitty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean put some food aside for us,\" Scott said. \"We know you can't help it and we do wanna help you, but that doesn't say we don't have to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can understand that,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But while you busy eating all that food we can eat without someones eating our food from our plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt a bit guilty about eating their food at breakfast and not leaving a single crumb of food after lunch. She could have saved a few pies for the others. Well a bit too late to think about that now. At least now she could eat knowing that the others would have food also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean gave Kitty a huge helping and put the rest of the food in front of Kitty and gave the others their helping. Kitty started eating her food fast, hoping Hungry Kitty wouldn't suddenly come up. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Kitty! Snap outta it sugah! You're startin' ta loose control!\" Rogue shouted as she barely moved her hand away in time as her best friend, teammate and roommate began scarfing down Rogue's helping of the chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans and gravy. After doing the same to Scott and Evan's, Kitty then started eating from the large bowls and tray themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jean, I thought you said your grandmothers' recipes were very filling!\" Scott said with concern as Kitty loudly gulped down the rest of the gravy from the gravy boat, spilling some on her t-shirt. \"I really thought so, Scott! Hungry Kitty must've surfaced before Kitty could even start feeling stuffed.\" Jean realized as Kitty shoved the rest of the chicken into her mouth and swallowed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kitty was leaning back in her chair, moaning and groaning loudly, her tongue lolling out of her mouth as she panted heavily. Her belly was so swollen, she looked like a pumpkin. Gravy was smeared around her mouth, which her tongue started lapping up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Now I think the stuffed feeling's working.\" Jean said. \"Yeah. Good thing we ate most of our dinners before she got 'em.\" Evan agreed as the others nodded. \"Kitty? Are you feeling alright?\" Kurt asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo\u2026 Like, I'm sooo full, my tummy's *BBBURRRRRRAAAPPPPP* like a lead ball. Why did I ate the entire chicken?\" Kitty moaned, her face turning bright green as her belly gurgled and burbled in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did warn you that my grandma's food was very filling.\" Jean said gently. \"Yeah. But, like, Hungry Kitty didn't wanna listen so now I totally gotta stuffer her poopy mistake...\" Kitty whimpered as she barely managed to heave herself up on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do ya need help gettin' back to our room, Kit?\" Rogue asked as Kitty stumbled slightly. \"N-No. Like, I got it.\" Kitty groaned as she slowly regained her footing and managed to walk out, burping, moaning and whimpering in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should've doubled the meal's size.\" Jean remarked with concern. \"Yeah. But what's done is done, Jean. You did your best and it was a good meal.\" Scott smiled gently. \"You think the K-girl's gonna be okay?\" Evan asked with concern. \"I think so.\" Kurt said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, they heard a large SNAP and a THUD! \"Ouchie! Like, there goes my bed!\" They heard Kitty cry in dismay. \"An' we better tell the Professor that Kitty's gonna need a bigger and stronger bed.\" Rogue added. \"Who should cover breakfast?\" Evan asked. \"I guess I can.\" Scott offered. \"Vhat're you gonna make?\" Kurt asked. \"You'll see.\" Scott smiled.</span></div></div>",

That she had gotten too fat for her own bed. This was probably one of the reasons why people did't wanna become obese. She must admit it did had his downsides. But she accepted the weight gain. But the part she hated was the hunger attacks. Also the fact that she ate the food of the others. Eating more then all the others was fine but eating their food... well that was just wrong. Especially since they tried to help her.<br>\r\nShe slowly rolled of her mattress like a beached whale. She got up on hands and knees.

How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slept so peacefully,\" Rogue said and smiled. \"I just could't bring myself to wake you up.

We're not mad at you that you eat our food too. It also seems that it is't fun for you either. But well we also need to eat. So that's why we ate breakfast before you woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt a bit offended by that. But soon she realized that she ate their breakfast and dinner yesterday she must admit she could understand that they also wanted to eat and with hungry Kitty who seemed like she could appear at any moment it was wiser for them to eat while she was't around. But still\u2026. it was no fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did had breakfast before you. However I did make you breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Oh that's so nice. I love you guys.

I don't really like hungry Kitty. She does't think about anyone else besides herself. She dies't care about anything except filling her tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah!\" Kitty said annoyed. \"I'm thank full for it Scott. Can I eat now? If I don't fill my tummy soon you know who comes out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Scott said. \"Go ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Kitty started eating.

Sure enough, Hungry Kitty was taking over. Within seconds, Kitty had shoved a giant forkful of pancakes into her mouth and swallowed them with a large gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the table eagerly, she grabbed a tray of doughnuts and stuffed ten of them into her mouth at once, swallowing them after barely chewing them. After Kitty had eaten the last few doughnuts, she grabbed a platter of bacon and shoved handful after handful into her gullet, gulping loudly and loudly licking and smacking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-Kids just watched in disbelief. \"Scott, I don't think your idea's working.\" Jean said as Kitty then guzzled down a very big pitcher of pulp-free orange juice, belching loudly after doing so before going back to scarfing down hash browns, sausages, scrambled eggs, ham, omelets, fruit and another tray of pastries. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, \"*BBBURRRRRRRRRAAAAUUUPPP!!*\" Kitty belched loudly, her stomach pressing against the table due to how big and fat it now was. Slowly, she noticed her friends' expressions and quickly realized what had happened. \"Like, I totally lost control again, didn't I?\" She whimpered sadly. Scott and the others all nodded silently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Kitty. We know you didn't mean to.\" Jean said kindly. Suddenly, *SNAP!* Kitty's chair broke under her large girth, causing the now obese girl to plop onto the floor with a *THUD* \"Owie! Like, that's the second piece of furniture I've totally broken in two days!\" Kitty moaned, rubbing her hippo sized butt as tears welled up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, we know it's not your fault. We told Professor X last night when you went to bed about your bed breaking and he guessed we'd likely need to order more chairs and things in case this happened anyway.\" Scott told her as he and Kurt heaved Kitty up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I hope we find out what's causing this hunger soon. I don't wanna be immobile.\" Kitty whimpered as she went to get dressed. As she did, Scott and the others eyed the debris from her pig out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One meal down. Two or so more to go, depending on Hungry Kitty's appearances.\" Kurt said with concern. \"Ah know. I hate ta say it, but Ah think we may need to... increase the meals' sizes.\" Rogue said gently. \"What do you mean?\" Evan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, the cookout's this weekend. That don't give us a lotta time to help Kitty. So Ah'm thinkin' we ask Storm to help us create meals so big, that even Hungry Kitty can't eat 'em all, startin' today.\" Rogue explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty waddled back in, wearing some more of her new clothes. Even though only two days had passed, she'd outgrown most of them. This was especially evident in her current jeans, which gave her a large muffin top belly. Before anyone could say a word, her pants button popped off with a loud *Ping* and would've socked Rogue in the eye if she didn't dodge in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess I'll totally need to buy new ones.\" Kitty whimpered as she held her pants up so the others wouldn't see her undies, grateful she'd bought the very stretchy underpants from the store that both she and Kurt had gone to two days prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty went to change into a large skirt she'd bought from the store as well before going go to buy more pants, Scott turned to the other X-Kids. \"Okay. Rogue's right. With the cookout this weekend, we can't afford to have Hungry Kitty attack then. We'd better tell Storm now so she knows.\" He told the others as they set off to do so.</span></div></div>",

Evan knocked at the door and after a: \"Come in.\" All teens entered the room and looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Storm asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is the thing,\" Scott said. \"We been doing what the professor told us. We made huge meals for Kitty but for some reason she keeps losing control. Hungry Kitty appears and eats everything. Including the food of everyone else. We're not mad at her since we know she can't help it. However we need to perhaps well... make bigger meals. We thought you could help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also need to make sure nothing happens at the cookout,\" Evan said. \"Especially since you practiced so much to make a perfect cake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know,\" Storm said. \"Kitty is eating huge meals all ready. You want to make even bigger meals.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she has eaten everything we had previous lunches and dinners,\" Jane said. \"Even while my grandmothers meals were very filling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do believe she had a tummy ache afterwards because of the filling food,\" Scott said. \"Hungry kitten does't listen to warnings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think to hungry kitten it does't matter what she eats, or how filling it is as long if it is a lot. She also keeps eating until everything is gone,\" Rogue complained. \"Sure we know she can't help it but we need to do something. We guess making even bigger meals might help her. We need to get her appetite under control. Especially with the cookout coming up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm nodded slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you mean,\" Storm said. \"Kitty is losing control more often. You think bigger meals could help her. Well I'm not sure if it will help her. But at the other hand we can try. Nothing else have helped until now. So I guess I can try seeing if this helps. Then at least we have some kind of solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks auntie O,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Okay Evan,\" Storm said. \"I'm always willing to help all of you. Even a hungry Kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the others smiled a bit since that sentence could mean two things.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well then, I better can start making lunch,\" Storm said and walked out of her room followed by all others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm went straight to the kitchen. Put some pans on the stove and poured some butter in them. Grabbed some bread and made some peanut butter jelly sandwiches. She bakes some eggs and cooked some other and used the leftover eggs to make omelets. She took more break from the freezer and make toasts with cheese, ham or both. Also cut some fruit for a fruit salad. Backed some bacon. Some bread rolls with mozzarella and put them in the oven. She also made some spaghetti and tomato sauce with meat balls. She also made some wraps filled with salad, salmon, cheese or salad and mackerel. She also made some break with salad and fish or cheese. Also cooked some vegetables cutting them in tiny pieces baking them wit some bacon. She even made some cakes and pies. A few stacks of pancakes and more food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Storm was done she was exhausted. Sweat was dripping from her face. The kitchen was a total mess with dirty pots and pans. empty plates and empty boxes and bags  But no matter how messy the kitchen was it was a huge meal. There was so much food on the table you could barely see the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this be enough?\" Rogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so,\" Evan said. \"To be honest I hope it's more the she can eat. Then I can also take a bit of this food. This stuff is delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps she leaves some,\" Kurt said. \"But with hungry Kitty around\u2026 I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe we're able with all this food to stop hungry Kitty from coming out at all,\" Jane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we soon will find out,\" Scott said. \"It's lunch time.\"  </span></div></div>",

What's...\" But she was cut short by a loud rumble in her belly. \"Like, I need food now!\" She told them. \"Look in the dining room.\" Jean said with a smile. Kitty, surprisingly quick for a girl her size, raced in and squealed in delight at the ginormous meal for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yummy!\" She cheered and with that, Hungry Kitty charged the food. First, Kitty started with the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, stuffing two into her gullet at a time, chewing and gulping loudly. Then, she loudly scarfed down the eggs and omelets, licking each plate clean to make sure she didn't miss a single crumb. Then, came the tray of bacon and fruit salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-Kids and Storm all watched, nervously. Hungry Kitty wasn't showing any sign of stopping yet and she still had quite a bit to eat. They only had today to curb Kitty's appetite before the cookout and this, along with dinner, would be their final chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya think this'll work?\" Rogue asked as Kitty buried her face into the giant plate of spaghetti and meatballs, loudly slurping the noodles up as sauce coated her face before spearing all of the meatballs in one go with her fork and plopping them into her mouth after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope so, Rogue. Otherwise the cookout's gonna be a massacre tomorrow.\" Scott remarked as Kitty moved to the salad, salmon, cheese, salad and mackerel wraps, inhaling each one. By now, her belly was even plumper, starting to hang over her pants' waistband as she, with some difficultly, managed to cram the entire stack of pancakes into her mouth, stretching it rather wide as she chewed and swallowed with a very loud gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then grabbed the veggie and bacon dish and wolfed that down with ease along with the bread. Now, came the pies and cakes. But just as Kitty picked up the first apple and cinnamon pie, Jean noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think she's slowing down!\" she said excitedly. Sure enough, Kitty's chewing wasn't at top speed now. In fact, it was getting slower and slower. Finally, Kitty licked the tray clean and let out a very big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!* Oooohh\u2026 Like, too... much... foooooddd\u2026\" She moaned, turning bright green as her belly rumbled and gurgled deafeningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it worked!\" Scott shouted in excitement as the others cheered as well while Storm merely smiled. Kitty looked at her celebrating friends and quickly realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-like *Urp* you *hic* totally *hic-urp* filled Hungry *burp* Kitty *belch* early.\" She groaned between each burp and hiccup, her tummy still making alarming noises. \"Yeah. Sorry to do this to you but we figured to make meals so big even Hungry Kitty couldn't keep up.\" Scott apologized as Rogue and Spyke helped heave the enormous Kitty up from her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess it's totally okay. I think it may've worked this time.\" Kitty smiled, having calmed down a bit in the indigestion department. Then, she yawned loudly. \"But, like, I'm totally pooped now. I'm gonna go lay down and digest before dinnertime.\" She told them as she slowly waddled away, still lime green and burping and hiccupping loudly. She even farted very loudly at least six times before she completely left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least she saved us dessert.\" Kurt pointed out as he and the others looked at Storm's remaining cakes and pies. \"Yes. I can put some of them away for both dinner and the cookout tomorrow.\" Storm agreed with a smile. \"Hey, Auntie O, could we have one since we didn't get dessert with our lunch yet?\" Evan asked. \"I suppose so, Evan.\" Storm sighed with an amused smile as Jean levitated a large chocolate cake over to her and the others while Storm set to work gathering the remaining ones.</span></div></div>",

Problem was that hungry Kitty did't knew her limit causing Kitty to have belly aches after every meal. Lucky for her Kurt and Jane helped her by giving her tummy rubs that did fell pretty nice and also helped against the tummy aches.<br>\r\nBut then came the day they all feared for. The cookout day. <br>\r\nKitty woke up. Looking at her body that was bigger each day. If she kept gaining she needed to start wearing bed sheets. Or somebody who might be willing to make some big clothes for her. She rubbed her belly. She liked it when the food was digested. Then it was soft and squishy like a nice pillow. Downside about this was it meant she would soon be hungry. She really need to eat. Today was the cookout. She ran downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kitty you're up,\" Jane said. \"We made some breakfast for you in the dining room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I would't want to have hungry Kitty at the cookout.\" Kitty said and ran over to the dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table was full of food. Sandwiches, omelets, baked eggs, omelets, boiled eggs, pasta, meatloaf, toasts, pancakes, waffles, wraps and a few buckets of chicken.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yummy. lets hope it's enough to shut up hungry Kitty,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that lately it was getting harder and harder to get hungry Kitty under control. She could't do anything about it. It was like a sirens call. But at least then you could stuff your ears with wax or let someone tie you to the mast of a ship. That would help her since she would phase right through the ropes. <br>\r\nKitty decided not to think about anymore and do why she came here for and started to stuff her face. She ate and ate Sandwiches omelets and baked eggs. It all tasted delicious. Especially the waffles. But the strange feeling she normally had did't happen. Was she finally rid of hungry Kitty? could it be?However she kept eating and eating. But a bit more slowly. She was already halfway done and still nothing from hungry Kitty. She finished of the meatloaf the went after the toasts and some of the other food. But suddenly she stopped eating. She let out a soft girly: \"burp.\" and giggled.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm full. No hungry Kitty. I did it. Better lay down for a while to let all this food digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up to her room and went lying on her new bed and soon fell asleep. A few hours later she woke up thanks to the sound of voices outside.<br>\r\nShe looked out of her window. The cookout started. A lot of people showed up. Many parents and siblings from some of the other students joined the cookout. Many people were talking with each other and laughing. Students showed their family where everything  was and introduced them to others. Also some other new people appeared to have joined the party. Perhaps some people who had a mutant child and were planning to put their child here but were't entirely sure. Or maybe some friends of others. But many people brought food.<br>\r\nKitty went pale. She knew what was gonna happen. But she did't want this to happen. Not now. Not with all this people around. Sure the others knew what was going on, but not all new students did nor their parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh all that food,\" Kitty mumbled when a familiar but unpleasant feeling appeared in her belly. \"Oh no. Not now. Please not now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Kitty's last thought before Kitty was gone and Hungry Kitty took full control. She faded right through the floor and as soon as she landed she ran straight through the wall the the garden were the cookout was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Kitty,\" Rogue said who noticed her first. \"Kitty do you feel all right? You have a strange look in your eyes. Oh no. Please don't tell this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUNGRY!!!\" Kitty yelled in Rogue's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It's hungry Kitty,\" Rogue mumbled on a defeated tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other started to notice her too and realized that it was hungry Kitty. Could't really miss it. Because Kitty ran at the table were Storm's cake stood and almost inhaled it. She ran over to another plate with pastries and stuffed them in her mouth so fast people almost could't keep track. Cinnamon rolls, steaks, hot dogs, hum burgers, cake, pies, fishes, squid, weenies, chili, pizza's and all other kinds of food. It did't really matter anything to Kitty. As long if it was edible and could fill her empty tummy. Hungry Kitty did't cared about anything else. She just stuffed everything she could find in her mouth. Kitty barely tasted the food. It did't matter to her. She ripped of pieces of the steak like a predator. Stuffed the hot dogs in her mouth two at a time.<br>\r\nSlowly all guests stopped with what they were doing or were talking about and started looking at the morbidly obese girl that was pigging out on the food for the cookout making herself even fatter. <br>\r\nFinally Kitty swallowed the last crumb and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!! Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kitty saw all the shocked faces of all the people and the all the empty plates and the realized what she had done. Her face got as red if a tomato from embarrassment. Her eyes got wet and the next moment she ran inside crying straight to her room. She jumped on her new bed and started sobbing in her pillow. Then she noticed something else. Her tummy. It felt awful. She had a terrible tummy ache. No wonder if you realized all the stuff she had eaten. Now she was in pain and could never show her face to the others ever again. This day could't get any worse.       <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Sniffling, Kitty managed to sit up, despite her belly's protests. \"C-c-come in.\" She whimpered, while wiping her eyes. Storm opened the door and slowly walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, she sat down next to Kitty. \"Are you alright?\" she asked. Kitty shook her head. \"No I'm not okay, Ororo! Like, Hungry Kitty attacked worse than ever! I totally thought she was under control again when she didn't strike during breakfast but then the cookout began and when she saw all that yummy food, she just snapped. Now I had a terrible tummy ache and I can't show my face to the others again! I'm such a big greedy selfish pig!\" Kitty wailed, burying her face in her hands and sobbing anew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty. It is alright. We all knew this might happen, remember? We honesty let our guard down after seeing how well breakfast went with you as well. Scott and the other upper classmen are currently explaining everything to the New Recruits right now so they understand too. The parents are freaked out a little as well, but they seemed to calm down when Charles told them after you left.\" Storm said assuredly. Kitty blew her nose loudly and sniffled as she looked up at her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" She hiccupped, her belly gurgling slightly now. \"Yes. Believe me, Kitty. The New Recruits will still like you no matter what. In fact, Jamie told me he, Amara and Tabitha would like to talk with you once your stomach calms down and the cookout ends.\" Ororo smiled as she gently hugged Kitty. \"What about?\" Kitty asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would not say. Tabitha wants it to be a surprise.\" Ororo admitted with a nervous look. Tabitha, or as she and the others called her \"Boom-Boom\", was often unpredictable and had often rebellious ideas. But she was a good person despite the rebellious side of her and got along with most of the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Like, tell them I'll be down in a bit.\" Kitty smiled as she managed to stand up upon hearing her belly gurgle urgently. \"Are you alright?\" Ororo asked as she too stood up. \"Yeah. Like, I totally just gotta use the bathroom.\" Kitty explained as she quickly raced into the bathroom. Storm watched with concern. Then she heard a giant fart, splash and Kitty sigh in relief. \"It's okay! Like, I just totally had to take a poop!\" Kitty called, somehow sensing Storm's concern as she let out another, longer fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm just smiled, relieved Kitty seemed to be feeling better, and went to inform Jamie, Amara and Tabitha that Kitty would be down soon to talk with them and hear Tabby's idea. She hoped Tabitha's idea wouldn't get the trio, or Kitty, in trouble.</span></div></div>",

She did't want them to see her. A girl who acted like a greedy pig. She sighed and walked further and saw Jamie, Tabitha and Amara.

You're worried about that you ate to much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you seemed kind of upset.\" Tabithia said. \"You know what always makes me feel better? Going on a shopping spree. We go and we want you too come with us. Besides I do think You need some bigger clothes don't you. Guess you need to go for a store for big sizes. But well that's no problem is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty remembered exactly were the store was for big sizes. She must admit it was a nice store. They also had some nice clothing. But she had two problems. She did't had any pocket money and what would happen if hungry Kitty showed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure you guys. I would love to go on a shopping spree with you. I really do. But I don't have any pocket money left and what will happen if  hungry Kitty appears?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well you don't have to worry about pocket money,\" Storm said who suddenly appeared. \"Professor X told your parents about your hunger right after the first time you told us. So since the clothing problems are not really your fault he decided to send you some extra pocket money to buy bigger clothes. Don't forget to thank him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Kitty smiled weakly. That solves on problem. But I don't wanna sound ungrateful but what Do I do when Hungry Kitty appears?\" Kitty asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she ate so much at the cake out she did still feel pretty stuffed. But she knew very well that could soon change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a solution for every problem,\" Tabithia said. \"We take you on a shopping spree and a pig out session!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really guys?

They had considered walking there, but Kitty knew she'd likely get very pooped before they even reached the mall due to her girth. So, Tabitha, having \"burrowed\" Lance's jeep, decided to use that. For once, Tabitha actually drove pretty smoothly and they were soon heading for the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I really don't wanna put you guys out of your money like I did with Kurt a few days ago.\" Kitty was saying from the backseat. She and Jamie were sitting there together while Amara was in the shotgun seat. \"Hey. Don't worry, Kitty. I told you I've got an idea.\" Tabitha smiled as they drove. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty felt that rumbly, gurgly feeling in her tummy again. \"Uh oh.\" She said. \"What's wrong?\" Jamie asked, his 11-year-old eyes wide with concern. \"Tabitha, it's happening.\" Kitty groaned, clutching her stomach. \"What?\" Amara said with concern for her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Hungry Kitty wants out!\" Kitty whimpered as her stomach kept rumbling and burbling, getting louder and louder with each one. \"Okay!\" Tabitha called as she gunned the engine and drove the jeep to a new buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this, Tabitha?\" Amara asked as they climbed out and Kitty nearly bowled Jamie over darting inside. \"Relax, 'Mara. I told you I got a plan and we'll use it soon.\" Tabitha smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio followed Kitty inside and found her already loading a plate with pizza, chicken, cake, cookies, pie, burgers, corn dogs, ham and doughnuts. \"Uh, Tabby? What's your plan?\" Jamie asked as he eyed Kitty's giant meal. Tabitha merely smiled, grabbed a plate and started loading it with the same amount of food as Kitty. Kitty seemed surprised for a second, but merely shrugged and took the extremely full plate to a booth. \"C'mon guys! This buffet's got a deal: Eat all you can and you get all meals free for the rest of your life!\" Tabitha smiled as she grabbed a rather giant drumstick from her plate and took a big bite. Amara and Jamie looked at each other doubtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabitha, I don't think we can eat all this food too.\" Amara said nervously. \"Sure you can Amara! That's why I brought you!\" replied Tabby, her cheeks bulging as she stuffed two cookies into her mouth while she kept eating her chicken. Kitty, meanwhile, was already mowing through her burgers, starting with one, then managing to stuff four more into her mouth at the same time before swallowing with a very big gulp, nearly choking as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why am I here?\" Jamie asked Tabitha. \"We need a cheering section, Jamie baby. You can eat some of you want.\" Tabitha explained as she finished the chicken and shoved two big slices of cheese and pepperoni pizza into her gullet. With a nervous look, Amara grabbed a plate and loaded it with the same pile of food as her friends had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie watched as the three girls chowed down. Kitty was finishing her first plate and managed to get up and refilled it, this time with hoagies, roast beef sandwiches, and other foods. Jamie decided to take a few cookies to eat, not wanting to go overboard as he watched and encouraged his three friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time ticked on Amara and Tabitha's bellies swelled up as they went back for seconds, thirds fourths and fifths. Kitty was already eating her 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th helpings, her belly starting to push against the table. During the third course, Tabitha had to unbutton her pants and loosen her belt so they didn't pop off due to her belly starting to feel restrained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara only had to undo her pants button since her pants didn't need a belt to hold them up. Kitty didn't even bother to do either of these since she knew they'd give way to her girth anyway and this proved true when her button popped off and nearly put out Tabby's eye if she hadn't ducked in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the three girls swallowed their last few crumbs and leaned back, stuffed and happy. \"Like, oh boy. That was totally worth Hungry Kitty's appearance.\" Kitty smiled, patting her enormous belly in delight before burping loud and long. \"See? Told ya this'd pay off.\" Tabitha smiled before letting out a giant burp as she rubbed her own bowling ball shaped tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like, your idea was to go to this buffet, pig out with me and then I'll get meals here free for the rest of our lives?\" Kitty asked in surprise, lovingly stroking her big belly as it churned all the food in it. \"Yep!\" Tabitha smiled, licking her fingers off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara? Are you okay?\" Jamie asked, upon noticing said girl's pained face as she clutched her poor tummy in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I'm gonna explode.\" Amara groaned, letting out an equally jumbo burp, her cheeks bulging as she did. \"Do you guys still feel like going to the mall?\" Jamie asked as he eyed both the girls and the other diners watching them in disbelief, disgust and/or awe. \"Yeah, Jamie baby. It'll give us time to- *URRRRRRRPPPP!* digest.\" Tabitha smiled, burping loudly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or loose our lunch.\" Amara moaned, hands on her head as she rested her chin on the table before burping loudly again herself, her face slightly green.  </span></div></div>",

I also never felt so stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop whining,\" Tabitha said. \"Be happy. We did it. With a lot of help from hungry Kitty but you must admit we put in a lot of the work too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides Amara you were always stick thin,\" Kitty said. \"I think some extra pounds will look great at you. Give you some female curves. They will look great at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O really?\" Amara mumbled on a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" Tabitha confirmed. \"Of course I already have perfect female curves but making them a bit bigger would be great. What do you say Amara. Don't you want a hot body with female curves where all men will drool over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if it's worth this pain,\" Amara moaned. \"Let's go look for some new clothes. I don't think my old clothes will fit me any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know a place!\" Kitty yelled excited. \"I've been there one time before with Kurt. It is a place with clothes for girls with a few extra pounds on them. Like me. It's a cool place. Not far from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I suggest will go there.\" Tabitha said and stood up. \"Kitty lead the way because well you know where it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait if it's a place for girls can I enter?\" Jamie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, as long if you don't look in the changing rooms,\" Tabitha said on a sweet tone. \"Besides we need some advice how our outfits look. We of course need the opinion from a boy because one reason we dress nice is because we want to get attention from nice guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to get attention from guys all you have to do is show your naked boobs or walk around naked,\" Amara mumbled. \"Believe me then you get enough attention from men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that's not really the attention we want,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Kitty saw the store. Big plump girls. Clothes for larger girls. The four entered the store and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit that they do have nice clothes here. Amara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they really do,\" Tabitha added. \"I did't know they had this much nice clothes for bigger girls. That fat girls at our school normally Always wore tasteless clothes. To be honest I would't even wanna found dead in them. But those at the other  hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna be found alive in them. So people see how good I look in them,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls started grabbing clothes and started trying on clothes. Poor Jamie was place on a chair and told not to move and tell them any time how good the clothes looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Amara bought some black with red clothes that looked really good at her and remembered the other three at her magma form. Tabitha got some jeans and purple shirts. Kitty was wise enough to buy clothes a few sizes bigger then her current size and made sure they were elastic. At least this way her clothes would last for longer the just a few days. She also bought a new bikini since it had been pretty hot the past days.<br>\r\nThey all four  left the store with a few bags filled with clothes. Kitty must admit that Tabitha had been right. This did cheer her up. She barely thought about her binge at the cookout. She also felt happy that she had some new clothes. She also was surprised how nice Tabitha was to her. Normally she was a rebel at hart who did nothing else then causing problems for herself and the others around her. But nothing of that hat happened today. At lest not as far if she knew.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Not again!\" She whimpered, clutching her tummy in agony. \"Hungry Kitty?\" Tabitha guessed in concern. Kitty merely nodded as she felt said persona taking over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need food now!!!\" She cried desperately. \"Okay! C'mon, guys. We gotta get her to the food court!\" Tabitha shouted, taking Kitty's arm. Quickly, the four raced for the food court. Upon reaching it, they were in for a nasty shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost all the booths were closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd they close down? It's still afternoon.\" Amara remarked. Kitty blushed as she realized the reason. \"Because, like, I totally demolished their food supplies last time I was here.\" She confessed with a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue did mention that.\" Tabitha remembered, using her nickname for Nightcrawler. \"Well, what're we gonna do?\" Jamie asked as Kitty doubled over again due to the rumbly, gurgly feeling in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was quiet and then got an idea. \"Over here!\" She said, pulling Kitty over to a large mall restaurant nearby. Amara and Jamie quickly followed. A bright chipper waitress came up after a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Welcome to Big Belly Bomb. Table for how many?\" She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Table for four and could you make it a booth please? Our friend really needs food now!\" Tabitha said quickly, nodding to Kitty. The waitress seemed to understand after eying Kitty's agony and quickly led them to the biggest booth in the place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so big, you probably could've fitted everybody from the mansion in it and still have room for some of Jamie's duplicates left over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, the woman returned with menus for them. \"What'll you have to drink?\" she asked. \"Um, I'll have an Orange soda.\" Amara said politely. \"I'll take four chocolate milkshakes.\" Kitty said. \"Root beer for me and Jamie.\" Tabitha added as Jamie nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress nodded. \"And have you decided what to order?\" she asked. \"No. Have any suggestions?\" Tabitha replied. The waitress smiled politely. \"Well, we have Jumbo Gut Bombs... we also have some awesome lasagna... turkey... hoagies... and every kind of dessert you can think off!\" the waitress smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Kitty, Tabitha and even Amara's tongue's practically flopped onto the table in delight. \"Sounds great! Like, give us four orders of everything!\" Kitty squealed. \"You must really be starving in order to order that much.\" remarked the waitress in surprise as she went to fill the order. Once she did, Kitty, Tabitha and Amara all tied napkins around their necks eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get some of your guys' food?\" Jamie asked gently. \"Sure thing babycakes.\" Tabitha smiled as they waited. \"It better not take too long. Otherwise I'm gonna start eating other people's food.\" Kitty warned. \"Yeah, Kurt told me about that cold burger you ate during your first public pig out.\" Jamie admitted. Kitty blushed sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, normally I wouldn't do that but I was so hungry. Luckily, the people who bought that meal had left beforehand. But, like, it was still totally humiliating.\" Kitty said as her stomach let out a giant rumble, causing several people to look up in surprise.</span></div></div>",

But soon their food was ready. As soon if the waitress put the plates down Kitty started stuffing her face like if she had't eaten in days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you really were hungry,\"The waitress said. \"I get the rest of your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was't the only one. Tabithia was also pigging out. Amara also was eating pretty fast but Kitty noticed she was doubting. She ate fast but was mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really shoud't be doing this but I'm really hungry. But I don't want to feel sick again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty focused on her lasagna. It was richly filled with sauce and meat and delicious cheese on top. It tasted pretty good. Also Jamie took a tiny piece of it however it was't much to what the girls were eating. <br>\r\nAfter the lasagna was gone the girls attacked the tukey's. it were pretty big ones but the girls did't care and ripped the meat of the bones like starving Komodo dragons. Jamie was able to get one leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange they call thing things legs,\" Amara said who got her own Turkey leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think it's strange?\" Tabitha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is't really a leg but a thigh. Let's be realistic. A bird leg does't have any meat on it. That's just bones with skin. But the thigh. That's were the meat is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right!\" Tabitha yelled and stood up. \"The meat is on the thighs.\" She slapped her one big thighs to proof her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty smiled. That was really Tabitha. So sassy and confident and at the same time did't really cared. But she was sometimes what irresponsible. That sometimes caused problems. It drove others, (especially Scott) crazy.<br>\r\nThe girls soon turned the turkeys in noting more the a pile of bones. Totally licked clean. There was't the tiniest piece of meat left. But the girls did't bother and started on the hoagies.<br>\r\nJamie just laid back. He had enough. He looked at the girls and must admit he liked watching them eat. He then noticed Tabitha undid her belt and opened her pant button just like Amara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should't do this. I know I should't but still\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look there are the desserts,\" Tabitha said while their table was filled with different kinds of dessert. Cakes, pies, ice cream. It all looked delicious. All three girl licked their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara suddenly did't care anymore. \"Ah what,screw it,I gonna eat myself stuffed like a turkey at thanksgiving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girl were eating dessert until there was't a crumb left. Only four burping girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh men,\" Amara moaned. \"I really have a tummy ache...  again. But considering how good those desserts were\u2026 it was totally worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked at the table filled with the remains of all their food. Suddenly Kitty realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... girls. How are we gonna pay for all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Tabitha said</span></div></div>",

If we eat all of it, or at least most of it, we'll get this meal free too.\" Tabitha smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the dessert?' Kitty asked with interest. She did have some pocket money left over and it could cover at least most of the feast, but she also knew Amara and Tabby barely had any left over after the shopping spree. \"It's a 50 pound ice cream sundae.\" Tabitha smiled. At that, Magma turned dull green. \"Tabitha... I don't think I can eat that. I'm too full.\" she moaned, her belly gurgling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Tabitha looked at her. Amara really did look ready to burst or throw up or both. \"It's okay, Amara. I think Kitty and I can handle it.\" smiled Boom-Boom. Kitty nodded. \"Totally.\" she smiled. So, when the waitress came up with the check, Tabitha put the request down. Needless to say, the waitress was very surprised. These girls had just eaten four orders of everything, including desserts and now they wanted the 50 pound sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough surprised, she agreed and went to inform the staff. \"Are you guys sure you can eat all that, Tabby?\" Jamie asked, eyeing his obese female teammates and friends. \"Yeah Jamie baby. Kitty and I can destroy that sundae, no problem.\" Tabitha smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty nodded eagerly. \"Tabitha's right, Jamie. My tummy's a lot roomier now that I've started eating bigger meals and I do have some of Hungry Kitty's hunger left over from our late lunch. This shouldn't be a problem.\" She smiled, ruffling Jamie's hair playfully. \"On that subject, I think I better go make some room.\" Tabitha said as she got up and went for the ladies room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the waitress arrived with four guys carrying the sundae. It was very big, with scoops of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, blue moon, mint chip, rocky road, cookie dough and peanut butter ice cream, a generous amount of hot fudge, a mountain of whipped cream and a cherry on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Kitty?\" Tabitha asked, grabbing a spoon. \"Yeah, Tabby. Like, let's totally do this!\" Kitty cheered as she grabbed a spoon herself and the duo started eating at top speed as Jamie and Amara watched in both surprise and encouragement as their friends ate and ate and ate and ate.</span></div></div>",

It looked like Kitty's eating habits had rubbed off on her. On herself too she must admit. She was a normal girl with a small waist and normal appetite but today she ate more then she'd ever ate before. She had a huge tummy ache to prove it. She looked at her friends destroying the sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man you could lose a hand in there,\" Amara whispered. \"Be careful you two don't choke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was supposed to be a joke but if you saw how they were eating, it could become reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy,\" Jamie said. \"Or else you get a brain freeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Tabitha were busy eating when both spoons suddenly hit a empty bowl.

Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on,\" Tabitha said. \"That was nothing. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! See that's a real burp!\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nBoth burps were so loud some other people looked up disturbed and a bit disgusted. However Tabitha didn't seem to care. At all.<br>\r\nHowever the waitress came over at their table not looking happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you did it. You ate that entire sundae so it's free. But can you two just GO!?!? You're disturbing our other costumers. And they pay for all the food they eat, and they don't burp so loud everyone in a ray of 100 yards can hear them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Tabitha said. \"We'll go. It's getting late anyway. Come on girls and boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Tabitha struggled a bit to get up which caused the waitress to make a soft sound in disgust before walking away. The four teens walked or in some cases waddled to their car and drove back to the institute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shopping spree lasted longer then I thought,\" Tabitha said. \"I think we're too late for dinner. That's too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara turned a bit green hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell me you two are still hungry!\" Amara said.  \"You can't be. We went to a buffet and we just ate all that food, especially you two with that entire sundae.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty giggled. \"Don't worry Amara. I must admit even I am pretty full. I don't need dinner. Or at least not right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they arrived at the institute and got inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what?\" Tabitha said. \"I think we should finish this shopping spree with a girls sleepover!\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tabitha had decided to keep the sleepover between the five \"Bayville Sirens\" members this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean and Rogue were surprised to see how round Amara and Tabitha now were due to their eating, but quickly shrugged it off. Per Kitty's suggestion, they had brought a ton of snacks in case Hungry Kitty struck again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPizza, snack cakes, candy bars, popcorn, doughnuts, cupcakes and even more snacks were ready for the girls. Each girl was now wearing their pajamas. Jean wore her usual blue nightshirt with yellow collar and cuffs. Rogue wore her normal orange and light green long sleeved pajama shirt and matching pants. Kitty had changed to her new extra-large, stretchy pajama t-shirt and shorts. Amara wore a big t-shirt and stretchy sweatpants and Tabitha wore a sleeveless t-shirt and big pajama pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tabitha... how do you like your new... um... plumpness?\" Jean asked awkwardly. \"You kiddin' Red? I love it. I mean, I already had curves, but this blubber makes 'em even plumper!\" Tabitha laughed as she slapped her big jiggly thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout you, Amara?\" Rogue asked as she eyed Magma's large brown belly. Amara was quiet for a moment before she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I like it too. Like Kitty said, I've always been pretty skinny and now I do have some curves.\" Amara admitted. She still felt somewhat queasy, but had felt well enough to come to the sleepover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a low, loud rumble filled the room. \"Like, I don't believe it! I'm totally hungry again!\" Kitty said as she patted her belly. Then, Tabitha's stomach gurgled in agreement. \"Me too.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda hungry myself.\" Rogue admitted as her stomach grumbled and she put a hand on it. Jean's own stomach rumbled as well. \"Good thing we have a ton of food.\" Jean smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll bet you guys can't eat as much as me and Tab!\" Kitty suggested with a giggle. Jean and Rogue looked at each other thoughtfully. After a quick (and telepathic) conversation, they turned to the younger girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on!\" Rogue smiled as Jean nodded. Amara watched as her four friends started pigging out on the ginormous mountain of junk foods. She had to admit she felt peckish, but her belly was still pretty rumbly and yucky feeling. So, she just decided to sit back and watch the feasting.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All four girls grabbed a pizza slice and started eating. Kitty was the first one done, grabbed the remaining two slices placed them on top of each other and stuffed them in her mouth. The other girl noticed this and did the same with the other pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Amara, for some reason she didn't understand herself, liked watching this and made a list in her head how much each girl was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext were the cakes. There were six. Each one grabbed a cake. Stuffing them in their mouth like a starved animal. Both Kitty and Jean looked at the two remaining cakes. Kitty went to grab one but Jean's mind was faster. The two cakes floated in the air and each cake broke in two equal sized pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is fair,\" Jean said and took a big bite of her cake, smearing frosting over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext there were four bags of popcorn. A least that what the box said. But when Kitty grabbed a bag it seemed pretty small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this bag contains popcorn?\" Kitty asked. \"It does't feel like popcorn. It's kind of hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pass me one bag,\" Amara said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty handed here one bag but as soon as Amara grabbed it they heard popping sounds inside the bag. It started to swell and a minute later it was turned into a big bag of popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go. You just needed to pop them first,\" Amara said and handed Kitty the bag with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the other bags too,\" Tabitha said and threw the three other bags to her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara sighed and also heated the other three bags until the were filled with popcorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls almost inhaled the popcorn. They didn't pause except to taking sips from one of the bottles of soda. Each girl liked how the fizzy drinks made their bellies swell even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned into a real competition. However they made it fair. Each girl was given the same amount of food. They equally shared the doughnuts. the candy bars and all the other food. Every girl was so busy in eating all of the food the didn't notice how stuffed they were or how big their bellies were getting. However Amara noticed how their bellies were swelling. But then suddenly the last bite of food was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was it,\" Kitty said on a sad tone. \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew that's gross,\" Jean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's not,\" Tabitha said. \"This is gross. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue opened her mouth. \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"All right. It seems like Rogue wins,\" Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet,\" Rogue said. \"Jean still needs to burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really you guys I....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four started to cheer: \"Jean! Jean! Jean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean knew there was no way out of this. She opened her mouth and: \"burp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was all?\" Tabitha said. \"What a disappointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not just a belcher,\" Jean said. Then she felt a horrible pain in her belly. \"And I don't know about you but I have a serious tummy ache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?\" Rogue asked, turning pale green. \"I thought it was just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I just kept eating. I didn't noticed how full I got.\" Tabitha admitted, her own face also taking on a greenish hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here. Even with hungry Kitty inside me I also have a tummy ache.\" Kitty said as she too turned green as her belly gurgled and rumbled ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara looked a bit amused at her four friends who were all moaning in pain from their over stuffed bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second,\" Rogue asked. \"Who won?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a tie,\" Amara said. \"I saw the whole thing. You split everything equally. You all ate the same amount. It was a tie. But I can tell you it was a lot. You were acting like real gluttonous pigs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not so skinny yourself chubby,\" Kitty moaned, barely clamping a hand over her mouth in time as she burped ominously, her cheeks bulging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche,\" Amara admitted. \"But what now?\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I need to sleep.\" She sighed, her eyes struggling to stay open. \"I'm not surprised, Tabitha. You did eat a lot, both now and earlier.\" Amara pointed out with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda pooped mahself. Ah guess Ah kinda understand what ya go through after your hunger attacks, Kit.\" Rogue yawned as she kept nursing her very sore belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A goodnight's rest might do our tummies some good.\" Jean agreed with a very big yawn as she licked the last bit of frosting off her nose with her tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm so totally pooped, I wouldn't be surprised if I...\" Kitty began but trailed off as she slumped over on her bed and began snoring softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is pretty late anyway.\" Jean remarked, eying Kitty's alarm clock. It read 12:50. \"We better get some sleep. Good thing Logan said we could take it easy this summer and agreed not to run any Danger Room exercises until school starts in August.\" she added, fluffing her pillow and crawling into her sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I gotta say Ah was pretty surprised by his willingness to do that, but now Ah'm really glad.\" Rogue agreed as she plopped onto her bed and was out like a light a second after turning her bedside light off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha yawned loudly as she crawled under her sleeping bag and fell asleep almost instantly. Amara just smiled as she listened to her friends' snoring or gentle breathing and the gurgling/rumbling of their very big bellies as they digested the large feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a word, Amara climbed into her sleeping bag and fell asleep too. Though she was occasionally awoken briefly by her friends burping, hiccupping or farting in their sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty woke up next morning due to soft talking. She opened her eyes and saw Amara, Jean and Rogue were talking with each other. Softly whispering. Tabitha was still asleep in her sleeping bag. Kitty yawned. Then went sitting up straight and stretching herself once. This got the attention of the other three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look who finally woke up,\" Amara said. \"Morning sleepyhead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm up right? It's not strange I was sleepy after last night. Besides Tabitha's still sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get it,\" Amara mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I was sleepy. It got pretty late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that Kitty,\" Jean said. \"We were having a conversation short before you woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems like you're not alone anymore,\" Jean answered. \"Kitty you must have noticed what we ate yesterday wasn't normal. You have Hungry Kitty inside of you. But what we ate yesterday... Well, it's way more food Rogue and I normally eat. While we did have dinner. And we may believe Amara that you and Tabitha both also ate awfully a lot in the mall. She did too. Both of you. Not just you. And now we.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026 do you think I got something to do with it?\" Kitty asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they don't,\" Tabitha said who clearly had woken up. \"But what Jean means is what has happened to you\u2026 is now also happening to us. That's not your fault. At least I don't think so. But well I'm hungry. Lets get dressed and get down for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girls agreed and went to their own room to get dressed. <br>\r\nKitty must admit some part of her felt\u2026 a bit better. At least now she was not alone. The others did help her and now she had some friends who seemed to have the same problem. It was more fun to have a problem with friends then just on your own. Now you could lean a bit on each other. She was happy she bought those new clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Kitty, Jean, Tabitha and Amara were all in the kitchen making a big breakfast for all of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey where's Rogue? She needs to help too,\" Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I am,\" Rogue said and waddled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue wore what she normally wore but between her pants and shirt you could see a stroke of her belly. A bit of her belly peeked out from between her pants and shirt. It seemed like all the snacking yesterday did took a toll on her body. Perhaps she also did eat a bit more during the day. She didn't know since she hadn't gone to the mall with Tabitha, Amara and Jamie like Kitty did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right since we're all here let's start making breakfast!\" Jean said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll five girls started making breakfast. It was pretty easy since Amara could defrost, toast, cook and bake things in less then a minute. Finally the table was covered. with sandwiches, baked eggs, omelets, boiled eggs, fruit, toasts, sausages, some pasta, wraps an a lot of other food. All girl looked at it almost drooling a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty felt a unpleasant feeling in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh. Seems it's time for Hungry Kitty!\" She warned the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as soon as hungry Kitty started eating so did the others. Even Amara. All five girl started stuffing their faces. Not having a care in the world except filling their bellies making them fatter by the day. Most of the girls didn't really notice what they were eating. They didn't really care either as long if it was edible. It was hard to believe how fast the food was gone. But after not to long all girls were leaning back in their chairs with swollen bellies. Kitty, Tabitha and Amara wore the clothes they bought yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Kitty could clearly see that Rogues belly was exposed now. Her shirt wasn't able to even cover her bellybutton. But Kitty must admit she liked seeing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean stood up and stuck out her arms and stretched and the next moment there was a loud: RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!!! Her light purple pants split. Both legs ripped at the sides. Jean stood there a bit in shock and embarrassment as the next moment the remains of her pants fell down revealing her tight pretty pink panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other could help it and burst out in laughter. Jean, with a head as red as a tomato, grabbed the remains of her pants and tried to cover herself with it. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"OK!\" Kitty said giggling a bit. \"You two need new clothes. So I suggest... we need to shop!\"</span></div></div>",

Jean and Rogue were somewhat uneasy by the idea of shopping at a plus-sized store. But they realized that the stores they normally went to wouldn't likely have larger sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was wearing a pair of Tabitha's new plus sized pants since none of her skirts or pants would go over her hippo butt anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, was thankful her pants and current shirt were still able to handle her size somewhat. She hoped Big Plump Girls had a gothic section for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Like, here we are!\" Kitty smiled as they entered the shop. Jean and Rogue looked around in surprise. There were quite a few large girls shopping and several clothes they'd enjoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, ladies... let's help our friends look good and fat!\" Tabitha smiled as she dragged Jean over to a rack. Kitty and Amara led Rogue over to another nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Kitty, Amara and Tabitha were sitting in front of the dressing rooms waiting for Jean and Rogue to show off their new clothes. So far, the duo had each tried on 8 different styles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean and Rogue felt a bit embarrassed being put on display for their friends while overweight. But they got over it and began doing so, figuring they might as well do it since their friends were willing to help them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean went first with a blue t-shirt reading \"I'm a big cute piggy\" and a large beige skirt. That got a thumbs up from Kitty and Amara and Tabitha gave it a playful \"Oink\" of approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue's first choice was rather surprising. She went with a red t-shirt with the words \"Gimme my food or I'll sit on you!\" and navy blue shorts. That got a big thumbs up from all three mock judges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, with Jean and Rogue taking turns in trying out new wardrobe ideas. Some (like Jean wearing a large muumuu reading \"Got pie?\" and large light blue jeans) got a big thumbs up, others (like Rogue wearing a hot pink t-shirt reading \"Will you be my feeder?\" and kaki pants) got a big raspberry, a thumbs down or both from the three younger girls. Other times, both Jean and Rogue would look so funny, the trio would laugh until they cried and/or (in Tabitha and Kitty's cases) fall onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jean slowly came out of the dressing room she was in for the final time. She wore a bright pink extra large t-shirt that read \"I'm a big, fat girl and proud of it!\" and large dark blue jeans. \"Well?\" Jean asked. Tabitha smiled. \"I like it.\" \"Totally.\" Kitty agreed. \"It's really cute Jean.\" Amara beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue then came out, wearing basically an extra large version of her normal clothes. \"Like, you totally look nice Rogue.\" Kitty smiled with a blush. She still felt something for Rogue ever since seeing her pale tummy poking out of her shirt at breakfast. She couldn't explain why but she really felt turned on by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Kitty. Ah like it better than that last one Tabitha made me try.\" Rogue replied, glaring at Tabitha, who giggled. Tabitha had made Rogue try on a fluffy white sweater with a cat on it that, as Kitty put it, \"totally looks like a giant, poofy marshmallow\" and cargo shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of this stuff isn't really cheap, is it?\" Jean remarked as she eyed her 4 new t-shirts, 5 pants and new bra and panties. \"Don't worry. We still have some money leftover from yesterday. We can loan it.\" Tabitha smiled. Rogue smiled and grabbed her clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since we got what we came for, Ah say we head on home an' see if the others are up yet.\" she remarked as she headed for the checkout, followed by her friends.  </span></div></div>",

I guess I need to eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry Kitty,\" Jean asked. \"Again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take her to the buffet. Since last time we're able to eat there for free.\" Tabitha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Jean helped Kitty over to the buffet. Rogue looked at Amara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can eat there for free?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it has a deal,\" Amara said. \"Eat all you can and you get all meal free for the rest of your life. We went there yesterday. I guess if we go there anyway I might also grab a bite to eat. All that shopping made me hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too.\" Rogue must admit. \"Be careful Perhaps I have a hungry Rogue. Well Kitty was sometimes able to keep hungry Kitty under control by eating enough. I guess we can better do that too. By the way you three can eat there for free. Jean and Ah first need to eat all we can. But with our appetites that shouldn't be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty waddled as fast as a girl of her size could to the buffet and filled her plate with chicken, burgers, corn dogs. Tabitha wasted no time and filled her own plate. Jean was doubting for a moment. She put a hand on her belly and also grabbed a plate. Rogue and Amara followed. about two minutes later they were all sitting at a table stuffing their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you four were all hungry too?\" Kitty asked between two large bites of chicken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure we were hungry,\" Amara said eating large  spicy meat balls. \"But we could use a bite. Besides if we don't eat enough you'll maybe meet hungry Amara. Or hungry Rogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well better hope we never have to deal with our hungry versions,\" Jean said while pushing a huge meatball sub in her mouth. \"But perhaps they come out in the near future. But at least we have each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty pushed a corn dog in her mouth and realized she felt kind of happy eating with friends who understood her because they almost were going through the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But eh Kitty I have a question,\" Rogue said between eating some chicken fingers. \"What is causing those hunger attacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. If I knew what was going on don't you think I would have done something about it!\" Kitty yelled biting a fat sausage in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That does make perfect sense,\" Amara said taking a bite of tofu. \"But when we're back at the institute we might tell professor X that what happened to Kitty is well also happening to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jean asked, taking another bite of her sub. \"Does it only happen to mutants or not? Also why does it only happen to girls? I mean, can it also happen to boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Kitty said stuffing fries in her mouth. \"I don't know anything more then you. You get hungry you eat more and gain. Besides I'm gonna go get some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that goes for me too. \"Tabitha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me three.\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane and Amara looked a moment doubtful at each other. Then they lifted their shoulders and both grabbed their plate for another round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after that another. After the third round Amara stopped. Saying she was feeling full. You could see a small sliver of brown flesh just under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the others went for another round. After that Jean and Rogue were also done, rubbing their bloated swollen bellies. But Kitty and Tabitha went for another round before they were full too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. That was a nice meal,\" Tabitha said. \"I'm really *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!* full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Kitty added. \"Me too. *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit, feeling this stuffed and eating what you like does feel nice,\" Rogue admitted. \"You don't have to care. *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you all ate more then me?\" Amara said. \"I wonder why that is? *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!* Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you Jean, come on.\" Tabitha said. \"We wanna hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you girls,\" Jean said. \"It's just not my thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty suddenly put her chubby hands on Jean's tight belly and started massaging it, rubbing and pushing. Jean made soft moaning sounds of pleasure. But then suddenly: \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!* Wow! Did that just came out of me?\" Jean asked in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Jean.\" Tabitha said. \"That was a nice one.

What can I-\" Professor X started, but he stopped upon seeing the bloated Jean, Rogue, Tabitha and Amara with Kitty. \"We think what's affectin' Kitty's also happenin' ta us now.\" Rogue explained, poking her belly and watching her plump finger sink into her pale white flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

No offense Kitty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some taken,\" She mumbled. \"But you're right. It does suck. But well at least you accepted me. It would be worse if you wouldn't accept me because of my appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Jean said,\" Of course we accepted you. Everyone here has problems being accepted because we're mutants. Burt we're still people. In a way. So you had something that was different. Just like we are also a bit different. But we look out for each other. And now we know how you feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit it does feel better not being the only one with this problem,\" Kitty said. \"Else it would really suck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment there was a knock on the door and Scott looked inside<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I hope I'm not interrupting but, there's a huge lunch down stairs. So if you're hungry\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment four girls almost ran over him except for Kitty who just faded though the floor. When she saw what was on the table she was having trouble not to drool. The table was covered with fries, hams, bowls of chili, chicken, sausages, hamburgers, fried bacon with eggs on bread, spaghetti with sauce and meatballs, steaks, baked potatoes, fried chicken and much more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others soon entered and looked at all the food. It only took a few seconds before all girl started eating. Well it wasn't really eating. The girls were more devouring the food like a bunch of starved animals. All four totally forget to use manners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey attacked the food like a pack of wolves and devoured the food like a couple of pigs. Kitty pushed fries in her mouth with two hands, while Amara devoured a whole ham. Tabitha and Rogue tore into a turkey that Storm was bringing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean in the meantime ate the fried bacon with eggs on bread. Pushing it into her mouth causing it to smear yellow egg all around her mouth. Not only yellow egg. Kitty had grease smeared all around her mouth. Rogue who after the Turkey was gone (what was soon gone by the way, only leaving a couple of bones), started on the hamburgers smearing grease and sauce around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara devoured another ham smearing more grease around her mouth as well. Tabitha covered hot dogs with mayonnaise and Ketchup and both sauces were smeared around her face dropping on her shirt. It was the same with the shirts of the other girls who were covered in food stains. Kitty stuffed so much food in her bulging cheeks she looked like a chipmunk. All the girls were focused on eating food and didn't notice the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Hungry Kitty is busy again,\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Hungry Kitty is but not she alone,\" Kurt said. \"Also Hungry Tabitha, Hungry Rogue, Hungry Amara and\u2026 isn't that Hungry\u2026 Jean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Scott yelled and looked back at the table seeing his Jean slurping spaghetti like she hadn't eaten in days. The extra weight around her waist told otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I saw eating like this once in a documentary,\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that about girls?\" Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er no. I believe it was about Komodo dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Evan said. \"Auntie O told me that some other girls were also having big appetite's but this is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey anyway they're still our friends,\" Jamie said. \"We need to help them and be there for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you girls taste the food?\" Storm asked a bit irritated, since she put a lot of work into making the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. It's delicious,\" Amara said guzzling down a bowl of chili.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best food I ever tasted,\" Kitty managed to say between bites of sausages and baked potatoes.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNext moment there was a sound in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Evan asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New recruits,\" Scott said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed a group of new recruits walked in but stopped when the saw the show of five girls devouring a entire feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if there's any food left for us with them around?\" Jubilee said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls were finally able to finish everything until the last crumb. Except for what was smeared around their mouth and what was on their shirts. All four girls had swollen bloated bellies and were softly moaning. <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

I, like, totally don't feel so good.\" She moaned, turning apple green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too..\" Jean groaned, her own face turning pale green as her tummy let out an equally big gurgle. Suddenly, Tabitha's own belly rumbled and gurgled as her face took on a deep green hue. \"I think I'm gonna be sick too.\" she groaned, clutching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, both Rogue and Amara also went green and their bellies started to rumble and gurgle. \"Ah think either Ah ate too much or Ah ate it too quickly.\" Rogue managed to moan before letting out an ominous burp, her cheeks bulging threateningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys gonna be okay?\" Bobby asked. \"Yeah. Like, I think we totally just need to *URP!* digest.\" Kitty moaned, letting out a big burp of her own as her tummy rumbled even more, causing it to jiggle like a big bowl of Jell-O. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or explode.\" Amara groaned before a thunderous belch of her own escaped her lips, causing her tongue to flop out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, the four girls slowly managed to stand up and started waddling to Kitty and Rogue's room. Jean, Tabitha and Amara were too full to try and make it back to their rooms right now so they decided to rest in said room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I feel like my belly's gonna blow.\" Jean moaned as she laid on her back, rubbing her large tummy in agony. \"Me too. I can't believe how much we ate.\" Amara groaned, laying on her large belly before quickly switching to her back when it became apparent her belly was too upset to lay on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, Amara? We just *burp* ate two big meals *belch* before this *hiccup* and now *urp* you're *hic-urp* in *burp* disbelief over *hic* how much *belch* we ate?\" Tabitha moaned as she lay beside Rogue, who was also laying on the floor, her tongue lolling out of her mouth as she rubbed her now large pale tummy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm sick to my belly but I gotta admit, that Storm's cooking was totally the best yet!\" Kitty smiled despite her stomach pains from beside Jean. \"Yeah. Ah've never had a turkey as awesome as that one.\" Rogue agreed with a slight smile herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And those hot dogs and burgers...\" Tabitha agreed, licking the remaining ketchup, mustard and mayo off her face and lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop!\" Amara moaned, clutching her belly. \"My bellyache's bad enough as it is without you guys mentioned all that, admittingly yummy, food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, 'Mara. We forgot.\" Tabitha smiled. At that moment, there was a knock on the door. \"Come in.\" Kitty called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and in came Scott, Jamie, Kurt, Spyke, and Storm. \"How're you guys feeling now?\" Scott asked. \"Still stuffed like turkeys before Thanksgiving.\" Jean replied, wincing slightly as she sat up despite her still sore tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you guys want?\" Rogue asked as she, Kitty, Amara and Tabitha also managed to heave themselves up into sitting positions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell, ve wanted to see if we could give you belly rubs to help calm your stomachs down.\" Kurt explained. \"Uh... sure.\" Jean said as the others nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the five set to work. Scott took Jean for obvious reasons. Jean moaned in delight as he gently rubbed and pressed on her tummy. It was so soothing and relaxing that Jean caught herself starting to doze off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurt offered to rub Tabitha's belly. As he did, Tabitha sighed in contentment as his three fingered hands gently went over her large gut, occasionally causing her to giggle as his fur tickled her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, wearing gloves, covered Rogue. The southern goth moaned happily as Ororo's hands lovingly stroked and pressed her pale, marshmallow belly while she relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie took Kitty. He seemed a bit embarrassed to be doing so since Kitty was a few years older than him and he'd briefly harbored a crush on her earlier this year. Kitty noticed and smiled kindly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it's totally okay Jamie. I don't mind you rubbing my tummy.\" she told him. Still blushing furiously, Jamie slowly began rubbing her large belly. Kitty sighed in blessed delight as he did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Spyke was rubbing Amara's large brown belly. All four girls sighed in relief as they felt their bellyaches fading away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty got a weird expression on her face. \"Are you okay?\" Jamie asked, upon noticing this. \"Yeah. Like I just feel like I'm gonna...\" Kitty started when a giant, smelly fart escaped from her big butt. *BLURRRAAAAPPPPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa K-Girl! Stink city!\" Spyke yelped as the others all looked at her in surprise. \"Like, sorry!\" Kitty blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Tabitha got a smirk on her face. \"That's pretty good, Kitty, but not as good as this!\"  And then, she let out a bigger fart.<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOURRRRRPPPPTTTT!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's vhy we call you 'Boom-Boom'!\" Kurt joked as he fanned the stench away as Tabitha laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kids' stuff, Tabitha! Here's how a real southern gal does it!\" Rogue jeered with a smirk as she also unleashed a doozy of a fart. *BBRRRRAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! I didn't know the Rogue had it in her!\" Bobby remarked as they all stared at Rogue. \"Like, totally awesome fart, Rogue!\" Kitty giggled as even Storm looked impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing! Check this out!\" Amara smiled as she started to strain and grunt. After a few moments, *BBBBBBLLLLLOORRRPPPPPPPTTTT!* A pretty impressive fart escaped her rear end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Jean! It's down to you!\" Tabitha giggled. \"Jean, you don't have to-\" Scott started when Jean smirked and began straining. <br>\r\nShe strained so much, her face went as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!*  Jean let out the biggest fart any of the X-Kids or Storm had ever heard. They could smell everything Jean had eaten since that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mein gott, Jean!\" Kurt coughed as the stench reached his nostrils. \"Jeez! Not cool, man!\" Spyke agreed, plugging his nose. \"Wow! Jean, what did you eat this mornin'? Baked beans?!?!?\" Rogue agreed, coughing and hacking like the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I probably should've mentioned this sooner, but chili tends to make me gassy.\" Jean apologized with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we've gathered!\" Tabitha wheezed in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Scott and the others left to get some air fresheners and other air cleaning things, the five girls laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Jean! Like, I totally thought my farts smelled yucky at times but yours are totally the bomb!\" Kitty giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Who'd think Miss. Perfect has a slobby side?\" Rogue joked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you teach me that for when school starts up again?\" Tabitha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. At least our bellyaches are gone. Guess I'm both a big burper and a big farter.\" Jean giggled along with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Kitty felt something wet in her pants. \"Um guys? Like, I totally don't know about you... but I think I totally pooped my pants.\" she squeaked. \"Yeah. Ah think mah fart did that ta me too.\" Rogue agreed as the others nodded sheepishly.</span></div></div>",

New pant and shirts since their shirts were covered with food stains. Jean an Rogue at least now had a good reason to show their new clothes. The fitted their fatter bodies perfectly and looked pretty good at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those clothes look really good at you,\" Kitty said and yawned. \"All that eating made me tired. Perhaps I take a small nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe Amara beat you to it,\" Jean said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed the dark girl was already fast asleep softly breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must admit I'm sleepy too.\" Tabitha said. \"Oh. Jean is also gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later all girls lay passed out in the room. All five were deep asleep while their bellies gurgled and groaned digesting their huge meals, adding more fat to their bodies. But while the girls were in dreamland, they were thinking about one thing. What was for dinner?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time for you to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty opened her eyes and saw Amara standing over her. She blinked a few times and looked at her alarm clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Is it 5:55 already!?!? It's almost time for dinner!\" Kitty yelled waking up all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner sounds great.\" Rogue said. \"I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Amara said. \"That's what was waking me up. That and the rumbling of my and your tummies. But I guess they have a big meal prepared  for us. I can smell something delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha put her nose in the air and sniffed. \"She's right. I smell it too. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls ran down stairs except for Kitty who like normally faded right to the floor and was first to reach the table. Kitty looked with big eyes at the feast before her. The table was covered with mainly junk food. Pizza's, fries, burgers, corn dogs, hot dogs, croquette's, minced meat hot dogs, milkshakes and other stuff that was dripping from the grease. Kitty couldn't help it and drooled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott entered while he was chewing on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you noticed. Go ahead. The others already ate so\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't need to say anything more. All girls started to attack the food like if they hadn't eaten in days. Soon their cheeks were so stuffed with food they looked like chipmunks. It was almost unbelievable. The girls started stuffing their faces. Kitty crammed about five corn dogs in her mouth at once. Jean did the same with the hamburgers. Tabitha took a pizza and was spinning it on her finger taking bites out it and soon the pizza was gone. Amara stuffed croissants in her mouth. She was going pretty fast but slower then the other four. Rogue wolfed down hot dogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott looked from a distance. He was afraid one of them might choke and he need to help them. But Lucky for him they were always able to swallow the food down without choking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty placed two pizza's on top of each other and ate them like they were a huge cookie. Tabitha stuffed several minced meat hot dogs in her mouth and the ends were hanging out of her mouth. The girls were eating so fast you would ask yourself if they tasted the food. However they seemed to like it. Amara shoved hamburgers inside with both hands. Rogue grabbed one of the plates of fries and emptied the plate in her mouth. All girl were eating like there was no tomorrow. At this moment they were all taken over by their hungry versions. Kitty smashed her head right into the fries almost inhaling them. Amara stuffed herself full with corn dogs while Tabitha started on the croissants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. I thought girls were always so worried about their figure,\" Evan said. \"But it seems like those girls only think about filling their tummies. Can tummies pop?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder who can eat most.\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess Kitty,\" Evan said. \"She already had those attacks before the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but don't you remember Jean's fart?\" Kurt asked. \"I bet she also burps louder then the others so she probably also eats the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think Tabitha is wilder and is most likely to let herself go.\" Jamie mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue? Probably, but I don't think she eats more then the others.\" Kurt said. \"She started at same time with Jean but...     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amara? I don't think so.\" Evan said. \"For some reason the hunger seems to have less effect on her then the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard to say since we don't know how much each girl eats,\" Kurt said. \"We should split the food in five equal parts and sees who eats the most. But I still think it's Jean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet on that?\" Evan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure I'll take that bet,\" Jamie said <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kitty, Tabitha, Jean, Rogue and Amara all looked at each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. What's the challenge?\" Jean asked. \"We're wondering who can eat the most out of all five of you.\" Spyke explained. \"So we decided to have each of you eat a pile of food.

The girls eyed each other again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally in!\" Kitty cheered. \"Me too.\" Amara smiled. \"I'm game!\" Tabitha whooped. \"Ah guess it'd be interestin'.\" Rogue shrugged. \"Okay, it's a deal, Scott.\" Jean beamed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let's choose the girls!\" Spyke smiled. Scott picked Jean while Kurt picked Tabitha, Spyke took Rogue, Bobby picked Amara and Jamie chose Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Now let's bring on the grub!\" Tabitha shouted. Quickly, the guys set to work bringing out the remaining food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, there was five large piles of junk food on the table. They consisted of doughnuts, cupcakes, regular cakes, pie, ice cream sandwiches, pizza, hamburgers, chocolate bars, hot dogs, corn dogs and cinnamon rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Everybody's clear on the rules, right?\" Scott asked. The girls and guys nodded. \"Like, we can only eat from our own piles and we can't leave any crumbs.\" Kitty smiled. \"Yeah. And we also can't hide any food in our pockets or down our shirts.\" Tabitha added as Amara, Jean and Rogue all nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.

They ate like starved animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a doughnut's on in each hand and stuffed them in her mouth. She barely chewed them once before she stuffed another two in her mouth. Tabitha noticed this and didn't wanna be left behind, and did the same. This didn't go unnoticed by the other three girls who also tried to eat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if it's wise if they eat fast. It may sooner cause a tummy ache,\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Scott said. \"You're free to tell them. But do you really think they will listen to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet that when you're sitting on the table they come at you they start eating and after that there's nothing left from you except a skeleton,\" Evan said with a smile. \"That would make a great horror movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were done with the doughnuts and Kitty and Jean already started on the cupcakes. Jean used her powers to put ten cupcakes on top of each other and stuff them in her mouth. Kitty just rolled onto her back, opened her mouth and stuffed cupcakes into it. The girls stuffed them in so fast they had barely time to chew the food but they didn't care right now. Amara was a bit slower then the others. But she as well was starting eating the cupcakes very fast, Just like Rogue and Tabitha who were both stuffing cupcakes in their mouth with both hands. All the girls had bulging cheeks what made the look like a bunch of chipmunks. Chipmunks the size and appetite of hippo's and eating like pigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty grabbed a large apple pie holding it in both hands eating it like a huge cookie. No matter how fast she was eating she seemed to enjoy it. The other five also reached the pie's. Jane grabbed one and took a few bites and stopped. She looked a bit worried. She opened her mouth again and : \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!! Oh that feels better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha smiled. After eating two pies she also opened her mouth: \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!! Hear that Jean? That's how you burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue put no attention to this. She was too busy eating. Amara as well. But she didn't think she would be able to win. All this time she was eating slower and less then the other girls. But she wasn't planning to lose this bet. She wanted those belly rubs more then anything else. So she stuffed another pie in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty reached the ice cream sandwiches. She first held her head back and: \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!* That's how you burp and\u2026\" She bent down and *POOOOORRRRRRRRRPT!!!* Let out a huge fart. After that she started stuffing ice cream sandwiches in her mouth. So much at once she could barely close her mouth. Rogue was able to stuff twelve ice cream sandwiches at once in her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're gonna eat the ice cream this fast they gonna have a tummy and a head ache.\" Jamie remarked with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara saw the ice cream. She remembered what Jean did with the cupcakes and used her own power to melt the sandwiches just a tiny bit so they went down easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue suddenly opened her mouth and \"*BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!*\" But at the same time: \"*BRRRRRRAAAAAAP!!!!!*\" A loud fart escaped her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Jamie said. \"Like my grandmother told me when you can burp and fart at the same time you have no soul!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nonsense,\" Bobby said. \"However\u2026.\" He grabbed a towel and tied it around his nose and mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah good idea,\" Kurt agreed. \"He disappeared and appeared a few seconds later. with towels for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean suddenly went sitting up straight and: \"*BLUUURRRP!!!*\" Then she opened her mouth: \"*BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!!!!!*\"   The next moment she grabbed a pizza and tried to stuff as much in her mouth if was possible. Amara put two slices on top of each other and ate them that way. Suddenly she paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Did that just came out of me?\" she asked surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girl had undone their buttons and had undone (if they had one) their belts.  There was grease, ice cream and frosting around their mouths and as well some stains on their clothes but the kept eating. After the pizza's were gone Rogue reached the hamburgers and corn dogs. Rogue stuffed hamburgers in her mouth one by one before swallowing them. Kitty and Tabitha tried to stuff as much in their mouth as possible. Jean used her power to make the food just float to her mouth and eat it. Amara grabbed one hand full of corn dogs and another full of hamburgers and stuffed it in her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing not one of them has elastic skin.\" Kurt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara crawled further. Suddenly she stopped and and: \"POOOOOOOOOTTT!!! That does feel better. I can still fit more in my tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing were cinnamon rolls. Most of them started stuffing them in their mouth several at a time. Tabitha was smarter and just grabbed the plate and poured all cinnamon rolls in her mouth, making her cheeks bulgy and lumpy and started on the next food. The other four paused for a moment wondering why they didn't think about that. All four grabbed their plates and poured all cinnamon rolls in their mouth. All five girls were burping and farting then they started on the hot dogs. Each of them were heavily covered with mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. After that, the girls started stuffing as much into their mouths as was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!* *POOOORRRRRT!!!!* *BRAAAAAAP!!!* *BUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!!!!!* Were all sounds that could be heard from all five girls as they ate the hot dogs and started on the chocolate bars which went in pretty easy after all the other food. Especially for Amara who just melted them and drank the melted stuff.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Not one of them's stopped,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Jamie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure but I guess we find out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara got a head lead thanks to her ability to melt the chocolate, but now came the cakes. 5 four layer chocolate cakes. Kitty wasted no time and smashed her head right into it inhaling it. Tabitha just broke lumps of it stuffing them in her mouth as fast if she could. Jean made the cake float over to her as she ate it in mid-air. Rogue went over to the cakes on hand and knees and started eating like a pig. Then a few seconds later at the same time five huge long belches could be heard and that was it. All the food was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five girls looked at each other. All, of them had a green face. All five were burping and farting and a lot of moaning. Grease, sauce, frosting and other stuff around their mouths. Their bellies bloated, swollen and hard as a rock. Their shirts covered in food stains and some clothes started to rip at the seams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys slowly walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who won?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe it was a tie,\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My tummy, like, totally hurts!\" Kitty whimpered in agony as she rubbed the aching orb of flesh. \"Mine too.\" Amara moaned as she tried hard not to vomit as she burped ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah belly's so stuffed, I think Ah'd explode if Ah try an' put one more thing into mah mouth.\" Rogue moaned in agreement as she laid against the wall so she was sitting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with you, Rogue. After that grub fest, I don't think I could eat another bite until breakfast.\" Tabitha groaned as she slowly messaged her jumbo tummy with both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the guys said anything for a moment as they watched their female teammates burp, groan and moan in agony. They felt bad for their friends and wanted to do something that would cheer them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had an idea. \"Hey, why don't we at least give them a belly rub? That helped at lunch when they had bellyaches.\" He offered. \"Worth a shot.\" Scott agreed as Kurt, Spyke and Bobby nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the five guys went over to their girl and knelt down. \"*Urp* Scot? What *belch* are *hic* you *burp* *urp* doing?\" Jean moaned as she felt her boyfriend's hands slowly start to rub and press her giant belly. Slowly, she felt its hardness fading and becoming soft again, lessening her pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're giving you guys belly rubs to help with the pain. It was Jamie's idea.\" Scott explained with a smile. Sure enough, Kurt was rubbing Boom-Boom's belly, Jamie was gently rubbing and pressing Kitty's while Bobby took care of Amara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan, meanwhile, was gently messaging Rogue's orb of a belly while wearing cleaning gloves. \"Feeling better?\" He asked as he kept rubbing, pressing and pinching her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mah god yes...\" Rogue moaned in relief as the hard rock feeling in her tummy went away, replaced with soft squishy blubber.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" Kitty agreed as she smiled at the blushing furiously Jamie while he kept working away on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo gooooodddd...\" Tabitha moaned in bliss as Kurt's furry fingers kept stroking hers gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*I agree.\" Amara smiled as Bobby's fingers ran over her brown skin, partially chilly to help dull the pain in her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all five girls' tummies rumbled loudly. \"Like, now what?\" Kitty asked nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guys all knew. \"Not again!\" Kurt groaned as the X-Boys quickly retied the towels around their noses just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, *PPPPPOORRRRRRTTTTTTTT!!!* Kitty let out another big fart. \"Now I totally feel better.\" Kitty sighed in relief as the pain in her hippo belly lessened greatly after that big toot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"That's not fartin', Kit. This here is fartin',\" Rogue smirked as her belly rumbled again.*BBBBLLLLOOOORRRRRPPPPP!!* A bigger fart slipped from her booty as she smirked again. Kitty playfully stuck her tongue out at her roommate, best friend and teammate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of you guys can't fart. Like Blue said this afternoon, this is why they call me 'Boom-Boom'!\" Tabitha laughed as she strained hard. *FFFFFFFBBBBBBBBRRRRRRTTTPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* Out came a fairly decent fart from her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I thought we did this hours ago, Tabitha!\" Amara giggled as she took a deep breath and strained hard. After a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPOOOOOORRRRRAAAAAAPPPPPPTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!* A big, long fart escaped her large butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once again I see I gotta teach you girls how to make a stink!\" Jean laughed as she began straining very hard. \"Like, plug your nose!\" Kitty shouted, quickly pinching hers closed as Rogue quickly grabbed a clothespin and clamped it on hers while Tabitha and Amara both tied some spare napkins around their noses just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBLLLLLLOOORRRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* Jean's fart was big, loud and really long. Soon, the entire dining room smelled awful. \"Open-ack- a window!\" Kurt choked. Even though he and the other X-Guys still had their masks on, Jean's stench was still able to get in their noses. Scott quickly ran over and threw the windows open, letting fresh air in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man! Jean, what did you eat last round! There wasn't any chili!\" Rogue groaned in disgust. \"I guess it was all the grease and stuff that can do it too.\" Jean shrugged with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better now?\" Scott asked with a slight smile. \"Yeah.\" Jean smiled as she and the others stood up. \"Good. See you girls later.\" Spyke smiled as he and the other guys left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was quite a gorge.\" Rogue smiled as she rubbed her now completely soft tummy. \"Yeah. But, like, I think I totally pooped my pants again with my farts.\" Kitty blushed as she felt that now familiar wet and smelly feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again!\" Rogue groaned as she looked in her pants and saw the same thing as Jean, Amara and Tabitha all discover this mess in their panties and pants as well. \"Like, maybe we should totally buy plus-sized diapers for teens.\" Kitty suggested, causing the girls to giggle at the idea.</span></div></div>",

Something everything was very thankful for. Next morning some birds were chirping outside the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can those stupid birds shut up?\" Tabitha yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty looked at her friend. She saw Jane and Amara and Rogue. Since their sleepover the girls kept staying together. Well they all had the same problems and supported each other. That was the spirit of the institute. Helping gifted kids with their problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tabitha,\" Amara said. \"Those birds perhaps woke you up, but you complaining about them woke me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me as well,\" Jane added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry gals.\" Tabitha said. \"How did you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I must admit it feels good sleeping with a full tummy,\" Rogue added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your tummy was full?\" Amara asked. \"Mine was overfilled. It's a miracle I did't threw up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It ended up all right, did't it?\" Tabitha said. But I could go for some breakfast. Lets get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed was easier said the done. Some clothes were very tight and most would never fit them. However Kitty gave them some of her not so old clothes. Some of her new clothes still fitted her and the five went downstairs. All smiling when they saw a table full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha you're here,\" Storm said. \"We made breakfast for you. After breakfast Professor X wants to talk to you. He maybe can find out what causes those hunger attacks and perhaps\u2026 stop them. I sure hope so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I hope so too,\" Amara said. \"But now\u2026 food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girls ran to the food. Storm looked a bit irritated. She knew the girls could't help it. It was just that she spent a lot of time, work and effort in making food and those girls just wolfed it down in a few seconds.<br>\r\nKitty ate a entire stack of pancakes in one bite. Amara did the same with waffles. Wolfing down a entire stack in one bite. Jane was stuffing herself with doughnuts. She put two on each finger like the were huge rings. The next moment she stuffed them all in her greedy mouth. Rogue attacked the bacon with scrambled eggs as Tabitha ate a whole bug tray of sweet rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girls are eating again.\" Kurt said. \"Lately they're putting more attention to eating then to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Kurt,\" Scott said. \"I heard that the professor might know what's wrong with them. Perhaps he can help them. Then their back to normal and I will have my Jane back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... before she's her old self again\u2026 she might need a  big diet and do a lot of exercise,\" Evan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's true\u2026 but I love Jane. No matter which size she is. I will help her lose the weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls still gulped everything what was on the table, Sandwiches, wraps,muffins, cakes, chicken sandwiches, hamburgers. Nothing escaped the appetites. The were't just eating. They tried to stuff as much food in their mouth if was possible at once. It was surprising they did't choke. However Scott thought it was a few times very close. Kitty plopped muffins in her mouth like if it were berries. Tabitha placed five sandwiches at top of each other and stuffed the entire thing in her mouth in one go. Amara grabbed the wraps eating three at once. All girls were eating that you thought like if their life depended on it. But then all the food was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...that was a good breakfast,\" Kitty said. \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nothing,\" Tabitha said. \"Listen to this\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no matter how much fun this is,\" Amara said. \"I believe professor X is waiting for us. Oh and better don'f fart. Or do you want to meet the professor with crap in your pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girls agreed that that maybe was't a good idea. All five walked to the office of Professor X. With jiggling bellies, rubbing thighs and wobbling butts. Kitty knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" Professor X answered, and the girls entered. \"I see you all put on some weight. But I think I know how to find the answer. Kitty. can you come over to me? I'm gonna look in your mind. We really think someone is playing with your mind. But I need to be sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty went over the Charles Xavier and stayed calm while he put his hands on her head and made contact with her. A few minutes later he let go of Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who it is. It's...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The girls looked at each other in surprise. \"But why would she do this?\" Jean asked. \"I think it is payback for the last time you and the others crossed her and her own student team.\" Professor X said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty scanned her memory. She remembered the X-Kids' last fight with the Hellions, Emma's team of mutants who were loyal to the Hellfire Club, which Emma belonged to. Most of the members there were mutants as well. The Hellions consisted of Empath, Catseye, Thunderbird, Roulette and Tarot. The group had broken into Area 51 for unknown reasons with Emma accompanying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the team had encountered the X-Kids, Magma, Boom-Boom and Professor X. During the fight, the Hellions were beaten and Emma had sworn revenge on them, especially the girls. But at the time, they hadn't taken her seriously. Now, it seemed that had been a big mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this must be her revenge. Making us fat.\" Kitty realized. \"But why?\" Amara asked. \"She must've decided it would be appropriate to make us into sumo-sized girls since the Hellions called us 'fat cats'.\" Jean replied. \"Well we really look the part now.\" Rogue agreed as she eyed her jumbo orb sized belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually thought I heard her voice in my head a few weeks ago the night before this started.\" Kitty admitted. \"What? Why didn't you tell us this?\" Tabitha asked in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that Emma's mental powers planted the suggestion into her head and then ordered her to forget who did so.\" Xavier replied. \"I was only just able to unlock this information from Kitty's thoughts. Emma's powers are equally, if not slightly stronger, to mine.\" He admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. If she only wanted ta make Kitty pay, why hit us?\" Rogue asked. \"I believe she actually meant to do it to all of you, Rogue. You, along with Jean, Amara and Tabitha were only recently affected due to her likely only wanted to largely punish Kitty.\" Xavier explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Jean asked. \"The next step is finding the Hellions and try to convince Emma to reverse the damage before you all become immobile.\" Xavier stated. \"Totally. Like, the last thing I need is to need a forklift or scooter to get around.\" Kitty agreed as the girls nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall use Cerebro to try and pinpoint the Hellions' current location since they likely abandoned their Chicago school. When I pinpoint them, I shall inform you and the other X-Men.\" Professor X said assuredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Professor. We'll be waiting.\" Jean smiled as she and the other girls waddled off to relax in Kitty and Rogue's room for awhile while Xavier headed for Cerebro to try and find Emma and the Hellions. </span></div></div>",

I'm so stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emma played you,\" Jane said. \"You could't do anything about it. No one blames you. It was even harder for you since had those hunger attacks longer then us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we know who did it and why but... how are we gonna solve it?\" Rogue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" Tabitha said. \"We go over there and force her to take that curse away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always the violent way right Tabitha.\" Jane said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna do then?\" Tabitha asked. \"Just friendly ask her. What do you think she will do then. Sorry I put a curse on you. I take it off now and no hard feelings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess Tabitha is right this time,\" Amara added. \"I don't think she'll just take that curse away if we ask her nicely. We might need to use some force. I normally don't like if I need to use violence. But in this case I make a exception.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls continued talking in the office of professor X while he looked with Cerebro. After several minutes he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find her?\" Tabitha asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. She's not far from here. She also was't hard to find. I'm a bit worried. It seems like she does't do anything to keep hidden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the address?\" Tabitha asked. \"You do know were she is right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor X wrote something on a piece of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is were she is. We need to go there but not\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for once the girls did't listen and ran out (or more waddled) with jiggling bellies, wobbling butts and rubbing thighs. The professor looked at the door a bit surprised the girls ran away without listening to him. They normally always listened. He knew Emma well enough that she would't make this easy. Even while she had been very easy to find. That did't make sense. Emma was a telepath and she knew Cerebro. So why did't she\u2026 then it hit him. This was most likely a trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls in the meantime took a car and dove away to the address they had. Kitty and the other hoped the could stop Emma before their next hunger attack. If she does't I gonna switch to cannibalism starting with Emma herself. See how long it takes before she'll take that curse away. after a few minutes Kitty looked around surprised. This part of the city was a part were she would rather stay away. Homeless people, drunk people and criminals were here. Also a lot of old empty houses. with boards before the windows, cracks in the wall. Gardens filled with weeds. <br>\r\nFinally Jean stopped by a big house. It did't looked different from all other houses. A garden covered with weed. Cracked walls, closed windows with board before it and blistering paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Emma live here?\" Rogue asked in disbelieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the address professor X gave us,\" Jean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we know for sure she's here?\" Amara asked. \"I trust professor X but it looks like no one has been here for over...well not since I was born. Look at that house. Would one of you want to live there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not me,\" Kitty said. \"I don't like the neighborhood and the other houses. This house needs a lot of work. Just like the garden. All other houses and gardens around here needed a lot of work too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Emma frost is white, not green,\" Rogue said. \"It looks like no one has been here but lets go inside anyway. Perhaps she is't there but maybe she is. I don't have a clue where she could be else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of several places I would rather be then here,\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked over the the door and opened it. As soon as the entered the heard some scratching on the floor. Probably some mice and rats who were disturbed and looked for a safe place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does't look like anyone has been inside here in a while either,\" Amara said looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A big layer of dust everywhere.\" Jean said. \"I don't think anyone has been here in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it,\" Kitty said. \"How is it possible the professor and Cerebro were wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment the front door closed. Then they heard footsteps on the stairs and down came Emma frost. She seemed a bit amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I expected you. It took you girls long enough\"to find out it was me. You five don't look like last time I saw you. It seems like you all put on some weight. Haha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this to us!\" Tabitha yelled. \"I warn you! Take of this curse or else\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what Miss Boom Boom. That's how they call you right. You don't scare me. Not one of you does. As for the curse\u2026 no I'm not gonna take it of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it of!\" Rogue yelled. \"You're strong perhaps but you can't fight all five of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like to admit \u00edt but that's probably true. But I'm not alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the shadows  came: Thunderbird, Jetstream, Cat's eye and Empath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took some of my best students. Capture them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderbird tried to grab Kitty but she faded right through his arm. <br>\r\nJean focused on Emma frost. It was a telepathy battle. Jean was having a hard time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must confess I'm impressed,\" Emma said. \"You have a lot of strength for such a young girl. You have potential. Guess that's why professor X put so much interest in you. You might be stronger then him some day. You could be like me But one thing you don't have is... experience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWit those words Jean was knocked to the wall and was out. Kitty seemed to escape all of Frosts students by fading through them all the time<br>\r\nCat's eye turned into her panther form and walked too Amara like if she was a tasty looking snack. Amara started to burn but suddenly her flames got shorter and stopped. Amara noticed she was scared to death for the predator. She was so scared. She realized it was Empath. Sure standing eye to eye with a panther was a bit scary. But Empath made it look even scarier. The next moment Empath hit her on the head with a piece of wood. <br>\r\nTabitha made some of her famous balls. But before she was able to throw them Jetstream flew right beside her and she dropped her balls at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" She mumbled. \"This is gonna hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment the bolls exploded throwing her to the wall and she passed out.<br>\r\nRogue was busy fighting Thunderbird. Thanks to his Super athletic ability he was able to duck away and block any attack Rogue did. At the same time she could't avoid his attacks. Of course if she could grab him she could defeat him. But Thunderbird was't maybe the smartest member of the team but he was't so stupid he would give Rogue the ability to touch him. Finally he jumped in the air. Gave Rogue a few good kicks against her head and she passed out and fell on the floor. <br>\r\nKitty noticed all her friends were defeated. The only reason she was't defeated because she faded through everyone and anything. But she knew she was't gonna win this way. Suddenly she froze. She could't move a single muscle. She knew who it was. Emma Frost. Sure she could fade through any body or object but that did't go for her mind. The next moment she passed out.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After what seemed like hours, Kitty slowly opened her eyes. \"Uuugggh. Like, what happened?\" She groaned as she slowly rose her head. As her grogginess faded, she gradually became more aware of her surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still in the old house, but, from the looks of it, she was in the basement now. She tried to move her hand to her head, but realized she couldn't. Looking down, she saw her hands were strapped to the arms of the large chair she was in. There was also belts strapping her legs down as well and a belt stretched over her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then, Kitty noticed something: she was no longer in her large clothes. Instead, she was wearing only her new plus sized bra and, here she blushed in embarrassment, a thick white diaper. \"What the-?\" Kitty looked around and then noticed that Jean, Rogue, Tabitha and Amara were also there, strapped to chairs and clad in bras and diapers. They were just starting to wake up now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? What's going on? Why're we in diapers?\" Amara asked as she tried to break free, but she was too groggy to flame up much to do anything. \"Like, I don't know guys.\" Kitty admitted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Emma walked downstairs with an evil grin. \"Ah. I see my five big babies've woken up.\" she jeered as she approached a control panel. \"Why're you doin' this, Frost?\" Rogue snarled as she struggled to get free, her diaper crinkling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't bother Miss. Rogue. Those belts were specially designed to keep your powers low enough to barely work.\" Emma smirked as she watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you totally gonna do to us now?\" Kitty demanded. \"Simple, Miss. Pryde. I'm going to use my new feeding machine to force feed all of you and make your even fatter.\" Emma smirked, nodding to the large machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why put us in diapers though?\" Tabitha asked, nodding to hers. \"Miss. Smith, what makes you think you'll be able to use the bathroom at any point during your feeding?\" Emma said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't get away with this!\" Amara shouted bravely at Emma. The White Queen merely smirked at her  as she pulled a lever and the large, expansive feeding machine roared into life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty went first, stopping at a large tank labeled ICE CREAM. A second later, large scoops of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, peanut butter, mint chocolate chip, blue moon and other ice cream flavors poured out into her gullet, bulging her cheeks. She barely managed to swallow before the next wave started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was sent to a large table piled with chili cheese burgers. Before she even really knew what was happening, a mechanical hand grabbed the first burger and smashed it into her mouth. Jean tried to fight back, but another hand merely pinched her nose, forcing her to swallow so she could breathe. Both hands then began stuffing the chili cheeseburgers into her mouth at a surprising speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, was being force fed rather huge sandwiches. PB&amp;J. Ham and Cheese. Grilled Cheese, Roast Beef. All those sandwiches were crammed into the poor fat goth girl's maw, nearly choking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was sitting in front of a large table with pies on it. One hand picked up a cherry pie and spin it on it's finger with a second forced Amara to gobble it down, getting the filling over her face. The same happened with an apple pie. Then a blueberry pie and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha, meanwhile, was parked in front of a table loaded with doughnuts. Soon, she was forced to wolf down ten at a time, her belly getting rounder and rounder as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a few minutes before they switched. Tabitha went to the ice cream, Kitty to the chili cheese burgers, Jean to the sandwiches, Amara to the doughnuts and Rogue to the pies. After they'd all gone to each station at least twice, Emma smiled down at the bloated five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time for the second course!\" she cackled as she activated the second round. This time, it was Jean who went first. Before she could even protest, a large tube was stuffed into her mouth and she felt chili running into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was forced to eat chili cheese hotdogs while Amara and Tabitha both were force fed with large, head sized meatballs and Rogue's mouth was stuffed full of rather jumbo corndogs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you to enjoy your meals.\" Emma laughed as she left, leaving the girls to their seeming fate. \"L-like *gulp* I totally *glorp* can't take *mmmph* this much *glorp chew* more!\" Kitty groaned in between chili dogs. \"Me neither, Kitty. But what can we do? Our powers don't work thanks to these belts.\" Rogue agreed before an especially giant corn dog was shoved into her mouth, bulging her cheeks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, an awful smell reached their noses. \"Um, guys? I think Jean's the first one to need a new diaper!\" Amara called, eying Jean's very full and lumpy diaper. Then, all four of the other girls farted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPOOOORRRRRRAAAAPPPPPP!!* Went Kitty's diapered butt as hers bulged out with poop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBLLLLOOOORRRRRTTTTTTT!* Tabitha's large butt followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFFFRRRRRRAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Amara's butt blared out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BLLLLLLLUURRRRRTTTCCCCHHHH!!!* Rogue went a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, check that. All of us need new diapees!\" Tabitha remarked before a new wave of food hit them.</span></div></div>",

MMMMMMMPPPPHHHH!\" Tabitha asked before her mouth was stuffed to the brim with fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the professor has the address of this house,\" Kitty was able to say before another wave of corn dogs was forced into her mouth.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Jean said. \"They'll look for us! MMMMMMMMPPPPPPPPHHHHHHH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean was right since Scott, Kurt, Evan, Bobby and Jamie were in their car just riding into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this's were Emma Frost lives,\" Evan asked. \"Professor X has a much better place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well be glad we're at his school and not here,\" Kurt said. \"I wouldn't wanna be here at night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. This is the address,\" Jamie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like Emma didn't put a lot of money in it,\" Evan said. \"If you need to pay for the repairs it will probably cost more then the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful.\" Scott said while he and the others walked in. \"I don't think Emma'll give up the girls without a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got that right, laser beam.\" Thunderbird said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came from behind a dark spot. Also Empath, Jetstream, CatsEye and Roulette appeared. All of the smiling in a evil way some of them cracking their knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott did a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen we don't want any trouble,\" He said calmly but on a convinced tone. \"We just want our friends back. Five fat young girls. You might have seen them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment the Hellions started to attack. Thunderbird jumped at Scott but as fast if he was he wasn't faster then a laser beam from Cyclops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJetstream flew around Bobby. Hitting him when he went by. But Bobby realized this after he was hit for the third time and the next time he froze him. He fell on the floor frozen not able to move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that you're gonna lose,\" Roulette said and threw a black disc at Nightcrawler who was limber enough to avoid it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard from your predictions. Point is it only counts when you get hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment he appeared behind her and give her a hard kick against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmpath could control other people's emotions. Point was that Evan seemed to have only one emotion at this moment. Anger. Anger that the hellions dared to capture some of his friends. Anger was one thing he couldn't really deal with. And angry or not it also couldn't control the spikes he shot at Empath. it were tiny spikes but very precise. It did touched his body but nailed his clothes to the wall with him still in them.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nJamie or four of him were standing around Catseye, in her panther form. When two of the got her attention a third one jumped on her back. But the one on her back became two, then three and the four. All four grabbed tight at her fur, ears and tail. When a fifth and sixth appeared it was to much for Catseye. her paws couldn't carry six boys on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the last Jamie walked away from the fight. He went downstairs and found the girls. All the girls looked at him with thanks in their eyes. He quickly turned off the machines while the others arrived<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll boys couldn't help it and smiled a bit at the girls. Not because of the very full diapers they were wearing. It was more since Jamie turned the machine of during the feeding. Kitty still had a large corn dog sticking out of her mouth. Jean had five large doughnuts stacked between her lips. Tabitha still had a large heap of fries sticking out of her mouth. Amara had a hot dog halfway in her mouth while Rogue had a mouth full of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty spat out the corn dog and moaned holding her belly in both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Ah! I'm, like, so totally full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? I'm bursting!\" Amara complained spitting out the hot dog before starting to clutch her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really\u2026 can't eat\u2026 another bite.\" Tabitha said while fries fell out of her mouth as she barely managed to swallow the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we better get out of here.\" Scott said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait we still need Emma to lift the curse.\" Kitty said. \"We're stuffed now but we all know how fast our hungry versions can appear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also still have five Hellions upstairs,\" Scott said. \"I guess they won't let us leave that easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're full but we can also fight,\" Tabitha said. \"They can't take ten of us. If they try we'll show 'em what a fat girl can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten came upstairs. Thunderbird, Roulette and Catseye had recovered, Empath had freed himself. Jetstream was standing up but she was shivering<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for round two?\" Scott asked and hit Catseye. She tried to crawl back up but suddenly got the entire weight of Kitty on her. She stayed where she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoulette ran at Kurt but suddenly bumped against Tabitha's belly who jumped for Kurt and threw a bunch of her balls right in front of her face. When they exploded she stepped backwards and fell right down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was fighting Empath. There wasn't any fear now in Amara only anger. She was fighting with (literally) burning fists and used her weight to push him back. He gave up and ran away. right out of the front door. Rogue jumped with her full weight at Jetstream. Pushing him right in front of Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no not again.\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby froze him again. Even more then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what,\" Jetstream said. \"How about I just walk away and we call it a tie?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment he ran away. They smiled but then Emma Frost came down. She took a look at the ten members of the X-Kids. Then at her students. But before she could do anything Scott hit her with a laser beam. Rogue picked her up and pushed her against the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now take off this curse or else.\" She growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can touch you so long you end up in a coma.\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can burn you like a torch!\" Amara said, flaring up her fists again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fade with my hands in your body and make knots in your insides!\" Kitty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can force  my ball in your mouth before they explode,\" Tabitha said. \"Can't wait to see what'll happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try anything Emma.\" Jean said. \"I might be not as strong if you but I can hold you up long enough for the others to do their thing. We also have a few boys here. You can't control us all at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Emma said. \"I guess I'm outnumbered. So fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She waved with her hand. Kitty, Tabitha, Amara, Jean and Rogue all felt like something leave their bodies, making them feel even more stuffed. All five girls moaned, holding their swollen bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they're fine now. I cannot take away their weight. I can do things with people's minds not their body. Their appetites will still remain large. Oh and say: \"hello\" to Charles for me. May I go now?\"</span></div></div>",

With that, the five fat and diapered girls waddled back downstairs with Emma as their hostage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmma struggled to break free, but the five were holding her tightly. After a moment, Jean undressed Emma to her bra and Kitty forced Emma into a large diaper of her own while Amara, Tabitha and Rogue changed into fresh diapers of their own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You brats're gonna pay for this!\" Emma snarled at Jean and Kitty as they strapped her down into a chair. \"No, Emma. You're gonna pay.\" Jean replied as she activated the machine. With one last snarl, Emma was sent to the Ice cream tank, which began pumping large scoops into her mouth. After two minutes, Emma was sent to the doughnuts and was force fed a whole truckload, giving her a big gut before the machine zipped her to the pie feeders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went until a roughly 700 pound Emma was brought over to the girls. She'd used her diaper four times during this and so it was very full and soaking wet from her urine. The girls smirked at her problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you ever try and do something like this to us again, we'll do it even worse.\" Jean threatened warningly. Emma glared at her and the other girls but didn't say anything. With that, Kitty, Jean, Amara, Tabitha and Rogue waddled back upstairs, Jean and Kitty having changed into fresh diapers during Emma's force feeding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey met up with Scott, Kurt, Bobby, Jamie and Spyke at the top of the stairs. \"How'd it go?\" Scott asked. \"I don't think we'll need to worry about Emma for a while Scott.\" Jean smiled as she hugged him, her belly smooshing against his trim lean body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, can we get outta here now?\" Kitty asked from behind Rogue. \"Sure.\" Kurt smiled as the ten started to leave. The Hellions had fled so they didn't face any opposition for trying to leave. Though the girls could only fit into their thankfully elastic and stretchy t-shirts, leaving their sumo sized diapers exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ten climbed into the boys' car and sped away for home, hoping they'd seen the last of the Hellions and Emma for awhile. Even though the ride was somewhat cramped, the girls didn't mind and neither did the guys. Jean sat beside Scott in the shotgun position while Spyke, Kitty, Kurt, Rogue, Jamie, Amara, Bobby and Tabitha were all squeezed into the back seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie sat beside Kitty, whose belly and love handles jiggled whenever they went over a pothole. Jamie felt somewhat embarrassed by his fixation on his doughy and diapered friend, but she did look pretty cute with the fat she now had. Kitty noticed him staring at her blubber and smiled before playfully ruffling his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was being oogled by Nightcrawler, who kept eying her massive gut as she rubbed and ran her hands over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was drumming her fingers lightly on her brown orb of a tummy as she talked with Bobby, who found it hard to keep eye contact with his NR teammate for more than two minutes before returning to eyeing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyke and Rogue both looked awkward. Rogue because she knew Evan was also slightly eying her pale, marshmallow like belly and Evan because he knew she knew he was impressed by her new size. Regardless, the ten teens made small talk as they got closer to Bayville's city limits a few minutes later.</span></div></div>",

Oh remember we need to say 'hello' to the professor from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we do that?\" Tabitha asked. \"Why should we do her a favor? After what she's done to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you mean\u2026 but I heard she and the professor once dated,\" Evan said. \"Long time ago.

What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps all the eating made your tummies stretch so much that they need a lot of food to fill them,\" Kurt said. \"So they still will eat a lot... but I don't think their hungry versions will come out ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets hope so.\" Kitty said. \"But I guess he's right. Sure I'm hungry and I want to eat but I don't feel like I'm gonna lose control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then why don't we stop at the buffet,\" Scott said. \"We boys also like a good meal right guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can eat there for free,\" Kitty whispered to Tabitha. \"But can the boys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not our problem,\" Tabitha whispered. \"Besides they have money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stopped at the buffet. The girls waddled inside as fast if the could. Scott wasn't entirely sure that this was the best idea. All five girls still wore their diapers since their pants were too tight. It might look a bit strange. But at the other hand so many people did strange things in America. Here in America the strangest things were possible. So why did a few fat, diapered girls matter? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got their plates and went in line. Each of them pilled their plates high with food and started stuffing their faces. The boys also took some food but it wasn't a large amount. Just a normal sized meal like they normally took. Only the girls took large meals and they were really pigging out.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nKitty was stuffing five burgers into her mouth before swallowing them, a very big lump sliding down her throat as she did.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJean had grabbed a whole pizza. She grabbed one side and rolled it up like a sleeping bag made it look like a huge wrap. After that she tried to stuff as much of it in her mouth as was possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had grabbed a entire basket of biscuits. She wasted no time and poured all the biscuits right in her mouth. Her cheeks were lumpy and full made her look like a chipmunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara was busy with her favorite. A chocolate cake. And not just any chocolate cake. A ten layer chocolate cake. Before she only had been able to look at it while drooling a bit and perhaps have a small piece before she was full. But now with her new appetite, she decided to use it to her advantage and to finally eat the entire thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha had something else in mind. She waddled over to the place were you could get soft served ice creams. just put you bowl or cone under it and you could get a nice ice cream. But Tabitha just put her head under it and let the ice cream just pour in her mouth right out of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara wolfed down the last piece of her cake and: \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!* Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need to excuse for that?\" Jean asked. \"Listen to this: *BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!* Look that's something to say Excuse me too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot really,\" Tabitha said with a mischievous grin. \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Hear that? That's how you gotta burp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Rogue asked. \"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!* That's how a real Southern gal burps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Guess I won!\" Kitty said with a big grin at her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one,\" Amara said. Then the lower part of her large brown tummy gurgled warningly. \"Oops I think I need to\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BLUUUUUURRRRRRRAAAAAAAAP!!!!!!* She filled her diaper and her face turned deep red as she felt the warm, sticky and smelly poop smooshing her butt since she was sitting down at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRPT!!!!!!!!!!!* This on came from Tabitha who also filled her diaper. Part because she needed too and part because she didn't want to feel Amara ashamed all by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell of both girls started to reach the noses of all the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest. I also gotta\u2026\" Rogue started but was interrupted when: *BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* A large fart escaped her bum and resulted in a rather full diaper for her too. \"Wow I gotta admit that feels a lot better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eh I need to go... get some fresh air.\" Kurt said and was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh I guess I need to go to,\" Scott said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso the other boys left since the couldn't stand how bad it smelt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nothing yet,\" Jean said as she began to grunt and strain, her face turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Another aroma joined the other three farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, why not,\" Kitty said with a smile. \"I could also go for a... Oh yeah. Here it comes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!* Kitty let out a ginormous fart that almost immediately filled her diaper completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Kitty won,\" Tabitha said with a laugh. \"Loudest burp and loudest fart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And also, like, biggest dump,\" Kitty said, poking her extremely full diaper as it bulged out from the giant poop. It was so full, it was filled from the waistband down. You could see her poop from behind her legs and the poor diaper looked like it was going to burst any second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know\u2026. I have these,\" Jane said and grabbed some clean diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were did you get those from?  Tabitha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took them from Emma. Short before we left. It seemed wise. And it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but what are we gonna do now?\" Amara said. \"We found out we did it. She lifted the curse but we still have a huge hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're still very fat.\" Jean added, poking her jumbo tummy as it gurgled slightly from the poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" Kitty said. \"But at least now we can keep our hunger under control. We still need to eat a lot to get full but we don't lose control. This way there's a chance we don't eat ourselves sick anymore. Sure we're fat and we probably gonna end up fatter\u2026 but girls... like, is that totally so bad? Amara, Jean all of you\u2026 you have some lovely female curves. And your bodies are now soft and warm. At least now your boyfriends have something to hold. You don't wanna feel bones when your hug your girlfriend. Something soft feels much nicer. If we're fine with our bodies isn't that what matter most. And as far if I could see\u2026 Scott, Jamie, Bobby, Evan and Kurt seemed to totally check out our bellies and like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. I guess that's true,\" Amara said. \"So what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.... eat! Kitty said with a grin, her diaper sagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we change our diapees. I don't know about you girls, but I don't want a big diaper rash when we leave.\" Amara said, noticing her butt was getting pretty itchy by that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls grabbed more food after changing into fresh diapers in the girls room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nKitty grabbed a large bowl of chill. She tried to gulp it all down but some of it landed in her shirt and face, though she didn't care. She just burped happily and kept slurping it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara in the meantime chomped down six rather large sugar cookies at once, getting crumbs on her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean and Rogue were both busy eating a large butterball turkey... at the same time using their hands and mouths. Ripping off the meat of the bones like a pack of starved wolves. Not wasting the tiniest piece of meat except what was around their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Tabitha enjoyed a big platter of doughnuts, shoving ten into her mouth at a time, getting powdered sugar, frosting and filling all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the girls kept eating and eating and were... happy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't notice Rogue went to bed. Did she sleep through that? What had happened? Suddenly she remembered. The huge dinner and her taking two slices of cake. How embarrassing. Well Storm was normally a pretty calm and understanding woman. So she probably wouldn't make a to big deal out of it. That was one good point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really needed to ask Professor Xavier what was going on with her. How to stop it. Or else she would soon look like The Blob. However Blob was fat but could take a lot. His fat protected him from objects of people that hit him. She didn't think she would have the same luck. Then her belly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again. I had a terrible tummy ache just a short while ago. How can I be hungry now again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed outside it was pitch black. Rogue was in bed. What time was it? She looked at her alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Middle of the night? That makes sense. After dinner and dessert I had a tummy ache. Not so strange if you knew how much I stuffed in my belly. But that was a few hours ago. I guess the food has digested. But why am I so hungry again? I need to ask Professor Xavier. But he's asleep now. I should do so but I'm so hungry. Perhaps just a small midnight snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to fall asleep again but the hunger kept nagging on her. She sighed and decided, fighting it was a lot cause.<br>\r\nKitty faded right through the bed, through the floor and dropped out of the ceiling. Right in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the right place. Just a small snack...\" Her voice drifted of when she opened the fridge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't knew what came over her but the next moment she started to stuff anything edible in her mouth. She even ate a raw broccoli. She ripped of leafs of lettuce and ate it with a gulp of dressing. She grabbed jars of jelly and poured the sticky stuff right in her mouth. The same went for the ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise. But she kept eating everything inside. A block of cheese, slices of ham and bacon. Fish and some other stuff that was probably mend for next dinner. But Kitty didn't mind. All she cared about was filling her belly. She even ate the six sticks of butter. The she slowly opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRP!! Oops. Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty suddenly saw the empty fridge and all the empty jars and wrappers around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man. I did it again. I made a total pig out of myself. Well I'm full now. I'm just pooped and\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she passed out right on the kitchen floor. Her belly round and bloated because of all the food in it.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Must be polite, friendly and a good worker. Apply at front counter</i>'.\" She read aloud. \"Like, that's a good idea.\" She decided as she went in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very plump young girl was at the counter as Kitty came up to her. \"Hi, I'm Kitty Pryde. Like, I'm here to totally try out for the job.\" She explained. \"Hang on.\" smiled the girl, whose name was Kimberly. She went to the back and entered the manager's office. After a few minutes, Kimberly returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Hoffman'll see you in her office.\" she told Kitty. Kitty nodded and headed for the office. Her stomach gurgled and rumbled hungerly as she watched the other employees cooking burgers, fries, salads and other delicious foods. She reached the office and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" said a voice. Kitty walked in and closed the door behind her. She found herself face to face with an heavyset woman with ginger hair and dark eyes. \"Hello. I'm Kitty Pryde. I-I'm here for the job.\" Kitty stammered slowly. The woman smiled at this. \"I see. Now, sit down and we'll talk.\" she said. Kitty swallowed slightly and did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, have you ever worked in a fast food join before?\" Mrs. Hoffman asked kindly. \"Well, no. But, like, I'm often willing to totally try out new things.\" Kitty smiled honestly, starting to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, when would you be able to come in for work?\" Hoffman asked. \"I can, like, totally come in every day. I usually have free time during the summer.\" Kitty offered. That was true. Aside from X-Men training, Kitty usually had the summer months free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, like, what're the benefits for the employees?\" Kitty asked after a moment. Hoffman smiled kindly. \"You will get 80% off all meals that you eat here. Also, the pay is very good and you can pick your days off.\" She explained. Kitty was sold after hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do I start?\" she asked with a smile. \"Tomorrow. We have enough people on the counter today.\" Hoffman smiled as she handed Kitty her uniform: a red t-shirt, black pants and a McDonald's visor hat. Kitty nodded and left after getting her first schedule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow she was to work the counter from 1 PM to 6 PM. The rest of the week would be this way as well. Kitty smiled as she then ordered 2 Big Macs, four large fries and a large chocolate shake to celebrate.  </span></div></div>",

In addition to her uniform, Kitty was also wearing a somewhat thick diaper in case she needed to use the toilet during her shift. Kimberly was there as well. When Kitty came in, she was surprised to see that, despite it still technically being lunchtime, there was barely anybody there aside from her, Kimberly, Mrs. Hoffman and some other employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, where is everybody?\" she asked Kimberly. \"Oh this shift's generally the slowest during the day. We usually only get people at the drive thru during it.\" Kimberly explained with an unconcerned smile. Kitty still seemed surprised, but ultimately accepted the explanation. \"So, what're we, like, totally gonna do today?\" she asked. Kimberly smiled even brighter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat!\" She smiled as she grabbed a large bag of burgers and fries and went to a booth. Kitty seemed shocked but then remembered that, as a McDonalds employee, she got 80% off every meal and so could basically eat as much as she wanted with little to no payment needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I guess it'll be, like, totally okay. After all, no one's coming right now and there's four to five more hours of my shift to kill.</i>\" She told herself with a smile. So, she purchased five Big Macs with onion, lettuce, tomato, cheese and ketchup, six large fries and two large chocolate malts before joining Kimberly at her booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were so satisfactory they passed quickly. By the time Kitty's shift ended, her belly had visibly bloated and she had massively pooped her diaper at least four times during her pig out. To her surprise, Kimberly had revealed she too wears and uses diapers during her shifts too. That led to the duo playfully farting and blaming each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty said goodbye to Kimberly and headed for home. She was glad when no one was in the main hall to greet her. Without making a sound, she happily went upstairs to change her diaper and lie down before dinner, hoping she could get at least most of it down without suspicion from the others as too why she was already full. </span></div></div>",

She'd also become good friends with Kimberly, who she enjoyed hanging out with both after school and work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the duo were hanging out at the institute in Kitty's room, clad in only t-shirts and their thick diapers. They were talking about their early lives and so on when Kitty had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Kimberly, wanna see which of us can, like, totally fill our diapers with the most poop?\" she offered with a smile. Kimberly was quiet for a moment and then smiled back. \"Okay. Though I should warn you, I've been winning diaper filling contests since daycare.\" Kimberly smirked as she and Kitty stood up to begin the contest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kinda cool. Like, in daycare, I totally won the \"Stinkiest and Fullest Diaper of the week\" award.\" Kitty smiled proudly. Kimberly smiled at that. \"I always wanted to win that award but Sharon Edwards always took it.\" She recalled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the duo squatted down and began pushing and straining. Gradually, their faces turned bright red as both kept straining. Finally, as they almost felt ready to call it quits, *PPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTT!!!* Kitty's rear end made a big fart and she pushed a decent load of poo into her diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Nice start, Kitty.\" Kimberly smiled as she then felt her own bowel movement incoming. Sure enough, a second later, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBLLLLLOOOORRRCCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!*  Kimberly's own diaper bulged slightly from her own pooping. The two girls giggled and kept pushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPP!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTT!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kitty and Kimberly's diapers were filled all the way up to their waistbands and sagging rather low so you could see the duo's naked butts slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My diaper's, like, so totally full, it doesn't have room for more.\" Kitty joked with a giggle as she held her diaper up with one hand. After a quick look, it was clear Kitty had won. Kimberly smiled and high fived Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Kit. Guess we're both 'big poopers'.\" She giggled as Kitty just giggled and nodded before they waddled to the bathroom to change and get ready for dinner.  </span></div></div>",

Kimberly was the same way as she was just as fat as her new friend Kitty was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to their new sizes, the two girls' meals were also much bigger than they were a year ago.

GO!!!\" Mrs. Hoffman shouted as she signaled the beginning of the competition. Kitty immediately grabbed a large cheeseburger and stuffed it into her mouth while also cramming a big fistful of fries in after it. As she chewed, she loudly slurped her malt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hour ticked by, the girls gradually weakened. Amber was the first to surrender, ending with 20 hamburgers and fries and 12 malts. Alison gave in two minutes later while trying to stuff her already overfilled-with-fries-mouth with a cheeseburger. Swallowing rather forcefully, she burped and fainted in her remaining fries with a weak groan, finishing with 25 burgers and fries and 17 malts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarcie admitted defeat ten minutes later with 28 hamburgers and fries and 23 malts. Groaning and hiccupping loudly, she leaned back in her seat, her pants popping open due to her jumbo belly a second later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her valiant efforts, Wanda also threw in the towel with 30 hamburgers and fries and 31 malts, burping very loudly as she also leaned back in her chair, clutching her swollen tummy in clear agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was just Kimberly and Kitty neck-in-neck. Kimberly had eaten 33 hamburgers and fries and 30 malts while Kitty had eaten 36 hamburgers and fries as well as 40 malts. Needless to say, Kimberly was both impressed and shocked by her friends' eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dang, Kitty's really improved over the last year. She's outeaten everybody else like me. I really do hope she may win the contest for her friend, but I'd also like to win. That way  I could help her by inviting her and the other X-Men to Hawaii with me.</i>\" She thought to herself as she stuffed burger and fries #34 into her gullet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as she brought burger #35 to her lips, Kimberly's large belly let out a massive gurgling grumble of protest. A second later, she moaned loudly and fainted face first onto the table as Kitty calmly finished her 44th burger and fries order as well as her final chocolate malt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I *burp* don't believe it. Pryde, how *urp* could *hic* you *belch* eat all that when *hic-urp* you've only begun eating like us for a  year? Where does it all go?\" Wanda groaned between burps and hiccups of agony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I've totally been ordering more food each day I totally work here.\" Kitty explained as she licked her fingers clean. \"Beside, I've always kinda had a bigger metabolism anyway.\" She added, patting her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Kitty won the trip and was commended for it by the others. As they headed home that night, Kimberly went with Kitty as she was allowed to spend the night with the X-Kids at the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, Kitty... if I'd won, I was willing to take you and the others to Hawaii with me.\" She admitted. \"Really?\" Kitty asked in surprise. \"Yeah. You guys're my friends. That's what friends do, right?\" Kimberly smiled back as she put a fat arm over Kitty's chubby shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two fat, diapered and happy girls set off for the mansion to tell Scott and the others the good news.</span></div></div>",

At the airport, \"So, is your brother a mutant too, Scott?\" Kimberly asked. \"Yeah. His powers are kinda like mine, but he can absorb energy and shoot it out of his chest and hands instead of his eyes.\" Scott explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a tall, slightly muscular boy with dark blond hair and wearing a white Hawaiian t-shirt and dark shorts arrived. \"Hey, bro!\" He said as he and the equally grinning Cyclops hugged. \"How're you Alex?\" Jean smiled. \"I'm doin' good, Jean.\" Alex smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he noticed Kitty and Kimberly. \"Woah. Kitty... is that you?\" He asked. \"Like, yeah Alex. Am I really so fat you didn't know it was me?\" Kitty asked as she ate a big candy bar. \"Well, you are kinda... round.\" Alex admitted sheepishly. Then, he saw Kimberly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are?\" He smiled politely. \"I'm Kimberly Hoffman. I work at McDonald's with Kitty.\" Kimberly explained as Kitty nodded. \"Cool.\" Alex smiled as the eight teenagers left the airport and headed for the Masters' house. Thankfully they had a fairly roomy house and so the kids would have their own rooms for the week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, the X-Kids and Kimberly attended a luau with Alex. There was all kinds of interesting foods, like Blue Hawaiian, Mai Tai, Pupu platters, Rumaki, Ono ribs and Shrimp Ono Nui. Needless to say, Kitty and Kimberly enjoyed each one extremely, eating the majority of each helping, though they did leave some for the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Kitty's really lettin' herself go now, huh?\" Alex remarked to Scott as they watched Kitty devour a massive amount of the Hawaiian cuisine all at once. \"Yeah kind of.\" Scott agreed as Kimberly devoured a large helping of Blue Hawaiian while Kitty cleaned out another plate of Ono ribs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may need to talk with her about it when we get home.\" Jean added as she watched Kitty and Kimberly giggling and laughing as they kept pigging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, Kitty, Kimberly, Spyke, Kurt and (to her discomfort at first) Rogue were convinced by Alex to try and do the hula with several of the other kids at the luau. Though they felt a bit embarrassed at first, the five quickly got the hang of it and began enjoying themselves immensely, especially Rogue. </span></div></div>",

What's up?\" Kitty asked upon noticing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, we've noticed you've been putting on a lot of weight lately. We just wanted to ask you if you think you could dial back your pig outs.\" Kurt said gently. Kitty didn't say anything. She just looked at her big tummy thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *SNAP!* her chair broke under Kitty's girth, causing the obese girl to plop onto the pavement on her fluffy diapered butt. \"Ooomph!\" She grunted as she did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Kitty? That's what we're talking about. You gotta cut down on the junk food.\" Jean said kindly. Kitty was quiet for a long moment as she stood up and looked down, only to barely see the tips of her feet over her fattened middle. It was then she realized that Jean and Kurt had a point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess you guys're totally right.\" She blushed. \"Maybe you should quit your job too. That way it'll help you lose your weight quicker.\" Kurt added as Kitty nodded thoughtfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, Kitty had quit working at McDonald's but remained close friends with Kimberly. She'd lost a majority of weight as well, but still retained a big appetite and a large belly as part of her life. She also kept wearing and using diapers due to finding them easier than going to the toilet.</span></div></div>",

Curious, Kitty decided to check it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she entered, Kitty saw it was very old fashioned on the inside. It had old chairs and tables that, despite their age, were still in very good shape. Though there weren't many people, despite it being the middle of the day, there was a fairly decent sized line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty got in line and looked at the glass case. There were cupcakes and slices of normal cakes for fairly decent prices. After a few minutes, Kitty's turn came. A plump redhaired girl around Kitty's age was working the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi and welcome to Swann Bakery, where we've been pleasing customers for 120 years. My name's Brianna. How may I help you?\" asked the girl in a cheerful voice. Kitty looked at the options again and decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll take one of the Choco Creamed cupcakes.\" Kitty smiled. Brianna nodded and pulled one of said cupcakes out. It was a large chocolate cupcake with chocolate cream filling inside and white frosting and colored sprinkles on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be two dollars please,\" Brianna smiled. Kitty handed over the money, telling Brianna to keep the change. As she left, Kitty unwrapped the cupcake and took a bite. Upon contact, her taste buds erupted into singing. It was basically the best thing she'd ever eaten. Kitty wolfed down the cupcake quickly and licked her fingers to make sure she didn't miss any crumbs, frosting or filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that was totally the best cupcake I've ever eaten! I've totally gotta hit that place again!\" Kitty smiled, letting out a gentle burp before giving her fingers one last good, long lick to make sure she'd gotten all the frosting, filling and crumbs.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it was the closest shop to the mall anyway. As she entered the shop, it was empty of people, which Kitty guessed was fairly common since it was pretty early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Kitty didn't know was that she'd put on a little weight from the cupcake yesterday. It wasn't noticeable, twenty pounds at the most, bringing her weight from 90 lbs. to 110. Instead of Brittney, who had worked the counter yesterday, there was another girl. She was slightly plumper than Brittney and had long ginger hair pulled into a ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. I'm Rita. Welcome ta Swann Bakery. What c'n I get a'fore ye, lass?\" she asked in a Scottish accent, smiling and showing her double chin. Kitty looked over all the cakes before deciding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll totally take the chocolate cake,\" Kitty said, pointing to the cake behind the case. \"Okay. We be havin' a special deal today. Buy one an' get four a'fore free,\" said Rita smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty thought that was a weird offer but took it anyway. She sat down at a table and started eating all four cakes, leaving no crumbs. She was soon licking globs of chocolate off her fingers as Rita came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah. Ye really enjoyed the cakes, didn't ye, lass?\" Rita remarked, surprised that Kitty had managed to eat all four cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They were, like, totally amazing. Like, I'm Kitty by the way.\" Kitty smiled as she and Rita shook hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we be havin' a job opening for a new taste tester. The owner's takin' interviews in the back.\" Rita shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that'd totally be awesome.\" Kitty smiled, figuring she could use the extra money. With a quick nod, Rita went to the back before returning a few minutes later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss. Swann'll see ye in the back,\" Rachel said, helping Kitty up. What Kitty didn't know was that now she had ballooned from 100 pounds to 120, giving her a chubby belly due to the four cakes adding twenty pounds to her weight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alicia Swann was in her office, thinking over her plans. She was a attractive 20 something year old woman with long brown hair. She had only taken the bakery over a year ago from her late parents. However, more modern bakeries were getting the attention nowadays. But, Alicia had developed a plan to stop this. \"I'm so close to my plans for world dominance. Once everyone gets addicted to my cakes, they'll all be too fat to stop me! It'll teach them to ignore my family's business. \" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door from Rita. \"What is it, Rita?\" Alicia asked with a fake smile as the young girl waddled in with Kitty behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Alicia. This' Kitty. She's here about the position.\" Rita said, pointing to Kitty before leaving the two. Alicia took a moment to look Kitty over. It was clear she'd enjoyed the bakery's cakes, judging from her visible chubby belly and the chocolate frosting smeared around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi miss...\" Kitty began but was cut off by Alicia waving her hand, hitting her dark blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Alicia. I hate the whole formal thing.\" Alicia said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I'm gonna ask you some questions and you just answer them to see if you get the job.\" Alicia added with a smile. In reality, it wasn't a food taste tester she was looking for, but someone who would promote her cakes and it looked like Kitty fit the bill, but she needed to make it look like an actual interview.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, first question: Have you ever worked in a bakery before?\" Alicia asked as Kitty sat across from her, looking nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no. But, like, I totally make cupcakes sometimes.\" Kitty said, a little nervously. Alicia just gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. When would you be able to work?\" asked Alicia, tapping her fingers on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I can totally come in everyday after school. I usually have a ton of free time then.\" Kitty offered. That was true. Aside from missions and training, Kitty usually did have everyday after school free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now for the final and most important question: How do you like our cakes?\" Alicia asked, even though she already knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, they're totally awesome! The best cakes I've ever had!\" Kitty smiled, rubbing her chubby belly in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. I think I've heard enough. Welcome aboard.\" Alicia said, standing up with Kitty as they shook hands. Kitty was feeling pretty proud about getting the best job in the world in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, when do I start?\" Kitty asked, ready to start eating some of those yummy cakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now.\" Said Alicia, quickly calling Rita, who waddled in carrying Kitty's new uniform. It consisted of a red t-shirt, a red visor hat and stretchy black pants. Rita was also holding what looked like a thick diaper. Kitty grabbed both, looking at Alicia in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot to mention that all employees are required to wear diapers so we can have 100% of our employees' time.\" Alicia explained. Kitty nodded after a moment and ducked into the bathroom to change. A second later, she came out in her new work clothes, the t-shirt already stretched tightly across her belly. \"You look perfect.\" Alicia smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Like, I totally can't wait to try more cakes.\" Kitty smiled as her belly rumbled, wanting more cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Go take a seat near the counter. I'll have Rita bring you the first batch.\" Alicia ordered. Kitty nodded and walked to the front. Alicia went to the kitchen, where six cupcakes with purple frosting were all ready for Kitty. Alicia smirked and then injected a brainwashing serum into them. It would take a few weeks to kick in, but she could wait. \"Rita, the first batch is ready.\" Alicia called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it boss.\" said Rita as she grabbed the tray and took it out to Kitty, who was waiting patiently. \"Here you go.\" said Rita, setting the tray down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Kitty said as she began to eat. She ate cupcake after cupcake until they were all gone. Then, Rita brought out four large chocolate birthday cakes, with Kitty eating them all up. She was so focused on eating that she didn't notice she pooped her diaper twice as she sat back, rubbing her full, large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few weeks had passed since Kitty got the job and there had been quiet a few changes with her. The first thing was that she had completely fallen under Alicia's brainwashing. Also, her size had increased quite a bit. Her belly was becoming as round as the rest of her, causing her to resemble a sumo wrestler. Her shirt stretched over the large tummy, which now looked like a wrecking ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd also been going around school, telling everybody about this amazing bakery. This led to quite a few female students and teachers becoming fat. With the exception of the other X-Kids and male staff and students, everybody was becoming bigger. Kitty walked into class late due to finishing her third cake of the morning. \"Like, sorry I'm late.\" Kitty said, taking her seat, causing it to crack under her blubbery and diapered girth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" said the teacher, not really caring as she stuffed a cupcake into her mouth, causing a button on her shirt to pop off. Kitty then pulled out a large cheesecake with whipped cream from her bag and started eating it. This concerned Spyke and Kurt, who'd noticed her increased size like Rogue, Scott and Jean had. Kurt decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kitty, maybe you should cut back on the cakes. You're getting pretty big.\" Kurt said, leaning from his desk and poking her in her large belly. \"Like, I totally have no idea what you're talking about. Besides, tasting the cakes is really good money.\" Kitty said. Thanks to Alicia's brainwashing, Kitty was oblivious to her weight unless ordered otherwise. After that, the X-Kids gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring lunchtime, the X-Kids were sitting together except for Kitty, who was off doing something. All the X-Kids were eating their lunch while the rest of the school (except the male students) were currently eating cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong's going on here. Kitty's been getting really fat since she started working at that bakery and she's acting really strange.\" Scott said with a concerned expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and a lot of the girls're getting fat too. Even the cheerleaders.\" Jean said, nodding to the table where said students were sitting. The cheerleaders really were pretty chubby. In fact, every female in the cafeteria also ranged from chubby to fat size wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at Taryn.\" Kurt said, nodding to Jean and Scott's friend. Taryn was currently eating a large chocolate cake that seemed to be four layers thick with large pieces of chocolate on it. She was definitely obese as her belly resembled a wrecking ball and her whole body was as big as Kitty's. Yet, like the other girls, she didn't seem to care as she happily scarfed down the cake, frosting smearing over her face as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has gotta be connected ta Kitty an' that bakery.\" Rogue said with a thoughtful look on her face as she crunched her apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I dunno 'bout you guys, but I think we should investigate that bakery an' see what's happenin' with the K-girl.\" Spyke suggested with concern for his fellow X-Men, earning nods from the others. The rest of the day went by fairly normally, aside from the fact that Kitty was absent for that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school found them sneaking to Swann bakery, which was now a factory due to increase in demand for their cakes. All five snuck into the factory and saw a whole group of obese, diapered girls making cakes while in the middle of it all was Kitty. She was sitting at a table with Alicia watching her while Rita handed more cakes over for Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the workers had befriended Kitty over the last few weeks and, like her, were under Alicia's mind controlling serum so they didn't remember most of their original lives aside from their names and were aware of their current sumo-sized weights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Kitty. Keep eating. With your help, soon the world's females will be under my control!\" Alicia laughed evilly as Kitty pooped her diaper, the stench carrying around the factory. The X-Kids decided to make themselves known after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step away from our friend!\" Kurt shouted as they appeared from behind a bunch of boxes. Kitty didn't even stop eating her cakes. Alicia rolled her eyes and turned to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, please help us deal with these fools. Attack.\" Alicia ordered. Kitty quickly stopped eating her latest cake and charged at her friends surprisingly quick for someone of her girth. Rogue got knocked out almost instantly by Kitty's large belly, being caught off guard for said attack. The others soon followed suit as they didn't want to use their powers out of fear of hurting their friend. Alicia looked over the knocked out X-Kids and suddenly had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I want you to tie these two up, change them into the company uniform and diapers and force feed them. Rita and Suzanne, help me take those three to be frozen.\" Alicia ordered, nodding to Jean and Rogue and Scott, Kurt and Spyke respectively as she, along with Rita and a large African-American girl with black hair tied in a ponytail grabbed the latter three and drug them to the factory's enormous freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kitty nodding as she grabbed two uniforms and diapers for Jean and Rogue. She quickly changed them and tied them up to two chairs. When Rogue and Jean woke up, the first thing they noticed was the diapers and that they were tied up. Before they could even speak, they were being force fed numerous cakes. As time passed, Jean and Rogue started to become fatter and fatter, their bellies becoming rounder and they had no choice, but use their diapers, causing Kitty to laugh as she watched her obese and helpless friends poop and pee their diapers again.</span></div></div>",

Alicia smiled at the handy work in evil delight. \"Alright. With that taken care of, I have some work to go over.\" Alicia said, heading to the office while Suzanne went back to work with the other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rita, don't forget to lock up the antidote cupcake!\" ordered Alicia, who had made said cupcake in case she ever accidently ate one of her cakes. \"Aye, lass.\" Rita said as Alicia went into her office. Rita went over to lock up the cupcake, when the timer went off for some other cakes. \"Och. Alicia'll kill me if I let the cakes burn.\" said a worried Rita, waddling to the ovens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to either Rita or Alicia, Scott's optic beam was charging up and a second later, he had freed himself, causing him to fall to his knees and hands. \"Finally.\" remarked Scott as he got up and quickly began freeing Spyke and Kurt. Within minutes, the duo were freed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks man.\" Spyke said as Scott helped him up. \"Vere are Jean und Rogue?\" Kurt asked, looking for said duo. \"I dunno but I overheard Alicia talking about an antidote cupcake that can destroy the brainwashing. We just need to feed it to Kitty, then we'll try and find Rogue and Jean.\" Scott replied, earning nods from the duo as he grabbed the large pink frosted and rainbow sprinkled cupcake as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio started looking around the factory and what they saw a few minutes later shocked them. There was Rogue and Jean, tied up, donned in the bakery's uniforms and diapers and being force fed cake. The duo had put on quite a bit of weight, the t-shirts riding up above their bellybuttons. Kitty was still force feeding them, often swiping bites from the cakes herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, stop!\" Kurt called, startling Kitty as Scott quickly used his optic blasts to free Rogue and Jean, who quickly used their new weight to pin Kitty down as they tackled her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Get this in her mouth!\" Scott called, tossing the cupcake to Rogue, who quickly stuffed it into Kitty's mouth. Kitty, out of habit, ate it and then burped loudly. It took a couple of minutes for the antidote to take hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errg. Like, what happened?\" Kitty asked as Jean and Rogue managed to get off her. Then, all the memories of her time mind controlled came flooding in. \"Like, oh man guys. I'm so totally sorry.\" Kitty said, feeling awful for hurting her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Kit. Ya can make it up by gettin' Alicia for us while we try an' free Rita and her friends.\" Rogue smiled as she helped Kitty up. Kitty nodded and took off fairly quickly despite her weight and full diaper. Soon, she reached Alicia's office and phased through the door, shocking Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? What is it? I told you to force feed those brats!\" Alicia commanded. \"Like, I'm totally me again, Alicia! My friend Jean's, like, totally going to free Rita and the others now.\" Kitty smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! That freak'll pay for this!!!\" Alicia snarled as she grabbed a tube filled with red liquid. \"Once I make her drink this, your idiot friend will be addicted just like you were!\" she laughed. \"Like, no way!\" Kitty shouted, tackling Alicia and pinning her under her gut. Quickly, Kitty grabbed the vial and forced it's entire contents into Alicia's throat. Within seconds, Alicia swelled up into a sumo version of herself, knocking Kitty off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What've you done to me?!?!? You stupid mutie!\" Alicia roared as she tackled Kitty with her girth, sending the duo toppling into the main factory. \"Kitty!\" Kurt shouted as he fought Brianna, who was wielding a rolling pin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite some difficulty, Alicia and Kitty managed to stand up. \"Like, it's okay Kurt! You guys get Rita and the others free! I'll totally stop Alicia!\" Kitty shouted as she and Alicia commenced a sumo-wrestling match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it!\" Kurt shouted as he managed to evade Brianna's pin and then knocked her down with a kick to her double chin. Scott meanwhile was fighting Rita and Suzanne while Spyke dealt with two Asian girls and Rogue wrestled with a sumo-sized Hindu girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can stop me, Pryde!\" Alicia snarled in delight as she belly-flopped onto Kitty. However, Kitty smirked as she phased out from Alicia and then sat on her, pinning Alicia to the floor. \"EEEuuggghh!! Stupid wide load mutie! Get off me!\" Alicia shrieked in fury as she wiggled and jiggled in dismay. However, Kitty just smirked and pooped her diaper again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Jean!\" Scott shouted as he dodged Rita's attack with a knife and eggbeater. Jean closed her eyes and focused hard on the girls. Alicia smirked evilly as Jean began straining slightly but then, to her horror, she saw Rita and the other girls freeze mid-attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what's happnin'?\" Rita stammered in shock as she looked at Cyclops, laying before her feet. \"I don't know. The last thing I remember is going into Swann bakery and eating a slice of chocolate cake.\" Brianna admitted as she helped Kurt up, having just knocked him down with a round kick to his chest. \"Yeah. Me too. What're the X-Men doin' here?\" agreed one of Evan's Asian opponents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to save our friend from Alicia.\" Scott explained. \"Do you guys remember anythin' from the last few months or so?\" asked Rogue, looking at her Hindu opponent. \"N-no. It's all a blur of cake and hazy memories.\" the girl said. \"They're telling the truth, Cyclops.\" Jean confirmed as she kept scanning the other girls' minds. \"The serum must've locked your memories away the longer you consumed it.\" Scott realized. \"What serum?\" asked the younger Asian girl from beside her big sister and Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mind control serum that Alicia here used to get you girls to do her bidding.\" Rogue replied. \"I don't believe it!\" said the Hindu girl in outrage. \"You took us all from our homes, our families and our lives just to do your evil bidding?!?!?\" she snarled at Alicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? My family have been top bakers for 120 years! But no one wants to use old fashioned bakeries for weddings or things anymore! You morons prefer using more modern and newfangled ones instead!\" Alicia spat from under Kitty's very full diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll have lots of time to think about things where you're going, Alicia.\" Jean frowned. \"What about us?\" asked Brianna nervously. \"Don't worry. you were all innocent. As long as we tell the police that, you'll be okay.\" Scott smiled kindly. \"What're your names? We know Suzanne, Rita and Brianna from Kitty talking about them but..\" He added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Parvati Koothrapali from Queens. My family owns a popular eatery there.\" said Rogue's Hindu opponent with a grin. \"I'm Wanda Yeung and this is my baby sis Cho.\" said the bigger Asian girl from beside Spyke as her sister smiled and waved. \"S'up?\" Cho smiled as Wanda rolled her eyes in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean used her telepathy to unlock each girl's memories from before and during their time under Alicia's brainwash. Wanda and Cho remembered coming to Swann bakery, having gone there to pick up a delivery for their mom, only to end up applying for a job after trying a free sample. Brianna recalled joining the staff after applying for a job there due to trying a sample at a supermarket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzanne had ended up at the bakery when Rita, revealed to be her best friend, had suggested it to her. Parvati, meanwhile, had wound up there due to her mother's friend also recommending it as a good after school job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, Kitty, Jean and Rogue were having a victory party in Kitty's room. The girls, due to being brainwashed, had been cleared of charges, just like Scott had said. They had kept in touch with Kitty and the X-Kids and both Wanda and Cho were revealed to be mutants and would join the institute next year. Rita, meanwhile, had taken over the bakery and was doing a good job running it as it was discovered she was Alicia's maternal cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girls had all returned to normal size due to the antidote Alicia kept in her office. However, Alicia had been barred from doing so by the X-Kids as punishment. Alicia had been jailed and was now currently awaiting trial. The Bayville High female students and staff were all back to normal via the antidote as well. Well... almost all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, good thing we totally decided against using the cure to loose this blubber.\" Kitty smiled to Jean and Rogue as they ate their way through heaps of junk food. Jean was eating numerous creampuffs, Rogue was chomping down on peanut butter, snickerdoodle and chocolate chip cookies and Kitty was eating numerous cakes. They were also clad in only t-shirts and diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can't believe we ever hated being fat. We're still pretty active and agile even with our current sizes and we're really strong!\" Jean smiled before stuffing six big creampuffs into her mouth, smearing powdered sugar and frosting on her face and mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kitty, eating a large cake with her hands, pooped her diaper. \"Oopsie!\" She blushed as the stench filled the room. \"Good thing we also decided ta keep wearin' and usin' diapers!\" Rogue joked, causing them to laugh as they continued their party.</span></div></div>",

Since she'd never seen it before, she decided to go inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked inside, Kitty noticed the shop was very retro themed. As she walked up to the counter, she rose an eyebrow at some of the names since they were all stuff like \"the gut puncher\" and \"the stuffer\". \"Like, those are totally strange names for doughnuts.\" Kitty thought to herself as she was brought out of her thoughts by the woman working behind the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Welcome to Doughnut Paradise. How may I help you?\" said the woman in a much too cheery tone for the job she had in Kitty's opinion. Kitty looked at the menu and took a few seconds before making her mind up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll have two gut punchers,\" Kitty said. The woman nodded and pulled two gut punchers out from the display case. Kitty was surprised by the size of them. They were as round as her head with red and blue sprinkles on them. The woman put them into a to-go bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok miss, that'll be three dollars.\" said the woman in her cheery voice. Kitty was surprised by how cheap the doughnuts were given their size, but nevertheless handed over a ten and told the woman to keep the change. Once out of the shop, Kitty pulled one of the doughnuts out and took a bite. Her taste buds exploded, it was the best thing she'd ever tasted and she kept eating as she walked. By the time she got back to the mansion, she had finished both doughnuts and was rubbing her bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I totally need to go there again!\" Kitty said to herself, letting out a jumbo burp, still rubbing her belly.</span></div></div>",

Once she got her clothes on, her belly rumbled and she decided it was best to grab some doughnuts and waddled to the doughnut shop. When she arrived, she found there weren't too many customers, which wasn't surprising since it was still pretty early.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Kitty. I see you're in again,\" smiled the woman behind the counter. Kitty had been in the shop so often, she was on first name basis with most of the employees who were always cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Betty. Like, can I totally get my usual order?\" Kitty asked. Betty nodded and stuffed 20 doughnuts into a box.

But Scott noticed someone was missing. \"Hey, where's Kitty?\" He asked, picking some loose fabric from his blue sweater, the dark lenses of his glasses watching the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's probably at that doughnut shop again,\" Jean said, rolling her eyes as she tucked some of her red hair behind her ear. \"I think she's spending too much time there. I think she's getting kind of...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jean could finish her sentence, there was a loud cracking sound. A second later, they saw Kitty waddling up to the door while using one hand to eat one of the doughnuts from a very big bag of them. But as she got up to the door and tried to go through, she found that she was stuck. Her big love handles pressed against the doorframe. She tried to free herself but couldn't. After a minute, she gave up, huffing and puffing and her round face slightly red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey guys. Can you help me?\" Kitty asked, waving her flabby arms, half a doughnut in her mouth. \"Kurt, you teleport and push from behind while I pull,\" Scott said. Kur nodded and teleported behind Kitty and the duo started to push and pull. It took a couple of minutes until Kitty was completely free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks guys.\" Kitty said, shoving another doughnut into her mouth. \"Maybe you should cut back on the doughnuts,\" said Kurt, clearly concerned for Kitty as she waddled to the couch. \"I'm, like, totally fine.\" Kitty said, flopping on the couch, causing her whole body to jiggle and repositioned herself so she was laying on her back, making her burp loudly with a giggle following afterward. As she made herself comfortable, the other moved away to talk about her for a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, Ah'm worried about Kitty. She's gettin' huge and Ah bet it's somethin' ta do with that doughnut shop she's been going too.\" Rogue said with a worried look towards Kitty as she happily scarfed her large bag of doughnuts, burying her head into the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. Maybe we should go check the place out.\" Jean said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Kurt, Jean and I'll go check it out while Rogue, you and Spyke keep an eye on Kitty to make sure she doesn't get any bigger.\" Scott said. Kurt then grabbed Jean and Scott's shoulders and teleported them to an ally behind the doughnut shop.

Jean signaled for them to hide behind some barrels and they listened to the mad scientist talking to himself. \"Yes. My test subject is coming along perfectly, now that Miss. Pryde is growing huge. Soon, I will release my doughnuts around the world and everyone will be too fat to resist me taking over the world!\" laughed Eugene Sprinkles. The trio decided it was time to make their presence known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if we stop you,\" said Kurt as he, Jean and Scott revealed themselves. \"Ah, I see Kitty's little friends have come to put a stop to my plans.\" said Sprinkles with a huge smirk on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will stop you,\" said Scott. But as soon as he stopped talking, a strange mist filled the room, making Scott, Jean and Kurt pass out. Sprinkles walked over to them smirking. \"Don't worry you will all wake up soon with a little soreness.\" He smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis current situation had put a big dent in his plans. He would need to put his off hand monitoring and take on a more practical approach. Grabbing a very large bag of doughnuts, he left for the X-Mansion. Upon showing up, he saw Rogue and Spyke arguing over something in the kitchen while Kitty was still laying on the couch, holding her empty bag of doughnuts with a sigh. Smirking, Sprinkles went to the front of the mansion and started speaking through an open window, \"Come on, Kitty. Don't you want some tasty doughnuts?\" said Sprinkles, waving the large bag of doughnuts back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doughnuts...\" Kitty said in an almost trance like state as she managed to get up and waddled to the door, turning sideways so she could get through. She then followed Sprinkles, with him feeding her doughnuts as he led her to his mansion, which took awhile to get to. Once there, Sprinkles helped Kitty onto a large king sized bed as she munched on doughnuts, moaning in delight as she did, getting frosting, sprinkles and sugar all over herself as she devoured tray after tray of them while laying either on her belly or back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, Sprinkles ran into a problem. Kitty seemed to have entered an eating trance, an unforeseen side effect of having nothing to eat but doughnuts, though the scientist didn't mind this side effect, it also brought out another side effect. Due to being in an eating trance, Kitty didn't notice she was peeing and pooping her pants due to forgetting about going to the bathroom. The scientist struggled to find away to fix this as he had to keep repeatedly clean her underpants and pants before deciding on putting her in diapers to deal with the problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of Kitty sleeping soundly, drooling in her sleep and sucking her thumb, he put her in a large thick diaper, taking time to lovingly jiggle her big belly and love handles. This diaper wasn't like normal ones. It was able to be cleaned after each use, even the wettest pee or stickiest poop couldn't stain it and it never wore out. The diaper was also very soft inside with fluffy padding. It wasn't long before this task was done and he went back to his main mission of spreading his doughnuts around the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later...</span></div></div>",

Though Kitty didn't seem to notice the passing time since she spent most of it eating or sleeping or, in some occasions, eating while sleeping, notably at night. It became normal for Mr. Sparkles to come downstairs and find Kitty with her head in the fridge, loudly scarfing down doughnuts in between snores while her large diapered butt jiggled and wiggled with each movement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Sprinkles was quiet happy with how much Kitty had grown. Her belly was now so big, it hung over the waistband of her diaper while her face was like a blob of dough with a double chin, plus her arms and legs were squishy and flabby, her fingers, hands, feet and toes were all plump and her boobs had swollen considerably as well and her butt was like a very ripe pumpkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had also mostly outgrown all but her stretchy bra and her diaper over the last month. Though she briefly felt embarrassed, Kitty quickly forgot all about it and went back to her eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to see if Kitty was still mobile, Sprinkles did an experiment in which he had her waddle to the living room. He found that, though she was able to do so, Kitty was left very out of breath and quite slow. She then flopped onto her belly and started eating the very big doughnuts left for her while still laying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the experiment, Mr. Sprinkles quickly changed into a smart suit. He had a meeting with a high ranking government official to get his doughnut franchise spread around the world. After checking to make sure that Kitty was still in an eating trance and had enough doughnuts to make her full and sleepy, he started to leave, only for a thick cloud of smoke to appear in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke cleared, he saw it was five mutant teenagers, three of who he recognized from the month before when they broke into his shop. All five were very shocked to see Kitty, semi-naked, fat and diapered while she started on another doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Kitty's as big as a pig,\" Rogue remarked, looking at her obese teammate and best friend. \"Why did you make our friend fat?\" Scott asked, glaring at Mr. Sprinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your friend is just helping me with my plan to conquer the world,\" Mr. Sprinkles smirked as he unleashed a pink mist. However, he was left confused by the fact it didn't have any effect on the five teenagers. He was even more shocked by the effect it had on Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Like, where am I? What's goin' on?\" Kitty asked, looking around in confusion at her friends and the mad scientist. When she looked down, she could only just see her feet over her big belly. \"Like, why am I so fat?!?!?\" She asked, shaking her belly and thus causing it to jiggle and bounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ve'll explain later,\" Kurt said as he and the others began fighting Sprinkles. Despite their efforts, Sprinkles was quite slippery and managed to avoid their physical or telekinetic attacks. As he got near Kitty, she saw her chance and threw herself at him. Before he could move, Kitty belly flopped on him, knocking him out cold. Scott and Kurt quickly heaved her up while Jean and Spyke tied up the Mr. Sprinkles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys. So, like, what happened?\" Kitty asked, still getting used to her girth and blushing bright red at the fact she was naked aside from her bra and crinkly undergarment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, you were used as a test subject by the scientist dude who wanted to make everybody fat so he could rule the world.\" Spyke explained, having been told of the man's plan by Scott, Jean and Kurt after the trio had returned to the mansion a month prior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, okay,\" Kitty said, clearly still confused over the whole ordeal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kitty... are ya wearin' a diaper?\" Rogue asked, trying and failing not to laugh at how silly Kitty looked in the extra large diaper. \"Like, I totally don't know why.\" said Kitty in embarrassment, her round cheeks blushing even deeper bright red as she poked the undergarment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll figure that out later,\" Kurt smiled as he teleported the gang home, leaving Sprinkles to the authorities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA year later found Kitty heading to hang with her friends. Though she had dropped most of the weight, returning her face, boobs, arms, feet, legs, butt, hands, toes and fingers to normal, she nevertheless sported a rather large belly that hugged her shirts and sweaters. She also retained her jumbo appetite as well. Despite this, she was happy this way and her friends knew and supported it. Kitty was still able to go on missions and was actually still fairly agile despite her remaining fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, unknown to the other X-Kids, Kitty still wore the thick, cleanable diaper she'd been introduced to by Mr. Sprinkles. It made her feel comfy and safe. </span></div></div>",

If ya do, Ah'll give ya 20 bucks.\" Rogue offered with a smirk. Kitty thought about it. On one hand, the picture made the sundae look massive. But then, on the other, 20 dollars was 20 dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that twenty dollars is totally mine!\" Kitty smirked back as she closed her menu. After waiting a few seconds after Scott got up to place their orders before returning to take his seat next to Jean. A few minutes later, a waitress arrived with five bowls of ice cream: mint for Jean, chocolate for Kurt, strawberry for Scott and two peanut butter ice creams for Rogue and Spyke. Then, she turned to Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring your order in just a second,\" smiled the waitress as she went back, leaving Kitty to watch her friends eat their ice creams. A minute later, the waitress arrived and placed a massive sundae in front of Kitty. It had large scoops of ice cream, which were drenched in hot fudge sauce, a generous amount of whipped cream and a huge red cherry on top. Kitty's mouth was watering and her friends were shocked by the size of the sundae. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! There's no way ya can eat all'a that!\" Rogue smirked, already gloating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, nope! That 20 dollars is totally mine!\" said Kitty, grabbing her spoon and digging in. Her taste buds exploded with flavor. She kept eating and eating until a half-hour later, the sundae was gone, leaving a very green looking Kitty clutching her bloated belly, her face filled with pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty? Are you alright? You don't look so good.\" Kurt said with concern for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally fine...\" said Kitty. She was then interrupted by herself slapping her hand over her mouth as she felt bile raising in her throat while feeling herself starting to gag, making her cheeks puff up, but Kitty managed to swallow it down, releasing her hand and letting out a large burp. \"Excuse me.\" said Kitty and then she turned to Rogue. \"Like, pay up.\" Kitty said with a smug smile, despite her poor belly's pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah still can't believe ya managed ta eat it all,\" Rogue said, rolling her eyes as she forked over the money and Kurt and Scott helped Kitty out of the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah. But it totally tasted amazing! I have to, like, totally do this again,\" said Kitty as she followed her friends out of the shop.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole week since the group of mutant teens went to the ice cream parlor and unbeknownst to the others, Kitty had been going back once a day to get a cup of ice cream, resulting in her putting on a little weight. Nothing major, just five pounds. None of her friends noticed this because they spend 99% of the time together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day the gang decided to visit the ice cream parlor again for another treat after a busy week as they took their seat in a booth. \"I still can't believe you managed to eat a whole sundae last week,\" Jean said with a giggle as she looked over the ice cream menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But it tasted totally amazing,\" Kitty said, licking her lips as she imagined the sundae despite the fact that she'd almost thrown up all over the table the last time she'd had it. Scott then had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I'll bet you 100 dollars that you can't eat two of those sundaes,\" said Scott with a smug grin, remembering the state Kitty had been in after eating just one last week. Kitty thought about it. Two sundaes were a lot to eat, but her appetite had been increasing over the past week. Plus, she could use the 100 dollars to buy something. After a couple more seconds of thinking, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your dare,\" Kitty said with a smirk. Jean went over and placed the order and returned a minute later. After ten minutes, two waitresses came to the table. One was holding the rest of the group's orders while the second held Kitty's two large sundaes similar to the one she'd ordered last time. After saying thanks to the duo, the rest of the group ate their ice creams while watching Kitty as she devoured the first sundae, getting hot fudge all over her face. But as she started the second one, she slowed down, starting to feel full. But she still ate and ate until the last sundae was gone, leaving Kitty looking very green. Even her ears had turned green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I lost 100 dollars,\" sighed Scott as he handed Kitty the money. Kitty was about to retort but she then felt bile raising in her throat. She quickly got up, grateful to have chosen to sit next to the booth's opening, and ran off to the bathroom surprisingly quick for being so bloated like she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the bathroom, she entered the nearest cubical and threw up straight into the toilet, thick brown liquid hitting the water. After a few minutes, Jean and Rogue entered as Kitty barfed one more time, nearly dunking her head into the toilet as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay, Kitty?\" Jean asked, looking at her bloated friend bent over the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, I totally think I got it all out of my system.\" Kitty said as Rogue helped her up and back to the rest of the group.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole month since Kitty had done her second sundae dare. Ever since that day, Kitty had been making multiple trips to the ice cream parlor daily, mainly getting ice cream cones. This had led to a massive change in her weight and appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly now hung over the waistband of her way too tight pants, her boobs had gone up at least two cup sizes while her face had gotten a bit rounder with chubby cheeks and a double chin coming in. All her friends had noticed Kitty's change in weight, but had decided against saying anything that might hurt their friend's feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something her friends didn't know. Due to having numerous peeing and pooping accidents in her pants (mainly the latter), Kitty had resorted to wearing diapers, which had two benefits in her mind. One was she didn't have to stop eating when she needed to use the toilet plus it made her feel more comfortable. One day, Kitty was back in the parlor with her friends when Jean had a small smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. I bet you can't...\" Jean began, but was interrupted by Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let me guess... you totally wanna bet that, like, I totally can't eat a whole sundae.\" Kitty said, rolling her eyes. Eating a whole sundae had become such an easy task for her at this point, she could probably finish two and still have room for at least seven ice cream cones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was gonna bet you couldn't eat a whole banana split,\" Jean said, pointing to a picture on the menu, making Kitty drool slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, bring it on!\" said Kitty with a confident smirk as Scott went to place their order and returned to the group. After a few minutes, two waitresses carried the banana split over and placed it in front of Kitty, who was surprised by the size of it. It had three bananas, several scoops of chocolate, blue moon, vanilla and strawberry ice cream, hot fudge and a big spray of whipped cream on top, complete with a cherry on top. Suddenly, Kitty didn't feel confident about eating it, but nevertheless grabbed a spoon and started to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half hour later, Kitty had managed to eat half of the banana split before she started to rub her belly, looking very queasy. Seeing that their friend needed help, Spyke and Rogue started cheering her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon K-girl! You can do it!\" Evan said encouragingly to Kitty. \"Listen ta him, Kit! Ya can't let that oversized dessert beat ya!\" Rogue agreed with an equally encouraging smile. Feeling a bit better and having freed up some room in her belly due to twice using her diaper, Kitty grabbed her spoon and started to eat the rest of the banana split. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she leaned back, rubbing her belly with hot fudge sauce on her cheeks and bits of ice cream on her shirt and sweater. \"Wow. I can't believe you actually ate all that,\" Jean said, a little surprised by how much Kitty had eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just smirked, still rubbing her swollen belly and thinking that she was getting very good at this eating ice cream thing as Kurt helped her up from the booth and she waddled after her friends, burping and hiccupping on the way home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Another three weeks had passed and Kitty had been visiting the ice cream parlor even more often than before and most of the time she would end up ordering a sundae maybe two if she was extra hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of changes had happened to Kitty. She put on even more weight. Her belly had grown bigger along with her boobs and butt and she had fully developed a double chin that wobbled as she talked and a third one was sneaking up on her. She also had to upgrade her wardrobe due to popping the button of her pants while eating one of her sundaes. She had also gotten a bigger sweater and t-shirt, but they still seemed very tight, highlighting her belly and love handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even had to get bigger diapers to contain her growing butt, though Kitty still seemed pretty oblivious to her massive weight gain. She thought it was only a few pounds at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was lying on the couch watching TV, the remote control laying on her belly when suddenly her belly let out a massive rumble, causing the remote to jiggle and bounce on it. \"Wow. Like, I totally better grab something to eat. It's totally almost dinnertime.\" thought Kitty as she got up and waddled to the kitchen to start making herself dinner, even though it wasn't anywhere near dinnertime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong with her visits to the ice cream parlor, her appetite at home had grown as well, making her eat more often and larger amounts. Kitty finished making her dinner, which looked like it could feed three people and started to eat it quite messily, with some of it getting on her clothes and face. Kurt walked past and rose an eyebrow, but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Kitty was laying in bed, trying to sleep, but she was feeling too hungry to sleep. Rolling over, she saw that her clock read midnight. \"Hmm... Like, I totally guess a quick midnight snack totally couldn't hurt.\" Kitty thought as she got out of bed, her pink pajama t-shirt clinging to her belly and her matching shorts looking like they were going to burst at any minute. It didn't exactly help that she was wearing her thick diaper underneath them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty waddled out of her room, going slow as possible to try and not wake anyone up. When she got to the kitchen, she started to make a sandwich with cheese, ham, tomato, lettuce, mayo, five pickles, lots of ketchup and an olive on top while also grabbing a carton of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was awakened by creaking floorboards and quickly jumped out of bed, following the sound and found a light in the kitchen. Peeking her head in, she saw Kitty gulping down her massive midnight snack and downing a carton of milk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. This is gettin' outta hand,\" Rogue said quietly, rolling her eyes as she left Kitty to enjoy her midnight snack. The next day, Rogue met her friends in the kitchen, except for Kitty, who was still sleeping. \"Hey. Is it me or is Kitty gettin' really fat lately?\" Rogue asked as she grabbed a cinnamon roll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is getting pretty big. Yesterday I walked by and she was eating a meal that would feed three people,\" Kurt said, a little worried for his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' last night Ah saw her eatin' a large sandwich and downin' an entire carton of milk,\" Rogue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think we should say something?\" Jean asked  just as they heard the sound of creaking floorboards and a few minutes later, Kitty waddled in. \"Hey guys. Like, what're you talking about?\" She asked, waddling over to the fridge and opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, we need to talk to you about something...\" Scott started, trying to find a nice way to say that Kitty was getting fat, but was interrupted by Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you're gettin' fat an' eatin' a ton,\" Rogue said, poking Kitty's belly, her finger sinking into Kitty's belly fat, which caused Kitty to slap her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys talking about? I'm totally not getting fat. I, like, only put on a few pounds at the most,\" Kitty said, in denial of her about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you are getting fat and you've been eating everything. You really need to cut back,\" Kurt said, earning nods from the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you guys are totally just being mean,\" Kitty said, grabbing a bag of Cheetos and waddling away in a huff, leaving her friends very confused and all promising to help Kitty loose weight. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a whole week since Kitty's friends had confronted her about her weight gain and her diet had taken an even bigger turn. Every day for breakfast, she would have a stack of pancakes covered in maple syrup and a whole box of doughnuts with mixed kinds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually also had a bunch of snacks to tie her over until lunchtime where she had three PB&amp;J sandwiches, 12 chocolate chip cookies and a large soda to wash it all down. And when dinnertime arrived, Kitty usually ate fourths of whatever was being served except for fruits and vegetables, which she wouldn't touch. During one meal, Scott decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you really need to cut back on the meals, plus all the junk food you've been eating.\" said Scott, causing Kitty to pause in the middle of eating her fourth plate of pasta. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Scott. You really do need to cut back like we told you last week. You're getting even bigger.\" said Jean, who was sitting closest to Kitty and was poking her finger into Kitty's much bigger belly, her finger sinking into the flab. Kitty slapped her hand away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, I'm, like, totally not fat and second of all, I'm totally not addicted to junk food.\" Kitty said, grabbing her plate of pasta and waddling away, eating her pasta as she did. As she reached her room, she was slightly out of breath. As she laid down on her bed, she noticed a leftover chocolate bar poking out of her underpants drawer. This gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, if my friends totally have a problem with me eating junk food, I'll just hide it in my room.\" Kitty thought to herself as she started picking places to hide her junk food. She then waited until midnight when everybody was asleep and then waddled down to the kitchen, grabbed several types of junk food and then carried them back to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, the gang walked into Kitty's room while she was out. They were looking for a couple of study notes Kitty had agreed to let Evan and Kurt look over for an upcoming test. After a couple of minutes looking, Rogue grew bored and decided to sit on Kitty's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her butt touched the bed, she felt something crumple under her butt. She quickly jumped up and pulled the blankets back to reveal a smooshed banana cream pie and a pizza box. containing a half eaten pepperoni and sausage pizza. \"Okay. That's just plain gross,\" said Rogue, lifting the destroyed pie and pizza up to show the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think Kitty's been hiding junk food?\" asked Kurt, raising an eyebrow. \"Looks like it. We can't let her keep it. We need to find the rest. Start looking.\" Scott ordered. Everybody started to look. After a few minutes, Jean found a massive stash. There was several types of junk food. Spyke grabbed a bag and started putting the junk food in the bag just as Kitty waddled in and saw her friends destroying her junk food supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're you guys doing?!?!?!?\" Kitty shouted, shocked at what her friends were doing. Kurt decided to speak up since he was the more diplomatic of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Kitty, ve are doing this for your own good. You've got a junk food problem and ve are just trying to help you. Ve're your friends. You need to trust us.\" Kurt said in a calming tone, trying to get his friend to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO YOU'RE NOT! LIKE, YOU'RE DOING THIS TO HURT ME!\" Kitty screamed, stomping her foot and causing her whole body to jiggle like jelly. \"You know what? Forget you guys! Like, I'm totally going to school!\" Kitty screamed as she started waddling away to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty finally made it to school. It took a bit longer than usual because she had to keep stopping every few minutes to catch her breath. When she got into the building, she waddled straight to her locker where she grabbed a package of cookies she'd been hiding in her locker and started to eat them five at a time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't notice that most of the school had been looking at her. Everybody had noticed her weight gain by now. Most didn't care and went about their own business but some were laughing behind her back as the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty made her way to class, bumping into a few classmates with her huge belly, which she was completely oblivious too. When she got to class, she spent most of it sneaking bits of food from her bag, mostly candy and cookies. She did this for every class until lunchtime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, she got herself four trays of food from hamburgers to pizza slices to corn dogs and ate them, causing several of the students to stare in amazement at how much she was eating. After half an hour, Kitty had finally finished eating, leaving herself covered with sauce and bits of pepperoni and she had also used her diaper at least three times while she was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she always kept a few spare diapers in her bag. She was going to change once her bloating went down and she was starting to feel slightly sick. After ten minutes of rubbing her belly and trying not to throw up, two cheerleaders came up to the table with mean looks on their faces. Kitty noticed them. \"Hey.\" said Kitty, covering her mouth with her hand to stop a big burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Pryde. You've really turned into a fat pig, haven't you?\" said one of the cheerleaders, poking Kitty in her large squishy belly. Before Kitty could respond after barely avoiding the sudden urge to urp, cheerleader number two spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You've turned into a big whale,\" laughed the other cheerleader, causing the other one to laugh and Kitty to blush. \"Like, you guys are totally just mean,\" Kitty said, getting up with some difficulty and waddling away, the cheerleaders laughing behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty made her way to the toilets where she spent another half hour sitting on a toilet seat before she finally felt like her food had digested enough for her to actually change her very full, wet and stinky diaper. Once she was changed, she suddenly got a craving for ice cream again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of thinking it over, Kitty decided to give into her cravings. \"Like, I've totally only got two classes left away. Plus, I can, like, totally get notes from Jean and Kurt anyway.\" Kitty thought, wadding out of the toilets and down the quiet hallway to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of waddling, Kitty arrived at the ice cream parlor and ordered five of every flavor of ice cream cones and two sundaes. The waitress working there was shocked by the order for one person, but nevertheless, she told Kitty the first part of the order would be out in a couple of minutes. Kitty smiled, showing off her double chin and waddled off to one of the booths, where she squeezed herself into one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a waitress came up with a tray holding six different types of ice cream cones which Kitty instantly started to dig into, not caring that they were dripping onto her clothes. \"Like, oh well. They're totally already dirty from lunch,\" said Kitty, loudly licking a chocolate ice cream cone before loudly crunching the cone after licking every drop of ice cream out of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, two waitresses walked over, carrying both sundaes. New ones with huge bananas, chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and mint ice cream with hot fudge and whipped cream with a cherry on top. Kitty dug in with glee. Half an hour later, Kitty was left feeling sick with two empty sundae bowls in front of her. Her face was deep green, her eyes rolled in their sockets and her tongue was lolling out of her mouth as she alternated between burping, hiccupping and panting. Her face, table and clothes were a mess. Half eaten ice cream cones littered the table and different flavors of ice cream were smeared over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was brought out of her thoughts by her friends showing up. \"Hey, Kitty. Are you alright? Ve heard about vat happened at school.\" said Kurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally fine.\" Kitty smiled. Then *GGGURGGGGLLLEEEEE* went her large belly. \"Like, oh poopy diapers. I so totally don't feel so go...\" Kitty said before throwing up all over her friends. \"Oops,\" Kitty blushed, seeing her friends covered with barf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just get you home,\" Rogue said, rolling her eyes as she wiped Kitty's vomit out of her hair while Scott and Kurt helped Kitty up and then home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Kitty went for a midnight snack. When she saw some ice cream that was on the floor after eating a lot of it and other junk foods,, she figured \"what the hell\" and loudly licked it up. She was just starting to dip a big block of chocolate into a pot of gravy she had made when her friends came inside.</span></div></div>",

Kitty looked up at her friends and blushed with embarrassment at them seeing her doing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking down, she saw her belly touching the floor. For the first time, she realized just how big she really was. Kurt could see his friend was embarrassed by the whole thing and went over to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, are you alright?\" He asked gently, helping Kitty to her feet, which was a challenge as Kitty was twice his size now. \"Ok. Like, I totally may've put on a little weight,\" admitted Kitty, only to be given a look by her friends. \"Okay. Like, maybe a ton of weight.\" Kitty said, looking down and making her double chins visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now admit ya've got a junk food problem.\" said Rogue, rolling her eyes while folding her arms over her chest and leaning against the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I still don't have a problem Rogue.\" Kitty insisted, crossing her bloated arms over her chest and pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We literally just saw you licking ice cream off the floor while holding a block of chocolate.\" Jean said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Like you guys totally have a point.\" Kitty said, blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Kitty. We'll help you get through this.\" Scott said, earning nods from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night had happened a few months prior and Kitty's friends had helped her loose a great deal of weight, though she still retained a large belly that was visible through her shirts. Her junk food habit had been tough to break, but they'd managed to do it, though she still retained a big appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, one thing that hadn't changed was her usage of diapers. She was currently sitting on her bed in only a thick diaper and a red t-shirt. After a moment, she let out a giant fart as she pooped her diaper and smiled. \"Like, I totally love using my diaper.\" She giggled, laying on her back and poking her tummy, causing her burp loudly while she then enjoyed her full and smelly diaper rubbing it's sticky, poopy load against her behind. Sure, she knew it would become itchy later as a result, but she still really loved it.</span></div></div>",

Let's, like, totally get ourselves a treat.\" Kitty said, dragging Jean into the small shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Why not?\" Jean said as they started to look around the shop. It had many types of sweets and candy. From M&amp;Ms to large chocolate bars. The duo kept looking through the options until Kitty found one that looked pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about this?\" Kitty asked, holding up a large chocolate bar in a purple wrapper with black writing on it. \"BIG FAT CHOCO PUNCH Bar\" it proclaimed on the wrapper. \"Like, it looks totally nice.\" Kitty said, handing it over to Jean to look over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks pretty big, but it'll do.\" Jean said as she and Kitty walked over to the counter and placed the bar on the counter. The cashier then told them there was a special deal that would allow them to get 60 bars for free. The two girls shrugged at each other. Free chocolate is free chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they exited the shop, Kitty picked a bar out of the bag, broke it in half with both her and Jean eating part of it. \"Wow. This' amazing!\" Jean said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it totally tastes awesome!\" Kitty agreed, taking a bite. Both girls were unaware that, by the time they got home, they had eaten 10 chocolate bars apiece between them. </span></div></div>",

They'd eaten all sixty bars by Wednesday and so went back for more. By now, they were much bigger in size and weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Jean's bellies now hung over their pants' waistbands, their boobs had gone up at least two cup sizes, their faces were rounder and sported double chins, their bodies were fat overall and they both had bigger and plumper butts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also something else about them that was new. Per Jean's suggestion, they now also wore and used thick diapers. Kitty had to admit that this idea was pretty good since it allowed them to eat nonstop without needing toilet breaks and they did feel comfy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the duo were in Jean's room, eating more of the chocolate bars. Scott, Kurt, Rogue and Evan knew of their friends' weight gain but didn't say anything since they didn't want to hurt their friends' feelings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I can't believe we'd never heard of these candy bars before until last week.\" Kitty smiled as she stuffed two very big pieces into her mouth, swallowing and burping loudly, chocolate smeared over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. They're so delicious. I really love 'em.\" Jean agreed with a smile as she managed to inhale three bars at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo kept eating until dinner and then resumed this afterwards. The next day, they went to the store again. As they came up to it, Kitty noticed a sign in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, 'Want a free tour of where your favorite goodies are made? Then find a Choco Extreme Factory's golden ticket in a Big Fat Choco Punch Bar for the experience of a lifetime'!\" She read aloud to Jean. The two girls looked at each other in delight. They had the same idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, they ran over to said bars and started grabbing as many as they could carry. Luckily, they had been there enough that their massive amounts of candy were now free of charge. Wobbling slightly from the weight of the giant stacks, the two X-Kids headed for the institute with their precious loads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, the duo went into Kitty and Rogue's bedroom and set to work eating the chocolate bars at top speed. Neither of them talked much, nor did they stop. Not even when they both wet and pooped their diapers. They just shrugged at each other after noticing their lumpy diapers and kept pigging out. They were determined to find that ticket and thus go on the tour.</span></div></div>",

Wrappers of already eaten candy bars laid scattered all over the room and the duo's diapers were very full by now as they were starting to itch and feel uncomfortable due to how full and wet they were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this is totally starting to seem impossible, Jean. Besides, my diaper's totally filled to the waistband with my poopies.\" Kitty sighed after wolfing down her 120th bar. \"I know, Kitty. But we can't give up now. Let's just keep eating.\" Jean smiled gently as she ate her 121st bar. Kitty moaned slightly but nevertheless grabbed bar #121 from her pile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe unwrapped it and was just about to sink her teeth into the rich milk chocolate when Jean let out a yelp. \"KITTY! DON'T EAT THAT CANDY BAR YET!\" She yelped, tackling the surprised Kitty off the bed, the duo landing with Kitty on bottom and Jean on top in only t-shirts and extremely full smelly and itchy diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owie! Jean, like, what was that totally for?!?!?\" Kitty protested as her older friend and teammate rolled off her, allowing Kitty to sit up, still holding the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the back of the candy bar.\" Jean said slowly and gently. Kitty frowned slightly, but did so anyway. Then, as she slowly turned the bar over to look at its' back, a flash of gold hit the light. She gasped as she pulled out the gold ticket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Kitty!\" Jean squealed as she and Kitty hugged tightly, their bodies squishing against each other. \"Yeah. I guess I, like, totally did!\" giggled Kitty in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean took the ticket and began reading the message aloud. \"\"<i>Greetings to the lucky winner or winners of this gold ticket from Mrs. Garcia. With this ticket I invite you to tour my factory for one whole day. You may bring one person with you on the tour. You will get to see how you're favorite candies are made and afterwards, when it's time to leave, you will be sent home with all the sweets you and your guest can ever eat'! Be sure to bring this ticket with you when you arrive. The tour will begin at your earliest convenience'.</i>\" She read to Kitty. \"So, we could, like, totally go tomorrow since we don't have school?\" Kitty asked hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Kitty. Let's go ahead and clean up the wrappers and then we can change our yucky diapers.\" Jean smiled as she and Kitty started to do so, their diapers sagging so much, you could see their butts poking out if you were going past the room at that moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo finished cleaning up and then changed their diapers, pulled their pants on and then went for dinner. Scott, Rogue, Kurt and Spyke didn't say anything as they watched their two obese teammates pig out as usual. Though the four were surprised when Kitty and Jean went to bed two hours later, simply stating they felt sleepy from their dinner and candy binge as they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Jean spent half the night dreaming about the tour the next day. Jean dreamed about eating more and more while being fed her candy by Scott while only in a bra and a large diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, meanwhile, dreamed about eating everything in sight since it was candy flavored or made of sugary goodies. When Rogue came up to bed not long after, it was to find Kitty chewing on her spare pillow. The southern goth merely smirked as she went to bed.</span></div></div>",

The duo didn't say anything as they approached the doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, a handsome looking tour guide came out. He wore a purple tailcoat, a black bowtie, kaki pants and black shoes. Upon seeing the overweight and diapered girls, he smiled at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. You must be our lucky winners of the tour. I'm Jose Garcia, Mrs. Garcia's son and heir to this factory. I will be your tour guide today.\" He said to the duo. \"Yeah. I'm Jean Grey and this is my friend Kitty Pryde.\" Jean smiled back as Kitty waved to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Follow me then. Let's get this tour started.\" smiled Jose as they headed into the factory. The entrance seemed to be the same as any old warehouse. Jose then led the duo towards a large set of metal doors. \"This room is the heart and soul of my mama's whole factory. It contains some of her old and new creations.\" He told Jean and Kitty, who watched as he unlocked the doors and opened them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, I give you: the chocolate room.\" He grinned as the doors swung open to reveal a large room filled with numerous types of candies and other sweets. Jean and Kitty couldn't believe their eyes as they took in this wonderful sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this is totally like <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i>!\" Kitty squealed as she licked her lips. \"Feel free to eat as much as you desire!\" Jose smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he didn't have to tell those two bloated X-Kids twice. They tore down the steps and began their pig out. Jean went first, grabbing a massive gummy bear and sinking her teeth into it while Kitty split open a large candy pumpkin and started eating it's chocolate inners with her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJose smiled as he watched the two girls making pigs of themselves. It was clear that the duo loved his mother's candy and were happy to be here. His family had been making sweets for years but had only started the Choco Extreme company a month ago due to moving to the US a year prior following his father's death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty was eating a large handful of jelly beans while Jean inhaled a long roll of taffy. The two girls noticed each other's actions, but beamed brightly at each other. The candy was really yummy and they just couldn't help themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, they kept on eating and eating and eating, their bellies bulging over the waistbands of their pants and diapers by now. Finally, the duo decided to take a break, Kitty licking a lollipop as big as her head while Jean kept chewing on a giant glob of saltwater taffy. \"Like, this is totally the yummiest candy I've ever eaten!\" Kitty groaned in delight, patting her belly with her free hand as she crunched down the last of her lollipop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it, Kitty. I don't see how this day could get any better!\" Jean agreed as she sucked up the last of her taffy and burped loudly, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little latter, the duo were following Jose over a massive vat of melted chocolate. Several employees were tending to it, making it ready for when it was needed for a recipe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a little ways from above the vat when Kitty's nose twitched. \"What is it?\" Jean asked. \"Like, is it me or does this walkway totally smell like gingerbread?\" Kitty replied. Jean leaned over and sniffed the railing herself. \"You're right. It <i>does</i> smell like gingerbread.\" she realized in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm sure Jose totally wouldn't mind if we eat a tiny bit.\" Kitty smiled. Jean looked up. Jose was busy talking to an employee at the edge of the walkway. \"Okay. But just a bit.\" She agreed. With that, Kitty starting to nibble the floorboards while Jean chewed on the railing. After a few minutes, \"Okay, let's go.\" Jean whispered. But just as they started forward, the floor gave way under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, how much of the floorboards did you eat?!?!?\" Jean screamed as they plummeted towards the vat. \"Like, I totally didn't think it was that muuuuccccchhhh!!!!\" Kitty screamed back in alarm. Then *KER-SLOOPPPSSSSHHH!!!* The duo landed in the chocolate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing both the screams and the splash, Jose looked over in alarm. \"Ladies?!?! Are you alright?!?!?\" He called. When there was no answer, he quickly ordered the employees to stop the chocolate's flowing throughout the factory in case the X-Girls ended up in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the bottom, a female employee used two hooks to fish Jean and Kitty out. After a nerve wracking minute, the hooks surfaced, pulling the two girls out. They were covered head to toe in sticky, gooey chocolate. \"Are you two alright?\" Jose asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We just, like, totally got carried away with tasting the walkway.\" Kitty explained sheepishly as she started lapping the chocolate from her arms and fingers with her tongue. \"Here, let me help. Then you can do me.\" Jean offered. Kitty stood still as Jean started licking her clean, beginning with her face. \"J-Jean! That, like, t-t-t-totally tickles!\" Kitty giggled as Jean's tongue ran over her tummy and into her bellybutton a few minutes later. Once Jean had cleaned Kitty up the best she could, the youngest X-Man did the same for Jean. With some help from some wash cloths, the rest of the cleanup went by fairly quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPORRRRPPPPTTTT!!!* Kitty farted and her diaper immediately bulged and sagged. \"Like, did you bring any diapers for us in case we made a poopy or wet ourselves?\" Kitty asked Jean. The redhead blushed sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I figured we'd be okay and I left them in the X-Van for after the tour.\" Jean admitted as Kitty frowned slightly. The brunette just sighed and smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Jean. Like, I guess I can totally wait until we get back to the X-Van for a diapee change.\" She said kindly. Jean smiled and then, *BBBOOOORRRRRCCCCHHHHH!!!!* Out came a giant fart and load of poop from her big booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\" Jean sighed. \"Well, at least I totally have company in my misery.\" Kitty giggled as she hugged Jean, who just giggled and smiled as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Jose came up. \"Pardon me, ladies but I could not help but overhear your little problem. If you will follow me, I think I can help you.\" He smiled. The two girls shrugged and followed Jose farther into the factory.</span></div></div>",

Soon, they reached a door marked \"<i>The Edible Diaper Room</i>\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, is this totally a joke, Jose?\" Kitty asked him, frowning slightly at the door. \"It is no joke, ladies. You see, my momma decided to try and create edible undergarments for children, since I am certain you two have no doubt hear of edible underwear?\" Jose smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty and Jean eyed each other and nodded. \"Well, Momma decided to do the same with young children's clothes. She decided to start with diapers since those technically are our first clothes when we are newborns and toddlers.\" Jose explained. The two girls looked at each other, their expressions a mix of surprised and curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what flavors do they come in?\" Jean asked. \"All sorts. So far, we have created chocolate, vanilla, lemon, strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, lime, coconut, key lime, peach, banana, orange, marmalade, etc.\" Jose smiled, At that, Jean and Kitty giggled to each other in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, like, are they only for eating or can they also be used to... y'know... do your '<i>business</i>' in?\" Kitty asked. \"You can use them for both. The diapers contain a special chemical that allows you to eat them, even after using them.\" Jose explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're saying that, if we wanted to, we could... eat our own urine and poop?\" Jean asked, wrinkling her nose slightly in disgust. \"Si. But the chemical makes them taste the same flavor as the diaper itself and contains a special formula that allows you to eat the soiled diaper without any aftertastes on your breath.\" Jose smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I guess we can try them.\" Jean decided. Kitty squealed and phased through the door. Jose and Jean followed a second later by opening and walking through the door. Luckily, Jose didn't seem to mind his tourists being mutants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean and Kitty's eyes went wide with wonder. Everywhere they looked they saw diapers of different colors, marking their different flavors. \"Why not try the mint ones first?\" Jose smiled, tossing both girls two mint green diapers. \"One is for you to wear and the second is for your taste test.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty wasted no time and managed to tag her full diaper off and slip the new one on in minutes after quickly wiping her butt off so it didn't suffer a diaper rash. She smiled as the fresh minty smell hit her nostrils. \"Like, this is totally the freshest diaper I've ever smelled!\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean also put a mint diaper on and grinned at the smell. \"Alright, Kitty. Shall we?\" She smiled, holding up the second diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, let's Jean.\" Kitty smiled. With that, the duo sunk their teeth into the diapers. As they chewed, they moaned in delight at the taste. \"Like, who'd ever think a diaper would totally taste so yummy to your tummy?\" Kitty remarked as she crunched the rest of the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. We gotta have more!\" Jean agreed. With that, the duo grabbed two more diapers, this time coconut for Jean and bubblegum for Kitty and this time, both were chewy. Soon, the two X-Kids had eaten half the supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you two are very satisfied now?\" Jose smiled to the two girls. \"Like, totally.\" Kitty smiled, patting her large belly as it hung over her waistband. \"Same here.\" Jean agreed, poking her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the tour ended and the two X-Girls were given their promised treats, including several large boxes of edible diapers. The duo thanked Jose and climbed into the X-Van, grateful for having chosen said automobile for the trip due to it's size. </span></div></div>",

Just take a seat and we'll bring it to you soon.\"  the girl beamed as Kitty raced over to a booth and sat down, licking her lips in eagerness. Soon, a massive pepperoni pizza was placed in front of her. \"Enjoy and happy eating!\" said the girl. \"Like, thank you!\" Kitty smiled, grabbing a big slice and taking a giant bite, pulling a great big chunk of cheese off it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kitty ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate, and ate. Trays after trays of pizza piled up on her table as did large bottles of Mr. Pepper soda, her favorite soda. Grease and sauce smeared on her face, as well as her pink sweater and cream t-shirt as her belly grew rounder and rounder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, \"Excuse me, miss. But it's midnight now. I'm afraid I'm gonna need you to leave.\" said the girl to Kitty as she was given her final pizza of the day. Kitty, who's belly had swollen up so much it was pressing against her table, looked up in shock just as she got ready to eat her final pie's first slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I've been here for eight hours?!?!?!\" She asked in shock, wiping her mouth with her sleeve. The girl nodded. \"You got really into the zone with your eating that you probably lost track of time.\" she said with sympathy. Kitty agreed after a moment. \"Would you like me to box up this pie for ya?\" the girl asked. Kitty shook her head. \"Like, no need.\" she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to the girl's shock, Kitty simply rolled up the pizza and shoved the roll completely into her mouth, bulging her cheeks out like a chipmunk's. She chewed heavily for a moment and then swallowed the giant mouthful of pizza with a giant gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl just stared in shock at Kitty's impressive display. \"You must've been hungry.\" she remarked as Kitty patted her big belly. \"Thank *UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!* you!\" smiled Kitty, letting out a giant burp as she rubbed her gut before leaving while sucking her grease and tomato sauce covered fingers on the way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I've totally gotta have more pizza in my diet!\" Kitty smiled as she went home, using her other hand to rub and pat her bloated belly in delight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several days had passed since Kitty had learned of the pizza place's takeout menu. She'd been ordering from it every two days. This had triggered quite a change in her weight as her belly became rounder and rounder with each order. It got to the point where Kitty secretly bought a stretchy girdle to keep herself looking thin. She also made sure to eat her usual light meals when with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the other X-Men was discovering just how much pizza Kitty was eating now as they began finding pizza boxes scattered throughout the mansion. Scott found ten in the trash can in the kitchen. Jean and Kurt found twelve in another trash can by the garages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Wolverine found 8 extra large pizza boxes in the Danger Room's control booth while Ororo found 11 in the X-Van's trunk. And Spyke and Rogue found no less than 27 boxes in Kitty's closet, resulting in 68 pizzas in total. Finally, the team decided to talk with Kitty about her pizza addiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BURP!* Kitty burped on this day, having just eaten 5 Super Duper Pepperoni pizzas, washing it down with three Mr. Peppers in the rec room. \"Like, I'm so full.\" She groaned, rubbing her now much bigger, squishier and rounder belly in agony. \"Too much pizza and soda. What'm I gonna do with a belly like this? I, like, totally can't let the others see I've been putting on weight!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her girdle wasn't with her, Kitty quickly began trying to button her sweater, only for it to refuse. \"Like, come on, you dumb sweater! Button already!\" After saying this, Kitty managed to close the sweater up, hiding her giant belly. \"YES!\" she squealed in victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"<i>Attention, my fellow X-Men, report to my office at once!</i>\" Professor X said mentally. \"Oh boy.\" Kitty said as she slowly staggered for the room in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Logan, Storm, Cyclops, Jean, Kurt, Rogue and Spyke were already in Xavier's. \"How're we gonna talk to Kitty about this?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah dunno. As much as Ah think we should be brutally honest with her, Ah ain't sure that'll work this time.\" Rogue said, actually sounding concerned for her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we must say something. Kitty clearly must be putting on weight by now because of her unhealthy eating.\" Ororo remarked with concern as she thought of the bubbly, friendly girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm with you, 'Roro. Half-Pint's gonna need to cut back on the pizza before we gotta use either the X-Van and/or X-Jet just ta get her to an' from school and whatnot.\" Logan agreed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kitty came in, her sweater's buttons straining against her large belly but managing to hold on as she came in the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey guys. What's up?\" Kitty asked innocently. \"Hey, Kitty.\" Kurt smiled. \"Where've you been, sugar?\" Rogue asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, like, nowhere.\" Kitty said quickly, not wanting to tell them about her gorging, unaware the others were already aware of it and that it was the reason for this meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her tummy rumbled ominously. \"Uh oh.\" Kitty gulped nervously as this happened.  </span></div></div>",

The others stared at her in disbelief. \"Like, excuse me.\" Kitty blushed sheepishly. Then, *PING!* The button on Kitty's sweater popped open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer large belly flopped out a second later. \"Like, oh big fat poopy diapers.\" Kitty sighed in dismay. \"Kitten, I believe your pizza addiction is getting out of hand.\" Storm said, eyeing the large, doughy, squishy and swollen ball of a stomach Kitty was now sporting. \"Like, this is totally water weight.\" Kitty replied quickly. All of the other X-Men looked at her, clearly not buying her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, I am afraid that is the reason I called this meeting. Over the last several weeks, you have been ordering numerous pizzas and sodas from your favorite pizza place. We have seen the evidence you left laying around the mansion. We all agree: you must cut back your pizza intake.\" Xavier said. \"Like, no way Professor! I'm, like, totally okay!\" Kitty insisted. Then, her belly gurgled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, like, hang on.\" a very sheepish Kitty said as she quickly darted into the next door bathroom. After a few minutes, Kitty came out in relief, having taken a large poop. \"Anyway, guys, I'm totally fine.\" she told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, starting tomorrow, I am putting you on an exercise regime. You will do two hours of exercise each morning every day and eat only fruits, vegetables and other healthy foods.\" Xavier said gently, but firmly. \"But Professor-!!\" Kitty whined. \"That is final, young lady.\" Xavier said with a serious and warning frown. Kitty pouted and stormed away, her belly jiggling like a rather big bowl of Jell-O. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Kitty was rudely awoken at 5 o'clock by her alarm, which had been set by Logan. With a whimpering moan, she rolled out of bed and changed into a t-shirt and sweat pants before heading outside to meet up with Wolverine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, Logan was already waiting for her, clad in his uniform. \"Mornin', half-pint.\" he said. Kitty merely glared at him through her droopy eyelids. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For yer first morning, I thought we'd start with a 5 mile jog.\" He told her. Kitty didn't say anything. She just nodded reluctantly. Soon, the duo were jogging along the path leading up to the mansion gates. Well, Logan reached them anyway. When he looked back, Kitty was laying on her back, sweating, wheezing and panting heavily. \"Did... I... like *pant* *wheeze* *gasp* even... get... close... Mr. Logan?\" Kitty gulped out. Logan had to admit Kitty did do fairly well despite her girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been fairly close to the gates when she'd had to stop. \"Not bad, half-pint.\" Logan told her as he heaved her up. \"Great. Can we, like, go in now?\" Kitty asked, her breathing getting back to normal. \"Nope. Ya still have pushups, sit ups and that kinda thing to do first.\" Logan said bluntly. Kitty didn't even bother holding back her moaning whine of protest as she reluctantly dropped to her hands and knees to begin her pushups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, Kitty practically dragging herself into the mansion, sweaty, greasy and pooped. Jean and Scott watched with concern. \"Y'know Kitty, if you hadn't eaten so much pizza, this'd be a lot easier for you.\" Scott pointed out gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like... bite... my... big... chubby... butt... Cyke...\" Kitty panted in response as she heaved herself up onto her legs, which felt like jelly. She just barely managed to climb up to her room before they gave out, causing Kitty to flop onto her bed face first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll totally never make it through these next few weeks on only rabbit food and exercise!\" She groaned into her sheets. Then, an idea came to her. \"Like, I'll hide junk food around the mansion so I can snack before, during or after exercises! As long as I keep up my exercising and eat healthier meals, I'll, like, totally get away with it!\" Kitty smiled excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Kitty began going around that night while the others slept, hiding candy bars in her dresser, cookies in the Danger Room's control booth and doughnuts in her bathroom, while also storing some Hostess cupcakes in her desk.</span></div></div>",

She would occasionally sneak a snack or two but the others luckily didn't catch on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, Kitty was snoring softly when her stomach rumbled quietly. Kitty woke with a start upon hearing this. \"Like, I need a snack.\" she whispered so not to wake Rogue, who was sleeping peacefully in her bed across the room. Kitty looked at her alarm clock and saw it was 12:01. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly, Kitty phased herself downstairs, landing neatly in the kitchen. She turned and opened the refrigerator. \"Like, just a tiny snack...\" she told herself. Then, it happened. All of Kitty's restraint from the last several weeks left her and she became ravenous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty quickly grabbed a plate of brownies and shoveled each one into her mouth, chewing and gulping loudly before chugging a whole carton of milk down. Then she grabbed a package of uncooked bacon and stuffed handfuls of it into her mouth, licking the packaging clean before tossing it aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, Kitty devouring everything in the fridge. She cleaned out an entire jar of pickles following the bacon, then a loaf of bread before she poured six jars of jam into her mouth, getting them on her face and t-shirt. She then devoured a block of cheese, a whole ham and a package of chicken following that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe even cleared out the veggies and fruits, eating an entire thing of grapes from the vines. Strawberries, cherries, apples and so on all went into her now starting to swell up again belly. Then, she devoured carrots, tomatoes, cabbage and the like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got to the lettuce, Kitty just ripped leaves off and then guzzled down a bottle of dressing to wash it down. And then, she saw a big chocolate cake with red frosting and a note. \"'<i>For Kitty, as a reward for sticking with your diet. Love, Ororo</i>'.\" The note read. But Kitty didn't know or care about it. All she cared about was getting that cake in her belly. She tossed the note aside, grabbed a fork and began loudly chowing down on the cake. Soon, the plater had been licked clean and Kitty was passed out on the floor, snoring as she rubbed her jumbo belly with a moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Rogue woke up and found Kitty's bed empty. Frowning, she got up and went downstairs. When she then entered the kitchen, the southern goth couldn't believe it. The kitchen looked like it'd been hit by a hurricane. Empty food packages, bowls, wrappers and so on were scattered everywhere. The fridge was open and all that was left was a single olive and the lightbulb. And there, passed out in front of the fridge, was a very bloated, snoring Kitty. Her face was a mess with jam, frosting, crumbs, grease and dressing, as was her pink nighttime t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Guess all that exercisin' and dietin' took its' toll on Kitty an' her body decided to rebel last night</i>.\" Rogue thought to herself as Kitty starting to stir. With a loud moan, Kitty slowly heaved herself up into a sitting position. Slowly, her eyes focused on Rogue and then the debris of last night's pig out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the debris and realizing what'd happened, Kitty's eyes filled with tears. \"Rogue! Like, I totally ate everything in the kitchen last night! I'm so sorry! I-I-I didn't mean to! I just felt so hungry, I kept eating and eating!\" She cried as she began sobbing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Kit. Ah kinda thought that might happen sooner or later. It ain't surprisin', given your dieting an' everythang.\" Rogue said with a smile as she helped her teammate up with a grin. Kitty hiccupped and smiled slightly as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what're we gonna tell the others?\" She asked nervously. \"Ah'm sure they'll understand if we just say what happened.\" said Rogue with sympathy as they started cleaning up the mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was right. While shocked by Kitty's actions the night before, the other X-Men did accept that what happened was in fact an accident. In time, Kitty's weight returned to normal again, though her appetite remained larger than before.</span></div></div>",

She noticed  a sign in the window advertising a meal deal: a whole bucket of chicken and fries and a whole bottle of coke for 3.99. \"Like, that's totally a good deal.\" said Kitty as she walked into the restaurant. It looked like a normal KFC apart from a huge painting of chickens on the wall. Kitty walked over to the counter where a employee was standing \"Hey I would like your meal deal please \"said Kitty with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it'll just be a few minutes.\" said the employee a couple of minutes later Kitty's order was ready. \"Here you go. That'll be 3.99.\" said the employee handing over the bucket of chicken the fries and the coke. Kitty handed over the money, took her order and started to dig into the bucket of chicken her taste buds exploding with flavor. She got so caught up in the taste she didn't notice until she finished that she had eaten the whole bucket and fries and drank all of her coke \"Hmm.

She walked into the kitchen and looked in the fridge, only to find it empty. That only made her belly rumble even more. \"Well it, like, totally looks like it's KFC for breakfast.\" laughed Kitty to herself as she quickly got changed into some slightly tight clothes, made her way to the KFC and entered. She was greeted by one of the employees at the counter <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Kitty how're you doing? \" asked the employee, smiling at Kitty <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. I'm doing good and I'll, like, totally have my usual.\" said Kitty with a smile.

We get a 15 % per cent discount and get to take home any of the leftover chicken \"said the employee with a smile. Kitty took a couple of minutes to think about it.

The manager's office is just at the end of the kitchen.\" said the employee, pointing to the door past the kitchen. Kitty nodded and said thanks and wondered through the kitchen, trying not to drool at the smell of cooking chicken and fries. She somehow managed this and knocked on the door. It opened to show a middle aged woman wearing a red work shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you must be Kitty. I'm Miss. Johnson.\" said Miss Johnson shaking Kitty's hand. Kitty then took a seat and Miss. Johnson asked Kitty a bunch of questions which Kitty answered honestly. \"Ok you got the job. Will you be able to start today?\" asked Miss. Johnson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Like, that's amazing.\" said Kitty excitedly. \"and sure.\" she added happily. Miss. Johnson handed Kitty over a red work shirt, a pair of black trousers and a thick diaper.

Kitty had grown fatter as she had outgrown two of her uniforms and her new one was starting to look very tight, showing off her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue had also put on a little weight. Not as much as Kitty but enough that she was starting to look quite chubby and had started to use her diapers more and more frequently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night after their shift, they went into the living room carrying five buckets of chicken and fries each and laid them down on the table but before they could begin their feast, Kitty needed to change her diaper but she was starting to have trouble doing it herself due to her girth. \"Here Ah'll help ya.\" said Rogue as she helped Kitty lie down so she could change her. Luckily for them everyone else was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you enjoying working at KFC?\" asked Kitty as Rogue finished up changing Kitty <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been ok. I've kinda gotten use to using diapers even if they're a bit annoyin' but the free food is amazing.\" said Rogue, helping pull Kitty up but suddenly felt her own diaper become really wet. \"Oops.\" said Rogue, blushing a bit as she realized that she had wet herself again, causing her thick diapee to sag slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I'll, like, totally change you since you changed me.\" said Kitty laughing as Rogue nodded and laid down, letting Kitty change her while being careful not to touch Rogue's skin with her bare hands. After all that was done, they both dug into their feast eating until there wasn't anything left and both sat back bloated, rubbing their stuffed bellies.  </span></div></div>",

Kitty was still bigger than Rogue by quite a bit but thanks to all the food she was eating, Rogue was quickly catching up to Kitty and Rogue had became more comfortable with wearing her diapers. One day Kitty and Rogue walked into the KFC to see it was completely empty apart from a few employees who looked bored out of their minds. It wasn't surprising at it so empty it was snowing pretty bad. \"Well it looks like there's  nothing to really do.\" said Rogue leaning against the counter, her belly pressing into it, highlighting how big her belly had became.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well on the bright side we can, like, totally eat for the whole shift.\" replied Kitty with a smirk as she popped a french fry into her mouth then grabbed a bit of chicken and started eating along with her bigger friend. They spent the next few hours eating and taking a few diaper changes in between as well. Finally, Kitty looked up at the clock and saw it the end of their shift. \"Hmm. Like, that already totally went quickly.\"  said Kitty rubbing her bloated belly and struggling to get up from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it really did.\"  said Rogue, getting up using one hand to rub her bloated belly and another to fill a few bags with buckets of chicken and fries for them to take home. It took them awhile to make the short trip back to the mansion, thanks to the heavy snow but by the time they got back they were really hungry again despite the fact they had spent the last few hours doing nothing else but eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it time to, like, totally eat again.\" said Kitty as she placed all the food on the table. Rogue was about to sit down and join Kitty when she smelt a really bad stench coming from her friend, making Rogue raise her eyebrows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah take it from the smell that ya messed your diaper. Do ya want me to change you?\" asked Rogue, smirking as she already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" said Kitty, laughing as she laid down on the floor and Rogue grabbed a diaper from one of their hiding spots. She quickly got changed and both enjoyed their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kitty got big when she started working at KFC then Rogue joined her and ballooned up as well.\" said Scott with a shrug, looking over to Kitty who was wiping some sauce running down her double chins while Rogue was rubbing her huge belly while eating some chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they been taking too much advantage of the staff discount.

Kitty was fuming over a mistake that her favorite store had made with outfitting her for a new sweater. Instead of either a small or medium, she was made a large. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that was totally humiliating! Anyone can totally see I'm, like, so <u>not</u> a large!\" Kitty growled to her fellow X-Kids and friends. \"Kitty, get over it. It was probably a mistake. Ah still say ya could've taken the large an' had Ororo or Jean take it down.\" Rogue sighed in annoyance at her best friend, roommate and teammate's ranting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vhy don't we get something to eat? It may help you relax.\" Kurt offered, nodding to a nearby cookie store. Kitty sighed and shrugged her agreement. So, the four went inside the shop. Even though it had only been open for a week, it seemed to be doing extremely well business wise. Kitty, Kurt, Rogue and Evan all stood in front of the counter and a rather obese young woman came up to them. \"Hello. May I help you?\" she asked. \"I'll take four peanut butter cookies please.\" Kurt said. \"Snickerdoodles for me.\" Rogue added. \"I'll take the chocolate chip cookies.\" Spyke piped up. \"And you, honey?\" the woman asked Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty bit her lip as she struggled to decide which one she really wanted to have since she loved cookies. \"Why not try a Passion Patty?\" suggested the woman, holding up said cookie. It was a chocolate cookie with mint inside. \"Like, okay.\" Kitty shrugged as she took it and tossed it into her mouth. After chewing it for a moment, her eyes popped open. Every sugary goody she'd ever eaten danced in front of her. After a second, \"Like wow! These are so totally yummy! So chocolatey and minty...\" she moaned in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she likes them.\" said Kurt with a smile as he, Rogue and Evan grabbed their cookies and walked out. They had to wait a few minutes for Kitty to follow them though. When Kitty stumbled out at last, the trio couldn't believe it. Kitty was carrying at least 10 boxes of Passion Patties. \"Uh, Kitty. Isn't that kinda goin' overboard?\" Rogue asked. \"Like, no way Rogue. These cookies are totally awesome.\" Kitty smiled, already popping another one into her mouth in delight. The trio didn't say anything as they left, Kitty still eating cookie after cookie. By the time they reached the mansion, Kitty had eaten two boxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA day later, Scott Summers and Jean Grey were walking down the main staircase when they saw Kitty buying cookies from some Girl Scouts. \"Like, thanks girls. These cookies are, like, totally yummy.\" Kitty was saying as she turned around, arms overflowing with what seemed to be the entire troop's supply of Passion Patties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Kitty? How many cookies did you buy?\" Scott asked in shock. \"Like, it's no big deal, Scott. I just totally love these Passion Patties!\" Kitty explained with a grin as she handed a box to Scott and Jean. \"Like, go ahead and try them. I think you'll like 'em too!\" she giggled as she skipped to her room, already eating another cookie. \"Kurt and the others were right. Kitty is forming an addiction to these cookies.\" Scott said to Jean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should have Mr. McCoy run some tests on them to be safe.\" Jean suggested. Scott nodded and quickly sent the box to Hank's lab via a chute in the nearby wall as they then went to hang out with Kurt and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Hank had started running his tests on the cookies and Professor X called the X-Kids into the meeting chamber. \"Hank has just started running his tests on the Passion Patties that Scott gave him. Though he isn't sure at this moment, he believes one ingredient could be rather addicting.\"  Xavier told them. \"So where do we go from here?\" Scott asked. \"I've been running for traces of Passion Patties in other cities. The first area they have appeared in is in Denver Colorado.\" Xavier explained, nodding to said dot on the screen. \"Has anyone bought them?\" Jean asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Miss. Jessie Clearwater. She lives with her young daughter Rebecca at 1347 Belmont Street.\" Xavier said. \"I'd like for you to talk with them and see if they may have any leads on the cookies.\" Professor X said. \"Right, Professor!\" Scott said promptly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the six X-Kids took off for the X-Jet and set off for Denver, Kitty munching on her 4th box of Passion Patties. </span></div></div>",

Scott rang the doorbell and a second later, a massive young woman with brown eyes and black hair answered the door. \"Yes? Can I help you?\" she asked with a smile. None of the X-Kids spoke at first as they eyed the picture of Jess and Rebecca Xavier had given them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, the two females were slim and trim looking. Not like the sumo sized lady in front of them. \"Jess? Jess Clearwater?\" asked Scott awkwardly. \"Yeah. That's me.\" Jess smiled as Kitty kept munching on her fifth box of Passion Patties. \"Did you happen to see a Girl Scout nearby. I've been waiting all morning for mine and Becca's cookies. Quit my job and pulled Rebecca outta school yesterday we don't miss any deliveries.\" She added as a very plump eleven year old girl with black hair and blue eyes came up, her belly poking through her red t-shirt. The X-Kids just stared at her in shock. She was only a year younger than Multiple, but she had to be at least two times his size weight wise. \"Hi. My name's Rebecca. Did you see a Girl Scout with our Passion Patties?\" smiled the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no sorry. We haven't.\" Jean replied honestly. \"Shame. We just love Happy Girl Cookie Time!\" Jess smiled as she moved back slightly so the X-Kids could look inside the rather nice looking house. \"See?\" The X-Kids just stared in shock. There had to be at least 50 to 60 empty boxes of Passion Patties scattered around the living room, hallway and the staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure. We've put on some weight. But, y'know, it's been worth it.\" Jesse added sheepishly as Rebecca nodded in delight. \"Mom even wrote Ms. Netterman and told her that!\" Rebecca chirped, her belly and double chin jiggling as she hopped slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Netterman?\" Rogue asked. \"Oh yeah. Hazel Netterman. I went to school with her when we were your guys' age. She was kinda a lard ball  cause her parents owned our hometown's bakery. I admit I didn't do much to help her when we were kids and teenagers and she was getting picked on, but now, she's my idol!\" Jess explained with a grin. \"Are you guys really the X-Men?\" Rebecca suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we are.\" Spyke smiled. \"Cool! I've read all about your adventures! I idolize you!\" Rebecca exclaimed in delight. \"Could I get your autographs?\" she asked shyly. \"Sure. If your mom agrees.\" Jean smiled. \"It's okay with me, Becca.\" Jess smiled. \"YES!\" Rebecca cheered as she waddled to her room to grab a pen and some paper.  \"She's a sweet kid.\" Kurt remarked. \"Yeah. Ever since her dad died a year ago, she's been so quiet and withdrawn outside her friends. Reading about your adventures is a great way for her to be a kid.\" Jess smiled. \"She says you're her hero.\" she added to Kitty. \"Like, I'm flattered.\" Kitty smiled, still eating cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where Ms. Netterman is now?\" Jean asked Jess as Rebecca came back with a notebook and a pen for the team's autographs. \"Yeah. She sent me a coupon for a month's supply of Passion Patties yesterday. I still have the envelope.\" Jess smiled as she handed it over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's in the Swiss Alps.\" Scott remarked in surprise. \"Then, that's where we'll go.\" Jean smiled before they autographed Rebecca's notebook. \"It was good to meet you guys. If you're in Bayville sometime, maybe we can babysit Rebecca. We have a student who's around her age group she might like to meet.\" Scott told them. \"Can we Mom?!?! Can we?!?!?\" Rebecca asked, sounding so excited, it looked like she was gonna wet and/or poop her pants from excitement. \"Well, spring break is next week. We'll see kiddo.\" Jess smiled. Rebecca squealed in delight and hugged her mother, her chubby arms barely reaching around her mom's middle. \"See you soon.\" Scott smiled as the team left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ya got the address of Ms. Netterman?\" Rogue asked Scott as they climbed back onto the X-Jet. \"Yeah. She's in the Swiss Alps.\" Scott replied as they set off for said mountains.  </span></div></div>",

You're getting pretty big.\"  said Kurt rising his eyebrow  as he eyed Kitty's bulging potbelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm, like, totally fine.\" said Kitty, taking another bite. \"Y'know, maybe ya should've just bought the large sweater.\" Rogue said. \"Yeah, K-Girl. 'Cause if you keep eating those cookies, you're not gonna be a small or medium anymore.\" Spyke pointed out. \"Oh. Ha-ha. This', like, totally only my second box.\" Kitty huffed. \"Yeah, since we got on the jet.\" Rogue pointed out. \"Whatever.\" Kitty huffed. Then, they heard they were about to land. Kitty struggled to get her seatbelt on. It took a lot of huffing and puffing to get the two sides connected, leaving her breathless when they landed. Soon, they were at the foot of the mountain. \"Like, why couldn't we have just totally landed at the top?\" asked the now sumo sized Kitty, moaning as she saw how far they had to climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because landing a jet next to the factory is a bit too obvious.\"  said Jean, rolling her eyes as they started to climb the mountain. When they finally reached the factory they saw a line for a tour of the massive factory up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, like, totally gotta be kidding me. We could've just went with a tour instead of climbing up this thing!?!?!?\"  complained Kitty completely out of breath as she gasped and wheezed behind Kurt and Rogue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the plus side at least we don't have to break in.\" said Rogue as they joined the line for the tour. Soon they were moved to a group of tour buses and started to look around the factory. A bunch of girl scouts were giving a way free samples  which Kitty happily ate after taking the tray. When the tour guide wasn't paying attention and the team snuck off. It took a couple of minutes for them to notice that Kitty wasn't following them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did Kitty go?\" asked Spyke looking around confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. Kurt and Rogue, you guys go find her and the rest of you with me.\"  ordered Jean. Both Kurt and Rogue nodded and went to find their friend while everyone else went to the main production area where they saw a bunch of fat men being feed cookies as they made and packaged them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the strangest workers compensation I've ever seen.\" said Scott looking at the scene before him. Before anyone could reply two very fat girl scouts guards burst through a side door </span></div></div>",

Must find cookies!\" Kitty was saying as she ran through a hallway, looking into different rooms as she kept up her search. On her fourth try, Kitty opened the door and, upon seeing what was inside, excitedly clasped her hands together, her eyes shimmering in delight before running into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Scott, Jean and Spyke were being cornered by the two massive girl scout guards. One, a sumo sized Asian woman with glasses, swung a meaty fist at Jean, sending her flying into the wall. \"JEAN!\" Scott shouted, barely moving out of the second woman's way in time. Having taken care of Jean for that moment, the first woman turned her sights on Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, Spyke popped one of his spike as a staff he could use as a weapon from his wrist. Smirking, the Asian woman lunged at him, only for Evan to briefly swipe her off her feet with his spike, giving him time to go to try and help Cyke, who was still struggling with the blonde guard. Jean was only just starting to recover nearby but it wouldn't be soon enough to help Scott. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fatty lady!\" Spyke shouted to her as she hauled Scott off his feet, his collar in her meaty fist, the other drawn back to deck him. \"Wanna dance with someone? The Spyke Man's ready.\" Evan added with a smile, popping smaller spikes out of his arms, hands and shoulders to prove his point to her. The woman grunted and threw Scott down on his back, nearly knocking the wind out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk, the second girl charged and managed to briefly grab Spyke, only to yelp in agony as she began poking herself on his spikes. The second she released him, Evan, using his spike as a vaulting device, flew forward and slammed his feet into her soft tummy. \"OOOMPPPHHHH!!!!\" She grunted as she went flying over Scott and the railing before landing on the production floor below. \"Nice one dude.\" Scott smiled to Evan, who grinned back, only for the Asian woman to grab and quickly overpower them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgot about her.\" Spyke groaned in agony as he laid underneath Scott. Sensing victory, the woman, having climbed onto the railing, leapt off it, preparing to perform a big belly flop on them, only to freeze mid fall. Startled, the trio turned to see Jean with one hand out, clearly using her powers to stop the woman's descent. With a grunt of effort due to the woman's weight, the young telepath and telekinetic girl hurled the woman over the railing and on top of her friend. \"You guys okay?\" she asked as she helped Spyke and Cyclops stand up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we're fine, Jean.\" Scott smiled as he dusted himself off. \"Man, those troop leaders sure pack a punch.\" Spyke remarked as he massaged his sore jaw. \"Tell me about it. One second I'm ready to fight and the next the anvil chorus was going off in my head.\" Jean agreed with a knowing smile as the trio set off to try and find Kitty or at least Nightcrawler and Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rogue and Kurt were busy looking for Kitty. Right now, they were in some sort of laboratory. Curious, Kurt went to a large boiler like object in the center of the room and turned it's valve lever. A blue drop of liquid dripped onto his finger. He was just about to lick it when, \"Kurt! Don't! This stuff's gotta be what's makin' people so dang addicted to the cookies.\" Rogue said as she took a small test tube and filled it with the liquid to give to Hank when they got home. \"Mein gott! Maybe if I vas addicted, I probably vouldn't know how chilly it is in here.\" Kurt remarked as he shivered. \"You're right. It is kinda nippy in here. Maybe that's a clue too.\" Rogue remarked as she finally felt the chill in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"Rogue, call me crazy, but I think zat might be a clue too.\" Kurt said, nodding to a map on the nearby computer screen. It contained locations like Queens, New York, Jackson, Mississippi, Malibu, California and Shaker Heights Ohio. \"Wonder why she's got these areas marked?\" Kurt wondered. \"Because they're where my cookies are to be sent.\" said a voice. Turning around in shock, the duo saw a young woman, not much older than Jess, with black hair and dark eyes, in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hazel Netterman, Ah presume?\" Rogue guessed. \"Yes. That is me. The greatest cookie maker in the world! Or, at least I will be once I began sending my Passion Patties around the world!\" Hazel laughed as her obese right hand woman, a brunette named Toll, smirked in equal delight. \"Toll, deal with these muties for me, please.\" Hazel added with a laugh as she left. Toll first tried by using a gun that fired the Passion Patties like bullets, only for Rogue and Kurt to dodge these with ease. Then, she tried the physical approach, only for that to backfire as well, Without a word, she quickly left. \"Come on, we'd better find Kitty an' get outta here.\" Rogue said as she and Kurt set off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the duo reached the gift shop. \"We should've known.\" Kurt sighed as he and Rogue looked inside and found Kitty happily wolfing down box after box of Passion Patties. She had already eaten six and was on her 7th. After popping one into her mouth, she loudly sucked on her finger before eating more. \"Kitty!\" Rogue hissed. Hearing this, Kitty looked up as her friends came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey guys! See, I told you I'd, like, totally find more free samples!\" Kitty smiled, pulling a cookie out. \"Here, try one!\" Rogue, who was being offered the cookie, quickly snatched it out of Kitty's chubby hand. \"No! We gotta find the others and get outta here!\" she ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"Not so fast, muties!\" smirked Toll as she and several other girl scout troops surrounded the trio, armed with cookie guns. The trio didn't say anything but they knew even with their powers, there was no way they could avoid having the tourists get hurt should they try and fight. Unknown to the two groups, however, a young girl was watching from the hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the group heading into the hall, Rebecca quickly ducked behind some crates as Toll and her men marched Kitty, Kurt and Rogue to where Hazel was. Rebecca then popped up after the group had gone past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh man, oh man! Kitty and the others're in big trouble! What do I do?!?!? I know, I'll tell Scott, Jean and Evan! They can help!!</i>\" she told herself as she quickly raced off to find her new friends and tell them of their teammate's situation ASAP. </span></div></div>",

I'm so glad to see you here.\" she smirked as the Girl Scout minions strapped Kitty, Kurt and Rogue to the chairs. \"Vat is that thing?\" Kurt asked, nodding to the machine on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce you freaks to the Feeder. It's designed to force feed you until you're either obese or explode!\" she cackled in delight, grabbing the remote control. \"Prepare for 'Death by Cookie'!\" she giggled, activating the machine. The Feeder slowly lowered a large Passion Patty to Kitty and then crammed it into the young girl's mouth. Kitty, surprised at first, then smiled in delight. \"Like, yummy!\" she smiled. \"Why're ya doin' this?\" Rogue demanded to Hazel before a Passion Patty was jammed into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, I was once a chubby girl when I was your age and my parents ran a bakery during that time. Those fools I had to call classmates bullied me daily and those who didn't or only took part in the bullying reluctantly still didn't bail me out. I've waited 16 years for my revenge. Now, I will fatten those who foolishly bullied me and make them the fat ones!\" Hazel cackled in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're insane! Fattening people merely because you were teased for being out of shape yourself!\" Kurt protested, only for a cookie to be stuffed into his mouth as well. \"You freaks are one to talk. Your kind hasn't exactly been accepted warmly yet either.\" Hazel spat as she activated the autopilot for the Feeder. \"Now, while the Feeder handles you fools, I'm off to oversee the first shipping operation of my cookies.\" Hazel cackled as she, Toll and the other minions left, Kitty, Kurt and Rogue still being force fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rebecca was still looking for Scott, Jean and Evan. Turning around a corner, she literally plowed into Jean, knocking them over. \"What the-? Rebecca?!?!? What're you doing here?!?!\" Scott asked in shock. \"I-I'm sorry, Cyclops. I wanted to join you guys so I snuck onto the X-Jet before you guys got on board and hid in the bathroom.\" Rebecca confessed sheepishly as she and Jean got back on their feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea how dangerous and stupid that was? Your mom's probably goin' outta her mind wondering where you are, kiddo.\" Spyke said firmly but gently. \"There's no time for that! Shadowcat, Nightcrawler and Rogue're in trouble! Miss. Netterman's taken them hostage! We gotta help them!\" Rebecca said quickly. \"Let's move.\" Scott said firmly, going into leader mode as he, Jean, Spyke and Rebecca hurried to where the latter had seen the trio being taken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the Feeder's room, Kitty, Kurt and Rogue were still being force fed, Kitty being the only one enjoying it. \"Well, if we explode, it's been nice knowin' ya and the others.\" Rogue said before another cookie entered her mouth. \"Ditto.\" Kurt agreed. Then, Rebecca, Scott, Jean and Spyke arrived. \"Rebecca? Like, what're you totally doing here?\" Kitty asked in shock. \"She snuck onboard the X-Jet before we came here.\" Scott explained as he freed Rogue and the others freed Kurt and Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the Feeder started for Kitty again. \"Wait! Like, it's totally my turn again!\" Kitty squealed in delight, only for Scott to pull her and Rebecca away in time. \"Guys, enough with the cookies!\" He told them firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We gotta stop Hazel before she sends those cookies ta all her old classmates as revenge for their bullying!\" Rogue agreed. Then, \"REBECCA JOSEPHINE CLEARWATER!!!\" Jess shouted as she stormed in, anger and relief on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell were you thinkin' running off like that?!?!? You scared me half to death when I found your note!\" Jess shouted at Rebecca, who looked very guilty and timid. \"Mom, I...\" she began slowly. \"Mrs. Clearwater, like, Rebecca totally helped save me, Kurt and Rogue just now! She told the others where we were!\" Kitty explained quickly, coming to her new friend's aid. \"It's true, ma'am.\" confirmed Rogue as the others nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess, upon hearing this, clamed down, her anger draining and replaced with surprise. \"You did?\" she asked. \"Yeah Mom. I did.\" Rebecca smiled proudly. \"If it wasn't for Rebecca, we'd probably still be looking for them by now.\" Scott agreed. \"Where's Hazel now? I managed to hear you guys mention her motives. I can't believe it. I never thought she'd harbor a grudge against me for not helping her against her tormentors for this long.\" Jess finally said after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like she's headin' for Iceland. That must be where her main supply area is now.\" Rogue said, nodding to the screen in the room. \"Then, let's move.\" Scott said as the eight headed for the X-Jet, Kitty, Rebecca and Jess all grabbing large armfuls of Passion Patties boxes as they went. Soon, the X-Jet was heading full speed for both Iceland and Hazel's shipping area.</span></div></div>",

Taking cover behind some massive crates filled with giant piles of Passion Patties, the X-Kids, Rebecca and Jess noticed Hazel talking with Toll and one of the large, obese men working for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want the first load to Indiana ready within the hour!\" Hazel was saying as Toll nodded loyally. Behind the crates, \"How're we gonna stop her, Scott?\" Jean asked quietly. \"I'm not sure.\" Scott admitted. \"Vat I vant to know is why it is so chilly in here.\" Kurt remarked as he rubbed his arms and hopped up and down, trying to keep warm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it's probably because of the cookies.\" Kitty said, reaching into her pants and pulling a melting Passion Patty out of them. \"See? Like, heat totally makes them all melty. So sad right?\" she added sadly as she stared at it, Rebecca and Jess both voicing their own dismay at the cookie's melting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we just gotta warm it up in here.\" Scott realized, eying the machine that controlled the temperature of the warehouse. Kitty quickly popped the melting cookie into her mouth and then sucked her partially stained finger off as she chewed. \"Cover me.\" Scott told her and the others as he dropped down and started for the machine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing him, two Girl Scout troop leaders started for him, only for Jean, Kitty, Jess, Rebecca, Rogue and Kurt to shove several of the crates they were hiding behind onto said women. The noise caused Hazel, Toll and the male workers to look up in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's those useless muties again!\" Hazel snarled. \"Toll, take care of them!\" she ordered. Kurt, Jean, Spyke, Rogue and Kitty all hopped down while Jean used her telekinesis to help Jess and Rebecca down just as Toll lumbered up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll deal with her! You guys stop Hazel and the others!\" Kitty called. The other X-Kids nodded and took off to fight Hazel's other goons while Rebecca and Jess tried to stay out of the way while still stuffing themselves with cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, like, totally don't know what half-baked idea you're cooking up, but it's toast!\" Kitty snarled at Toll before they began their sumo wrestling match. Initially Toll had the upper hand as she managed to flip Kitty onto her back, only for Kitty to grab her ankle, tripping her and allowing Kitty to belly flop on top of her, knocking the wind out of Toll. \"Like, try that on for size!\" Kitty giggled at the knocked out Toll as she heaved her massive sumo body back up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Scott had reached the machine and was currently working away to figure it out in order to warm the factory up as Jean covered him using a telekinetic shielding. Spyke, Rogue and Kurt were all dealing with the sumo sized male workers, who despite having great strength and size to their advantage, were no match for the slimmer, quicker and super powered X-Kids. Spyke managed to pin six of them to the wall with his spikes, Rogue, using her powers, absorbed one of her opponent's strength to hers, allowing her to floor the other eight she was fighting while Kurt also quickly dispatched his opponents by teleporting them into different areas as they charged him, causing them to knock themselves out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Rebecca and Jess were still pigging out on the Passion Patties. Unknown to them, Hazel was watching them with an evil smile on her face. \"Time to say goodbye, you stupid fool.\" she smirked as she released a giant crate from the crane above the duo. Rebecca noticed this as she shoved two big handfuls of cookies into her mouth. \"MOM, LOOK OUT!!!\" She screamed through her bulging cheeks. Jess looked up in time to see the crate but she could never move aside in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, just as the crate plummeted towards her, it stopped. Jess, having closed her eyes, looked up and saw the crate hovering a few feet from her head. Thinking Jean had saved her, she turned to thank Jean, only to see the redheaded X-Kid still protecting Scott from their attackers. Slowly, she turned her head slightly and saw, to her great shock, it was Rebecca. Her chubby hands were in the air like Jean's and she was straining slightly from the weight. With a determined grunt, Becca tossed the massive crate towards the rest of Spyke, Rogue and Kurt's attackers, taking them down as the crate burst, covering the goons in a mountain sized pile of Passion Patties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mein gott!\" Kurt yelped, having seen this as Rogue and Spyke also looked on in shock. Seeing three more Girl Scout troop leaders heading for Jess, Rebecca snarled in rage. \"GET AWAY FROM MY MOM!!!!\" She screamed, several bony spikes shooting from her arms, fingertips and shoulders, pinning the trio to the wall, two upright and the middle one upside down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud \"BAMF!\" Rebecca teleported over to the X-Kids. \"That was awesome, Rebecca! How'd you-?\" Rogue began as a large male worker lumbered for them. Rebecca, not even missing a beat, whirled, grabbed the guy by his overall straps and, with one hand, threw him into Hazel, who screamed in horror and outrage as he pinned her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scott, how's that machine coming?\" Jean asked as she dropped the shield as all of Hazel's minions were defeated. \"Got it!\" shouted Scott as he activated the heat feature. After a moment, the cookies began melting inside the giant crates, leaking out in the process. \"NO!!!! YOU IDIOTS!!!\" Hazel screamed as Rebecca pulled her free and restrained her by pinning her arms down to her sides. \"Like, time for you to have a taste of your own medicine!\" Kitty smirked after Rogue handed her the test tube of blue liquid. \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Hazel screamed in horror as Kitty forced the liquid into her mouth. Within seconds, Hazel ballooned into a sumo version of herself, roughly the same size and weight as Jess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must have cookies! Must have cookies!\" Hazel whimpered after Rebecca released her as she waddled over to the melted cookies and began scarfing them down loudly as the X-Kids smiled in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the police had arrived and were taking Hazel, Toll and their goons away as Professor X and Beast had also arrived. \"Well done, my X-Men. You saved the world from Hazel's 'sweet' revenge.\" Xavier smiled proudly. \"Thanks, Professor. But, like, it totally wasn't just us.\" Kitty smiled, a chubby arm around Rebecca's shoulder as she smiled shyly as Xavier and Hank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rebecca, it seems you are a mutant. Gifted with superhuman strength and the ability to mimic other people's skills, powers and, if I'm not mistaken, also their personalities, memories and so on.\" Xavier smiled. Rebecca nodded gently. \"It's true.\" she said and turned to Jess, who wasn't saying anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momma, I'm a mutant. I discovered my powers a month ago after the anniversary of Dad's death. I didn't wanna tell you because I was afraid you'd freak out and hate me.\" She confessed, tears rolling down her plump cheeks. \"Oh, Becky honey. I'd never hate you. I love you, mutant or not.\" Jess smiled as she hugged her smiling daughter. \"Besides, your dad and I always figured it might happen.\" she confessed as they broke apart after a moment. \"How?\" Kurt asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before Rebecca was born, her dad was working at his chemical company when a generator began going crazy. Julian donned a hazmat suit and went in. He managed to get things under control again but not before taking a massive dose of radiation, even through the suit. When we learned a week later that I had become pregnant, we knew our child might have a mutation.\" Jess explained. \"We just thought she'd reach puberty beforehand.\" she confessed. \"Not all mutants wait until then for their powers to show up.\" Jean said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right. Jamie was only ten when his powers began to develop and he was eleven like Becca when his duplication mutation surfaced.\" Scott confirmed. Rebecca smiled in delight at this discovery. \"Mrs. Clearwater, if you would, I would like to talk with you and Rebecca at the institute.\" Xavier smiled. Jess nodded and she and Rebecca began to head for the X-Jet together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, did you work out an antidote for the cookies, Mr. McCoy?\" Kitty asked, poking her belly. \"Yes I did, Kitty. It's at the mansion and I've already sent out more of it to those Hazel's cookies effected.\" Hank smiled as the team followed the Clearwaters onto the X-Jet together for home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA week later, everybody who'd eaten Passion Patties and ballooned up were back to their normal weight and the cookies destroyed. Hazel was sentenced to 60 years in prison for her plans and her minions ended up suffering similar sentencings as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Rebecca, she was offered a place at Xavier's as while her mimicking power was very controlled, her super strength still had rough edges as she accidently smashed the front door open while opening it and broke a doorknob off another when she closed it, forcing Kitty to phase half the group out of the room while Kurt teleported the others after the meeting. Rebecca accepted the offer and joined the New Recruits under the codename \"Mimic\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough shy at first, she quickly became friends with the others, especially Amara, Tabitha, Kitty, Jamie and, to everybody's shock, Rogue. As Rebecca still needed some paperwork from her previous school in order to transfer to and attend Bayville Elementary like most of the NRs, excluding Magma and Boom-Boom both of whom were already attending Bayville High with the older kids, Rebecca was being home schooled by Hank, Storm and Professor X. She soon proved to be very intelligent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPer Kitty's request, Rebecca was now her roommate. The duo often spent nights talking, laughing and staying up late. Sometimes, Professor X would go by their room and find them asleep in the same bed, Kitty's arm drooped protectively over Rebecca's chest, making them resemble an older sister sharing a bed with her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Rebecca did miss her friends and mom, she was allowed to see Jess on certain weekends. She was very happy with her new friends and life.</span></div></div>",

It was to raise money for repairs to the school gymnasium which had recently been partially destroyed during a battle between the X-Kids and the Brotherhood of Bayville.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, this carnival is totally awesome.\" Kitty smiled as she walked between her two teammates and friends. At that moment, Jean noticed a cotton candy booth. \"Let's get some.\" she said after Rogue noticed it and pointed it out to Kitty. With that, the trio went over to the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi. Three please.\" Jean smiled as she handed some money over. The guy grabbed three cones and set to work filling them with the cotton candy. Kitty and Jean's were bright pink while Rogue took the blue colored one. They thanked the guy and walked away. \"Like, I've never totally tried cotton candy before.\" Kitty remarked as she looked at hers. \"It's really good, Kitty.\" Jean smiled as she took a fairly big bite out of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty shrugged and took a tiny bite. Then, her eyes widened as she felt the cottony treat slide down her throat. It really was tasty. Without a word, she quickly inhaled the rest of her cone to Jean and Rogue's shock. \"Wow. Enjoy it, did ya?\" Rogue remarked, eying Kitty as she loudly licked her fingers clean of the cotton candy that'd stuck to her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, I totally need more food.\" Kitty smiled as she still felt hungry. \"Well, there's a few more booths over there that're selling food.\" Jean offered. Without a word, Shadowcat raced off to said stands in hunger. \"Ya think we should go after her?\" Rogue asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I'm sure she'll be okay on her own. We'll just go find a table and wait for her.\" Jean smiled assuredly as she watched Kitty reach a funnel cake stand. Rogue didn't say anything but then she nodded and followed Jean to the picnic tables nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Kitty came up, holding a large tray containing two rather large hot dogs slathered in ketchup, mustard and relish as well as a big helping of funnel cake and a large glass of lemonade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Kitty. Are you sure you can eat that much food?\" Jean asked. \"Like, I'm totally sure, Jean.\" Kitty smiled as she picked up her first hot dog and took a jumbo bite out of it, smearing ketchup onto her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty quickly tore through the food on her tray in minutes, not leaving a single crumb. After it was over, Kitty was loudly slurping her lemonade as she rubbed her stuffed belly. \"Like, I totally think I'm good.\" Kitty smiled as she stood up, still slurping up her beverage as Jean and Rogue also stood up, still shocked their friend had eaten all that junk food so quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you were hungry.\" remarked Rogue as Kitty finished her massive lemonade and tossed the cup into the trashcan with her wrappers and things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah *BUUUUURRRRPPPP!!!* Excuse me. Like, I'll totally need to come back here again.\" Kitty smiled as the trio left, holding their prizes from the carnival games they'd played beforehand. </span></div></div>",

Now she was going back four times a day to eat more of the delicious carnival food. She had doubled her intake by now and would get two large orders of everything, like four large hot dogs, two large helpings of funnel cake and at least two massive lemonades as well as 2 large bags of cotton candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was taking a toll on her figure as Kitty was now plump. Her face was rounder and softer looking with chubby cheeks and a double chin. Meanwhile, she also now sported a bigger butt and meatier thighs that strained her black pants. Her legs had also become plumper, as had her feet and her toes were much chubbier looking. The same held true for her arms, hands and fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest part of her though, was her belly as it bulged visibly under her red t-shirt, the buttons straining against her squishy, bloated tummy. Despite this, Kitty kept eating the carnival food daily. Right now, Kitty was hurrying into the carnival grounds for her 2nd helping that day as Kurt, Rogue, Scott and Jean all watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it me or is Kitty becoming too addicted to this unhealthy carnival food?\" Kurt asked as they watched Kitty excitedly picking up her tray of free carnival foods. Since she'd been there so often in the last two days, the workers allowed her to take her orders for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right, Kurt. She has been getting pretty plump lately.\" Scott agreed as Kitty sat down at a picnic table and began wolfing down her pile of junk food at top speed as usual. \"Should we tell her?\" Jean asked, unsure of hurting her friend's feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think we should.\" Rogue said promptly as she came over to Kitty, followed by the others. \"Hey, Kit. Can we talk?\" Rogue asked once she reached her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Mmph.* Like, sure Rogue. What's up?\" Kitty asked after swallowing her giant mouthful of funnel cake and then grabbing her second jumbo lemonade and beginning to guzzle it down with very big slurps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh... Kitty... over the last two days you've been eating a lot of these carnival food and, uh... well...\" Scott began slowly, unsure how to tell his friend the truth. Kurt decided to break the silence and get to the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, you're getting rather round.\" He told her, gently poking her belly, his furry finger sinking slightly into her gut. Kitty, still slurping her lemonade, gently pulled his hand away. \"Like, I'm totally okay, guys. It's not like I'm as big as Blob.\" she huffed as she finished it and began her third. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, just make sure ya don't, sugar. Otherwise we're gonna need a flatbed or somethin' ta get ya to an' from school.\" Rogue said gently to her best friend and teammate. With that, the others left to enjoy the carnival's other attractions, leaving Kitty behind   as she happily rubbed her belly while slurping up her lemonades, her belly straining even more against her tight red t-shirt.</span></div></div>",

The duo had dated briefly before mutants were exposed a few days ago and after the fight between their teams in the school parking lot during the school board meeting, the duo had wisely decided to break up, knowing they could never be together while on such polar opposite teams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what is it, Lance?\" Kitty huffed in equal contempt as she started her fourth lemonade after tossing the third cup away. \"I just wanted to see if you're missing me yet?\" Lance replied with a smirk. \"Like I miss my hideous pyramid shaped hat.\" Kitty retorted, recalling the hat that she had bought. It had claimed to simulate brain power and Kitty had been freaking out over a Geometry test at the time. Though she ultimately aced the test, she had finally noticed how weird the hat looked after wearing it in front of a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance smirked as he sat down across from her. \"Looks like you've been puttin' on some weight.\" He remarked, pointing to her belly as it pressed lightly against the table. \"Like, maybe I have. So what?\" Kitty snarked as she rubbed her gut defensively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing. It's just...\" Now Lance was turning bright red as he awkwardly rubbed the back of his head. \"Like, what?\" Kitty asked, her anger slipping away slightly. Lance stammered for a second and then he blurted it out loud. \"I've always kinda liked chubby or fat girls.\" For a moment, neither teenager said anything. Lance because he was embarrassed and Kitty because she was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Was all Kitty said, her eyes wide in shock. \"I never said anything about it because I wasn't sure if you'd like to put on weight.\" Lance explained. Kitty didn't say a word for a long time. She just slowly sipped her lemonade in thought as she went over Lance's confession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lance?\" She finally said after a moment. \"Hmmm?\" Lance asked, looking up. Then, Kitty broke out in a smile. \"Wanna ride the Fairs wheel with me?\" she offered. Lance was quiet for a moment, then he smiled, nodded and followed Kitty to said ride, Kitty quickly gulping the rest of her lemonade down and tossing it into the trash bin as they reached the ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey climbed in, Kitty with some difficulty due to her belly, and then they enjoyed the ride. After riding on the wheel twice, they got off, laughing and talking as if they'd never broken up. \"Like, what should we do next?\" Kitty asked Lance with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance was about to answer when he noticed a hot dog eating contest. At least four other girls had entered so far and there was room for one more. He quickly pointed this out to Kitty. \"Wanna try it?\" He asked. Kitty was quiet for a long minute as she considered it.</span></div></div>",

Kitty swallowed nervously but nevertheless remained seated. She looked at her opponents. Three of them were equally unsure of themselves, but the fourth was smirking, clearly sure of her victory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hi. I'm Kitty. Who're you?\" Kitty said to her politely. The girl, who towered over Kitty by at leas five to six inches, smirked and pushed her blonde hair back. \"I'm Samantha Heffernan, junior. If you have any idea about winning this little competition, mutie, I'll make it clear to you now: you'll lose.\" she said in a superior tone of voice. Kitty was shocked at this girl's rudeness and arrogance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything, the referee came up with a microphone in his hand. \"Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to the 1st Annual Bayville Hot Dog Eating Contest! Our competitors tonight will try to eat as many hot dogs as possible. The winner will receive a check for 10,000 dollars!\" He announced. Kitty thought her jaw was gonna drop onto the table. Ten thousand dollars! That would be enough to give a donation to the school for repairs and she'd have enough left over to buy anything she wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha seemed to notice what Kitty was thinking about. \"Don't bother planning on how you're gonna spent that loot, mutie. I'm going to win and add it to my inheritance.\" she smirked smugly. \"Like, don't bet on it, creep!\" Kitty snarled determinedly as she prepared for the signal to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark... get set... GO!!!!\" the referee bellowed as the girls set to work gorging themselves. Samantha was the first to start shoveling hot dogs into her mouth, chewing loudly and smacking her lips. Kitty, however, was keeping up fairly well herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the contest went on, the other girls began surrendering to their now stuffed and aching bellies. The first one had eaten 40 hot dogs before she fell back in her chair, clutching her tummy in agony while burping ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second one lasted to hot dog #49 before surrendering to her own aching belly with a massive and deep burp as she laid her head down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirl number three lasted six more hot dogs than her friend before she got a major bellyache and fell off her chair and onto her back, moaning and hiccupping in agony as she rubbed her gurgling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was just Kitty and Samantha left. Lance was cheering loudly for Kitty and several of their other peers, who weren't anti-mutant, were as well. \"Come on, Kitty! you can do it!\" Lance shouted as Kitty gulped down her 69th hot dog. Samantha, meanwhile, was starting to slow down. She was on her 71st hot dog when her tummy let out a giant rumble, causing her to turn green and hightail it into a nearby porta-potty, barfing loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kitty was calmly finishing the 79th and final hot dog on her tray. With a sigh, she leaned back, patting her belly in delight. \"And the new winner with 79 hot dogs: Kitty Pryde! the ref shouted as Kitty heaved herself up and thrust both hands into the air in victory as the crowd cheered. Kitty accepted the large check and shook hands with the ref and Kelly, who looked like he wanted to break his hand after touching hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great *urp* job, Kitty.\" said the first challenger, a black haired and green eyed Caucasian girl in Kitty's grade as she stifled a burp while patting her mostly calm again tummy. \"Like, thanks Rachel.\" Kitty smiled as they high fived. The second girl, an African-American with braids, spoke next. \"Yeah. It was cool to see this new side of you.\" said the girl, whose name was Ruthie Palmer, a senior in Scott and Jean's year as she rubbed and patted her big brown boulder of a gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third, who was still somewhat sick looking, came up next. \"I'm *burp* with *hic* them, *urp* Kitty. You were *ugh* totally *belch* awesome.\" said Selene Raymond as she kept rubbing her big pregnant looking belly. \"Like, thanks you guys.\" Kitty smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha then staggered out of the porta potty, her face dull green now and she looked rather weak, but upon seeing Kitty holding the giant check under her flabby arm, she seemed to regain her strength as she stomped over, getting into Kitty's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cheated, you lousy mutie! I don't know how, but YOU CHEATED!!! THAT MONEY WAS GONNA BE MINE!!!!\" She screamed, Kitty gagging slightly at the stench of Samantha's breath. \"Like, I totally didn't cheat, Samantha! If I had, I would've been disqualified! Besides, you were just gonna use all the money on yourself!\" Kitty retorted in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Rachel, Ruthie and Selene came up. \"Leave her alone, Sam.\" Ruthie ordered. \"Yeah. Just 'cause she's a mutant doesn't mean she's a cheater.\" Rachel agreed. \"Kitty's a really nice person. She's not an arrogant know-it-all like <i>you</i> are, Sam!\" Selena added with a frown. Samantha scoffed and crossed her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shows what you morons know, coming from poor, lower class families. I am extremely perfect.\" She jeered. Kitty smirked as an idea came to her. \"Like, do you guys totally wanna grab something to eat?\" she asked with a wink to her new friends. The trio giggled as they realized what Kitty was doing. \"Sure. What'd ya have in mind, Kit?\" Ruthie asked with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like, maybe more hot dogs with ketchup, mustard, pickles, relish, onions, chili and/or cheese.\" Kitty offered with a smirk as she saw Samantha pale again. \"And greasy corn dogs with fries.\" added Selene, catching onto the plan, causing Samantha to turn dark green this time. \"And big helpings of funnel cake and candy apples.\" Rachel smirked as Samantha clamped her hand over her mouth.  \"Don't forget the cotton candy and lemonade!\" Ruthie giggled. At that, the very green as a leaf Samantha let out an ominous burp, her cheeks bulging behind her hand and she turned and nearly flew back into the porta potty, slamming the door shut as she barely turned her head over the toilet in time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks guys.\" Kitty smiled as she slapped hands with the trio again. \"No prob. See you tomorrow?\" Rachel smiled. \"Like, sure thing.\" Kitty giggled as the trio set off to meet up with friends or family while she went to meet up with Lance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, that was awesome!\" Lance cheered as he gently hugged her. \"Thanks. Like, can we go and get something to eat? All this talk about food, like, totally made me hungry.\" Kitty smiled as her belly rumbled in agreement. Then, *RRRRRIIIIPPPP!!!* Her pants split right down the middle. \"Oops.\" she blushed as Lance smiled and quickly used the check to cover her underpants as they went to the food booths.  </span></div></div>",

Upon seeing her, the worker's eyes went wide in delight. \"I was watching you last night, Kitty. You were awesome in the hot dog eating contest!\" He smiled in delight. \"Like, thanks, Brian.\" Kitty giggled with a blush. \"I don't think you knew this, but the rules stated that the winner of the contest is allowed to eat however much they want, whenever they want.\" Brain smiled. At that, Kitty grinned in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, then I'll take my usual order and a large Banana Fudge Sundae.\" Kitty smiled. Brian nodded and set to work. Soon, Kitty was eating her massive tray of food, now including a giant sundae with chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream with both hot fudge sauce and bits of fudge on it, three bananas, a giant spray of whipped cream and a cherry on top. She was just starting said sundae when Lance came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Pretty Kitty.\" He smiled. \"Like, hey Lance. Guess what? Since I totally won the hot dog eating contest last night, I can totally eat even more food whenever I want to!\" Kitty smiled, popping a big spoonful of ice cream into her gullet. \"Cool. Hey listen, I was wondering if...\" Lance paused and blushed again. \"What Lance?\" Kitty asked as she shoved another spoonful of ice cream into her mouth. \"I was wondering if you'd be interested in hanging out on Saturday. I know this neat new All-You-Can-Eat buffet you may like.\" Lance offered. Kitty thought about it as she finished the rest of her sundae, licking the bowl clean as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess I can totally make it.\" She smiled. Lance smiled at his becoming obese girlfriend. \"Cool. I'll either pick you up at 6 or we'll meet there. Knowing Summers, it's probably better if we meet there.\" He said. \"Like, can't wait.\" Kitty smiled as she began chugging lemonade #3 as they got up and moved in separate directions. Lance to meet up with the Brotherhood nearby and Kitty to hang out with Kurt and Rogue. As it was spring break, they didn't need to worry about school, hence why Kitty had began going to get four helpings each day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough out the day, Kitty was congratulated for her victory in the previous night's contest by several of the students as she kept going back for more food, her red t-shirt's buttons straining against her larger belly each time. </span></div></div>",

The two girls turned to look. It was the Hurl-A-Whirl. \"Like, I'm not sure about that, Kurt.\" Kitty said as she chomped on corndogs and a large bag of popcorn, having already popped her bottom button off her t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think it'll be okay, Kitty.\" Rogue smiled assuredly to her best friend and teammate. Kitty finished eating her corn dogs and popcorn before giving in. \"Okay. But if I, like, totally urp, I'm gonna say you two convinced me to do this.\" she warned as they climbed in and leaned against the wall, holding onto the railings beside them. Luckily for the trio, they were the only ones riding the Hurl-A-Whirl right now. The operator helped strap them in and then started the ride. Slowly, the machine began twirling and then it got faster and faster and faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it was running at it's top speed. Inside, the three X-Kids felt gravity pressing on them as the machine whirled like a top. Kurt whooped in delight as his hair blew around due to the wind the ride was kicking up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS IS SO AAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWSSSSSSSSSSOOOOMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!\" He shouted over the roar of the wind and the ride's rattling and whirring. Rogue actually seemed to be enjoying herself as well as she too was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH'M WITH YA, KURT! THIS IS REALLY COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!\" She whooped as her own hair blew around as they spun around at top speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, however, wasn't having a good time. Her very stuffed belly was flip flopping and doing summersaults every minute. She was starting to wish she hadn't eaten that second Banana Fudge Sundae or that popcorn and those corn dogs. As the machine kept twirling them around, Kitty turned lime green as a giant wave of nausea hit her hard, her tummy rumbling ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, are you alvight?!?!?!\" Kurt asked upon noticing her expression and hearing her gut's rumbling and gurgling. \"Nooo... *urp* Like, I totally think I'm gonna be si-\" Kitty managed to get out before she felt a giant amount of bile rushing up her throat. Her cheeks bulged out like a chipmunk's and then, *BBBBOOOOURRRGGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!* Kitty vomited loud and hard into the middle of the ride's floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurt, maybe we shoulda listened ta her.\" Rogue remarked with concern. \"I think she'll be fine.\" Kurt said as Kitty rose her head, still pale apple green. \"Not done yet.\" she mumbled, guessing Rogue's question, vomit on her chin before she bent over again. *BBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOORRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!* She barfed again, even more this time, with her sick getting on her t-shirt and sandals as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the operator had heard this barfing episode and quickly stopped the ride. \"Are you alright, Miss. Pryde?\" he asked, remembering her from the previous night's contest as Kitty dang near crawled out of the ride, clutching her large tummy as it kept feeling very, very queasy. \"Like, I will be once I totally... *UUUUrrrrrrpppppp!!* Gotta go!\" Kitty yelped as she flew into a nearby porta-potty, slamming the door shut.  *HHHHUURURRRRRRKKKKKKKK!!!!* She vomited a second later, Rogue wincing in sympathy while Kurt went to hang out with Amanda Soften, his girlfriend and one of the few people to have known about the X-Kids' powers until mutantkind was exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Scott and Jean arrived and found Rogue by the porta-potties. \"Hey, Rogue. Where's Kitty?\" Scott asked. Before Rogue could answer, \"*HHHHHUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!* Like, my poor tummy! Why did I totally eat that second sundae!\" Kitty moaned from inside after barfing for the umpteenth time. Slowly, she stumbled out, still visibly green and weak looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kurt came up with Amanda. \"Hey guys.\" Amanda smiled to the four. \"Hey, 'Manda.\" Rogue smiled. \"Hi.\" Kitty mumbled weakly as she rubbed her seemingly calm again belly. \"Feeling better?\" Kurt asked. \"Like, a little bit.\"  \"We swung by the food booths and Brian gave this to give to you.\" Jean said as she held up Kitty's 4th and final tray of hot dogs, funnel cake, cotton candy, lemonades and two of the Banana Fudge Sundaes. Upon seeing this, Kitty immediately turned green again, let out a giant deep burp as her cheeks bulged and quickly ducked back into the stall. \"Ah don't think she's gonna be hungry for a few hours guys.\" Rogue said, wincing as Kitty's vomiting could be heard inside the toilet. Kitty ultimately stayed in the portable toilet for another hour before finally recovering enough to head home. By the next day, she was well again.</span></div></div>",

That was a good thing too, as tonight was her going to the buffet with the Brotherhood. That night, Kitty managed to leave the mansion without raising too many questions and headed off for the buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance, Toad, Pietro and Blob were already there, waiting for Kitty. \"There she is, yo!\" Toad called as Kitty entered the buffet and located their table. \"Like, this is a totally awesome looking place guys.\" Kitty smiled as she sat beside Lance. She felt glad she hadn't pigged out yet so she had a lot of room in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, can we eat now, Lance?\" Blob asked, clearly tired of waiting. \"Yeah, Blob. We can.\" Lance smiled as the five got up and headed for the serving stations. Kitty grabbed a plate, but then changed her mind and simply grabbed a tray like Blob had done and began piling it with hot dogs, corn dogs, funnel cake, pie, pizza, french fries, burgers, cupcakes and biscuits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she returned to the table, she began inhaling the food at top speed like Blob. The Brotherhood boys just watched in disbelief as Kitty inhaled all the food in minutes, her belly swelling up as she did. \"This is way freaky, yo. I never thought we'd see somebody else who could eat like Freddy.\" Toad remarked. \"Yeah. And this' comin' from me.\" Blob agreed in equal awe and impressment as Kitty loudly inhaled six corn dogs at once, pulling the sticks out completely clean with a loud belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she kept eating, Kitty's t-shirt strained to remain intact. However, as Kitty finished her 3rd tray, the buttons simply gave up. *PING!* *PING!* *PING!* *PING!* *PING!* All five of them went as they popped off, flying in different directions. Kitty didn't even seem to care. She just kept eating and eating and eating and eating and eating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, \"Ooooohhh godddddd.... *UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Like, I totally think I overdid it.\" Kitty groaned, massaging her large belly with her hands as she leaned back in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Kitty Kat?\" Quicksilver asked. \"Y-Yeah, Pietro. Just *BURP!* a little queasy.\" Kitty moaned as she kept messaging her tummy while quietly burping and hiccupping. \"C'mon. We'd better get you home.\" Lance said as he helped Kitty up and the four helped her to Lance's Jeep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they arrived at Xavier's. Kitty managed to climb out, thanked Lance and the others and slowly waddled up to the mansion, burping, hiccupping and occasionally farting loudly as she came in. When asked by Cyclops and the others, Kitty merely replied she'd taken advantage of her new discount thing at the carnival as she went to bed still fully clothed.</span></div></div>",

Upon arriving, Shadowcat headed straight for the food booths. Brian noticed her right away. \"Hey, Kitty. Your usual?\" He guessed with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, you totally know it!\" Kitty smiled as he handed her the massive tray of hot dogs, cotton candy, lemonade, funnel cake and sundaes. Kitty plopped down on a picnic bench and began eating. While the other X-Kids hung out at the rides and games while occasionally going to get some food, Kitty stayed at that bench all day. She just kept eating and eating, and eating and eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTray after tray after tray piled up on her table as she gorged herself. Her belly grew rounder and round, filing up her lap. She grew fatter and fatter, her girth causing the poor bench to bend and creak warningly. Kitty didn't even stop until *CRACK!* the bench finally gave way to her massive butt, sending the bloated X-Girl crashing to the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOMMMMPPPPPHHHHH!* Kitty grunted as she landed on her poor backside with a jiggle rippling through her body. \"Like, guess that's totally a sign I've been eating too much lately.\" she remarked with a shrug as she went back to eating while sitting on the grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty just kept on gorging herself, unaware that Scott and the others had grown tired of waiting for her when it was time to go home and left without her. Nor did she notice as the other carnival goers left as well or when her shirt buttons popped open again. She didn't care as long as she kept eating and drinking herself full to bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as dusk began to fall, one of the employees came up to Kitty, who was finishing up her 30th tray of food. Her face was a mess of cotton candy, funnel cake, ketchup, mustard, relish, ice cream, whipped cream and hot fudge sauce as was her t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Miss. Pryde... but the carnival's getting ready to close now. You'll have to leave.\" He told her politely. Kitty nodded as she stifled a very big burp, her cheeks bulging while she did.  \"Like, okay. Thanks for a totally awesome week!\" she giggled as she heaved herself up and staggered away, burping, hiccupping and farting loudly as she did while also licking the remains of her her feast off her face and fingers as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few weeks, but Kitty ultimately lost a majority of her girth by summer break. Despite this, her new appetite and a rather round belly remained with her. However, she was very happy with her new look and appetite with Scott and the others accepting it due to their friendship with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they did end up needing to hid their snacks from her most of the time due to her hunger reaching the same level as Blob's.</span></div></div>",

They had recently won a fight against the Brotherhood of Bayville and had decided to go out and celebrate. A young girl, not much older than the six themselves, came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon. Welcome to the Bombay Palace. My name is Padma Koothrappali and I will be your waitress. What may I get you?\" she said with a smile. Scott and the others ordered first and then it was Kitty's turn. Kitty looked at her menu thoughtfully before making her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'll have an order of the chicken Korma.\" Kitty said. Korma was a dish consisting of either meat or vegetables braised with yogurt or cream, water or stock and spices resulting in a thick sauce or glaze. Padma nodded and went to fill the orders, leaving the X-Kids to talk about their recent victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Padma arrived with the team's orders. But, to Kitty's surprise, she received 5 of the chicken kormas. \"Um, like, I totally didn't order this much.\" Kitty said in surprise. \"My mother always says that a girl should always have a healthy appetite.\" Padma smiled. Kitty shrugged and picked up her fork. She took a bite, and her eyes widened in delight at the taste. \"Like, this is totally YUMMY!\" She squealed and began bolting down each helping as the others and Padma watched in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah think she likes it.\" Rogue remarked as she watched Kitty wolfing down her korma. Finally, Kitty was licking her 5th bowl clean as the others stared at her in shock. \"Are you alright, miss?\" Padma asked. Kitty nodded after setting the bowl down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, yeah. It was *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPP!!!!* totally good! *UUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPP!!!*\" Kitty said, letting out two big burps due to the sauces' spiciness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott paid for the meal and the six X-Kids left, Kitty burping every so often on the way home. That night, Kitty, as she laid in bed, couldn't stop thinking about the delicious Indian cuisine she'd tasted that afternoon. \"<i>Like it really was so yummy. I'll totally need to stop by there again soon</i>.\" Kitty smiled as she went to sleep, dreaming about korma and other Indian foods. </span></div></div>",

Without wasting a beat, she began scarfing them down like she was starving. Padma smiled as she watched the young girl.

Kitty smiled back. Then, *PPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRTTTTTT!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer butt let out a big fart due to the sauces in the curry and korma. \"Like, pardon *BBBBEEEELLLLLLCCCCCHHHHHHH!!!* me!\" She blushed with a burp and a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadma laughed as she helped her friend up. \"Y'know, my mother asked if she could meet you after I told her how much you love our food.\" she said with a grin.

Kitty's eyes lit up at the thought of even more yummy Indian foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, sure! Is tomorrow totally good for you guys?\" Kitty asked. Padma smiled. \"Yeah. Mom said she'll take tomorrow off. We live in an apartment upstairs so you can just come right on in.\" She replied. Kitty was about to reply when, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOORRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* *BBBBUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Two big burps escaped her lips. The two girls giggled in amusement. \"Like, maybe next time I should totally go easy on the sauce.' Kitty smiled as she licked some of it off her finger a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said goodbye to Padma and headed for home, her potbelly gurgling slightly due to the gas inside her, causing her to burp and fart loudly on occasion as she came back to the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kitty. Where were you?\" Scott asked as he ran into her outside the mansion. \"Like, I went back to Bombay Palace and had some more of their yummy food.\" Kitty replied, stifling a very big burp with her hand as she quickly darted inside and headed for the bathroom, the spicy sauces causing her to need to take a poop because of her now slightly upset tummy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day found Kitty going back to Bombay Palace after school. Padma was waiting for her when she came in. \"You made it! C'mon! Mom's upstairs already!\" she smiled, taking Kitty by the arm and practically dragged Shadowcat up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they entered a fairly roomy apartment. Kitty looked around as she stood in the doorway. It looked very neat. There were a few things paying homage to the Koothrappali's Indian homage, like fancy curtains and a few elephant statues, but that was it. Padma seemed to notice Kitty's surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were thinking of something like on TV, right?\" she guessed with a grin. Kitty blushed deeply. She hadn't meant to be so obvious. \"Like, I-\" she began nervously. Padma just giggled. \"It's okay, Kitty. I'm used to it. Believe it or not, I wasn't actually born in India. I was born here in the US after my parents immigrated here. Don't get me wrong, they loved India but they wanted more for me since they both came from poor families.\" Padma explained gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, an older woman came out of the kitchen. \"Ah! You must be Miss. Kitty Pryde! Padma told me about you.\" she smiled upon seeing Kitty. Kitty smiled and nodded. \"Like, that's me, ma'am.\" she said. Mrs. Koothrappali smiled again. \"Come, come! I've been making a big meal for you.\" she smiled, leading the two girls to the kitchen/dining room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Kitty sat down, Padma's mom quickly placed a large helping of chicken curry in front of her along with an equally large helping of korma. Kitty quickly wolfed both down quickly, moaning in delight at the taste. Mrs. Koothrappali smiled at the sight as she put another, even bigger helping of curry on Kitty's plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kitty's belly had swollen up even more, making her potbelly more gut-like in appearance. She'd eaten at least 10 of both chicken curry and korma. Now, Mrs. Koothrappali placed a plate of poppadom and pita bread in front of her. Without even missing a beat, Kitty quickly began eating that, soon licking the plate clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs. Koothrappali and Padma, who'd been eating as well, smiled at their new friend. Then, Kitty opened her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP P!!!!* She belched loudly. \"Like, excuse me.\" she apologized with a blush. \"It is alright, Kitty. That shows me you enjoy the food.\" Mrs. Koothrappali smiled as she gently rubbed Kitty's belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT TTTT!!!* Kitty farted in response. \"Like, I think I totally gotta use the bathroom.\" Kitty said, the lower part of her belly rumbling in agreement. Mrs. Koothrappali smiled. \"I have just the thing for you.\" she replied and went into the bathroom. She came out a second later, holding a thick diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, a diaper?\" Kitty asked in bewilderment. \"Yes. Padma wears them too.\" Mrs. Koothrappali said assuredly. Padma nodded and, to Kitty's shock, pulled her pants down to reveal an equally thick diaper. \"Mom didn't really have time to potty train me when I was a kid so I just kept wearing and using 'em.\" She explained to the surprised Kitty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was silent as she thought it over. But then, her tummy let out another ominous rumble and she practically phased her diaper on. Not a moment too soon. *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRCCCCCHHHHHH!!!* With that giant fart, Kitty filled her diaper with a massive poop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks.\" She told Mrs. Koothrappali, who smiled before going to clean up the table. As she worked, Kitty and Padma talked  while sitting on the couch in the living room. \"So, like, if you don't mind me asking, where's your dad?\" asked Kitty. At this, Padma became sad. \"Like, I-I'm sorry. You totally don't need to answer if...\" Kitty began quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's okay.\" Padma smiled gently. She took a deep breath. \"It happened two years ago. Mom and Dad were driving home from Temple. It was rainy so the road's were slick. A car was coming into the intersection at the same time from the opposite direction and hit them. They were both taken to the hospital. Mom survived since she was on the passenger side but Dad... he died two days later.\" Padma explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty didn't say anything. Then, she slowly hugged her new friend. Padma, though surprised, smiled and returned the hug. A little later, Kitty (now in a fresh diaper and with several more in her backpack) said goodbye to Padma and her mom and headed for home, her belly noticeably rounder and bigger. </span></div></div>",

She and Padma had met at school and had decided to have a sleepover, having cleared with Professor X and Mrs. Koothrappali beforehand. She headed up to the apartment and knocked on the door. A second later, Padma opened it, already clad in a t-shirt and a thick diaper. \"Hey Kitty!\" she smiled as they hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks for inviting me.\" Kitty smiled back. \"You just want more food.\" Padma smirked as she playfully poked Kitty's gut, causing its' owner to blush. \"Like, maybe.\" Kitty giggled. At that moment, Mrs. Koothrappali poked her head out from the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, hello Kitty. I have just finished up a meal for the two of you.\" She smiled. Hearing this, Kitty quickly dropped her sleeping bag and suitcase and ran to the table. There was a massive meal of chicken curry, korma and poppadom and pita breads waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks Mrs. Koothrappali.\" she smiled. \"Hey, Kitty, I have an idea.\" Padma said as they sat down to eat. \"Like, what is it?\" Kitty asked as she began pouring spicy sauce on her korma. \"Let's see who can eat the most food with the sauce on it before needing a drink. Loser has to change the winner's diaper.\" Padma offered. \"Like, sure.\" Kitty smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether, they poured a massive amount of the sauce onto their first meal and then ate it. Kitty felt the heat from the sauce but otherwise felt okay. Padma, since it was the first round, looked to have the same reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey kept eating and eating with more and more of the sauce added with each course. Finally, after eating a piece of pita bread drowned in the sauce, Padma couldn't take it anymore and grabbed her glass of water, chugging it loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, are you okay?\" Kitty asked. Padma didn't answer until she drained the glass. \"Yeah. I... just forgot... I can only take... a certain amount of spicy sauce.\" gasped Padma as she fanned her tongue. Then, with a *PPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOTTTTTT!!* Kitty filled her diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls didn't say anything at first and then, \"A deal's a deal.\" smiled Padma as she nodded to the floor. Kitty slowly got on her back and Padma changed her diaper in a matter of minutes. \"Like, thanks.\" Kitty smiled once she was in a fresh one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" Padma smiled back. The rest of the night went like any girl sleepover. They did their hair and nails, told stories about their lives and gossiped a little about the boys they liked. Finally, they fell asleep in Padma's bedroom at midnight.</span></div></div>",

She had just walked in, humming to herself as she did, when she noticed Kurt and Rogue watching her from the steps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys. Like, what's up?\" Kitty asked as they came downstairs. \"Kitty, we gotta talk to you.\" Rogue said, nodding to the couch. Kitty nodded after a moment and then sat down with Kurt on one side and Rogue on the other. \"Like, going on?\" She asked cheerfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know you've been eating quite a bit lately.\" Kurt began slowly, poking Kitty's much bigger belly. *BURP!!!* Kitty burped as a result with a blush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I guess I have totally put on extra weight.\" Kitty agreed sheepishly. \"We're just saying maybe ya should cut down on the amount of food you're eatin'.\" Rogue explained to her friend, roommate and teammate. Kitty was quiet for a moment as she thought over the request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she smiled and nodded. \"Like, I guess you guys're totally right. If I keep this up, I'm gonna need a forklift to get around.\" She joked as she put a hand on her belly. The trio then went to get breakfast, with Kitty making sure to not eat too many doughnuts, bagels, cinnamon rolls and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks passed and Kitty gradually slimmed back to her normal size and weight. Despite this, she remained close friends with Padma and her mother. Padma eventually learned of Kitty being a mutant, but accepted it very well, as did her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the other X-Kids, meanwhile, Kitty kept wearing and using her new diapers. They were very comfy and made her feel safe and secure.</span></div></div>",

It featured new veggies that had apparently been gene spliced to have more healthy things in them. Deciding to check it out, Kitty left the mansion and located a stand handing out free samples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, could I try the carrot?\" She asked the woman behind the counter. The woman smiled and nodded, handing Kitty the carrot. Kitty took it and bit into it. Upon doing so, her eyes widened. Instead of tasting more carrot-like, the carrot actually tasted like cake. Quickly polishing it off, Kitty looked at the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, got any other of those new veggies?\" She asked. The woman nodded and handed over some radishes. Kitty eagerly took one bite and moaned in delight at the peanut butter cookie taste. She then tried a potato and discovered they tasted like cheeseburgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Like, I'll take a few pounds of carrots, potatoes, cabbage and radishes.\" She requested. The woman smiled and prepared said request. Soon, Kitty had paid for them and was heading home while eating a cheeseburger potato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon returning to the mansion, Kitty placed the veggies in the kitchen and then grabbed a few carrots before heading up to her room and spent the rest of the day eating the cake flavored carrots as she read until dinnertime. Luckily, no one touched her veggies so they didn't notice the different tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty went to bed, feeling very happy. \"<i>Like, if these veggies'd come along when I totally first started eating them, I'd have enjoyed them right from the start</i>.\" she giggled to herself as she went happily to sleep.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Humming happily, she got dressed, her belly poking out from under her cream t-shirt, and went downstairs for breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, Jean, Kurt, Rogue and Spyke were already there, finishing up their breakfasts. \"Like, hey guys.\" Kitty smiled as she came into the dining room. The other X-Kids eyed Kitty's chubbier belly as she began getting her breakfast. She didn't even notice the stares until she sat down with her pancakes, bacon and toast. \"Like, why're you guys staring?\" She asked, her first forkful of food near her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kitty... I think you're putting on weight.\" Scott said, eying Kitty's noticeably chubby tummy. Kitty frowned at this. \"Like, no I'm not guys. I'm totally fine.\" she said as she stuffed the pancakes into her mouth. The others rose their eyebrows but didn't say anything farther about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Kitty went to watch TV in the rec room. As she watched cartoons, a commercial for the veggies began playing. At the end of it, she discovered that they offered discounts for students like her. Upon hearing this, she got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can, like, totally get even more of those yummy veggies since I'm a high school student. I'll bet I can, like, totally get twice as many as I did yesterday.</i>\" Kitty thought to herself excitedly as she kept watching her cartoons while thinking about all of this in her head.</span></div></div>",

Like, I totally came down here about the discount since I'm a student at Bayville High.\" Kitty explained with a smile. Lester smiled again. \"Of course, young lady. Come with me.\" He told Kitty. Kitty smiled and followed Lester into the factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was given a tour, Kitty couldn't help but feel happy about the whole thing. She'd never really enjoyed eating many veggies like turnips, cabbage and others, but now, with the junk food thing in them, they weren't so awful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the tour, Kitty's chubby belly rumbled quietly, letting the15-year-old know it was starting to become very hungry. Noticing that Lester had gone farther ahead to talk with an employee, Kitty headed for the next room of the tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, Kitty couldn't believe it. Inside was piles of carrots, turnips, potatoes, cabbages, lettuce, radishes, onions and even broccoli. \"Like, this is totally the best tour ever!\" She squealed in delight as she charged the pile of junk food flavored health foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a piece of broccoli, Kitty shoved it into her mouth and moaned in delight. It tasted just like a banana cream pie. Eagerly, she grabbed an onion and tried that, discovering it tasted exactly like a hot fudge sundae. The lettuce tasted like cupcakes, the turnips tasted like red velvet cake and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kitty had eaten several of each veggie and was considerably fatter. Letting out a stifled burp, Kitty heaved herself up and staggered out, having stuffed her pockets and her bag with as many of the veggies as they could hold, thankful Lester had ended the tour to talk with one of the other employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kitty got back to the mansion, she found Kurt, Rogue, Scott, Jean and Spyke in the living room. \"Kitty, where've you been?\" Asked Jean upon noticing her friend. \"Like, just out.\" Kitty answered quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* Kitty let out a massive fart that split her pants, showing off her pink underpants to the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Kitty blushed bright red as she quickly covered the large hole with her bag and raced to her bedroom before the team could say anything else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her belly was much bigger and rounder, hanging over the waistband of her pants, her arms, toes, feet, fingers, thighs, butt and boobs were also much softer and plumper and she had gained a double chin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had also finally noticed her weight gain after she stopped being able to fit into her clothes easily two days ago. Though intitally embarrassed, Kitty had ultimately accepted it. She had to admit she looked cute with her extra blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, she was eating some pie flavored broccoli and red velvet cake flavored turnips when Jean, Rogue, Amara and Tabitha came into the kitchen. \"Hey, guys.\" Kitty said with a smile. \"Hey, Kitty.\" Tabitha smiled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, would you guys totally like to try some these veggies? They're really good.\" Kitty offered with a smile. The other four girls shrugged and grabbed one. Jean took a carrot, Tabitha grabbed a big fat onion, Rogue took a fairly big potato and Amara took a piece of broccoli respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha was the first one to take a bite of her veggie. Upon tasting the hot fudge sundae flavoring, she moaned in delight. \"It tastes just like a hot fudge sundae!\" She moaned through her bulging cheeks as she began wolfing the rest of it down and grabbing another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, meanwhile, bit into her carrot and nearly wept in delight at the chocolate cake flavoring of the carrot. \"Chocolate cake! Just like my mom makes!\" She groaned as she crammed the carrot into her mouth and grabbed two more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue and Amara, meanwhile, both gave equal sounds of delight at their respective veggie's junk food flavorings. With that, the four girls began eagerly scarfing down the piles of carrots, onions, potatoes and broccoli as Kitty watched, having already eaten her fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched them do so, Kitty noticed the four starting to visibly put on weight, their normally trim tummies slowly turning pudgy and poking out from under their shirts while their boobs, butts, thighs, hips, feet, toes, arms, hands and finger began swelling up as well. Kitty thought about telling her friends about their WG, but decided against it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the now noticeably chubbier girls finished licking their plates clean and burped in unison, big grins on their faces. \"Those were the best veggies we've ever had!\" Amara smiled as she rubbed her potbelly obliviously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, why don't we totally have a movie night?\" Kitty offered. The others agreed and they went to change into their jammies while Kitty prepared more of the junk food veggies for their movie night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night was spent by the girls eating themselves sick on the veggies and putting on more weight with each one consumed. </span></div></div>",

They had, like Kitty, begun putting on a large amount of weight as a result. Despite this, they remained oblivious of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUuuugggghhh!! C'mon! Fit would ya?!?\" Rogue groaned as she struggled to pull her leggings all the way up her plumper booty. Finally, she managed to inch them up enough that her butt was completely covered. She then struggled to pull up her skirt somewhat but managed to pull it up as well before sitting on her bed, wheezing and gasping heavily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just her leggings or skirt either. Her black sleeveless top and green see through shirt were both rather tight on her noticeably fatter body, her belly being visible under the latter one. She had grown considerably over the last three weeks of junk food veggies. Her face was doughy and had a double chin, her arms and legs were plump and squishy looking, her hands and feet were fatter and her fingers and toes were all swollen as well. Add that with her softer and squishier boobs and hippo butt and thighs, and you had an obese Rogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping her sweaty brow, Rogue heaved herself up and started to the kitchen. \"<i>Ah wonder if the others're havin' trouble with their clothes too</i>.\" She wondered as she slowly walked to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Jean's room, \"Oh come on, pants! You just gotta fit!\" Jean was pleading to her light purple pants as she struggled to button them up. Like Rogue, Jean was much larger than before. Her face was round and doughy looking with a double chin, her arms, butt, feet, legs, boobs, belly, hips and thighs were all fat as well. Her yellow sweater could barely fit over her plump middle and it hung over the waistband of her pants. Finally, wheezing and gasping like Rogue had been, Jean managed to button her pants before going downstairs as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room, Kitty yawned and rolled out of bed, her massive belly rumbling and gurgling for those yummy veggies. \"Like, I totally hope the others've save me some. They've totally been pigging out on them lately.\" Kitty smiled as she tugged on her tight blue pants, cream t-shirt and pink sweater, her belly bulging under the latter two and hanging over the waistband of the former. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got downstairs, Kitty saw Tabitha, Amara, Jean and Rogue all ready downstairs. Kitty couldn't believe how big the four had become over the last three weeks. They all looked like they'd been blown up by giant pumps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha's big gut hung over the waistband of her unbuttoned pants while her double chins wobbled as she ate her massive pile of junk veggies contentedly. Amara, meanwhile, was toasting some of hers with her powers before eating them. She and Tabby looked like giant boulders due to how round shaped they were. Rogue and Jean, meanwhile, looked like oddly rounded out pears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, hey guys.\" Kitty smiled gently as she came in. \"Mmmph. 'Ey 'Itty.\" Mumbled Tabitha through a very big mouthful of cheeseburger potatoes. \"Anyone else notice their clothes're tighter than normal?\" asked Amara as she nodded to her own very tight looking clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But Ah think they probably shrunk in the wash.\" Rogue shrugged as she shoveled a handful of red velvet cake flavored turnips into her mouth. The others, except Kitty, nodded in agreement. Kitty didn't know why, but she still felt like she shouldn't say anything to her friends about their new chunky appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we'd better go clothes shopping today.\" Jean said in agreement before cramming six carrots into her maw at once, chewing loudly and nosily. The other girls agreed and soon had squeezed into Jean's SUV and were heading to the Bayville Mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the five girls were in a plus sized store, buying up extra large t-shirts and stretchy sweatpants before heading home and eating more and more of the veggies. Kitty decided, as she pigged out with them, that she should probably take the girls to the factory tomorrow and find out what was going on.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My name's Brooke Yeung. I'm the creator of the veggies.\" she smiled to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Kitty Pryde. Like, that's Jean Grey, Tabitha Smith, Amara Aquilla and Rogue. We've been eating the veggies for the last four weeks now and, as you can, like, totally see, we've bloated up a bit.\" Kitty smiled, nodding to herself and the other four plump girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. We've been getting quite a few calls about the veggies' side effects for some time now and we think we may finally have the reason.\" Brooke said to them. \"What is it?\" Tabitha asked as she loudly crunched on a cake flavored carrot while scratching her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems we made a slight error in making the junk food flavoring. It does work in making the veggies taste like the junk food in the spray, but the chemicals remove all the nutrition from the veggie, thus making them more addictive and causing weight gain in a matter of hours.\" Brooke explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't notice until now?\" Rogue asked as she shoved a massive handful of turnips into her own mouth. \"We honestly thought they were ready for distribution. We didn't catch on until concerned parents began calling us to reveal their kids were bloating up and eating more than usual.\" Brooke confessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So like, how long does the addiction last?\" Kitty asked as she munched on a cheeseburger potato. \"We've discovered the addiction only lasts for a few weeks. Unfortunately, the bloating doesn't go away, nor does the person's increased appetite.\" Brooke answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we'll recover from the addictions but not our bigger appetite or bloating?\" Jean asked as she loudly scarfed down a large piece of broccoli. \"I'm afraid so. I'm sure the bloating will go down if you exercise but the appetite will remain forever.\" Brooke confirmed in sympathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, the girls were relaxing at the mansion. They had stopped eating the veggies and gotten rid of them. Brooke was right. Aside from their bloated appearances and massive appetites, things had returned to normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit, this is kinda nice.\" Jean smiled as she, Kitty, Rogue Tabitha and Amara pigged out on their massive lunch, consisting of PB&amp;J sandwiches, cake, pie, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, hot dogs and other junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally. And like, the others are totally cool with it.\" Kitty smiled as she inhaled a massive PB&amp;J sandwich a second later, burping loudly after doing so. She was right. the other X-Kids and New Recruits were perfectly fine with the five girls' new weights and appetites, as were Professor X, Storm, Beast and even Wolverine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Rogue had just entered her and Kitty's room when she noticed a large box under Kitty's bed. \"What the heck?\" She wondered as she pulled it out and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe southern goth couldn't believe it. Inside were very familiar looking carrots, potatoes, lettuce, turnips, broccoli and other junk food flavored veggies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the box, Rogue went downstairs with it and went to the living room, where Kitty, Jean, Tabitha and Amara were all lounging, rubbing and playing with their massive tummies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Rogue holding her box, Kitty's face filled with alarm. \"Like, where'd you find that?!?!?\" She yelped in alarm. \"Under yo' bed, sugar. Ya left part of it stickin' out.\" Rogue replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in it?\" Tabitha asked as she sat up on the couch she was laying on with some difficulty, wheezing slightly as she managed to do so after two tries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turns out Kitty here's been smugglin' those veggies under her bed.\" Rogue replied as she showed the contents to Jean and the others, Kitty blushing very brightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty...\" began Jean slowly. \"I know, I know! Like, I was totally gonna throw them out but then I tasted one turnip and I couldn't do it! You guys know I've, like, totally never been crazy about most veggies since I was in diapers!\" Kitty confessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty... it's okay. You were the first one of us to taste these so it's understandable that your addiction isn't completely gone yet.\" Jean said assuredly as the others, even Rogue, nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Kitty's addiction did leave her completely two days later and left her free to enjoy her other massive meals with her friends as they got bigger and heavier.</span></div></div>",

The Professor said it could be dangerous here so just take things slowly.\" Scott Summers, alias Cyclops, said to teammates Jean Grey, Kurt Wagner, Rogue, Spyke and Shadowcat. Professor X had sent the six teenagers to the castle as Cerebro had apparently detected a mutant signature there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be okay, Scott,\" said Jean assuredly as they entered the huge, fairly creepy looking castle. It was old and rather dirty. It looked like no one'd been there in a very, very, very long time as a result. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll cover more ground if we split up.\" Scott decided after a moment. \"I'll take those two hallways. Rogue, you go and cover the third and fourth hallways. Nightcrawler, you and Spyke take upstairs while Jean comes with me.\" He ordered a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what about me, Scott?\" Kitty asked him. \"You can take the downstairs,\" Scott decided. \"We'll meet back here in two hours.\" He added as he and Jean set off down the first hallway's corner, Rogue took the third while Kurt and Evan teleported upstairs, leaving Kitty by her lonesome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 15-year-old mutant gulped nervously. She'd always been somewhat jumpy about creepy places and things and this was definitely one of the most frightening places she's ever seen or been in yet. Everything looked dark and very spooky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty was so scared, she felt like she was gonna barf, cry, scream, poop and wet her uniform all at once as she kept looking around in fright. She thought it this castle looked like something out of an old horror movie she'd seen with Rogue, Kurt and Evan. She'd been so scared afterwards, she couldn't sleep for a week unless she used a night light or, if she was really freaked out, Rogue had allowed her to sleep with her, which'd surprised Kitty due to Rogue's often grouchy and/or aloof personality.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the movie had also resulted in Kitty being the butt of numerous pranks by Kurt and Spyke as a result until Logan intervened after a prank involving Kurt and Spyke dressed as the movie's monsters made Kitty wet and mess herself in front of the other students and faint. The duo ended up with two months probation and had to clean the vehicles owned by the X-Men twice during that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Kitty was ready to be brave. Sure, she'd led a sheltered life with her parents before coming to the X-Men a year ago, but she was willing to help this new mutant if it was possible. She also know that if she stayed put or hid in the X-Van for the next hour or so, she'd never hear the end of it from Kurt and Evan when they and the others found out should she do one or the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, there's n-n-nothing to t-t-t-totally b-b-b-be scared a-a-a-about, Kitty. G-g-g-get a grip.\" she told herself nervously, stammering as she did. \"<i>Like, it's totally now or never.</i>\" She thought to herself as she eyed the grandfather clock nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, taking a deep breath, Kitty dove into the floor, using her mutant powers to phase through the stone flooring to the downstairs level.</span></div></div>",

As she looked around, she was very surprised by the lab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the castle's age, everything here was brand new. Bright lights filled the room, showing off new lab equipment, beakers, microscopes and the like. Despite the creepy castle, it didn't look like a mad scientist's lab at all. This place looked like a normal science or chemistry class and had a nice, almost cozy atmosphere around it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, total freaky-ness.\" Kitty whispered in amazement as she kept looking around the large room at all the amazing looking chemicals and projects.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear that someone had either been there recently or was still there. Liquids were bubbling and in some cases, frothing in several beakers over still turned on burners, a nearby computer was still on (but on the screensaver), the lights were still on and a half drank cup of water was on a table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked towards the computer, Kitty noticed a large pink potion bubbling and somewhat gurgling nearby. Aside from the friendly coloring, it smelled heavenly. \"Like, what's this?\" Kitty asked as she slowly approached it nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kitty did so, the smell grew stronger. Kitty now realized it smelled like melted chocolate and other yummy smells like freshly baked cookies, brownies and other desserts mixed into one doozy of a wonderful smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Kitty's tummy grumbled with hunger. Blushing, she put her hand on it. \"Like, I totally knew I shouldn't have skipped lunch, but Scott totally hurried us out here before I could even grab an apple.\" She sighed in dismay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around carefully. If Scott or the others were here, they'd likely urge her to reconsider what she was thinking of doing right now. But the potion did look and smell very tasty. Surely, if she took an itsy, witsy sip, it wouldn't hurt, would it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I'm totally sure a sip wouldn't hurt.\" Kitty smiled as she carefully lifted the beaker up and bought it to her lips. Slowly, the small stream of pink liquid flowed over her lips onto her tongue and taste buds. It smelled like chocolate but tasted like fresh apple pie going down her throat. Kitty let a little more pour in before gently removing the beaker from her lips, running her tongue over her lips in case some of the potion had stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!, Like this stuff totally tastes...\"</span></div></div>",

Like what's-\" Then, her cheeks swelled up to the size of beachballs and then, *UUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!!*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty let out a ginormous burp that shook the walls and tables. \"Woah! Like, excuse me!\" she blushed in understandable embarrassment. But, despite the humiliation from that big burp, Kitty realized that she also felt... happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, why am I totally happy about it?\" Kitty wondered in surprise. Then, *GGGRRROOWWWWLLLL!!!!!* Her belly let out another growl. \"Oh no! Like, now wha-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!* This time, Kitty let out a giant, smelly fart. Now, instead of being embarrassed, she actually laughed. \"Wow! Like, that was kinda totally cool!\" she giggled as she waved her hand behind her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, Kitty picked the empty beaker up again and noticed a label on it \"Like, '<i>Tiana Mobley's Secret Dessert Sauce. Just one drop and you can have whatever dessert for dinner you please with the appearance of your healthful food'!</i>\" She read aloud, her eyebrows raising in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I don't know any kid or teen who'd totally want the ability to do that!\" Kitty smirked as she pocketed the beaker, promising to have Beast, Professor X or even the new mutant (who Kitty strongly suspected of making this potion) test it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty then set off, not noticing that there was a small label on the beaker that had this notice on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid label read: \"'<i>Caution: Not to be consumed by females with the 'X' gene. Will cause brief period of increased appetite, burping, farting, body odor, pooping and other forms of slobbiness while consuming fattening and/or greasy foods until sauce wears off'.</i>\"</span></div></div>",

L-Like what's-NNNNN-happening?!?!?\" Kitty wailed as she found herself started to fart up a storm, more smellier and nosier poots than she had unleashed yet since she'd started doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPOOOOOOTTTTT* *FRRRRAAAPPPPPPP* *BLARRRRAAAPPPPPP!!!* Kitty doubled over in agony, clutching her large tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith more giant and smelly farts and a few grunts of pain, Kitty felt a very big, hot and stinky pile of poop enter her pants. The load bulged the seat of her pants and made them sag. \"Like I totally just *UUURRRPPP!!!* pooped my uniform!\" she shrieked in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBLOOOORRRRRRCCCCHHHH!!!!!* Another load of poo entered her pants, making them bulge and sag more. Kitty just stared at her lumpy pants in dismay and embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what's *BBBURRRPPPP!!!* happening *PPPPPPOOOOTTTTTT!!!* to me?!?!?!?\" She asked as she scratched her armpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty knew she needed to try and find Scott and the others and get help for her new slobby urges, but the remaining food called out to her, just waiting to be eaten. Kitty tried to fight it, but the urge to eat more and fill her fat, yet still feeling empty tummy was too much for the 15-year-old mutant to bear. </span></div></div>",

The two hours had lapsed and they hadn't found the new mutant they'd been looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Kitty?\" asked Scott as he realized their youngest teammate wasn't with them. \"Maybe she got lost or something.\" Kurt offered with concern. Despite his teasing of Kitty, he really considered her his friend and they did have fun together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try to pick up her thoughts.\" Jean said after a moment. She put her hands to her head and began to concentrate. \"<i>Kitty? Kitty, where are you? It's Jean. Let me know if you can hear my voice</i>.\" She said telepathically. Everybody waited a few minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, \"<i>Jean? *UUURRRRPPPP!!!* Excuse me. Like, I'm okay. I'm in the downstairs basement kitchen. *BBBUURRRAAAPPP!!* Like, there's totally something wrong though. I, like, totally need you guys to *BEEEELLLLLCCCCHHHH!!!!* come down and see for your selves</i>!!!\" Kitty's response told Jean a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Jean?\" Spyke asked. \"Kitty's downstairs in the kitchen. She sounded a little freaked out though. We'd better get down there.\" replied Jean seriously as the five hurried to the nearby staircase leading to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd only gone down a few steps when Rogue froze. \"Pee-yew! What the heck died down here?!?!?\" She asked, pinching her nose as a very terrible odor hit it. \"Oh man! I smell it too, Rogue. It reeks here!\" Spyke groaned as he quickly held his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mein gott! And you guys zink my smoke during teleportation smells awful!\" Kurt agreed, blocking his nose as the poopy and body odor combined stench hit his nose as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming from the kitchen.\" Scott said, blocking his nose and mouth as well. The five bravely raced in. What they saw, they couldn't believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was Kitty, scarfing down greasy, fattening foods like a pig. She nosily gobbled down Twinkies, chewing with her mouth open while scratching her armpits before grabbing two burgers and inhaling those, smearing ketchup, mustard and grease on her already sweat covered and food stained uniform. \"Ah think we just found what's makin' that smell.\" Rogue said in shock as Kitty burped loudly before farting with a giggle as she kept eating, burping, farting, pooping and sweating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-Kids couldn't believe it. Kitty was always so neat, tidy, polite and clean. Now, she was a complete slob. None of them spoke as they watched Kitty finally reached the final part of her messily eaten meal: a massive banana split with chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, blue moon, peanut butte and mint chip flavored ice cream, three bananas, a massive amount of hot fudge and whipped cream and a cherry on top by eating with her face like a dog. Finally, Kitty loudly lapped up the last of the melted ice cream and leaned back in her poop filled pants, rubbing her very big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP !!!!!!!* She let out the biggest burp yet. \"K-Kitty? Is that you?\" Jean stammered slowly. Hearing this, Kitty turned her now chubby head. Upon seeing her friends, her eyes widened in humiliation and horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys! *BBUURRRRPPPPP!!!* Like, I'm so sorry you *PPPPOOOORRRRTTTTTTT!!!* gotta see me like *OOOOORRRRPP!!!* this! I've become a *UUUURRRRRAAAAPPPPPP!!!* total slob! I can't control myself!\" She sobbed, burying her greasy, sweaty face into her hands, letting out another giant fart in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitty, it's okay. What happened?\" Scott replied slowly as he bravely approached the younger girl. Kitty looked up, let out a small hiccup and began to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I phased into the basement to look for the new mutant and I found this laboratory. I noticed a pink potion and I drank it, thinking it was okay. Then, I, like totally began burping a lot. I got hungry so I came here and after I started eating the fried chicken and cake, I also started farting a ton. But it felt... good to let myself go like that. Then, I drank a bottle of orange soda and... I, like, totally began pooping my pants and losing my manners as you guys just saw.\" Kitty explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have the beaker the potion came in?\" Jean asked. Kitty nodded and, with some difficulty, pulled it out of her belt. Jean took the beaker and found the caution sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know why you're a slob, Kitty. This thing apparently causes any girl with the \"X\"-Gene to become a slob for a brief time until this sauce wears off.\" She explained. \"Like, I totally didn't notice that label.\" Kitty admitted sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Kit. We just gotta get ya back ta normal. 'Cause, Ah dunno 'bout anyone else, but Ah ain't exactly eager to ride home with your poopy pants stinkin' up the X-Van.\" Rogue smirked teasingly. Kitty just stuck her tongue out at Rogue and grinned back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Professor said Tiana was the new mutant's name. She may've created this sauce.\" Jean said as she read the main label. \"But where is she?\" Scott asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here.\" said a new voice. The six teenagers turned and saw a girl, not much older than Jean and Scott, with black hair in a ponytail and brown eyes. She was tan skinned and fairly good looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiana Mobley?\" Jean guessed. \"That's me, ma'am.\" Tiana smiled kindly. \"We're the X-Men. As you can see, our friend drank your sauce and is suffering the side effects from it since we're mutants like you. Can you help us?\" Scott asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana looked at Kitty in sympathy as the 15-year-old let out a squeaky fart and picked her nose. \"Yeah. I can.\" Tiana smiled as she came over.</span></div></div>",

I also have some super strength, agility and speed.\" Tiana replied as she put the antidote over a burner to cook. \"I gotta say, Tiana. You really seem to know your way around chemicals and things.\" Jean replied, clearly impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooking's a lot like chemistry and I've always loved both, even before I became a mutant.\" Tiana smiled as she faced them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's with this crazy sauce ya've been trying to make?\" Rogue asked as Kitty (who's slobbiness had slowed down to a crawl by now), merely picked her nose again and ate the mucus she'd gotten from it before scratching her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The idea is that if your younger kids, cousins or siblings refuses to eat their fruits and veggies at meals, just slip a little of the sauce on and they taste exactly like their favorite desserts. Problem solved.\" Tiana explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But something went wrong when you tried it out on yourself?\" guessed Kurt. \"Yep. First time I tried it, I ended up like Kitty for five hours. Luckily though, I'd anticipated this and had created the serum I'm rebrewing now.\" She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think if I either have help with the next batch or work more on it, I can perfect it so it'll be safe enough for everybody to use it, including us mutant girls.\" Tiana added with a confident smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it does work in the tasting like your favorite dessert area.\" Kitty grinned. \"Why was all that food out earlier?\" Spyke asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you guys were coming when your Professor contacted me telepathically and I decided to whip up a quick snack for you once we'd met.\" Tiana explained as she carefully removed the new beaker from the burner as the potion was now ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Kitty. Drink this. Since I've been experimenting with both formulas, I engineered this one to help slim you down a bit quicker. You'll still be a bit bloated and hungry, but it won't be as bad as before.\" She said to Shadowcat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty slowly took the potion and slowly took a sip. \"YUCK! Like, it totally tastes like boiled cabbage and brussel sprouts!\" She groaned, sticking her tongue out in disgust. But she nevertheless took a deep breath, plugged her nose and gulped the rest of the antidote down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Kitty felt herself slowly shrinking back to her normal size. The pit stains vanished from her uniform, her face cleared up the grease and sweat that had been on it and even her uniform pants and panties became clean again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, a normal, though still fat, Kitty stood before the team with a wide grin. \"Like, it totally worked!\" Kitty squealed in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Tiana.\" Scott smiled as they shook hands. \"Do you want to come with us to meet Professor X?\" Jean asked. Tiana was quiet for a moment. Then, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" She beamed as she joined the six teenagers in leaving the castle that had been her home for the last month since she came to Bayville to make her fortune with her sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, things worked out in the end. Tiana, with help from Beast, managed to perfect the sauce and began selling it to different stores. Within two months, she had made enough money to start her own company and she decided to do so, having stayed at the institute during that time to get better control of her super strength, agility and speed abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the X-Kids (especially Kitty) were sad to see her go as they had became close friends with her (and also enjoyed her cooking), they still saw her on weekends and Tiana often sent them homemade cookies, cakes or other foods every two weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, most of the X-Kids often had to keep their halves safe from Kitty, who still retained her new big appetite. In addition, Kitty had also decided to wear and use thick diapers in case she needed to go to the bathroom during meals or snacks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it somewhat surprised the X-Kids at first, they ultimately accepted this change in Kitty's lifestyle and supported her as they knew she was happy being fat and diapered.</span></div></div>",

Popular' all the time!\" Jean was saying in annoyance. \"Well ya definitely act like ya are, sugar! Straight As, captain of the girls soccer team and everybody gushes over you!\" Rogue replied in annoyance, arms crossed and a frown on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean just stood there fuming. \"Face it, Jean. You're so popular, Ah think ya couldn't keep your popularity if ya became a fat slob!\" Rogue added. Jean went redder than ever at the snarky remark. \"Oh yeah? Well, I'll prove to you I can be a fat slob and keep my interests and friends outside of the institute!\" She spat and stormed off to her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night at dinner, Jean came down to find they were having fried chicken, corn on the cob and biscuits. She started to eat her first piece of chicken neatly, but upon seeing Rogue smirking at this, Jean dropped her fork and began loudly eating her massive drumstick with her hands, getting grease and sauce on her hands, lips and face. None of the others said a word as they watched Jean chewing her chicken loudly while also smacking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her chicken, Jean tore into the corn like a shark, sending pieces of it flying as she tore through each cob, smearing butter onto her face as well before grabbing a big fat biscuit and plopping it into her mouth as well while chewing loudly with her mouth open, leaving her friends (except Rogue) in shock and slight disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Jean? Are you okay?\" Scott asked her. Jean looked at him for a moment, sauce and butter smeared around her face and on her cheeks. Then, *UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* She belched loudly, rubbing her full stomach. \"Yeah. I'm fine Scott. I just got a little hungry tonight.\" she explained quickly. After that, Jean got up and quickly left the room. The others shrugged and went back to their conversations except for Rogue, who smirked to herself. \"<i>This is gonna be fun, seein' if Jean really can keep this up. She'll be friendless in a week</i>.\" She thought as she finished her dinner and then went to her and Kitty's bedroom to relax. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rogue was wrong when she thought Jean wouldn't keep up her slobbiness at Bayville High. During her classes, Jean stuffed herself with candy bars she had sneaked out from the mansion, making sure to smear them on her face and sweater, chewing loudly as she sat in class, occasionally farting audibly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of Jean's peers and teachers were shocked by Jean's sudden change in personality overnight. Yesterday, she wouldn't've done something like this but now, she seemed like she didn't care anymore. Luckily for Jean, since this was the first time she'd done this, the teachers mainly let it slide aside from a few dirty looks whenever Jean burped or farted loudly while the students merely smirked in amusement at their friend or classmate's antics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunch, Jean went to the lunch line, licking her lips eagerly. When it was her turn, she smiled at the lunch ladies. \"Fill 'er up!\" she smiled, pointing to her tray. A lunch lady went for a plate, but Jean merely shook her head. \"No plate! Just fill it up please!\" Jean stated firmly. With that, the lunch ladies set to work, piling sub sandwiches, doughnuts, cake, pie, cookies, pizza, burgers and other cafeteria food onto her tray. Once they were done, Jean smiled and walked towards Scott, Kitty, Kurt and Rogue's table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends couldn't believe what they were seeing as Jean came up with her massively close to overflowing tray. \"Jean! Like, what're you doing with all that food?!?!?\" Kitty asked in shock. \"I'm just really hungry today, Kitty.\" Jean smiled as she sat down. \"Jean, that amount of food is meant for the Blob, not you!\" Kurt said in equal disbelief. Jean then had an idea as she looked at Rogue and smirked. Rogue knew right away what was gonna happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean turned towards the Brotherhood's table where Fred \"the Blob\" Dukes was sitting with Toad, Quicksilver and Avalanche. \"Hey, Blob!\" she shouted, causing the four to look up in surprise and then fury upon seeing Jean was the one addressing them. \"Whadda ya want, Grey?\" Blob asked, having just begun on his own massive tray of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet I can eat more than you before lunch is over!\" Jean shouted. At that, the whole cafeteria went as silent as a graveyard. No one had ever challenged Fred to an eating contest since he'd arrived and they all saw how much he can eat. And now, here was Jean Grey, captain of the soccer team, challenging him. You could tell the Brotherhood was just as shocked as the X-Kids and their other peers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you're too chicken to do it.\" Jean added calmly. Fred's face went back from surprised to fury. \"Oh yeah?!?!? You're on, Miss. Popular!\" He snarled as he stomped over to the X-Kids' table with his tray. Scott and the others stood up as the rest of the student body present gathered around to watch the contest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who'll time us?\" Jean asked. Scott rose his hand as he set his watch to it's stopwatch feature. \"On your mark... get set... GO!!!\" he shouted. With that, Blob and Jean plowed into their heaps of food. Jean quickly shoved a triple cheeseburger into her mouth and swallowed it whole, though with some difficulty before cramming two giant handfuls of cookies into her mouth, smearing crumbs and chocolate around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, it became clear that although Blob was pretty good, Jean, despite this being her first time, was equally, if not better, to him. Several of the other students started taking bets on who would win while others all cheered their respective choices on, the X-Kids obviously rooting for Jean while the Brotherhood boys cheered Fred on. Finally, to everybody's shock, Fred dropped his last piece of pie, looking queasy as Jean victoriously plopped the last cake slice into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Jean wins!\" Scott shouted as the X-Kids (excluding Rogue) and Jean's other supporters whooped and cheered as Jean panted and leaned back in relief, her belly swollen to the size of a watermelon and her face and sweater covered in grease, sugar, frosting, ketchup, mustard, tomato sauce and other foods. To everybody's great shock, Fred then offered a large hand to Jean, who looked at him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Jean.\" He smiled as Jean slowly shook his hand with a grin of her own. \"Thanks. Almost thought I was gonna loose there.\" she replied. \"We should do this again sometime.\" Fred grinned as he stood up and went off to his next period with the Brotherhood boys following, all of them wearing impressed expressions on their faces as they looked at Jean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, Jean! That was, like, totally incredible!\" Kitty gushed as she hugged her friend. \"Ja. You actually defeated the Blob at his own game!\" Kurt agreed. \"That was wicked, Jean!\" agreed soccer teammate Taryn. \"Thanks, Taryn.\" Jean smiled as the group set off for their last few classes of the day, with Jean burping and farting during most of them.</span></div></div>",

During that, she had grown bigger as her belly hung over her pants' waistbands and she could only see the tips of her toes over it. Her face was also rounder and chubbier while her fingers, arms, hands, feet, toes, boobs and butt were all considerably plumper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also barely changed her clothes so they were often stained with food, pit stains and sweat. She also had some acne but otherwise still looked fairly pretty. In addition to this, Jean also took to picking her nose, scratching her butt and armpits in public and ditching her table manners completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Kitty and Rogue were also growing fatter. Though they were still smaller than Jean, Kitty was the biggest out of the duo as she was the most willing to be a slob. Her belly bounced and jiggled with each step, as did her swollen boobs and butt. Her face was gaining a double chin and was noticeably rounder. Her own clothes were often stained with food and sweat and her own table manners went out the window in a meal as she often ate like a pig alongside Jean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue was also noticeably fatter but still smaller than Kitty and especially Jean. Her body was fairly softer looking, mainly going to her tummy, which pooched out, nearly hanging over her waistband. She also burped and farted in public while also picking her nose and scratching her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Jean had called her pupils to the kitchen where a massive collection of soda was awaiting them. \"Like, what's this, Jean?\" Kitty asked before farting loudly, causing Rogue to roll her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are gonna compete in a belching contest as your final test in my slob class.\" Jean replied, picking her nose and then wiping the mucus off on her sweater. Kitty grinned and nodded eagerly. Rogue sighed and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two girls were sitting in front of their soda. Kitty went first, guzzling a massive Sprite bottle at top speed. Then, *BBBBBBUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!* She burped loudly into Rogue's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue frowned even more at that. She grabbed an orange soda and chugged it down. Her belly rumbled and gurgled for a moment and then she opened her mouth as she felt the gas racing up her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPP!!!!* Rogue belched loudly into Kitty's face, blowing the younger girl's ponytail and hair back. Kitty frowned at the bigger and louder burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it is so totally on now!\" She said as she grabbed a root beer and loudly guzzled it, her belly swelling up like a balloon. Then, her cheeks bulged out as her tummy bulged out due to the soda currently inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEELLL LLLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHH!!!!* Kitty's burp trounced Rogue's quite a bit. At this, the southern goth snarled in fury as Kitty smirked at her while calmly scratching her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, Kitty and Rogue guzzling soda after soda, their tummies swelling up more and more while their burps became bigger and louder than the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!! *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, there was only one last soda left for each of them. Rogue grabbed hers, which was a Mountain Dew and loudly gulped it down in massive chugs. Upon finishing it, her belly rumbled and burbled. Then, her cheeks puffed up like balloons and she opened her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer burp was very impressive, even Kitty had to admit that much. Rogue smirked as she calmly dug a finger in her ear. \"Your turn, sugar.\" she told Kitty. The younger girl gulped nervously before she gulped down her final Dr. Pepper. Then, her belly rumbled, gurgled, jiggled and bounced as she felt the gas building in her. Slowly, her cheeks puffed up and then she timidly opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPP!!!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty's burp shook the whole kitchen and sent Rogue and Jean on their butts. Now the whole room stunk like everything the two girls had eaten that day. \"Like, I won!\" Kitty squealed as Jean high fived her. Rogue just glared at Kitty. Then, before she or Jean knew what was happening, Kitty found herself underneath Rogue's chubbier butt on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya asked for this, Kit!\" Rogue said as she grunted and strained hard in concentration. Kitty felt Rogue's butt jiggling and wiggling on top of her. Then, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!* Rogue let out a massive fart in Kitty's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that was totally cool, Rogue!\" Kitty squealed as Jean nodded her agreement. \"You both have become big burpers and farters so far.\" Jean smiled at her two friends as they went to go watch TV before their large dinners, Kitty and Rogue trading burps and farts with each other and Jean the whole time.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Next morning found Jean waking up and going downstairs for breakfast, clad in only her blue pajama shirt, which stretched out over her massive tummy. She felt better after a good night's sleep and was determined to keep slobbing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just about to enter the kitchen/dining room, when she saw a sight that made her gasp silently. There was Kitty and Storm, farting up a storm as Rogue watched while loudly and messily gobbling down her massive breakfast. Kitty and Rogue were also in their respective PJs: Kitty in a pink t-shirt and shorts and Rogue in long sleeved green and orange ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTT TTTTTT!!* Kitty let out a giant fart as she smiled at Storm. \"Like, top that!\" She giggled as she scratched her armpit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStorm, to Jean's shock, actually smirked back at Kitty and began straining and grunting slightly. Then, *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTT TT!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big poot escaped Storm's butt, slightly longer than Kitty's. The 15-year-old mutant frowned in annoyance. \"Oh yeah? Well, like, smell on this!\" She said began really grunting and straining. Her face turned bright red as she squatted more and more, almost sitting on the floor. Then, it happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LLLLLLLLCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!* Kitty's final fart shook the kitchen and nearly knocked Ororo, Jean and Rogue flat. \"I win!\" Kitty giggled as she picked her nose and rubbed the mucus off on her tight t-shirt with a burp. \"Good match, Kitty.\" Storm smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean came up to Kitty as the latter grabbed a big banana cream pie and began eating it very sloppily. \"Kitty... why were you and Ororo having a farting contest?\" Jean asked. Kitty, face covered with whipped cream and pie, looked up with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it was totally Ororo's idea. She was serving me and Rogue our breakfast and I, like, totally happened to let out a small fart and then she let out a bigger one and suggested we totally have a farting contest.\" Kitty explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you said Jean: '<i>gas is your friend</i>'.\" She pointed out before putting the empty pie tin in the trashcan after licking it clean. *UUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* She let out a big belch into Jean's face, blowing the redhead's hair back slightly before heading off to laze around the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean didn't say a word as she went up to Ororo, who was serving Rogue a second platter of doughnuts, which Rogue immediately began scarfing down at top speed, getting frosting, jam, glaze and cream filling over her face while chewing loudly and with her mouth wide open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Storm?\" She asked. \"Yes, Jean?\" Storm smiled as she began preparing Jean's own mammoth sized breakfast. \"Is what Kitty said about how your farting contest began true?\" Jean asked. Storm, in the middle of placing a stack of pancakes on Jean's tray, was quiet for a moment and then nodded. \"Yes. It is. And besides, honestly, it is such a relief to let go every once and a while.\" She admitted with a smile, handing Jean her tray of pancakes, doughnuts, eclairs, eggs, bread and bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean didn't say anything as she began eating her massive meal. Inside, she was worrying this whole thing could spiral out of control if they weren't careful. Kitty and Rogue, she was okay with... maybe even some of the female NRs, but if Storm began letting herself go, then they might have a problem. She tried to push it out of her mind as she kept shoveling her food into her tummy with Rogue. </span></div></div>",

Despite having only recently started slobbing out with her, Kitty and Rogue, the younger duo were surpassing her original efforts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Jean made a decision. \"<i>If I wanna keep my place as top slob, I'm gonna need to redouble my efforts. I don't wanna be immobile, I just wanna avoid being surpassed</i>.\" She told herself as she watched Boom-Boom cram six massive cinnamon rolls into her mouth at one, smearing globs of frosting on her face as she loudly chewed with her mouth open, already developing a potbelly alongside Amara, who was gobbling down a massive five layer chocolate cake by burying her face into it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon, Storm whipped up a massive greasy, fattening feast for Jean, Kitty, Rogue, Amara, Tabitha and herself. It contained hamburgers, fries, hot dogs, corn dogs, pizza, onion rings, cakes and pies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Jean grabbed three of the large hamburgers and stuffed them into her mouth, bulging her cheeks out considerably.  Swallowing the massive amount of food in her mouth, she then crammed two massive handfuls of fries and corn dogs into her gullet as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up as she chewed loudly and with an open mouth, she noticed Kitty, Rogue, Amara, Tabitha and Ororo all watching her in shock, their own food filled mouths hanging open. \"Wha's 'rong?\" she asked around her large mouthful of food.  \"Um, nothing Jean.\" Kitty said quickly as she crammed two ketchup, mustard, mayo, chili and cheese covered hot dogs into her mouth, smearing said condiments on her cheeks, chin and lips as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others didn't say anything as they went back to eating sloppily as well. Jean shrugged and kept up her massive stuffing, despite her bloated tummy rumbling in protest at how fast Jean was forcing the food down into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the lunch was done and all six X-Ladies were feeling very stuffed and full from the huge lunch. Then, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPP PPPPPPPPPP!!!* Jean belched very loudly and noisily. \"Woah, Jean! Like, that burp was totally awesome!\" Kitty squealed as she licked her food covered fingers clean while patting her own boulder belly with the other one (having already licked that one clean). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Jean smiled as she scratched her armpit and then farted equally loudly before managing to stand up and, with a slight waddle, headed for her room. As she flopped onto her bed, she sighed in delight that so far, her extra effort seemed to be paying off.</span></div></div>",

When the five X-Ladies reached said room, they found the dining room table covered with numerous large soda bottles. \"Like, what's all this, Jean?\" asked Kitty as she picked her nose before farting loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I figured I'd challenge you guys to a burping contest.\" Jean explained with a smile. \"Cool. I've been wanting to try and face you since I heard about Kitty an' Rogue's burp-off the other day.\" Tabby smiled as she scratched her butt very obviously. \"I don't know, Jean.\" Amara said anxiously as she picked her bellybutton. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, 'Mara. It'll be awesome.\" Tabitha smiled as even Storm smiled encouragingly. Amara sighed, but then nodded as she sat down with the others. Once they did, Jean grinned at her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark...  get set... CHUG!\" She yelled as she grabbed a massive bottle of root beer and loudly guzzled it down, spilling some onto her food and pit stained sweater. She tossed the bottle aside and then opened her mouth as she felt gas rising up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* She belched loudly a second later. She smirked at the others. \"Your turn, Ororo.\" Jean smiled at Ororo, who swallowed nervously as she picked up a large Sprite bottle and loudly gulped it down in surprisingly big chugs. Once it was empty, she tossed it aside and waited. After a few seconds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!! * Storm burped loudly, triumphing Jean's. \"Like, nice one, Ororo!\" Kitty cheered as the others, except for Jean, nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Amara. Your turn.\" said Rogue as she dug a finger in her ear before wiping the earwax off on her shirt. Amara timidly grabbed a bottle of grape soda and began sipping it. \"'Mara, you're not gonna get burp burps if you don't guzzle it.\" Tabitha said as she tilted Amara's head back, grabbed a funnel, installed it into her friend's mouth and quickly poured the whole bottle down it and Amara's throat nonstop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* *GLUG* Magma went as the soda thundered down her throat and into her bigger potbelly. Within seconds, it rumbled loudly as it bloated with gas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPP PPPPPP!!!* She belched loudly, sending Tabitha's hair flying back slightly. \"Nice one, Amara.\" Rogue smiled as she took her turn, chugging down a large orange soda. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHH!!!* She belched out a second later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, each of the six X-Ladies guzzling a soda and burping loudly, each one triumphing over the previous one every time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was down to Jean. Kitty had just unleashed a very big impressive burp. Jean quickly gulped/guzzled down her Pepsi bottle and tossed it into her pile. Then, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out the biggest burp of all out of the six, knocking her friends off their seats in shock. Jean smiled as she look at her friends in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I won! I won!\" She giggled as she squatted down in Rogue's face and then, *PPPPPPRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTT!* Let out a big smelly poot into the goth's face before dancing over and doing the same to Kitty, Tabitha, Amara and Storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you guys are no match for Jean Grey, the biggest fartin', burpin' and slobbiest girl in the mansion and probably in Bayville!\" She giggled as she left. \"She did have a pretty good burp.\" Kitty admitted as she and the others stood up and began cleaning up the mess, burping, farting and hiccupping as they did.</span></div></div>",

As she read her horror novel, Rogue thought of ways to rebel against being made by everybody to act like Jean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she leaned back to read, Rogue had an idea. \"<i>'Course, it'll be a bit weird at first, but Ah'm through tryin' ta mimic Miss. Perfect all the time. So they're just gonna need ta get over it.</i>\" Rogue thought to herself with a wide grin as she kept reading. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night at dinner, Rogue, Scott, Jean, Kurt and Kitty were eating together. The New Mutants (excluding Tabitha \"Boom-Boom\" Smith and Amara \"Magma\" Aquilla) had gone on a survival trip with Wolverine and Beast, leaving Professor X and Storm behind while Spyke had left the team recently to join the Morlocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight's dinner was turkey, mashed potatoes and green beans. Rogue loaded her plate and then, to the other X-Kids' shock, began scarfing her massive meal down with only her hands, getting grease, gravy and crumbs everywhere. She also chewed with her mouth open and licked and smacked her lips and fingers while Scott and the others watched in slight disgust and disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Rogue? Are you alvight?\" Kurt asked his foster sister. Rogue, cheeks bulging, looked at him as she loudly swallowed her food with a giant gulp and then, *UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a massive burp before patting her full stomach. \"Yeah, Kurt. Ah was just hungry, that's all.\" She said as she stood up and went to her and Kitty's room. The others shrugged and went back to talking or finishing their meals, except for Kitty, who watched her teammate and best friend with a thoughtful expression on her face as she chewed on her turkey drumstick.</span></div></div>",

Scott and the others had already finished their breakfasts and were off either training, doing homework or going out into Bayville for the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue grabbed a plate and piled it with doughnuts, pancakes and bacon. Once again, she made sure to eat everything sloppily, stuffing each doughnut onto her fingers and then eating them that way, stuffing handfuls of greasy bacon into her mouth and then swallowing the entire stack of pancakes in one giant gulp, burping loudly before licking and smacking her fingers off loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitty, Tabitha and Amara just watched their friend in disbelief. \"Rogue? Like, are you totally okay?\" Kitty asked. Rogue, still sucking on her index finger, looked up and quickly pulled said finger from her mouth. \"Yeah, Kitty. Ah'm fine. Jus' really hungry again.\" She explained simply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabby spoke up now. \"Hey, Rogue. Wanna have a burping/farting contest with me?\" She offered. Rogue was quiet for a moment as she thought about the offer. \"Alright. You're on, Tabitha.\" She smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the duo had several bottles of soda in front of them as Kitty and Amara watched. \"You ready to lose, Boom-Boom?\" Rogue smirked. \"Bring it, Stripes.\" Tabitha retorted with a laugh. \"Like, on your marks... get set... CHUG!\" Kitty shouted a second later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue quickly snagged a large Dr. Pepper bottle and began loudly chugging it down. After she tossed it aside, she didn't have to wait long for the gas to bubble up inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!* She belched loudly into Tabitha's face, making the blonde mutant's hair blow back slightly.  Tabitha just calmly smirked as she grabbed a huge orange soda and guzzled it down at lightning speed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPP!!!* She belched back into Rogue's face, making the southern goth's own hair blow back. \"Top that, Rogue!\" Tabby giggled with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, the duo kept chugging and guzzling their way through the sodas, their burps getting bigger and louder each time, and each one topping the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPP !!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLCCCC CCCCCCCCHHH!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP PPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's gonna win?\" asked Amara to Kitty as their respective best friends kept burping louder and louder. \"Like, I totally don't know, Amara. But I'll bet it's gonna be impressive to see who does.\" Kitty whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNDDDDDEEERRRRRRR TOOOOOOO MMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE, BBBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM-BBBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMM!!!* Rogue burped loudly a second later with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFFFFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEETTTTTT IIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTTTTT, SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIPPPPPPPPPPPPSSSSSSSS!!!* Tabitha belched back almost immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately, Tabitha won with that burp as both of these recent burps had come after the duo's final soda chugs. \"Now let's get on to the fartin' contest.\" Rogue smirked, confident she would win this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was ultimately Tabby who also won this contest as well. \"Guess Ah know why ya went with 'Boom-Boom' as your codename.\" Rogue smirked as she and Boom-Boom shook hands afterwards. The four then spend the rest of the day hanging out together.</span></div></div>",

Ever since she could remember, Rogue had always secretly loved wearing and using diapers, even after undergoing toilet training. However, she'd never acted on it due to Destiny's predicting powers alerting her whenever Rogue tried to buy diapers at the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, she figured she had the perfect chance to do so. Making sure none of the others were coming, Rogue tugged off her leggings, skirt, underpants and boots before putting a thick, fluffy diaper on and standing up. Then, she grabbed a large jar of chocolate chip cookies she'd smuggled from the kitchen earlier that day. In addition to her love of diapers, Rogue had also decided to put on some extra weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was just shoving the second cookie into her mouth, when Storm came in. \"Rogue, Kitty asked me to-\" but then the weather witch stopped short upon seeing both Rogue's diaper and the huge jar of cookies. For a moment, neither of them said a word. Then, Ororo broke the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogue... why are you wearing a diaper and eating an entire jar of cookies?\" she asked gently. Rogue blushed and stammered for a moment before taking a deep breath. \"Ah... Ah've always wanted ta wear an' use diapers again an' gain weight. Since movin' here, Ah've been lookin' for a good time to do so an' now seemed like it.\" She confessed with a sheepish expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ororo didn't say anything for the longest time. Then, she slowly sat down on Rogue's bed beside her. \"Rogue, believe it or not... I too have often wondered what that would be like.\" she confessed with a wide grin. Rogue's jaw dropped in shock. \"Really? Ah... Ah never knew that.\" She finally managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true. As a child, I loathed toilet training and wished to remain in my diapers. Even as I matured, I still missed how comfy they were, even after I had relieved myself in them but could never act upon my urgings because my parents and sister Vi were usually around.\" Storm admitted with a grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ya know what? Ah think it's time, we actually do it. We'll gain weight while wearin' and usin' our diapers.\" Rogue smiled as she offered a cookie to Ororo, who smiled while taking it and then grabbing a spare diaper, quickly putting it on and smiling as she felt the comfy padding on her butt again for the first time since she was a toddler. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo thus spent the rest of the day, eating and lazing around in their diapers, occasionally changing each other's whenever they peed and/or pooped in them, giggling like little kids as they did this.</span></div></div>",

Between training and school, they'd also saved the world from Apocalypse and were still recovering from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, we so totally need a vacation.\" Kitty sighed as she sat beside Rogue. \"I'm with you, Kitty. I just wanna laze around and take it easy.\" Tabitha agreed. At that moment, an ad began playing on the TV for a new resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ladies, have you had a busy week or weeks? Do you wish to just laze around, take it easy and be just plain lazy? Then come to the Growing Resort.. You'll be well cared for and pampered by our staff. Just take it easy and let them cater to your every need while you enjoy your favorite junk foods, our beautiful beach, numerous shops and just relax.</i>\" The ad said as it showed a beautiful resort on the beach. The five girls couldn't believe it as they watched the ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun!\" Amara said excitedly as Kitty and Tabitha both nodded in agreement while Rogue and Jean remained silent. \"I'm not sure, guys. I mean, it looks great, but...\" Jean began. \"Oh, come on, Jean! Please?\" Kitty begged as Amara and Tabitha also looked at their older friend with equally pleading expressions, to Rogue's amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean sighed as she picked up her cell phone and dialed the number for the resort. \"Yes, is this the Growing Resort? Well, I'd like to book a few rooms. My name's Jean Grey.\" Jean said a second later after the receptionist answered the phone. A second later, Jean nearly dropped her phone as the receptionist squealed very loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD! Jean Grey?!?!? The Jean Grey of the X-Men! I saw you guys on TV! You basically saved the whole world from that madman Apocalypse! We'd be honored to have you and your female teammates here!\" The receptionist squealed excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... thank you, but getting back on the rooms...\" Jean smiled awkwardly. She listened to what the receptionist said next and nodded. \"Okay. Okay, thank you. Bye.\" she said as she hung up and sighed. \"Well, the good news is they seem open to mutants being guests.\" Jean remarked to the others. \"We heard.\" Rogue remarked with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did you, like, totally get the rooms?\" Kitty asked excitedly. \"Yeah and no. I got us <i>a</i> room, but we'll have to share it.\" Jean admitted. The four younger girls were quiet for a moment, but then they shrugged. \"No biggie, Red. It'll be like a slumber party.\" Tabitha shrugged as Kitty and Amara both nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we go?\" Amara asked. \"Tomorrow. We'd better pack since we'll need to leave early to get there by afternoon.\" Jean replied as they went to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright and early next morning found the five girls in Jean's SUV heading for the Growing Resort. Jean was driving while Rogue sat in the passenger seat and gave her directions. Kitty, Tabby and Amara all sat in the back, still sleeping since they'd barely gotten any sleep due to their excitement last night. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon, the five teenage girls arrived at the Growing Resort. It was a very beautiful building located by an amazing looking beach with crystal white sand and sparkling clean water. \"Like, this is totally a paradise!\"  Kitty giggled in delight as she and the others looked at the resort and beach in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they'd entered the very grand looking main lobby. It was very big and elegant looking with fancy lamps, sofas, chairs and tables as well as a big crystal chandelier on the celling. The five approached the beautiful front desk and were greeted by a young man. \"Hello and welcome to the Growing Resort. I'm Travis Mosby, the manager. How can I help you?\" He smiled politely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Jean Grey and I called yesterday about a room...\" Jean replied as the others kept looking around in delight. \"Ah, yes. The famous Miss. Grey.\" smiled Travis with a nod before Jean could continue her sentence. He rang the desk bell and a young man came up wearing a bellhop uniform. \"This is Esteban. He'll take your bags to your room.\" Travis smiled. \"Thanks.\" Jean smiled back as she and the girls followed the young Latino male to their room on the 12th floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, ladies.\" Esteban smiled as he opened the door and handed Jean the keycards before taking the five's suitcases inside. The girls gasped in delight. The room was massive like the rest of the hotel, with two big beds, a flat screen TV, a large mirror, a shiny maple wood desk and leathery desk chair, beautiful lamps and a bedside table between the two beds and a balcony overlooking the beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This room's really freaking awesome!\" Tabitha cheered in delight as the girls all began looking around, Jean handing a dollar to Esteban for his tip before he left, Boom-Boom flopping onto the left corner's bed in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what should we totally do first?\" Kitty asked eagerly as she sat on the end of her bed. At that moment, a knock came on the door. Rogue went over and opened it, revealing a smiling and perky looking young woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there! You must be our new guests! I'm Cora Lauder, the tour guide. Are you ready for your tour?\" she chirped at them. \"Um,\" Jean said before getting pulled out of the room by Cora before she could fully answer, Kitty and the others scrambling after them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the girls were following Cora as they went through the resort. \"The Growing Resort have great clothing and swimsuit stores that's open to our guests, free of charge.\" Cora was saying as she nodded to the two stores. \"Like, they're both totally plus sized stores.\" Kitty remarked as she read the names: Super Big Girls Clothes and Plus Sized Ladies Swimwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Here at the Growing Resort, weight gain and laziness is highly encouraged by our staff.\"  Cora smiled as she kept walking. \"What're the rules around here?\" asked Jean as she and the others struggled to keep up with the surprisingly fast Cora. \"There's only two rules: One, you cannot take food out of the buffets in the main hotel and two, you must wear and use diapers and only a hotel staff member may change you.\" Cora replied. \"Why diapers?\" Amara asked as she noticed two girls around both her and Tabby's age, both rather round and wearing only t-shirts and thick diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because using the toilet takes away from your vacation and eating, sweetie weetie.\" Cora cooed, causing Rogue to roll her eyes and Kitty to giggle upon seeing this. Cora then lead the girls to the main buffets. There were five of them, all large and filled with delicious, greasy and fattening looking foods. There was a Chinese place, an Ice Cream parlor, a hamburger joint, an Italian one and an Indian cuisine buffet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go swimmin'?\" Rogue asked as Cora led them onto the beach after a moment. \"Certainly dearie. Swimming is allowed as long as you don't do it after eating.\" smiled Cora as she grinned at Rogue like she was a little girl. \"She does that again an' Ah'm gonna zap her into next month.\" Rogue growled to Jean and the others, who merely smiled assuredly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora then took the girls back to their room. \"So, what happens if we, like, totally get hungry and the buffets are closed or we totally don't wanna leave our room?\" Kitty asked. Cora smiled and pushed a button on a pad beside the light switches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds a massive buffet consisting of a pizza oven, hot dog machine, soft pretzels, a soft serve ice cream machine, and numerous other foods appeared from the floor and walls. \"Wow! It's like an entire motherload of junk food stashes!\" Tabitha declared as she popped a large doughnut into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave you girls to get in your diapee wipees now. Enjoy your stay!\" Cora chirped in delight as she closed the door. \"Thank god. Anymore of her perkiness or baby talk an' Ah was gonna pukey-wookey.\" Rogue gagged in relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls simply giggled and began changing into their diapers. They were all bright white with different patterns on them. Kitty's had a rainbow and unicorns on it. \"Very fittin'.\" Rogue joked as Kitty merely stuck her tongue out at Rogue with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue's diaper had a large dragon on the back and a smaller one on the front. Tabitha's had motorcycles on it while Amara's diaper sported polka dots and Jean's had a big heart on the rear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do now?\" Tabitha asked. Then, *RUMBLE* *GURGLE* *GLORP* went Kitty's belly as she blushed. \"Ah think someone's hungry.\" Rogue laughed, only for her belly to rumble as well, with Jean, Boom-Boom and Magma's following suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that answers that.\" Jean smiled as they stood up, clad in only t-shirts and thick diapers, as well as flip flops. They soon reached the Chinese buffet and were seated in a large booth. Not long after, they were eating noodles, spring rolls, chicken curry and numerous other Chinese takeout foods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, \"Ooof. I'm stuffed.\" Tabitha sighed in delight as she rubbed her chubbier belly, which was stuffed full of the unhealthy Chinese foods she and the others'd pigged out on. \"I'm with you, Tabitha. My stomach's really full.\" agreed Amara as she rubbed her own chubby tummy. Then, *BBBLLLOOOOORRRCCCCHHH!!* Rogue farted loudly and her diaper filled with poop. The other girls all coughed and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Rogue made an 'oopsie' in her diapee.\" Tabby giggled as her gothic friend went bright red. Jean merely smirked, only to feel something warm and wet enter her diaper, discoloring the front bright yellow. \"And Jean made a wee-wee!\" Kitty cooed as Jean also blushed with a sheepish smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTT!!!* Kitty went bright red herself as a massive poop entered her diaper as well. \"You were saying Kitty?\" Jean giggled, her wet diaper squishing slightly against her legs and crotch. Then, Amara felt a large stream of pee enter her diapee as well, causing her and the others to laugh as well. Finally, Tabitha rounded the whole chain reaction by massively pooping her diaper as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill giggling, the five went over to the ice cream buffet in their still full diapers and began sampling everything there as well, though they did struggle slightly due to feeling pretty full. Finally, the five returned to their room and flopped onto the twin beds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so *urp* full, I don't even wanna think about food right now.\" Jean remarked as she rubbed her bigger potbelly with a groan and a burp. The others merely mumbled their agreements as they rubbed or pinched their own bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I totally don't know about you guys, but my diaper's totally starting to itch.\" Kitty said as she scratched her butt. Noticing a blue button marked 'Diaper changes', Jean pressed it and three young females soon entered. Without saying a word, the trio had the five cleaned up and thickly diapered again before leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk about service.\" Tabby remarked as she sat up in her new motorcycle diaper with a grin as the others also did the same. Soon, it was time for bed. \"So how're we gonna do this?\" asked Rogue after they changed into their pajamas, their diapers bulging noticeably under them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we go three and two? Three in the right bed and two in the left?\" Amara suggested innocently. \"Okay.\" Kitty agreed as Rogue and the others nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was ultimately decided that Rogue and Kitty would double up in the left bed and the others would take the right. Soon, the five were under the covers and fast asleep, dreaming of all the food they'd eat the next day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One afternoon, Kitty Pryde, Tabitha Smith, Rogue, Jean Grey and Amara Aquilla were hanging out in the institute's kitchen. They were just talking when Tabitha had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls, wanna do something interesting?\" She asked with a wicked smile. \"What?\" asked Amara. \"First, a question: Who here thinks they can eat the most food without puking?\" Tabitha replied. The other four girls eyed each other in bewilderment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, why're you totally asking that, Tabitha?\" Kitty asked, pushing her brown hair back slightly. \"'Cause I think we should have an eating contest.\" Boom-Boom smiled. At that, the four girls just eyed her in surprise and disbelief for a good, long moment. It was Rogue who broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are ya crazy, gal??!? Why do ya wanna have an eatin' contest?\" She asked bluntly. \"Because I think I could beat all of you in one. I just want proof.\" Tabitha explained. Amara looked confused at the whole conversation. \"What's an eating contest?\" she asked, cocking her head slightly to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a competition to see who can eat the most of a certain food or dessert.\" Jean explained. \"Oh. Can anyone do it?\" Amara asked. \"Yeah. Like, tons of males and females do them. There's some for only guys and only girls or, like, in some some of them, both boys and girls can compete at the same time.\" Kitty explained now with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. This one'll be just girls only. It'll be a week from now so we can train. We gotta stretch our tummies out.\" Tabitha added. \"How?\" asked Amara. \"By gorging ourselves on junk food, since that's what'll be the food selection for the contest.\" Boom-Boom smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, should we tell Scott and the other guys first so they know about it?\" Kitty suggested \"Hold on Kit. We ain't even agreed to the contest yet.\" Rogue argued. \"I'm in.\" Amara smiled after a moment. \"Me too.\" Jean smiled to the surprise of everybody. \"Like, totally count me in!\" Kitty chirped. \"Rogue?\" Tabitha asked. Rogue looked at her smiling girlfriends and teammates. Finally, she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Ah'm in.\" she sighed. \"Okay. Now let's go tell Cyke and the boys.\" Tabitha smiled as the five set off to inform Scott and the other X-Boys present of the upcoming challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the five girls reached the living room. Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Spyke, Iceman and Multiple were all gathered there. Wolverine, Storm and Beast had taken the other New Recruits on a month long survival experience trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, girls. What's up?\" Scott asked. Tabitha quickly explained about the eating contest and everything. When she finished, Scott and the other X-Guys just eyed their female friends in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys wanna do an eating contest?\" Bobby asked. \"Yeah. What's wrong with that, Iceboy? Plenty of women've done them.\" Tabitha pointed out. \"Yeah, but none of you've done one before.\" Spyke argued. \"That don't mean we can't Porcupine.\" Rogue retorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do have a point, Scott.\" Jean said with a grin. Scott was quiet for a moment, and then he nodded. \"Okay. We can have your eating contest. What do you guys want us to do?\" He finally said as Bobby, Evan, Kurt and Jamie nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were kind of hoping you'd act as our eating coaches.\" Jean explained. \"Basically, all y'all gotta do is make sure we eat everythin' on our plate at mealtimes both here and in public.\" Rogue added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X-Boys eyed each other for a long moment and then nodded. \"Sounds good.\" Scott said. \"We should, like, totally break up into pairs to make it more fair.\" Kitty suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others agreed and so the teams were made. Jean, obviously, picked Scott for her trainer. Amara took Bobby, Kurt was paired with Tabitha, Jamie went with Kitty and Spyke and Rogue teamed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I think we should get started right away with your guys' training since you only have a week.\" Scott said in his usual leader voice. \"We'll hit the fast food joints for the next hour. The mall food court and buffet is okay, but I'd rather wait until tomorrow for those.\" He added. \"Good idea.\" Jean said as the other girls and guys nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Enough  chitchat! Bring on the grub!\" Tabitha shouted with a wide grin, causing the others to also smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the five pairs set off to their decided spots for the girls' first day of training for the next week's contest. Kitty and Jamie went to an ice cream parlor, Tabitha and Kurt went to a Gut Bomb's diner, Jean and Scott chose a bakery, Rogue and Spyke headed to a open barbecue and Amara and Iceman went to a hot dog joint.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kitty and Jamie entered the ice cream parlor Jamie had selected for the start of Kitty's training. It was a nice and peaceful looking one. After a moment, both kids headed up to the counter. \"Kitty? D-Do you mind if I order for you?\" Jamie asked nervously. Even though he'd moved past it, he still had a slight crush on Shadowcat, despite the slight age gap between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks Jamie.\" Kitty smiled while looking at the menu over the counter while waiting their turn. \"Like, I'll take three banana splits and a jumbo chocolate malt.\" she whispered so he knew what she really wanted. Jamie nodded and, when their turn came, placed the order. The waitress seemed shocked, but nevertheless agreed and told them to find a table while they waited. Kitty and Jamie went over to a booth near the windows and waited. After a few minutes, the waitress brought out Kitty's order. The splits were massive, with four bananas, eight scoops of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry each, a big spray of whipped cream, hot fudge and a cherry on top. Kitty gulped nervously as she eyed the sundaes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Kitty?\" Jamie asked gently from beside her as he licked his strawberry cone. Kitty nodded her head assuredly. \"Yeah. Like, I'm totally okay. I'm just a little nervous.\" Kitty admitted as she picked up her spoon and started eating slowly and carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Kitty had eaten the first two sundaes as well as drank her malt and was currently eating the third, her belly notably rounder and poking out from under her cream t-shirt and pink sweater. Ice cream, whipped cream and hot fudge was smeared on her face as she slowly chewed and swallowed each large spoonful loudly. Jamie was watching intently, making sure she didn't try to quit before finishing it.  As he watched his older teammate and friend eat, Multiple couldn't help but notice how round and plump Kitty's tummy looked now. He'd secretly thought the girl was too skinny at times. Now, he had a chance to help her fatten up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Kitty! Last bite! You can do it!\" He cheered as Kitty finally stuffed the last big spoonful of sundae into her mouth and swallowed it with a big gulp as she dropped the spoon into the empty bowl and leaned back with a long moan escaping her hot fudge, whipped cream and ice cream covered lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it, Kitty! Great job!\" Jamie smiled at her. Kitty merely moaned in response as she rubbed her orb of a tummy. \"Like, my tummy's so totally full. *UUUUURRRRRPPPPPPP!!!!!*\"  She groaned painfully as she let out a big burp. Jamie didn't say anything as he watched his friend moan and groan as she ran her hands over her big swollen belly. \"D-Do you want me to rub your tummy?\" he asked her. Kitty was quiet for a moment and then she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like, sure you totally can, Jamie.\" Kitty said, moving her dirty t-shirt up more so Jamie could rub her whole belly. Jamie slowly put his small eleven-year-old hands on Kitty's squishy, warm and bloated gut and started rubbing and pressing on it gently. Kitty closed her eyes and let out a gentle moan of pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that totally feels soooo good.\" she sighed, causing Jamie to blush. They paid for Kitty's massive pig out and then they walked back to the mansion, Jamie supporting the bloated Kitty as she staggered slightly as they walked, Kitty burping and hiccupping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Amara and Iceman had arrived at a local hot dog joint. they had just sat down when a young waiter walked up. \"Hello kids. What can I get you?\" He asked, taking out his notepad. \"Nothing for me, thanks.\" Bobby smiled. \"How 'bout you, little lady?\" the waited smiled at Amara. \"I'll, um, take 40 hot dogs please. Just ketchup and mustard on them.\" Amara said after a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the waiter was surprised by this, he didn't show it. He just nodded and set off to place Amara's order. \"You sure you can handle that many hot dogs, 'Mara?\" Bobby asked with concern for his friend. Amara didn't say anything at first. Then, she nodded determinedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Bobby. I'm sure I can handle that many hot dogs. After all, that's why you're my eating coach. You need to make sure I eat all of them, no matter what.\" she pointed out with a smile. \"Alrighty. Just remember you asked for it.\" Iceman shrugged as they waited for Amara's dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Amara was eyeing a massive platter of freshly made hot dogs with ketchup and mustard. \"How many hot dogs have you even eaten?\" Bobby asked Amara. \"I think at least five or nine.\" Amara shrugged. Bobby just stared at her in shock. \"What can I say? Tabitha's a big encourager.\" Amara shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing.\" she added, grabbing the first hot dog and eating it fairly quickly. The second, third, fourth and fifth ones all went down quickly as well. But as she started on the sixth, Amara began feeling queasy. Best she could figure it, she had eaten the first five hot dogs too quickly. Despite this, she managed to swallow the sixth and grabbed the seventh one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHot dog #7 went down with Amara making weird gulping and almost grunting noises as she ate it, sweat running down her face. Hot dogs 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 slowly followed suit, Amara looking more and more sick as she ate each one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy hot dog #35, Amara was sporting a bloated, plump and round belly of her own as she timidly ate her 36th hot dog. Bobby, noticing Amara was starting to weaken, came up with a plan. \"Sorry, 'Mara.\" He said gently as he quickly grabbed the last four and stuffed them into her mouth, pinching her nose with his fingers and covering her mouth with his other hand so she couldn't spit the hot dogs out in order to breathe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara struggled slightly, but it was no use. She was too bloated and full to fight back normally. Knowing there was only one way of getting out of her problem, Amara quickly swallowed the last four hot dogs down with a large gulp. Upon her doing this, Bobby sat back as Amara gulped and panted heavily, warmly welcoming the fresh air into her lungs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... did you... do... that?\" She gasped. \"You told me to make sure that you ate all the hot dogs without stopping any way I could.\" Bobby reminded her as he eyed her big belly. \"Well, it worked. But I feel so full...\" Amara groaned as she, like Kitty, rubbed her ginormous belly in agony. Iceman smiled kindly. Making sure that no one was watching, he iced up his fingers and started rubbing Amara's sore tummy. Upon feeling her friend's cold fingers on her tight and sore belly, Amara groaned in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\" Bobby asked her. \"Yeah. Thanks Bob-\" Then Amara froze, her cheeks bulging. For a moment it seemed she was gonna be sick. Then, *OOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!* She belched loudly, rattling the windows and causing the other customers to look up in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" Amara blushed as she rubbed her gut. \"Man, that was a big burp!\" Bobby remarked as they stood up, Amara placing a hand on her bloated tummy. \"I know. I'm sorry.\" Amara mumbled. \"No... I didn't say it wasn't awesome. It totally was.\" Bobby smiled as they left, Amara also staggering slightly due to her new weight. </span></div></div>",

Upon being seated, Tabitha picked up her menu. \"Alright, let's see here. I think I'll have ten normal gut bombs and 12 of the Extra Jumbo Bombs.\" she told the waiter with a smile. The boy nodded in surprise and then left to place the order. As they waited, Tabitha noticed Kurt watching her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, Blue?\" she asked, using her nickname for him. \"Nothing. I vas just vondering if it's a good idea for you and ze other girls to have this competition.\" Kurt replied quickly. Tabitha smiled at him and gently put her hand on his. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, 'Crawler... I know that sometimes you guys don't always like my ideas. But I know this one's gonna be a great one once it's over.\" she smiled. Kurt still didn't look convinced, but he nodded as the waiter brought Tabitha's massive Gut Bomb feast, 22 of them in total. \"Wish me luck, Blue.\" Tabitha smiled as she picked up her first Gut Bomb and sunk her teeth into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha plowed through the regular sized Gut Bombs with no problem. Then, she hit the Extra Jumbo Bombs. They were basically the same thing, but considerably larger. Smiling bravely, Boom-Boom grabbed the first one and took a giant bite out of it. Within seconds, it was gone. As she kept eating, Tabitha's tummy started to bloat up like Kitty and Amara's. So much so, that she actually had to both loosen her belt and undo her pants to make more room in her rapidly swelling tummy. That helped, but only a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Tabitha swallowed the last bite of her final Extra Jumbo Bomb and leaned back, her tummy pressing against the table. She felt so full, she didn't want to move. \"Tabitha? Are you alright?\" Kurt asked her. Tabitha, with a slight effort, heaved her head up to look at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay, Blue. Just a little stuffed that's all. *BBBBBBBUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!*\" Tabitha replied as she let out a giant burp while she rubbed her tummy, breathing heavily. \"Oh man. That burp nearly made that last Extra Jumbo Bomb make a reappearance.\" Tabitha groaned as she kept rubbing and pressing on her boulder sized belly. Kurt smiled gently at his friend and simply heaved her up. \"C'mon. Let's get you home.\" He told her as they staggered slightly out of the burger joint.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, if I'm this stuffed now, I can't wait to see how my belly handles dinner tonight.\" Tabitha smiled at Kurt, who simply stared at her in shock that she still felt a might peck-ish despite being stuffed to her bursting point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jean and Scott had reached a bakery not too far from the institute. They had soon picked out a table and Jean had placed her order for her first pig out. As they waited, Jean looked at Scott. Upon noticing him frowning slightly, she decided to talk to him telepathically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Penny for your thoughts</i>?\" she asked him telepathically. Cyclops started for a second and then, realizing who was in his head, smirked as he turned back to her. \"<i>You're not sure about me being in the eating contest, are you?</i>\" Jean added after a lull. \"<i>What gave you that idea, Jean</i>?\" Scott asked, also telepathically with a wry grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I know you, Scott. Out of all the New Recruits, you often butt heads with Tabitha. She is a good kid, she's just a little too wild at times.\" Jean said aloud, yet quietly so no one would hear them. \"I know. But sometimes it's like she's determined to be rebellious, especially during training sessions.\" Scott admitted gently. \"Just give her time. And besides, I've always kinda wanted to enter an eating competition.\" Jean admitted. After a moment, Jean's order arrived and the waitress set it down between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean had ordered a whole banana cream pie, 30 large snickerdoodle cookies, 20 chocolate doughnuts, 10 long johns and 14 cinnamon rolls, totaling into a 75 piece meal. \"Are you sure you can handle all that?\" Scott asked her. Jean simply smiled and took a shark sized bite out of her first cookie. \"<i>Watch me, Scott</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jean had eaten the pie, all the cookies,  the long johns and the doughnuts. Her face was a mess of pie filling, whipped cream, crumbs, cream filling, chocolate and frosting, with some of these stains on her sweater. Right now, she was currently eating the final 3 cinnamon rolls, frosting smearing on her already messy face and dripping onto her clothes. Her sweater was bulging over her large belly, her bellybutton exposed. At last, Jean swallowed the final mouthful of cinnamon roll and laid back in her chair, patting her boulder sized belly gingerly as she quietly burped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooohhhh goooodd. *AAAARRRRRAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!* I'm... so... full.. I'd... explode... if I ate even... a crumb... or... dollop of frosting...\" Jean groaned as she kept patting and pressing on her tummy. Scott was quiet for a moment and then he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, do you want me to give you a belly rub?\" he asked her slowly. Jean smiled a gooey, crumb, whipped cream, cream filling, chocolate and cinnamon roll frosting smile and nodded. Slowly and carefully, Scott put his hands on Jean's tummy and began rubbing it. After a few minutes, Jean felt well enough to stand up again and the duo carefully left the bakery to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gotta admit, that was pretty awesome, Scott. I'm looking forward to dinner tonight and training tomorrow.\" Jean smiled as she and Scott walked home, causing Scott to eye her in surprise and then shake his head in amusement at Jean, despite being stuffed to the gills, awaiting more food at dinner and her training tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only imagine how Kitty, Amara and Tabitha were feeling about that thought right now as they too headed home. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At the same time, Rogue and Spyke had reached the open barbecue in the park. All kinds of steaks, burgers, hot dogs, and other barbecue foods were simmering on the grills, \"Alright, Rogue. Just remember, you keep eating, even if you feel full.\" Spyke reminded her. \"Got it, Spyke.\" Rogue smiled as she grabbed her first plate and went over to the grills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly selected a large juicy steak, five hamburgers and six hot dogs, which she drowned in ketchup and mustard. She then joined Spyke at their picnic table. \"You can do it, Rogue.\" Evan smiled. \"Ah hope so.\" Rogue replied as she picked up her first hot dog and took a large bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Rogue had eaten at least 20 plates of barbecued food, the plates were stacked up on her side of the table and covered in barbecue sauce, ketchup, grease, mustard and bones from Rogue's ribs and chicken. Rogue herself was feeling very bloated and had the gut to prove it. Her pale belly was so big, it hung over the waistband of her skirt and leggings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mah god... Ah'm so stuffed, mah belly feels like it's gonna *UUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!!* explode.\" Rogue groaned as she rubbed her massive tummy while it digested all that food. Spyke watched with concern. \"I'd offer you a belly rub, but my fingers aren't covered.\" He apologized, showing her his gloves, which were in fact the fingerless kind. Rogue nodded in sympathy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, Evan. Ah think Ah can tough it out 'til we're back at the mansion.\" She said as, puffing heavily, she managed to heave herself up off her bench. Evan got up as well and the duo headed for the mansion, Rogue burping and farting loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later, the five stuffed and bloated girls were in Kitty and Rogue's bedroom, Jean, Amara and Tabitha feeling too bloated to try and make it to their rooms. They were all sprawled on the floor on their backs, smiling and burping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, my tummy was so full, I'm lucky I wasn't totally sweating ice cream.\" Kitty grinned as she massaged her now calm and soft belly. \"I know how you feel. After those 40 hot dogs, my belly was aching up a storm.\" Amara smiled in sympathy as she poked hers, causing a quiet burp to escape her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After those Gut Bombs, I thought I was gonna blow up.\" Tabitha added from beside Amara as she slapped her tummy, which gurgled slightly at the slap. \"I was so bloated from my dessert pig out, I wasn't sure I'd make it out the door.\" Jean giggled from beside Kitty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mah tummy was so full from all that yummy barbecue food, Ah thought I'd die from bein' so full.\" Rogue smirked from beside Tabitha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But at least the guys were there with tummy rubs. Like, I totally thought poor Jamie was gonna either faint or wet his pants because he got to touch my belly.\" Kitty said, giggling at the memory. Though she had originally been slightly annoyed by Jamie's crush on her, she still considered him a good friend and was close with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blue didn't really complain about touching my gut. I really enjoyed his belly rub. Mainly 'cause his fingers tickled it.\" Tabitha admitted with a giggle of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bobby's belly rub was really good too. He used his powers to help relax my tummy as he rubbed it.\" Amara smiled as she remembered how nice Bobby's iced up fingers had felt on her sore belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys're lucky. Ah couldn't get a belly rub 'cause Evan was wearin' his normal finger free gloves.\" Rogue admitted sadly. The other girls eyed her in sympathy. \"That must've been hard.\" Jean said calmly. Rogue shook her head. \"Nah. It was fine. Ah told him Ah could wait until we came back here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, it's totally weird. We've eaten more than we usually do today and, like, I'm still totally hungry for dinner.\" Kitty remarked as her belly rumbled hungerly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?\" Tabitha asked in disbelief as she sat up. \"I thought it was just me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm kinda hungry again too.\" Amara agreed as she also sat up in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Jean added as she also heaved herself up into a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah gotta admit, even Ah'm kinda starvin'.\" Rogue agreed eagerly as she also pulled herself into a sitting position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Scott knocked on the door and came in. \"Dinner's ready. We already ate our own dinner so the one in the dining room is...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was almost flattened by Tabitha, Amara, Rogue and Jean as the four charged past him to the dining room. Kitty, however, merely phased her way to the dining room, thus reaching it first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Due to phasing through the floor into the dining room, Kitty reached it first. Upon seeing the table, her eyes widened in delight and she began drooling. Almost the entire table was covered in junk foods. There was a very big platter of hamburgers, a platter of french fries, one of pizzas, a whole tray of cookies, one of cupcakes and five massive ice cream sundaes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Jean, Amara, Tabitha and Rogue arrived and also began drooling at the food. \"Wow. This is awesome.\" Tabitha smiled in delight. \"Food! Glorious food!\" Jean agreed, rubbing her hands together. \"Deep fried!\" Rogue cheered as she ran for the table. \"Like, LET'S EAT!!!!!!\" Kitty cheered in agreement as the other four raced for the table as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they were all stuffing themselves with junk food. Kitty stuffed five big burgers into her mouth one at a time, not really bothering to chew each one after they entered her mouth, causing her cheeks to bulge out like a chipmunk's. After a moment following the 5th burger's entry into her mouth, Kitty swallowed all five at once with a loud gulp, her tongue hanging out of her mouth as she smiled in delight at the taste. Then, she crammed six more into her mouth while they were stacked on top of each other, stretching her poor cheeks out more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, Amara let out a wild yell and began chowing down on 23 of the big, fluffy fries at once, several of them sticking out of her mouth in the process. Beside her, Tabitha spun a large cheese, pepperoni and sausage pizza around on one finger and began chomping it down in massive shark-like bites, leaving only a very small piece left for her to suck off her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJean, sitting across from Kitty, began stuffing down stacks of the cookies. First she started off with five, then ten, then 15 and finally, skipping 20, went straight to 25 in a stack. Rogue meanwhile, stacked 10 of the large, fluffy cupcakes on top of each other and then gulped those down with ease, licking her fingers as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the girls switched so they each got some of the meal's other inclusions. Jean took the cupcakes, Rogue took the burgers, Kitty took the fries, Amara took the pizzas and Tabitha tackled the cookies. As they ate, Kitty thought she heard Amara muttering something to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is kinda fun, but still wrong. I probably shouldn't be doing this. This isn't right to our poor tummies but I will try to keep going.\" Amara was muttering to herself as she rolled up her pizza and stuffed the entire roll into her mouth at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was going on, the guys were watching in delight and astonishment. \"You know, I think I vunce saw this in a documentary.\" Kurt remarked as he watched Rogue loudly swallow five big burgers whole like Kitty had done. \"Was it of an eating contest?\" Scott asked. \"No. It was more like a Komodo Dragon one.\" Kurt admitted as Jean, using her telekinesis, consumed 12 cupcakes at once, licking her lips loudly after doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I can't believe how much the girls're eating.\" Spyke remarked. \"I know. Kinda makes ya admire them for it, huh?\" Bobby remarked wisely as the guys all nodded while not looking away from their female friends and teammates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe five X-Girls kept eating and eating, getting more and more fatter, their bellies swelling up more with each course, plates, trays and other items all slowly stacking up or being discarded around the table as they kept up their food fest, seemingly unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, empty bowls, trays and plates lay scattered on the table. Five bloated, moaning and full girls leaned back in their chairs, their bloated guts all groaning, gurgling and sloshing from all the food in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys okay?\" Jamie asked them with concern. \"Yeah. Like, we're totally *UUUURRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!* fine, Jamie.\" Kitty moaned, letting out a giant burp as she said this. Her belly grumbled loudly in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak *BBBBUUURRRRPPP!!!* for yourself, Kitty. My poor belly *UURRRPPPPPPP* feels like it's gonna blow at any second!\" Tabitha groaned in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for me. My tummy feels like a turkey being fattened for Thanksgiving. It *OOOORRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!* hurts so bad!\" Amara moaned as her big brown belly gurgled and rumbled ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue tried to speak, but she was so full, she could only moan and groan in agony, her big pale belly looking like a white colored basketball or a big snowball. Jean was just as bad, she merely moaned and hiccupped loudly, her tongue lolling out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you all like a belly rub?\" Scott asked after a moment. The five bloated girls all looked at each other, considering the offer. They then had a quick talk telepathically so the guys wouldn't hear them and get embarrassed by what was being discussed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What'd you guys think? Should we have our bellies rubbed</i>?\" Jean asked. \"<i>Well, I totally enjoyed Jamie's belly rub at the ice cream parlor. I could, like, totally go for another one. Especially with my tummy feeling like it is now</i>.\" Kitty answered with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ah'm with Kitty on this one. Ah didn't get mah tummy rubbed while me an' Evan were at the barbecue. Now'd be a good time for him to make it up to me</i>.\" Rogue agreed with a smirk. Tabitha and Amara also agreed mentally and then the five turned to the boys.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, each of the five X-Boys went to their respective partners. Jamie went to Kitty, blushing profusely as he once again began rubbing and pressing her big, squishy, warm and plump belly. Kitty moaned in delight as Jamie's fingers kneed, pressed and squished her tummy flab like dough, causing Jamie to go even redder upon hearing his friend's moans of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that totally feels good, Jamie. My belly's feeling sooo much better now.\" Kitty moaned as she felt the pain lessening up in her gut, causing Jamie to smile nervously at his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott, meanwhile, took Jean under his care. As he gently began messaging her big, round squishy tummy, Jean also moaned with pleasure at the feeling. \"Oh Scott... that feels sooooo good...\" She sighed in delight as she felt her bellyache fading away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBobby, once again, was tending to Amara's upset tummy, using his powers to do so. Amara moaned with relief and pleasure as she felt his iced up fingers running over her big brown boulder tummy. \"Thanks, Bobby. That really feels good on my belly.\" Amara sighed in relief, causing Bobby to smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha, meanwhile, was being tended to by Kurt. The fuzzy teleporter was currently rubbing and squishing Boom-Boom's belly gently and lovingly, causing Tabitha to smile and moan with pleasure, occasionally giggling when Kurt's furry fingers tickled her large gut as he kept tending to it. \"Wow, Blue. That really feels good on my belly. You're a great massager.\" She smiled up at him, causing Kurt to flush under his fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue, meanwhile, was being tended to by Evan, who was now covering some spare rubber gloves to rub her tummy. As he did, the southern goth moaned and smiled with pleasure like her friends. \"That feels so awesome, Spyke. Thanks.\" She grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Kitty got a weird look on her face as her belly rumbled. \"Kitty? Are you okay?\" Jamie asked with concern. Kitty didn't answer at first as her tummy swelled up, not from food but gas. For a moment, it looked like she was going to burp, but then,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBLLLLAAAAARRRRPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Kitty let out a giant fart, causing her to sigh in relief. \"Like, excuse me.\" she blushed with a giggle. \"That wasn't too bad, Kitty. But here's how a big girl does it!\" Tabitha smiled as she felt one coming on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTT!!!!* She farted a second later, causing the guys to cough at the stench. \"Now I know vhy you decided on 'Boom-Boom' for your codename!\" Kurt joked as he waved his hand in front of his nose is disgust. \"Nice one, Tab!\" Amara giggled. Then, \"Yeah. That one's ain't bad either, Tabby, but this is how we southern gals fart.\" Rogue smirked as she slapped and jiggled her gut to create one. Then, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBLLLLLOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!* She let out a longer and louder fart. \"That was pretty good, Rogue, but here's how a princess does it!\" Amara smiled as she felt a fart of her own bubbling in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*POOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Her fart was a bit longer and louder than Kitty, Tabitha and Rogue's. All the boys and the other girls all looked impressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one 'Mara!\" Tabitha cheered as she and her best friend slapped hands. \"Okay, Jean! Like, it's totally down to you now!\" Kitty giggled at the bloated redhead. \"Jean, you don't need to do it if you don't-\" Scott started but Jean merely smirked and started shaking, sloshing and jiggling her big tummy. After a minute, it started to gurgle and rumble ominously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!* Jean's fart rattled the entire room, filling it with the stench of everything Jean had eaten that day. All the X-Kids coughed, gasped and choked in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez Jean! What did you eat?!? A mega bowl of super spicy chili?\" Bobby groaned, pinching his nose in dismay. \"Yeah, man! Freaky!\" Evan agreed as the guys all quickly left to open the windows and/or get air fresheners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, totally awesome job Jean!\" Kitty giggled as she and the other girls complimented Jean. \"Yeah. Who know Miss. Perfect has a slobby side to her?\" Rogue smirked. Jean smiled. \"Hey, I don't mind burping or farting myself when I'm alone. I just try to keep a polite guard up like my parents taught me.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen , Kitty felt something wet and stinky in her underpants. \"Um, guys? Like, I totally don't know about you, but I think I pooped my pants with my fart.\" she confessed. \"Me too.\" Tabitha agreed as she felt the same things in hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmara and Jean also agreed sheepishly as they felt their pants and discovered the same thing. \"Ah man. Ah can't believe we pooped our pants! Ah ain't done that since Ah was four.\" Rogue groaned in dismay upon discovering the same mess in hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, next time we should, like, maybe totally invest in diapers.\" Kitty joked slightly, causing the other girls to giggle and nod in agreement as they waddled slightly to their rooms for bed.   </span></div></div>",

By the time that she was done, she had gotten a large{technically speaking} gut that she took a moment to rub before moving on to her soda. This time, she actually flew inside the liter bottle and took a swim in the carbonated liquid as she gulped it down. Her gut was even larger now as she floated on her back in the drink.

Let's do this then.\" Jan smiled as she shrunk down and flew for the kitchen. Soon, the duo were sitting down at the counter, bottles of soda in front of them. Wasp, due to her size, had been given straws to use so she didn't need to fly into each bottle, mainly because, at her size, she would likely become stuck as she swelled up. \"You know, Jan, this is probably gonna be easy for you at your size.\" Pepper joked as Jan hovered in front of her first soda's straw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJan rolled her eyes in amusement, knowing that Pepper was only trying to tease. \"Good luck, Pepper.\" she smiled back. Then, the duo began their contest. Jan began loudly slurping her first soda, a cherry coke, though its' straw, moaning as the cool, dark carbonated liquid flowed into her mouth, down her throat and into her chubby belly. Soon, she had finished this bottle and sure enough, felt the gas rising in her. After a second, she opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* She belched loudly, covering her mouth with slight embarrassment as Pepper laughed before finishing her 2 liter Dr. Pepper bottle. After a few seconds, Pepper felt the gas bubbling up inside her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRPP PPP!!* She burped louder and longer than Jan. At that, Wasp frowned in determination. \"It's on now!\" she declared as she began forcefully slurping up her Mountain Dew bottle, her belly rumbling and gurgling at how fast and hard she was chugging it. Seeing this, Pepper smirked and began picking up the pace as well, chugging bottle after bottle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the duo's bellies ballooned up with each soda they chugged, their burps becoming bigger, louder and deeper each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! !*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!! *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR RP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRR RRPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, two piles of empty soda bottles were in front of the duo. Jan looked like a miniature balloon because of her soda logged belly while Pepper looked like she was ready to give birth to triplets. \"This is it. The big standoff.\" Jan said, wobbling in the air slightly due to her current size having to handle a massive girth. Pepper smirked at that. \"You first.\" added Wasp with a smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPPPP PPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper's belch rang through the kitchen and echoed through the (thankfully) empty mansion. Wasp suddenly felt nervous. What if her final burp wasn't good enough? Pepper smirked as she eyed her tiny, bloated challenger. \"Looks like I win, Wasp.\" She smiled. Then, Jan felt her tummy rumbling and gurgling much louder than before due to her quick chugging. Her cheeks puffed up as she felt the buildup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUU-UUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPP PPPPPPP!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasp's burp filled the whole mansion and caused it to shake violently. Pepper was shocked that a tiny woman like Wasp could out-burp a normal sized one like her. \"I win.\" Jan smiled as she rubbed her somewhat deflated belly in delight. </span></div></div>",

The male Avengers were gone for the weekend, giving Jan the run of the mansion. So, she'd invited the trio over for a girls weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do?\" asked Jane from the sofa where she and Pepper were relaxing. \"I was thinking we could have a competition.\" offered Hill. \"What kind?\" Pepper asked in surprise. \"An eating competition. To see who can gain the most weight.\" Hill replied with a slight smile. The other ladies were quiet for a moment as they considered the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that sounds pretty cool.\" Jan shrugged as Pepper nodded after a moment. \"I'm not sure about this, Maria. I mean, too much weight is unhealthy without exercise or anything.\" Jane warned. \"It'll be fine, Foster. It's not like I'm saying we become blobs.\" Hill replied calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the four headed into the kitchen and began grabbing different foods. Soon, they had covered the whole dining room table in the food. Burgers, pizzas, hot dogs, corn dogs, doughnuts, pie, cake, PB&amp;J sandwiches, cookies and other foods were sitting on it, waiting to be devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four women sat down eagerly. \"Alright. Remember the rules: no stuffing food in your clothes and no stopping until you're feeling or are full.\" Hill told them. \"Right.\" Jan smiled as she eyed the massive platter of hamburgers in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark... get set... GO!\" Hill shouted. With that, the four began loudly inhaling the food. Jan stuffed three burgers into her mouth at once and swallowed them whole with a giant gulp before stuffing five in at once a minute later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a determined yell, Pepper began PB&amp;J sandwiches into her mouth at top speed while Hill rolled up and then devoured a whole cheese, mushroom, pepperoni and anchovies pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was nervously eyeing the food in front of her. As a nurse, Jane was uneasy about stuffing her gullet like this. But, she did want to win despite herself. So, taking a deep breath, she began stuffing her mouth with hot dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four women kept eating at top speed and stuffing themselves. After the burgers, Jan moved on to the doughnuts while Hill began gulping down cookies and soda pop. Both of their bellies were becoming visibly bloated and rounder with each moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPepper, having inhaled her sandwiches, began wolfing down the pies while Jane scarfed down tacos after finishing her hot dogs. The four kept eating and eating and growing bigger and bigger with each course devoured. None of them were willing to give up even as they began feeling queasy from their stuffings. </span></div></div>",

The other guys were gone for a few days so the girls decided to have a girls' thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, they were currently watching a movie in the rec room. As they watched, Carol took a swing of cherry coke and then opened her mouth. *BBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRPPPP!!!* She belched loudly. \"Woah! Nice one, Carol!\" Jan smiled. Pepper and Jane eyed each other. \"I admit that was impressive, Ms. Marvel. But I think us normal ladies can out-burp superhuman ones.\" Pepper said in her calm manner. Carol smirked at this remark. \"Really? You think regular females can out-belch ones like me and Wasp?\" she asked with a slightly arrogant tone. \"I'm with Pepper on this one, Carol. I know several females like us who might pull that off.\" Jane agreed as she took a handful of popcorn and began munching on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet?\" Carol asked. Jane and Pepper were quiet for a long moment. Then, they nodded. \"Until Tony and the others get back, we'll have a burping contest each day.\" said Pepper. Carol looked at Jan. \"What do you think, Jan?\" she asked. \"I'm game, I guess.\" Jan agreed with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually have an idea to make things interesting.\" Jane offered. \"What?\" Jan asked. Jane reached into her duffel bag and pulled out four big, fluffy diapers in each of the fours' sizes.  \"You joking?\" Carol remarked as she eyed the diaper being handed to her. It was bright white with her symbol on its' back where her butt would go. \"Nope. I think this'll be good for us. This way, we don't need to waste time with using the toilets.\" Jane explained. The other three were quiet for a second, but ultimately decided Jane was right and began pulling and taping them on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's diaper was bright blue, like her medical uniform. Jan's was white with a rainbow on its' back (Jane explained that she'd tried to find a diaper with Jan's costume pattern on it, but was unsuccessful and so figured Jan would like the childish ones). Pepper's was red and gold, like Tony's armor. This earned Pepper an teasing giggle from Wasp while Pepper blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the four were securely in their diapers. Jan looked her butt to see how much it filled her diaper. \"I like them. They're like a big fluffy pillow.\" She smiled. \"I gotta admit, these aren't half bad.\" Carol agreed as she kept eying her diaper. Pepper simply nodded her agreement to the positive comments as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later found the four in the kitchen with numerous sodas in front of them. Their plan was to have their burping contest first and then possibly have a farting contest afterwards.</span></div></div>",

Now, it was down to Jan and Jane. Jane went first in doing her final burp. She chugged down her Coca Cola loudly and then waited after tossing the empty bottle aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP P!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe belched loudly with a smile, confident that she'd won. \"Your turn.\" She told Jan. Wasp swallowed nervously and then chugged down her final grape soda. After a moment, she felt, to her surprise, a massive amount of gas raising up in her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU UUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe burped very loudly, sending the other three flat on their backs to their complete surprise. \"Nice one, Jan!\" Carol whooped as Jan smiled, her cheeks bright red. Jane and Pepper eyed each other in disbelief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys may've won that one, but how about we have that farting contest?\" Pepper offered. Jan and Ms. Marvel looked at each other. \"You're on!\" Carol said as Jan merely nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Pepper squatted down and began grunting and straining. After a few seconds of waiting and looking like she was gonna take a dump, she felt the gas coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTT TT!!* She farted loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, Pep.

Then, it happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR RRRRRRRCCCHHHHH!!!* A massive poot escaped Jan's diapered butt that trumped Pepper's 1st fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing.

Her face went completely red and sweat actually started to run down her face as she did so.

Barol beally bon bat bound!\" Jane answered in agreement, pinching her nose shut as well while Jan merely giggled as she held her nose.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't just her belly that'd grown larger though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was now round and doughy, with a double chin, her hips, butt and thighs had all blown up with blubber as well and her arms, fingers, hands, feet, toes and legs all resembled soft, squishy sausages. She'd also gone up in size regarding her diapers as they were now extra large and stretchy adult diapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jan, come on! It's time for breakfast!\" Carol called outside her room. \"Coming!\" Jan called excitedly as she ended up having to roll herself over the edge of her bed  (after carefully putting the rest of her cake into her mini fridge). \"OOmph!' she grunted as she plopped onto her massive diapered booty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter recovering, Jan slowly walked up to the door and opened it to reveal Carol. But this wasn't the same Carol from a month earlier. Like Wasp, Ms. Marvel had gone from slim, trim, crime fighting machine to overweight heroine. Her face was plumper and double chinned, her arms, legs, feet, toes and fingers had all puffed up like sausage, her belly bulged over the waistband of her own extra large and stretchy adult diaper, her boobs were squishier and jigglier, her butt was rounder and juicier looking and her hips and thighs had a nice layer of squishy fat on them. Carol Danvers, in a word, was F-A-T. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for breakfast?\" Jan asked as they walked to the elevator, feeling too lazy to use the stairs. \"Jane wouldn't say. She just said we'll love it.\" Carol shrugged as she scratched her large belly while it rumbled in anticipation of the hopefully elephant-sized breakfast they were gonna have. \"If it's anything like those massive omelets she made last week, it's bound to be yummy.\" Jan smiled, licking her lips in her own anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo reached the kitchen/dining room to find Jane and Pepper already there. Like their heroine friends, the two normal women had rounded out nicely as well, though they were somewhat porkier than the two 200 pound Avengers. Jane sported a triple chin on her fat, doughy face, her belly was considerably bigger, hanging over the waistband of her bigger adult diaper, and her whole body was overall sumo sized, with bigger boobs, wider hips and thighs and so on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same held true for Pepper. Tony's aid and secretary had swollen up considerably herself. No longer was she skinny or twig looking. Instead, she was around, roughly 210 pounds, sported a triple chin like Jane on her doughy face, bigger and fatter hands, fingers, toes, feet, legs and butt, chunkier thighs, boobs and overall massive body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning guys.\" Jane smiled as she worked away on breakfast at the stove. Pepper was at the table, sipping a cup of coffee while wearing only her now tighter looking bra and her own stretchy and extra large diaper. Upon seeing her friends, Pepper merely smiled and nodded as she went back to reading the newspaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Jane had whipped up their massive breakfast. It contained 3 huge plates of pancakes, 2 plates of waffles, a huge frying pan of bacon, a plate of buttered and jellied toast, a platter of doughnuts and a basket filled to overflowing with large, fluffy buttermilk biscuits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane, you really outdid yourself this time.\" Pepper smiled as she eagerly grabbed a piece of toast smeared with grape jelly, taking a shark sized bite of it. Jan, meanwhile, grabbed a huge stack of pancakes and began inhaling them while grabbing a giant handful of bacon and doughnuts as Carol and Jane did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the massive breakfast was gone, every plate, tray, pan and basket licked clean. \"Man, that was probably the yummiest breakfast yet, Jane.\" Wasp giggled as she patted her massive gut, stuffed to the brim of the unhealthy breakfast feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did have a motive.\" Jane smiled as she stood up and, to the others' surprise, squatted down and began pushing and grunting. *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRCCCCCCCCCH HHH!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, Jane's diaper was sagging with poop. \"It's time for our pooping rematch.\" She explained with a smile. The other three smiled. \"Me next! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!\" Jan squealed in delight, bouncing up and down, her belly, boobs and arms jiggling like Jell-O. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jan. Go ahead.\"  Carol smiled as Jan squealed again and squatted almost as soon as Carol finished saying this. After a moment, *PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!* Jan was now also sporting a full diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarol smirked and squatted her massive diapered butt down as well as she began grunting and straining hard herself.<br>\r\n *BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!* Now her diaper was equally poopy as Jan and Jane's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well, how about this for size?\" Pepper smirked as she squatted down and began pushing and straining herself. With a massive fart, her diaper bloated up with a massive dump herself, causing the others to smirk at her. \"Oh, it's so on now.\" Carol smirked as Jan and Jane smiled in equal delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on it went, the four girls' diapers becoming more and more poop filled. Finally, after it was all over, Jane and Pepper had won again. \"Yes!\" Jane cheered as she and Pepper high fived and belly bumped, their bodies jiggling like crazy as a result.</span></div></div>",

Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Falcon, Hulk and the other FF members were busy elsewhere for the time being. The two women had decided to spend the time having an eating contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, the duo were sitting in the kitchen, most, if not all, the food piled in front of them. There were cakes, pie, ice cream, hamburgers, doughnuts, hot dogs and fried chicken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to lose, Storm?\" Black Widow asked with a smirk to her opponent. Sue merely smirked back in response. \"Are you?\" She asked calmly. Natasha merely rolled her eyes in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On your mark... get set... GO!\" She declared as she grabbed a large hot dog and shoved it into her mouth before also cramming a large bacon cheeseburger into her mouth as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue merely smirked as she grabbed a large drumstick and tore into it, smearing grease on her cheeks and lips. After finishing that, she began inhaling the rest of the fried chicken before moving on and grabbing a handful of doughnuts, which were immediately crammed into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Widow, meanwhile, was shoving slice after slice of a big lemon meringue pie into her mouth, moaning in delight at the taste each time. After that pie was gone and the tray licked clean, Natasha grabbed a chocolate banana cream pie and simply smashed her face into it, eating it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contest continued with Black Widow and Invisible Woman stuffing themselves with all the food on the table they could cram into their mouths at once. After the pies, Widow began scarfing down the cakes while Sue then began inhaling burgers and hot dogs before they both moved to the ice cream sundaes, their bellies starting to bloat and bulge visibly under their uniforms as the contest wore on and on as the hours ticked by. </span></div></div>",

By the thirty minute, She-hulk had eaten one thousand Gamma burgers and developed a big green gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick was beyond excited as he watched the number of views for his show go higher than after the Kree Invasion!

But there were a few commenters who said that the male Smashers, like Rick, could easily out-eat her. This got her blood boiling, but not as much as someone who called her burp weak! They even challenged her to a belching contest live on Rick's next show! She became so angry that she accepted the challenge.

But now she seemed determined to give it a go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Betty arrived at Gamma Base for the challenge. \"Hey, Jen.\" she smiled. Jen, her belly still swollen, glared at her. \"So my burp's weak, huh? Well, we'll see who's belch is weaker at the end of this challenge, Ross.\" She snarled as Betty simply nodded. \"I guess we will.\" she agreed and went to get ready.

Betty merely nodded as she eyed the massive collection of sodas in front of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready... set... GO!!!\" Rick called a minute later. Jen immediately grabbed a 2 liter bottle of root beer and started loudly guzzling it down while Betty grabbed a 1 liter bottle of orange soda and began gulping it down. Seeing this, Jen smirked as she tossed her first bottle aside. \"At this rate, Betty, you're not gonna win.\" she smirked as she grabbed another 2 liter, this time a cherry coke, and guzzled it down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty frowned at the comment and began picking up her pace. Bottle after bottle began piling up beside the two ladies as their bellies kept swelling and swelling like balloons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the duo finished the last bottle in their respective piles and then leaned back, rubbing their swollen tummies. Jen looked like she'd been inflated by a pump since she was as round as a balloon while Betty merely looked like she was eight weeks overdue to give birth. Then, Jen's belly rumbled loudly as she kept rubbing and stroking it. Her cheeks puffed up and then... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*UUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPP PP!!!* She let out a massive burp that shook the room. \"Woah! And Shulkie leads the challenge with a beautiful burp!\" Rick smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Top that, Ross!\" Jen jeered with a smirk. Betty frowned and began straining so much, her face turned red from the effort. Slowly, her belly began gurgling and rumbling as her cheeks puffed up. </span></div></div>",

In all honesty, She-Hulk felt a little upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently, she'd learned that, out of all five Agents of S.M.A.S.H., she was the lowest on the popularity scale. Sure, she'd never really cared to be popular, but still, it wouldn't hurt to be the most popular, at least once. Right now, she had no idea how to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she wandered into the fully stocked kitchen, Jen got an idea. \"<i>Of course! That's how I can become more popular! I'll gorge myself on food and become obese! People'll be sure to notice me more then!</i>\" She told herself mentally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning widely, Jen then grabbed 6 huge bag of potato chips, three large jars of chocolate chip cookies, 5 cartons of chocolate ice cream and 3 huge marble cake before taking them all to the rec room and turning on the TV. She ripped open the first bag of chips and began shoveling the massive handfuls into her mouth, chewing loudly as she began vegging out in front of the TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours went by as She-Hulk kept eating and eating and eating and eating and eating and eating and eating nonstop, her normally trim tummy slowly losing it's sturdiness and begin replaced by soft, squishy and large blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, She Hulk was snoring loudly as she sprawled on the sofa, empty cartons, jars, bags and cakepans littered around her as she dozed, one green hand on her bulging gut as it grumbled, rumbled and gurgled in delight at the junk food feast currently digesting inside of it as Jen snored and drooled slightly in her sleep while dreaming of endless junk food feasts being fed to her.</span></div></div>",

Hulk, A-Bomb, Red Hulk and Skaar had all gone away for the month, leaving her alone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis worked wonders for Jen as she could now do something she'd wanted to do for months. First, she went into the massively stocked kitchen and grabbed numerous cakes, pies, candy and cookies, taking them into the rec room. Then, She Hulk went into her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came out a few minutes later wearing a large, fluffy diaper under her costume. \"Okay. 'Jen Walters' Month of WG and Diapering' begins now.\" Jen smiled as she plopped onto the sofa and turned on the flat screen TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the first show began playing, Jen grabbed a large chocolate cake with both hands and began taking giant bites out of it, smearing frosting on her face as she did. After finishing it and licking the plate clean, Jen then grabbed a platter of cookies and began loudly gobbling them down, crumbs sprinkling onto her costume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on this went as Jen kept vegging out in front of the boom tube, her belly growing bigger and rounder as she kept gorging it with fattening, sugary and greasy snacks. Soon, *UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRPPPPPPPP!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJen belched loudly as she lounged on the sofa, her massive green belly bulging out, rumbling and gurgling quietly as she rubbed it. \"Man, this is gonna be a great month.\" Jen smiled as she poked her massive gut, causing a gentle 'burp' to escape her frosting and crumb covered lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, *PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT!!!* With that massive fart, Jen felt her diaper fill up with her large poop. \"Shulkie made a 'tinky!\" She giggled like a little 2-year-old girl in diapers as she smooshed the poop against her green butt in delight.</span></div></div>",

After a few minutes, Betty felt something starting to exit her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*PPPPPPPPOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!* A giant smelly fart later and Betty had a decently filled diaper. \"Your turn.\" she smiled at Jen, who calmly squatted down as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRR RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPPP!!!* Jen let out a giant fart and a bigger load of poop entered her diaper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that?\" She asked sweetly to Betty, who frowned in annoyance at Jen's bigger poop and fart. \"It's on now, She Hulk.\" she snarled in fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on this went, the duo repeatedly farting and filling their diapers more and more, each poop and fart getting larger and larger with each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, a very full diapered Betty and Jen sat down, their butts smooshing their massive loads of poop as they did. Though Betty had fought hard, Jen turned out to be the bigger pooper out of the duo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good match, Jen. But I'll beat you next time.\" Betty smiled. Jen simply grinned at her friend and rolled her eyes at the promise. \"Time for me to get a fresh diapee!\" she squealed, once again sounding like a two-year-old. Betty sighed and rolled her eyes, but nevertheless began changing her friend's massively full diaper.</span></div></div>",

Doreen thought about it. \"Yeah, I guess we could.\" she smiled as she followed Kamala into the dining room. Doreen nearly yelped in surprise. The table had two massive platters of fairly large cupcakes on it. \"We each try to eat as many cupcakes as we can. Whoever eats the most wins.\" Kamala smiled. Doreen was quiet for the longest time before she smiled at her BFF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring it on, Kamala!\" Doreen smirked as she sat down alongside Kamala. \"On your mark... get set... EAT!\" Kamala declared as she grabbed two cupcakes and shoveled them into her mouth and swallowing them whole. Doreen, meanwhile, calmly popped six cupcakes into her mouth, puffing her cheeks up like a chipmunk as she chewed and then swallowed them with a big gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Kamala quickly shoveled 10 cupcakes into her mouth by slightly embiggening her hands and grabbing five in each one. By now, her and Doreen were slowly starting to bloat up weight wise.  Of course, Doreen was already somewhat thicker built than the normally skinny-as-a-railing Kamala, but now this was actual blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamala tried to push this aside as she grabbed ten more cupcakes and loudly gobbled them down, her belly swelling up even more. Doreen just smiled as she also kept gorging on the massive cupcakes, her own body slowly rounding up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the duo leaned back and burped loudly in pleasure. Though Kamala had tried her best, it was Doreen who'd won the contest. \"Nice... going... D.\" she panted, rubbing her gurgling and rumbly gut of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... Kamala... I... gotta admit... you definitely gave me... a run... for... my money.\" Squirrel Girl panted as she rubbed her own big fat boulder belly, stifling a giant burp with her hand, her cheeks puffing up as she did, causing the two fat superheroines to giggle as they spent the rest of the evening burping, farting and hiccupping loudly.</span></div></div>",
