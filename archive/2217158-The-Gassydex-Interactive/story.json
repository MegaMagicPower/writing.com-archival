It stared directly at him, doing nothing, almost like it was thinking about something. However, Hiro didn\u2019t have much time to think about the Eevee himself, because the fuzzy Pok\u00e9mon suddenly pounced on the trainer. Hiro was taken by surprise, and fell over onto his back.

Do not change this.<br>\r\n2) The Pokemon may be any gender, but sex in any capacity is not allowed.<br>\r\n3) Farting, shitting, and pissing are all okay.<br>\r\n4) No killing Hiro. <br>\r\n5) No humans being the ones gassing or shitting or whatever on Hiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm curious to see how this goes. Who knows, I might even use ideas and such from this in the official entries! I look forward to seeing what you create! </td>",
