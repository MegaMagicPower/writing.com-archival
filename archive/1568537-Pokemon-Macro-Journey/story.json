Its tails gently float in the breeze revealing more of its juicy plot, before it starts to descend on you. Immediately you turn and make a run for it, but couldn't run fast enough and soon <b> <i>-SCRUNCH-</i> </b> its left butt cheek smushes you. The Ninetales sighed and stared at the leaves floating by and felt a lump under its cheek and ground its plump butt down, completely unaware of your presence. Your body is flattened further by the grinding and you yell out in pain. The giant Ninetales however, wasn't pleased with its work and gave several bounces to even it out. The bounces pulverized you to a pulpy flattened mess. When the pokemon was content, it settled its butt down with full weight causing you to groan as your body creates a delicious <i> <b>-SQUISH-.</b> </i> The relentless weight off the Ninetales completely flattened you under its booty....</span></div></div>",
