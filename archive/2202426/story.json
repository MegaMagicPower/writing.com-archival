Recently he had been studying on machines and how to build them. Sinjin was in theater room working on his first invention the body swapper it was a machine with two chairs with wires attached leading to a red button between the chairs. He had just finish with the final touches and wiped the sweat off his face \u201cfinally I\u2019m done 4 weeks with no help and teachers asking what I been doing\u201d he said, \u201cnow all I need is to try it out on to see if it really works but who\u201d. There was a whole school to try it out on but the first people to pop into his head were Tori the most popular girl that everyone admired and knew, there was also Beck the guy all the girls loved and wanted to go out with, them there was Andre one of Tori\u2019s close friends he could swap with him and get to know Tori a little more, and then there was Cat the one girl he could easily trick into swapping with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight when Sinjin was going to make his mind up the principal called him on the intercom \u201cSinjin please report to my office I repeat Sinjin please report to my office thank you\u201d. He covered up the machine with a blanket and walked out of the theater. Moments later the door opened and who step in?</span></div></div>",

The puppy is so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing Cat however, the puppy went and jumped on her happily, not knowing he was in Tori\u2019s body. This knocked Cat over, as she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat seeing Tori like this confused her, but then Cat thought of it and said \u201cGood puppy?\u201d The puppy smiled and licked Cat\u2019s face, Cat smiled and giggled \u201cOk. A ha ha ha. Good puppy.\u201d She patted him, then she said \u201cSo if your the puppy, then where\u2019s...\u201d then she saw the puppy\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori thought \u201cOh good! Cat!\u201d Tori then jumped onto Cat, snuggling with her. Cat smiled and said \u201cTori! It is you! How did you and the puppy switch bodies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori then pointed with her puppy paw at the body swap machine, Cat examined it and saw a label that said \u201cBody Swap Machine. Created by Sinjin.\u201d Cat said \u201cSinjin? He made this machine, that switch you and the puppy\u2019s bodies?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori then realized this and nodded, thinking \u201cOnce we switch back, I\u2019m going to kill Sinjin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat knew she had no choice now, so she had Tori and the puppy hide behind curtains, saying \u201cStay here. Please be quiet. I\u2019ll be quick.\u201d And she ran out of the theater, leaving behind the puppy and a confused Tori, she went to Principle Helen\u2019s office, saying \u201cPrinciple Helen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen saw Cat and said \u201cYes, Cat? What is it? Shouldn\u2019t you be in class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat came up with a good lie \u201cYes, but I got a call from my family, so I went out into the hall, excusing myself from class, and they told me to come home, because my brother thinks he\u2019s evil and they need my help, and Tori\u2019s also sick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen thought this maybe like Crazy Steve, so she said \u201cIs he crazy?\u201d Cat sadly said \u201cYes, but-\u201c \u201cGo child! I\u2019ll excuse you for the rest of the day! Go help your family!\u201d Helen said, wanting to have no more crazy people in the world. She also said \u201cAnd tell Tori she can go too, and hope she feels better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat smiled and said \u201cThank you, Principle Helen! Bye!\u201d She exited the office, Helen sighed and said \u201cAnd I thought Crazy Steve was crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat went back into the auditorium and said \u201cHi you two.\u201d The puppy and Tori were happy upon seeing her. Cat carried Tori and had the puppy follow her as they exited the school without being noticed. Then Cat got her bicycle, and they went to a pharmacy store. Cat put a strap around the puppy\u2019s human hand, and to a pole, so the puppy wouldn\u2019t escape, she knew Tori would stay and not run away. She said \u201cOk you two. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went into the pharmacy, as Tori waited patiently with the puppy, who snugged with Tori. Tori then thought in relief \u201cThanks, Cat. Now we need to figure out how to find Sinjin to make him switch us back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat then walked out of the pharmacy with something in her hands, saying \u201cOk. Now let\u2019s go to my place.\u201d She got the puppy, Tori, and her bicycle and left the area, they arrived at Sam and Cat\u2019s house, as she parked her bicycle. She went in with both of them, as Sam looked at her from the couch and said \u201cHey kid. Your home...early...what is happening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat put the Tori next to Sam saying \u201cI\u2019ll explain in a minute, Sam.\u201d She had the puppy follow Cat into the bathroom, in which she closed the door. Sam shrugged and said \u201cOk.\u201d She looked at the puppy and said \u201cHey there. Cute puppy.\u201d She patted him, not knowing its Tori, Tori smiled and thought \u201cThat actually feels good. No wonder the puppy likes getting patted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, the puppy was sitting down on the floor, as Cat got opened the package she got, and pulled out a big diaper. Cat knows the puppy wouldn\u2019t follow how humans use the bathroom, so Cat had to do this so there wouldn\u2019t be any trouble. Cat said \u201cOk, puppy. Lie down.\u201d The puppy listened, and laid down for Cat. Then Cat pulled Tori\u2019s pants and panties off her body. Cat then unfolded the diaper and lifted Tori\u2019s legs, and slide the diaper under her butt. Then she put Tori\u2019s legs down, as she then taped the diaper on her body. She then put the panties away, but pulled Tori\u2019s pants back up over the diaper. Cat then had the puppy sat up, and hugged him smiling saying \u201cGood puppy.\u201d The puppy smiled too, liking the comfort he was given to his human butt, thinking people must be glad to have this on. Then, Cat has the puppy follow her back to Tori and Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puppy lied on the couch, smiling. Tori thought \u201cOk, puppy. That\u2019s not how I lie down.\u201d Sam was confused and said \u201cOk, Cat. What is going on?\u201d Cat then said \u201cOk, Sam. There\u2019s a body swap machine Sinjin build, and it happened to swap the bodies of Tori and a cute puppy I found. Now, we have to watch them until we find Sinjin and switch their bodies back.\u201d Sam at first, thought Cat was just joking, but then she looked at Tori\u2019s body, as she had her tongue sticking out, happily painting. That\u2019s what a puppy would do. Tori thought \u201cOk. I know your happy puppy. I\u2019m just glad we\u2019re safe.\u201d Sam then widened her eyes and said to Cat \u201cWow, kid. That\u2019s some story. Ok, I\u2019ll help you, but you clean the messes while I help find that Sinjin kid.\u201d Cat smiled and said \u201cThank you so much, Sam. That would be wonderful.\u201d She hugged Sam, and she reminded her \u201cNot a hugger.\u201d Cat quickly ended the hug, but Sam smiled and said \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do this kid.\u201d They bumped butts as they waved and Sam exited the house saying \u201cMake sure they don\u2019t cause trouble, ok kid?\u201d Cat said \u201cPromise, bye Sam!\u201d Sam said \u201cBye, Cat!\u201d Then the mission begins, Cat watching Tori and the puppy at home, while Sam goes to Hollywood Arts to find Sinjin.</span></div></div>",

Cat ran to the restroom and grabbed a ponytail to tie back Tori\u2019s hair so buddy wouldn\u2019t eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan this sucks I can\u2019t communicate with Cat at all.\u201d Tori though, \u201cand I\u2019m so hungry wait a minute I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoof woof woof woof.\u201d Tori said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you hungry Tori.\u201d Cat said as she reached into her bag from the pharmacy, \u201cI got this bag of dog food at the pharmacy for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat grabbed a bowl from the kitchen and put food in it. She walked back over to the living room and put the bowl on the floor.

She started eating it faster while Cat walked over to the kitchen with Buddy. Cat told Buddy to sit and he did as he was told. All the food in the fridge was nothing but junk food that Sam bought but that\u2019s when she saw a bucket of fried chicken Sams favorite food. Cat put a chicken leg on the floor and Buddy started eating it right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay that solves that problem.\u201d Cat said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori walked into the kitchen after finishing her dog food and saw the chicken leg that her body was eating.

Tori thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat picked up Tori and placed her on the table. She started scratching Tori\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww no wonder dogs like this.\u201d Tori though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Buddy started whimpering.

Buddy then extended his leg to the back of his head and started scratching. Cat looked over at Tori and started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny hahaha he\u2019s using your feet to scratch himself hahah I didn\u2019t even know you were that flexible either.\u201d Cat said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeither did I.\u201d Tori thought.</span></div></div>",
