You were prepared to wake up in a crazy place with a hangover but you weren't prepared to wake up on a giant sized workbench in some kind of futuristic lab. You were sitting on the bench looking around. Something about this giant room felt very familiar. Like you've been here before, but you couldn't quite remember, it's right on the tip of your tongue. Maybe looking around the room could help you. You see many giant sized items throughout the lab. Things you'd expect such as beakers, tools and other lab equipment. Then there seems to be the more odd objects like a lipstick, a bottle of nail polish and a light blue bra. So you've figured that one of the workers must be a female. And a pretty big one at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around even more and see something that really catches your eye. A picture, facing the opposite direction. Maybe this will help you figure out where you were. Once you get to the front of it, you see a picture of a couple. It was an old man with grey hair and a much younger blonde woman next to him. They also look familiar, it feels like you need one more clue and you'll figure out this entire puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you see something that pieced the entire puzzle together. It was a symbol on the wall with two CC. You remember seeing that sign as Capsule Corporation. And you were in Capsule Corp!. As in the fictional lab in the Dragon Ball Series. This would be amazing if you weren't so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly You hear the sound of a door sliding open on the other size of the room. And you see the blue haired beauty herself.

But you also noticed she her famous micro band on her wrist ! Maybe that was your chance to get at last a decent size, but you fist needed to get her attention.

H\u00e9h\u00e9 i'm sure this will be usefull someday ! \" The girl began to yawn loudly. \" all right let's take a rest for some minutes.\" Bulma took another sip of her soda and suddenly leaded toward your postion...the bench ! You couldn't be so lucky, and you began to shake your arms with hope she'll see you..but it didn't happen, and she was coming dangerously closer. You tried to scream also, but it was too late as she turned back, about to sit on the bench...and you !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you manage to escape in time ?</span></div></div>",

The pressure was intense, and the pain unbearable, maybe the worst thing was the fact that you were still alive and enought conscious to realize your own suffering. Not to mention that the giant butt didn't allow you to scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" hmmmm ? \" Bulma noticed something as she drinking. \" What's that ? \" She began to twist her bottom from right to left, adding more pain to your situation...but at last her move managed to get you under her crack, which caused you to feel less pain as you were not receiving all her weight on you anymore. You were only blocked. Bulma took her time to finish her drink and finally stoop up, giving you some fresh air after living a strong experience under herself. She was about to leave, when a strange noise from her micro band got her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" What's the....?\" was all you could hear before Bulma disappeared in front of you ! You wondered what just happenned and approached the edge of the bench, when you saw her...as small as you, trying to regain balance to not fall on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" This thing doesn't work at all !! I almost died because of it !! \" Bulma yelled with anger, unaware that you were behind you. As you didn't want to surprise her and make her fall, you decided to slowly get closer until she finally turned back to face you. \" AAAAAAAH !!!\" She screamed. \" Hey...huh sorry i didn't mean to scare you....\" You replied sincerely.  \" Who are you and why are you small ?! Wait !! It was you under my bottom right ? Admit it !! How did you shrink ?! \" Bulma was now taking her anger on you and that was not good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" i can explain...in fact i was hoping you could help me to get back home, but i don't know if that's possible so...maybe you can help me to get my size back with your micro band ? \" You asked clumsily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No way. \" Bulma just replied. \" Wh...why not ? Please i don't want to be like that forever...\".  \" I don't know you, and this micro band is only for myself not anyone else ! \". Bulma made a point, she didn't know you. But on the otherside she was also childish...You walked toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go any closer !! \" the girl warned. \" Please relax i swear i have no other intentions than...\" but it was too late, Bulma had a step back and lost her balance, and in her insinct she caught your arm bringing you with her !! You both landed hardly on the ground. For someone like Bulma, that was something relatively painfull considering she was a character from an anime...as for you, you were glad you were on her body, otherwise you would probably be dead right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get...away...from me !! Little perv ! \" the girl pushed you back and got back on her feet. Before you could do the same, she place her right foot on her chest to keep on the ground. Her sneaker was pressing your body already injuried by her butt some min ago, which hurt a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm now going to grow back, see you in some sec when i'll be a giant for you hehe...\" she said giving you fear.  \" Wait...where's my micro band ? \". You noticed that there were nothing on her wrist. The fall probably broke it, you thought..Bulma looked around and saw it a few step away. She began to run toward it, you knew there was no way you could get it before her and you started to fear for your life, your body trembing. What could you possibly do ?</span></div></div>",

However you have to get to the other side of the room first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was on the other side of the lab, she wouldn't hear you. So getting near her is plan A. You look around the workbench seeing anything you can work with to get down. That's where you see Bulma's work lab coat. Hanging on a revolving chair. Getting a running start you leaped from the workbench and caught yourself on the white fabric of the coat. Gripping on the coat, you shimmy your way down the coat, making sure that you won't fall to the ground and break your everything. After some careful climbing. You reached ground level. You look to see Bulma still working on the same piece she was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some walking you finally arrived at the foot of Bulma. You were simply flabbergasted at the size she was. Seeing her across the room was one thing, seeing her towering right in front of you simply was a different story. You didn't even come past the top of her foot. It looks like one of her fingertips could pin your entire body. You having to crane your head just to look her in her face. You realized that there was possibly no way she would hear you from all the way down there. You would either need to get her attention or climb to a more hearable position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about both options you decide to ___________</span></div></div>",

Since she's wearing boots, jean and a full shirt as well as a scarf. This gives you a lot to grip onto when climbing. Deciding to not put it off anymore, you walk up to her boot and climb on top. You walk towards the top of the boot and grip on to the jeans. After making sure you've got the fiber you start climbing. Every now and then you will look up to make sure that she's still working on whatever she's working on and not getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up her jeans, making it past her calves, her knees and finally you made it her thighs. You decide to take a little break and sit on her thighs, more specifically near her lap. You look up at the blue haired girl. You couldn't help but admire how she was very beautiful. It's weird that her husband is obsessed with training and yet she's manage to keep a slim, non muscular gorgeous body. You actually are getting impatient and want to climb her body even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab her white shirt and pull yourself up. You can feel her stomach on the other side due to her tight shirt. After some more climbing you hit your head on a pound of flesh above you. You look up and notice that you bumped into the under boob of Bulma's melons. Using quite a lot of skill you climb the bottom of bulma's breasts. Using upper body strength to hold yourself as you climb around her breasts. You pull yourself on top of Bulma's breasts. You notice the opening of her top and you consider jumping down there to have the time of your life. It would be amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do, continue climbing or do you have fun in Bulma's cleavage?</span></div></div>",

You jump into the open cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you jumped in feet first, you felt both breasts part a bit as you fell straight in. Your surrounded by both breasts of Bulma. You sink in and get more and more into the cleavage, your so happy about where you are. You lean your head to the side and rest it on one of the breasts. You could literally fall asleep in here, hell you could die here and you wouldn't complain. You felt Bulma stand up as the breasts your in starts bouncing. You felt Bulma walk as your pinned towards <br>\r\nHer tight breasts. You hear doors open as Bulma walks thought Capsule Corp. you wonder where she is going, that was until you heard the sound of Bulma sitting. You then hear a drizzle of water coming from underneath and you realize whats happening. Bulma is in the toilet \"Nhggg\" Bulma said as you heard a turd fell into the toilet.

You start to run as fast as you can !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChichi openned her eyes with a smile. She had someone to take her company, and she knew this was not a dream.

It didn't take long for her to notice something running on her carpet and she knew this was not a bug. She turned angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" How dare you try to escape me ?! \"  She said while placing her feet on the ground. You get scared but you could see one way to avoid to get caught : you ran right between her gigantic feet near you and went under her bed just before her hand coming down for you could grab your body. You kept running to be sure you get enought distance, then you stopped to recover your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when the angry face of chichi appeared in front of you.

As soon as i'll get you you'll be punished ! \" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Please, i don't want to be impolite or something...but i have a life and i want you to give it back to me...\" You pleaded. You kept thinking that a mother of two sons must have an heart, even if she seemed heartless. It was your only hope after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChichi sighed, looking disappointed. \"Do you really think i won't take care of you ? I'm not cruel ! If i have to punish you that's only because you deserve it ! I've decided to be your mother, and the life you want to have is with me ! \" the giant woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Now come here and face your punishment because i won't leave this room until i get you. So you have nowhere to go ! \" She insisted. Maybe it was a chance for you, maybe you should accept your new life to make things easier. You tried your last chance to escape, and she couldn't be reasonned. What can you do ?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She smirked at that and looked at you  from between her toes. \"That's enough rub the other foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded relieved not to hear her say she wasn't satisfied, it might prologue your life.You run over to the other foot and shoved your shoulder into it's sole.You were grateful that it smelled no worse than the last one. She seems to take care of her feet much to your relief.You felt her soft skin against your palms, it almost felt like a mattress. Still you hope that she'll let you go soon, you really want to go home now. If only you hadn't bitten her daughter's hand, bigger or not she was still a child, you felt shameful for doing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" 18 closed her eyes being in complete bliss from her new little servant. \"Your doing such a good job, I almost forgot what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt hope hearing that. \"R-really?\" Maybe she's going to let you go after all! If you do a good enough job maybe she'll let you go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18 glared again and tapped her big toe against your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of her big toe that's bigger than your head forced on the ground on your back you were dazed seeing the ceiling spinning. Than you see what looks like the back of the giant woman's calf coming down on you. \"Wai-\" You couldn't say anything as her ankle pressed down against your chest, it drilled down more when she crossed her other foot over the one that's on you. You feel the feet relax on top of you, you were glad that they weren't on your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said almost forget, not forgive!\" 18 said sharply. \"You bit my daughter. It's going to be a while before I even think about forgiving you, I'm talking years, decades even.\" She pressed down her crossed feet causing you to scream in pain. 18 had an evil smile on her face. \"You make a great cushion at my feet.\" She noted.</span></div></div>",

You see the beautiful Mage Mirajaine behind the bar. Next to the guild master Makarov. You see Levy talking to both Jet and Droy, you see Happy trying to hit on Carla. And there's even Cana chugging a barrel. This is amazing! Or at least it would be if not for one small detail. The fact that your so small!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour shrunken and on the hard wooden floor in the middle of the Guildhall. Perfect for stomping range. You know there's got to be a spell which can reverse your size, you just have to get someone's attention. You look up at all the giant mages, walking around, some you recognized and some you didn't.  Luckily none were stepping near you, but that doesn't mean something didn't land near you. In fact a Real Man's unconscious body landing right in front to you. Almost squishing you unnoticed and underneath. You see Natsu standing above the defeated Elfman, asking for his newest challenger. Which came when Gray tackled him away. This guild was just as rowdy as you've seen on the show and you honestly love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously Elfman...why do you keep challenging him\" you hear from above as his little sister Lissana stands above him. Your amazed at her size and her body. All Fairy Tail girls are beautiful but seeing them like giants is something else She grabs him and drags him away towards her older sister behind the bar. Your just about to go over there too and get the friendly and beautiful 's attention.

You suddenly had to change your plans to avoid being smothered -- you ran as fast as you could off the pillow and into the sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the giant occupant lifted up the covers and slid in.

You slide down the pillow and run towards her face on the pillow. Since her eyes are closed she doesn't see your small form. Just as your about to yell and get her too look she shifted around the bed, trying to get comfortable. Jynx laid on her stomach and you found yourself stuck underneath her neck. However your not there for long as Jynx immediately felt you and grabbed you. Her slender fingers gripping you and bringing you out, you get pulled to her face and you can see that she is still to drowsy to see you as a human. \"Stupid bug\" Jynx said as she tossed you towards the foot of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land on the edge, on the verge of falling off. Your thankful that you didn't fall off. You see that your right next to her feet, her soles pointing straight at you from underneath the blanket.

Thinking Smartly you whisper gently in her ear \"Wake up, please wake up. I need your help\" at this, she did not wake up. You did it louder but once again she did not wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving onto the next idea. You grab her bottom lip, pulling it back trying to get her too wake up. Her eyes open slowly with annoyance as you see that she's woken up. However you don't see anything after as Jinx's hand swats you, squishing you into the pillow. You feel pain as the swat hurt every part of your body. Thanks to the pillow you weren't completely turned into a blood stain. The hand comes off of you and you see the annoyed half asleep face of Jinx. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems drowsy and annoyed as her eyes examined you. Noticing you were not a bug \"What the hell.

You were so confused where you were that you didn't notice the disturbing creature landing onto your platform until it was too late. You hear a loud landing behind you and turn around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see something that made you scared as hell. Before you was the literal meaning of a nightmare dog. It was bright green and it looked deranged and feral. Not only that but it was the size of a colossus. You didn't even come past the Canine's Paw. And to make matters worse, it was looking at you very hungry. It started to step towards you and you backed up afraid. That was until you hit the edge of the platform and couldn't back up anymore. The dog leaped for you and fearlessly you jumped off the platform. You expected to fall down but instead you just floated away, almost like you were in space. You see the dog look at you, almost like it was deciding whether it was worth it to chase down its pray. The feral green dog decided against it and jumped away. You wonder why until you turned around and saw a giant open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were floating directly to the door and landed on the inside. Not hesitating you step inside only to have the door close behind you. To say it was creepy would be a underestimation. Since there's no going back you decide to look around the room. It seemed to be a normal room, only just gloomier. There was some key items scattered around After being in the middle of the room the door opens again. You see a giant woman standing on the other side looking around \"Ok, who's got the nerve to invade my domain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did this girl look like?</span></div></div>",

But you need to get this woman's help. She walks closer to you and you feel smaller and smaller with every step that she takes. She stopped when her heel was mere inches away from you. You look up and see her face staring down at you. Still looking pretty angry. Her arms crossed over her moderate sized breasts. However you were more interest on the short skirt that gives you see a straight look to her red panties. She noticed you were looking there and said \"You little Brat!

It's weird how she's smiling at you know but before acted like she hated you. \"So your lost?\" the woman asked as she raised an eyebrow \"Uh yeah, I'm sorry I didn't intend to intrude in your home miss-\" \"My name is Spectra\" the woman replied finally giving you a name  \"Right miss Spectra.

You open your eyes expecting to see the roof of your small bedroom. You did see a roof but this wasn't yours, and it was also high in the sky. You quickly get up thinking you've been kidnapped. But as you look around you realize that was the last of your worries, as you notice the place you woke up. It was the room of a giant girl. A lot of things indicate this, the girly wallpaper and pink bed, the decorations on the desk and the fact that you can clearly see a diary up there. You wonder how you got here and more importantly why are you so small?. Before you can ponder those questions anymore you hear steps from outside the giant door, someone's coming in! You need to get their help. Since traveling around a giant house in only your boxers doesn't sound that appealing. The door to the room opens and you become shocked at what you see. Not just two girls entering the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n But the two girls being Wendy Testaburger and Bebe Stevens from the South Park Franchise. Sure they weren't all small and unrealistic like most South Park characters look like, the two girls look like actually girls. But there's no mistaking it that it's those two girls. Their clothes and their hair gives it away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay dad, we will be good, have fun with your thing!\" Wendy said to her dad as she kicked off her shoes and Bebe did the same leaving the girls in their white socks. Bebe closed the door keeping you from escaping. Both girls tread over to the bed almost crushing you under their unaware feet. You watch as both of the girls sit on the bed and start chatting about typical girl things. Like boys and shopping, you weren't really paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever you did hear when Bebe said to Wendy \"Is that a doll on your floor or something?.\" you look up to see both girls looking straight at you \"I don't own any dolls, maybe dad bought me one\". This could be good that they both saw you. On one hand Wendy has always been a responsible girl while on the other hand being in the care of a ________ Year old girl doesn't really sound to good.</span></div></div>",

Then again they look like actual girls not cardboard cutouts so maybe this isn't the South Park you knew. You watch as Bebe leaned forward on the bed. Her Caucasian hand surrounds you and you felt yourself get pulled off of the carpeted floor. You get pulled In the air and you see both of the girls staring down at you. Both with looks of shock. \"Is that..... Is that a little man?\" Wendy said to her other friend just making sure she's seeing the same thing in Bebe's hand. Bebe poked you with her index finger straight into the stomach. \"Oww, why did you do that?\" You say up to Bebe. Both girls gasped as they heard this \"He's not a doll, he's actually a real small person\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden your flipped over like a pancake in Bebe's palm. She starts inspecting you and you do feel a little embarrassed. being in only boxers being treated like a toy by some girls. She flips you over again and you yell \"Can you stop that\" \"Bebe he doesn't like it when you do that\" Wendy said to her teenage friend caring. Being the smart and responsible girl the creators have made her though out the series. Even at the warning, Bebe continues to inspect your body by poking your naked chest \"So what if he doesn't like. What's he gonna do\" Bebe said having fun. The smile she's giving yours making you feel very unsafe \"Bebe, seriously stop. He's still a person\" Wendy said to her. Bebe stopped poking you and turned to her friend. \"Wendy don't you see what we have here. It's a cute tiny man. We could do anything we want with him. And he could do nothing but listen\" Wendy gasp at her friends reaction and quickly grabs you out of her. She stands in front of Bebe with one hand on her hip and one hand carrying you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bebe, this is a man in need of our help\" \"No this is our chance to make it fair, you said it yourself that the boys in South Park don't respect girls, well this one will be forced to respect us.

The building looked quite grand too, almost making it look more like a mansion than a house. There's a clearing in just a little far from where you are which turns out to be a pathway for cars. It looks like someone who lives there must be very wealthy so with a house that big, you could try to seek shelter inside there (and probably get someone's help if needed).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk among the grass blades until you got to the vast landscape that was the pathway. So far, there were no cars around here which means nobody's home right now or at least that's what you think. Thankfully, the door wasn't that very far ahead so it'll probably take several minutes or so to get there. So with that, you make a dash to the entryway of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately when you got there, the entryway doesn't have stairs to get across the door so there's no need for climbing the steps. You walk to the door which towered above you, making you feel like an insect trying to get inside a house for shelter (which was you been trying to do at the moment). You look down at the gap and noticed it was very small, but at least you can make it inside by crawling in military-style.

After all of that, you finally made it to the staircase. The stairs themselves are also made out of carpet so you'll have a much easier attempt to get to the next floor.

Now that you know who's the owner, you still don't know wether or not she's reliable for help. As think about this, the school bell rings outside from the locker and you can hear the sounds of children walking down the halls; class must be over. You're glad that you are not standing in the middle of the hall because you doubt that you'll ever survive there. You just stand there and wait for that Trixie girl to come here and open her locker and after that, you'll try to contact her. And just in the nick of time, because you can hear the sounds of a lock turning around and the door opens. You quickly cover eyes due to the sudden light coming out, but it was only temporarily as you open them to see the girl named Trixie Tang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the very moment you saw her, your eyes grew big because of all the thoughts you could ever think about her, you never expect to see a type of girl like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst things first, Trixie appears to be quite tall for such a young age and appears to be of Asian descent. She has long black hair that was tied up by a purple headband and has some mascara paint over her eyes. She wears a lavender sweater, a white skirt and matching boots. She looks very attractive for a kid which was enough to make you just stand there and stare at her beauty; your mouth was even slightly dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Which was all you could say \"You know, maybe getting her attention doesn't sound necessary anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as Trixie combs her hair with her hand proudly and looks down to where you are. Did she found you? Not really, she was instead looking at her purse that was hanging on top of you. As she reaches for the purse, you make a quick climb up to the notebook and make a quick leap to the purse. You succeeded and as you were lifted up, you climb up and crawled inside (which was half-opened).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peak up from the purse and look above at Trixie. You never knew a young girl like her can be so beautiful that was enough to make even you look up and stare. Now that you were going with her, you can now be close to her whatever you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the looks of it, school must be over because Trixie is heading to the front door and outside the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere is Trixie going?</span></div></div>",

A few minutes pass and she decides to turn the tv off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from the couch, Marie begins looking around the room. Fortunately, she isn't looking for you, or any other mini-people, but you're curious what she IS looking for. Soon enough though, you get an answer, \"There you are,\" she says, holding a pair of yellow dumbbells, \"I may as well use these for once, didn't expect I'd ever pick these up after I got 'em for my eighteenth birthday. Thanks, May.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch her do some pretty basic lifting, but your attention soon turns towards her chest.<br>\r\nUntil she mentioned her age, or at least a minimum, you didn't notice, but she has a good looking pair of breasts... But that's not what you should be focusing on right now, you need to consider what she's saying. So far you know a few things that could be useful, at least if you ever have to converse with her that is, like her name, and the fact that she has sisters, May probably being one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you're going through all the information you have in your head about this situation, she's finishing up with the weights, \"Okay, I guess that's enough,\" she says as she sets them down and resumes sitting on the couch, \"But I'm still so bored. I feel like I'm gonna go crazy if I son't do something about it!\" she exclaims in frustration. After a few minutes, she decides to occupy herself with more exercise, this time with sit-ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you notice another detail of her body you hadn't before, this time it was even less expected.<br>\r\nWith her hands behind her head, you had an uncompromised view of her armpits, which each had a rather thick patch of hair growing from them. Oddly enough, they were the same blue as on her head, so for all you know, that might be her natural color and not just dye, as crazy as it sounded, but considering the rest of this situation, it's not exactly the biggest surprise you've gotten recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long later, she's finished again, ready to take a break until her boredom forces her to act once again.</span></div></div>",

She's got a nice ass. Wait, don't get distracted, her entire body is way bigger than you, so unless you get back to your normal size, assuming this world isn't just larger than your own, a relationship probably wouldn't work between the two of you, at least not one like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you start to smell something. All this exercise has gotten her hot and sweaty, and your nose seems a lot more sensitive than usual, either that, or the odor coming from her is really, REALLY strong. Not sure which you would prefer, you pinch your nose and go back to watching her instead of dwelling on questions you'd hopefully be free of soon. Alright, now she's done, and as you can see, she is indeed sweating a lot, something she notices as well, \"Oh great, now instead of being bored, I'm way too hot! I gotta cool down,\" she says, before doing something you definitely were not prepared for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie's shirt gets flung across the room, her idea of \"cooling down\" is stripping.Well, as long as she keeps her underwear on, this shouldn't get too weird, right?  The only thing keeping her breasts covered is a black bra, and you also notice two more things her shirt had hidden. She had a decent set of abs, not nearly as extreme as some comic book hero or a bodybuilder, but still more than you'd expect from a random trailer park girl. The second thing was that, much like her armpits, she didn't shave her pubes, as her bush is peaking out the top of her pants and trailing to her belly button, and again, all this hair is blue. \"That's better,\" she says, relieved to have more air on her body, \"but it's still not enough...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie reaches down and unbuckles her pink belt, then proceeds to drop her pants to the floor. You screamed in shock at what you had just now seen, and she heard you, \"Huh, what was that?\" she asks herself before managing to see you.<br>\r\nThe two of you make eye contact, and you doubt she's going to believe you weren't peeking at her like a perv.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was your audible reaction caused by? Her panties. They...</span></div></div>",

I've ran out of patience so wake up\" the girl said again sounding a bit meaner this time.

There's no possible way you could forget someone like this \"Disgust?\" you say in complete confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe emotion from the disney movie 'Inside Out', but it doesn't make sense. She isn't real, she's a fictional cartoon. You look away from her and notice that you were also in the hub room of Riley's brain. Which doesn't make sense at all either. You notice all the other emotions were absent currently and that you were on the panel that seems to control all of Riley's emotions. You turn around and see the gate way that shows Riley's life. She currently was in a school class with a boring teacher. So it makes sense that Disgust would be the only one taking control. You turn back to Disgust and that's when you realize this wasn't the Disgust that you remember. Her proportions were more to an actual girl then a cartoon. And she had a body like a fashionista. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes up here\" Disgust said as she saw you looking at your body. \"Uh sorry\" you Crane your head back up to her face \"So why am I-\" you question got cut off as Disgust reached down for you and used two green fingers to squeeze you and lifted you up.

She didn't have an answer just like you didn't have one either \"So your my imaginary friend?\" disgust asked you, with you nodding in respond \"Which mean I created you?\" you nod once again \"Which means you belong.........to................me\" Disgust said talking down at you in her fingers, a superiority smile glued to her face. You became covered in fear as you realize the position you've put yourself in. You nod your head once again figuring your to tied into the web of lies to back down. \"You know I was having a bad day when I woke up, Joy took the shower, Fear spilled some coffee on me by accident, Anger yelled at me when he did his daily explosion and sadness's wardrobe!. Ehhhhhh!\" she said making a gag face \"But now that I have you, I feel like today is my luckiest day ever\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps coming towards the hub room and you panic \"Quickly hide me\" \"Why no one can see you?\" Disgusted retorted. Thinking quickly you say explain \"Thats not how imaginary friend work in minds. They'll totally see me\" disgust seemed to agree with you not wanting to share you, Eapecially with Joy.

It was all green except her tongue and her lips which seemed to be normal human colors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Disgust saw the other four emotions that piloted Riley's mind. Joy, Sadness, Fear and Anger. \"Hey Disgust\" Joy said,.....well joyfully. \"Is Riley still in the class. Since disgust can't open her mouth and run the risk of you being seen she just nods her head up and down, unaware of how that's throwing you around inside her mouth \"Okay well recess is almost up, do you mind if I step in?\" joy asked which disgust once again replied with a nod. Disgust goes to walk off and go to her living quarters when all of a sudden Anger got in her way \"And where do you think your going, class isn't over!\" Anger yelled at her. Out of all the other emotions, Disgust dislikes Anger the most, maybe it's because their emotions are both negatives or because their personalities are opposites. She just doesn't like him. Begrudgely she turns around and walks back, ready for the lesson to be over with for Riley's Sake and Her's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware to Disgust, you were feeling every motion that she was doing.

You look up out of the glass and see Disgust staring down at you. \"Why did you do that, why didn't you just drop me in your hand\" you say as you tread water, not liking the way she just dumped you in the water \"Because you were covered in my saliva. There was no way I was touching you like that!\" Disgust said giving what she thought was a reasonable reason. Knowing Disgust's personality as a picky fashionista you shouldn't be surprised. Skipping the issue you look around and see that you and disgust were currently in the break room and the water she got for the cup was from the water Cooler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hurry up and take off your clothes so you can wash off the saliva properly.\" Disgust said acting like it was no big deal \"What...what are you saying!\" you say as you become incredibly flustered.

Don't worry I'll make you new clothes that are a lot more fashionable then those rags you have on\" \"That's not the problem!

And just like her emotion would indicate she's wearing a big smile upon her face. Just like Disgust, Joys proportions have been changed to match that of a normal humans, she's very tall as well as being very skinny. Not to skinny where it feels like she should eat more but skinny enough so you can call her skinny. Also judging from her height, you assume she's about a head taller then Disgust. But right now you shouldn't be focused on her proportions. You should be focused on the fact that Joy is reaching for the glass your naked form is swimming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her yellow fingers wrap around the glass of water and using insane strength lifts it up and brings it into the air. Small waves for you are caused from just the smallest of movements from Joy. These waves made it hard for you to stay on top. And what makes it worse is that Joy is tilting the drink towards her mouth. The water tilts with the glass and you could feel the unbelievable Current trying to push you to the giant Yellow face of Joy, more specifically her throat. You don't hesitate and start swimming the other way trying to get away from her mouth. Your swimming however wasn't good enough as you kept losing ground. Joy takes one gulp and all the water fell into her mouth with you swimming in it. You land in her mouth and Joy starts swishing the water around in her mouth. Throwing you around like you were in a washing machine. She tilts her hand up and gurgles her water like a child would do for fun. Once she stop you finally get a good look at the inside of Joy's mouth. Just like with Disgust, the walls aren't pink but the color that Joy is, that being yellow. But now's not the time to admire her Simpson Colored mouth you need to get out now. But how can you? Now that she has had her fun she's going to swallow the water and you as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut does she or does she get stopped?</span></div></div>",

Just like Disgust, Sadness is more realistic and looks like a cute chubby girl, well a cute chubby girl that is blue. What's really astonishing is the size of her breasts, her sweater looks like it can barely contain them. You watch as she bends over giving you a good view at her mountains, when all of a sudden she extended a hand towards the glass. You watch as the glass gets surrounded by her blue hand. She lifts the glass of water up and you could watch as she brings it to her face. Sadness then proceeded to close her eyes and open her mouth. Giving you a good look at the inside of her mouth. Her lips touched the glass and she tilted the glass, all the water draining into her mouth. Not hesitating you start the swim the other way, trying to fight the current. However the more Sadness tilts the closer you get towards her mouth. You start the panic swim trying to get away but your quickly losing distance. you look down and notice that you were going past her lips and before you knew it you were in her mouth. And you were on a direct course down Sadness's throat and into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for you Disgust decided to look if you finished changing, she was more than a bit surprised when she saw Sadness drinking the glass. \"Oh My God! Sadness Spit It Out!\" Disgust yelled at the other emotion. Sadness spat all the water in her mouth out and you went along with it. You would of hit the ground hard but the amount of water droplets seem to cushion your fall. \"What was wrong Disgust, did I do something wrong!\" Sadness said worried she did something to offend her friend. \"Where Is He? where Is He\" Disgust didn't listen however as she scanned the ground looking for any sight of her imaginary friend, what she didn't see was you right in front of her, and just about to be stepped on by her green heel</span></div></div>",

Your just waiting for the pressure to start and man did it start. Her heel slams down onto you almost like you were literally nothing. You felt your body get squished and flattened under the green girls heel, your body expand and gets turn into nothing but a smear and smudge. This really confuses as you should be dead, but you don't argue against the good fortune. Or bad fortune cause the pain is possibly worse than anything you've ever felt. And to make matters worse Disgust lifts her heel and you who is stuck and slammed you onto the ground, your stuck to her heel and Disgust is completely unaware of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he. Where is he!\" Disgust said getting annoyed \"What's wrong Disgust?\" Sadness asked \"I know you spat him out, I saw him leave your mouth!\" \"Disgust?\" \"I just need to keep looking, he's gotta be here\" \"Disgust\" \"OMG!! What do you want Sadness!\" Disgust yelled at Sadness causing her to start welling up with tears. \"I'm sorry for being such a bother Disgust\" Sadness then ran out of the room trying not to be seen crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadness, no its just-\" Disgust starts but stops figuring Sadness is to far away for her to hear. Disgust will apologize to her later but first she needs to find her imaginary friend. She simply doesn't understand where he could be, she search the landing zone from Sadness's spit take and still nothing.

Giant Beautiful Fairies! Two of them to be exact. The first one had a green shirt dress on and blonde hair that was done into a bun. The second one had a yellow and red outfit with a long braid at the back of her brown hair.

Fairy size to a fairy. If these two weren't such a gorgeous sight, you might actually be a bit angry.<br>\r\n\u2028Suddenly you hear steps behind you as you turn around. You step back and fall down as you watch a third giant fairy enter. This had had a blue dress on and long black hair. She also look like she was from eastern descent.

What about you two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing, i mean it couldn't have gone far, whatever it is\u201d The one called Tinkerbell said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just hope we get this done soon, the search is tiring\u201d The brown haired braid girl said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it has to be done fawn, whatever this thing is. It could be trouble\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below you were amazed at what you heard. They were looking for you! Honestly your kind of happy, having three giant beautiful girls looking for you. even more if possibly. Granted their fairies and you don't know if getting spotted by them would be your best option.

Little or no, forcing someone into servitude would make me no less evil then Bowser. On the other hand, friends are in very short demand for a princess.

Sorry, I just needed to step away there...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence that you used to regain your bearings. A bright orange and white wall crested upwards in front of you. To either side of you were extremely soft, skin-toned orbs, holding you gently in place. That skin traveled up behind you, and it was around this time that you realized Daisy had simply dropped you down the collar of her dress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went red, and your ears burned. You couldn\u2019t make out the rest of their conversation as your mind focused on your current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were so soft, plush even. Her skin was smooth, and warm. Very warm, in fact. You shifted slightly in discomfort. Definitely not feeling up the Princess\u2019s heavenly mounds, nope. Not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were brought back to the land if the living as Daisy began moving, your \u201cprison\u201d bouncing ever so slight as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaisy, please. Be reasonable about this!\u201d Peach\u2019s voice said from somewhere to your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing Mario\u2019s crazy party games with BOWSER of all people, Peach.

Her pace was quick, and your position bounced slightly in time with her steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay little guy,\u201d you heard Daisy whisper, apparently to you. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out back at my castle, just sit tight.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Princess!\u201d You shouted in return, hoping she had heard you. But you did hear a sighing chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you said, but keep it down in there.\u201d Your position bounced more heavily this time, presumably her response to you. You blushed slightly. Nintendo hadn\u2019t mentioned she was this sort of playful...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few minutes later that you could hear soft talking around her, and someone asking for tickets. You could hear her sit down, and felt her sit, too. You bounced with her chest, but to your surprise you slipped down further between her breasts.</span></div></div>",

You were already blushing, but her noticing your predicament made it somehow more embarrassing. And a bit hotter too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement was pretty literal. Your fleshy prison was quite warm, and you could feel your own sweat coating you, along with Daisy\u2019s. It was surprisingly intimate, if a little disgusting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour situation didn\u2019t change much for the next few hours, aside from becoming a but more confined as Daisy somehow managed to squeeze her breasts together even more. You wondered how discreet she was being, or if she was simply alone wherever she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she had stood when your entire world started bobbing with each step, your entire body feeling each of her steps. Another few minutes, and the bouncing slowed, a bit more light trickling into your prison as a pair of fingers reached in and plucked you from her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy had undone her collar a bit, and she held your tiny freed form in front of her face. Her smile was playful, and she didn\u2019t seem too embarrassed about the whole situation from moments before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell hello there, little guy. How\u2019d you get in there?\u201d Daisy said, her tone teasing. She giggled as she moved your tiny form to her other hand, setting you down on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on her gloved hand was quite an experience. It was huge, each of her fingers more than twice your height. It was warm too, even through the gloves. But her smiling face placed you in relative ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she continued. \u201cDoes the little guy have a name?\u201d You told her your name, shouting up at her. She nodded. \u201cWell, I think I\u2019ll stick to little guy. My name is Daisy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe curtsied with you in her hand, shifting your platform beneath you. You fell to your hands for balance, gripping her silk gloves tighty. You took a moment to take in where Daisy had taken you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly her bedchambers, the entire room themed like an orange creamsicle. A large canopy bed sat against one wall, a desk against another. Towards the far wall was a single table and chair, with a view out onto a balcony. In a corner, a divider sat next to a large wardrobe, a spare dress hanging over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy looked back at you, and you back at her. \u201cWell, I\u2019m beat, to be honest with you.\u201d Her posture sagged for a moment, but her expression was a bit more awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHows about we just wind down for the day?\u201d You hadn\u2019t had a chance to check the time of day, but looking out a large window, you could see that the sun had set some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did she have in mind?</span></div></div>",

Who wouldn\u2019t have liked to be squeezed by a beautiful girl\u2019s boobs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, giddy and somewhat proud of herself. \u201cI was slightly worried that you might not have liked it.\u201d She giggled. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have that <i>weight</i> off of my chest.\u201d She wiggled her eyebrows, and you couldn\u2019t help but chuckle and shake your head at the pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy simply nodded, then booped you on the head. \u201cNow, you ask!\u201d You were still shaking out the stars but you managed to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTruth or dare, Daisy?\u201d You rubbed your head, but Daisy had already averted her eyes, assuming a faux thinking face, before flashing you a toothy grin.</span></div></div>",

You weren\u2019t sure what her plan was, until you ascended right up to her face. You practically felt your eyes bug out of your head as her lips parted and you saw your destination: her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA half second later you were tossed onto her waiting tongue. Your clothes were immediately soaked in her saliva, and you barely had time to regain your bearings before her mouth closed with you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark, hot, and humid. Each breath you took might as well have been from the muggiest sauna. Her tongue was squishy and coated in saliva, that same liquid now coated you as well. Surprisingly, the smell was actually somewhat pleasant, mild strawberries and a hint of mint. That or your mind was doing leaps to try and wrap itself around your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world lurched, and you were pressed into her tongue momentarily. You could only assume that had meant Daisy had stood up, quickly, from her crouched position. You could hear her breaths escaping through her nose, somewhere above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world moved again, but this time it was the massive muscle beneath you that was moving. It lifted and flexed beneath you, moving you somewhere within the dark cavern of Daisy\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I might find you here...\u201d You could make out a distant, muffled voice somewhere outside of Daisy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the tongue beneath you shoved you against a soft surface and retreated. The saliva coating your body stuck fast, leaving you plastered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, a burst of light and a cacophony of noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201dOh, Peach! Sorry, I just needed to step away there...\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice boomed and the mouth around you quaked with the movements and vibrations of her conversation. Thanks to the bursts of light you were able to discern your position in the inside if her cheek, but the volume from inside her mouth left your ears and head ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaisy, I know its not something you agree with, but we can\u2019t just-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cCan\u2019t just not invite BOWSER? He kidnaps you or unleashes an ancient darkness every other month!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy\u2019s voice had increased in volume, and you clung to your ears to try and escape the noise. You couldn\u2019t even follow the conversation after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was clearly upset about something, and as your head threatened to split, you just wished she would excuse herself and take you out of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several agonizing... you\u2019re not sure how long, her voice quieted down and you began to get your bearings. She was now walking, her mouth bobbing with her footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t even bother to fight her tongue as the massive muscle pulled you from her inner cheek, leaving you lying in a defeated heap on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I panicked. I\u2019ll get us home and get you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice boomed around you, difficult to make out, but she was clearly speaking somewhere below a whisper. Her tongue had moved as well, but its movements were slow, as if considering your position. How considerate, you muttered, shifting your position on her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDAISY, I WAS LOOKING FOR YA!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming voice emanated from outside Daisy\u2019s mouth, and the Princess jumped in apparent surprise, her tongue rose up...</span></div></div>",

They spasmed briefly, halting your slide down, before you heard an audible gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a rush of movement around you as powerful muscle pulled you down, assisting the cruel mistress that was gravity, to your inevitable destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn the stars! Fuck you, Bowser!\u201d The voice sounded muffled, despite the volume, and you found yourself unable to hear any outside noises, the sounds of her body surrounding you completely. Her heartbeat was close by, and you could hear the rush of air flowing in and out of her lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rate of both was increasing as your undulating surroundings began to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took you a couple second more to reach your destination, but you could already smell the acrid stench below you. And, with an unceremonious splurch, you were squeezed into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was large, compared to you, and you couldn\u2019t tell where the light was coming from, your eyes having adjusted some time ago to the dim reddish light of Daisy\u2019s interior. You splashed down in a thick liquid that stung your skin. There wasn\u2019t enough to reach your knees yet, but you hadn\u2019t fallen gracefully, and your clothes were quickly soaked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou threw off your stinging clothes and clambered across the uneven and squishy terrain of the Princess\u2019s stomach. It didn\u2019t help that she was still moving, the entirety of her stomach tilting and shaking. You did manage to make it to a spot free of the acid, and began pounding the walls of her stomach uselessly. You could still hear her heartbeat, and her breaths, but they were far above you now. You were so small...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were worse places to die, you considered. But that didn\u2019t make the idea any more appealing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on little guy, please be all right...\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear her voice, still kinda muffled, but audible. You slammed the wall of her stomach, trying to give her any sign you were still alive. The shaking stopped, her fast heartbeat taking up most of the sound around you now.</span></div></div>",

All at once, the walls tensed, and the pressure rose, popping your ears. The acid on the floor rose slightly before you heard a distant rush of something below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour vision blurred and stung as you were suddenly swept away, back in a tight tube of flesh. This time, it stung, the acid joining you in what you hoped was an ascent. You had your eyes pressed shut, and had managed to get a hand over your mouth and nose, but it still burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was over as soon as it had begun. The light was too bright as you felt open, clean, cool air enter your lungs. You were spinning and falling, but that didn\u2019t matter, you were alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen bubbles. Lots of bubbles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWater, you had fallen in water, you thought to yourself. Your mind was no longer hazy, though hadn\u2019t even noticed that it was until the cold water woke you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir. Breathing. Right, you thought, trying to start swimming. You only managed to right yourself before a massive boom shook the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to look around, find the cause, but only saw a giant tan wall speeding towards you. Panic taking hold, you tried to swim away from the approaching danger, but too quickly it was upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was, it grabbed your panicking form and you began to rise with it. Almost as soon as it had you in its grip, you were clear of the water. Gasping breaths and trying to adjust to the bright lights, you heard Daisy speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank goodness you\u2019re alright! I thought, when Bowser startled me, that I had just killed you! I freaked out! I ran to the nearest bathroom and- and-\u201c She took a deep breath, and you were finally able to look at her from your lying position on the palm of her non-gloved hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tears in her eyes, either from vomiting you up or from whatever fear she had melting away. She wiped her eyes with her still gloved hand, giving you a moment to realize you were in fact in a bathroom. A huge, luxurious, gilded bathroom. Using the power of assumption, you gathered that she must have just fished you out of the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as how you had almost died in her stomach, you weren\u2019t too disgusted by this. And she clearly seemed sorry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy finished gathering herself, sniffing one last time as a more dignified and less emotional expression wavered onto her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, whats good is that you\u2019re fine! I got you out and you\u2019re fine...\u201d She rose from the floor, finally getting a look at you. She grimaced, apparently noticing your lack of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh. I\u2019m so sorry... your clothes are gone..\u201d Her eyes welled up again, her composure breaking. You quickly stood up on her hand, shaking your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, its fine!\u201d You shouted at the giantess. \u201cThey\u2019re just clothes! You got me out and I\u2019d say thats the important part!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled weakly, sniffing once more. \u201cWell, lets at least get you washed off.\u201d She emphasized this with a flush of the toilet you had just been in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell to your knees for stability as she walked over to a large sink, and you watched as she turned on the faucet. A small amount of water trickled out, and she gently set you down in the basin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ll get you some soap...\u201d You were already under the tap, cleaning off the stink of her insides. Daisy lowered a dab of soap on her finger to you, which you accepted, scrubbing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Princess watched you bathe, concern and worry etched on her face. She began talking as you washed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I saw you on the ground, I was ready to just pick you up and figure out what had happened to you, but then the door behind me opened, and I knew that if Peach saw you, she would take you to Mario and Toadsworth, and some sort of ridiculous adventure would start up again.\u201d She pouted a moment, displeasure clear on her face and in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re way too over the top. Bowser would probably get involved too, and the lot of them would end up fighting some elder god by the end of the week.\u201d She sighed and glanced down at your small form stepping out from under the tap. Her expression seemed more guilty now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I didn\u2019t want her to see you, and I just kind of tossed you in my mouth without thinking.\u201d Her guilty expression grew. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would SWALLOW you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze fixed on you, and she composed herself. \u201cWell, I got you out at least, but now I owe you. So, I\u2019m gonna help you out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy lowered her clean hand to you and lifted you up and out of the sink, then began washing the hand that had pulled you out of the toilet. She stayed quiet as she finished, drying her hands off, before considering you for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled kindly, and lifted you again. She rubbed you into the massive towel, drying you off from your shower. She was surprisingly gentle, and when you returned to the countertop you were dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy then took a breath, pulling her white gloves back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how are we getting you out of here?

Strands of saliva snapped quickly as light and air entered the pink cavern of her maw. Her tongue stretched out a bit, covering her teeth. You took a breath, trying to calm yourself. Surprisingly, her breath stilled smelled like strawberries and mint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind you at the mirror, you could see her eyes were still closed. She was waiting... you felt bad, honestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood straight, your decision made. Everyone deserves a second chance, right? You closed the gap between yourself and the muggy cave, and after a moments hesitation, you climbed back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue twitched under you, and you could feel her breaths stop, as she started breathing through her nose. You took a few steps forward, and heard a groaning noise. Nothing loud, surprisingly soft even. As the light became dim, you looked behind you to watch her lips, and your exit, close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately Daisy\u2019s tongue maneuvered you, gently, beneath it. You were once again coated in Daisy\u2019s saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, lets get back to Sarasaland.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy began to move, clearly being more careful than before. Your ears were assaulted by her booming voice though, thankfully only a whisper,, so you just focused on keeping still and not agitating the massive tongue resting on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an agonizing few hours but, true to her word, Daisy was far more careful. Every once in a while she would take in a breath of fresh air and keep it in her mouth, which you were thankful for in the humid air of her mouth. Her tongue kept a light but constant pressure on you, which was surprisingly comforting. She also spoke sparingly, only saying goodbye to Peach as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might have fallen asleep, the warmth and gentle rocking of her mouth somewhat comforting. And, oddly enough, you felt rather safe, if a bit filthy. But, her tongue shifted suddenly, the dexterous muscle maneuvering you up and on top of it. Light flooded her mouth, and you could see the top of a counter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clambered out of her mouth, breathing in the outside air greedily. Behind you, Daisy stood from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I hope that wasn\u2019t too bad. But hey, we made it!\u201d She did a little hop, the entire room quaking practically. She looked back down at you, smiling ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made a show of flicking a bit of saliva off of you and she quickly got the message. Her smile shrunk sheepishly and she turned to the faucet of this bathroom and got it running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly her bathroom too. Very orange creamsicle themed. That and her Daisy logo was embroidered on all the towels and towlets of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...\u201d She said, somewhat softly. \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered my spit at all, here.\u201d She had this faucet on a trickle like the previous. You slid down the basin yourself and stood under the running water. Daisy took this time to talk again, but you didn\u2019t mind too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do hope I can get you back to normal size, or at least back home...\u201d She pondered aloud. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad you have me a chance to prove myself to you.\u201d She smiled down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved up at her in response, deciding speech was overrated, considering your size. Your voice would be impossible to hear. Daisy leaned her elbows on the counter as you climbed out of the sink, pulling down a towel and eyeing you for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned, accepting your silence as she picked you up and dried you off with the towel. In no time you were dry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy returned the hand towel to it\u2019s hook, then lowered her hand to the edge of the counter. \u201cHere, lets get out of the bathroom.\u201d You quickly hopped onto her waiting palm, moving closer to the center. She began walking...</span></div></div>",

It would have been a large bedroom to any normal sized person, but to you it was as big as a city. Her bed sat against one wall, a large canopy draped over it. Against the opposite wall was a clean desk, a large stack of papers towered out of a bin labeled \"out\". In a corner, a changing screen hid most of a large, ornate wardrobe, a racing suit hung across the barrier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large window overlooking a balcony was against the third wall, a table and chairs both outside and inside her bedroom. It was dark out, you realized as you remembered you'd been in Daisy's mouth basically all afternoon. Kind of a weird thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was clearly following the same line of thinking as you when she yawned. She stepped up to her bed and, after a moment of thought, placed you on one of her pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I don't want to lose you tonight, so you'll be sleeping with me.\" The connotation of her words not being lost on you, and this same realization dawned on her as well, and you watched her face turn beet red with the realization. \"I- I mean on that pillow. Not... not with me, with me...\" She said quickly, abashed at what she had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to change, you make yourself comfortable. On the pillow.\" She said, turning away quickly and rushing behind her screen to change. With not much else to do, you sat back on the pillow and waited for her to return.

If it wasn't for the fit, it might as well have been an oversized t-shirt. In this case, it fit like a simple sundress, and was a bit tighter around her midriff while the base of the dress skimmed above her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited as she approached, shooting a small smile your way. Clapping, she turned the lights in the room off, leaving only the lamp on her bedside and the moonlight filtering in through the windows of her room. You watched her climb into bed, somewhat in awe, as Daisy's size once again hit you. Her enormous body was far to graceful for her size, but it was quite a sight to watch her snuggle in under the covers, her head coming to a rest on the pillow next to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled over at you, her hair flowing messily around her head. \"You've had a bit more of an... <i>exciting</i> day than I did...\" She said, her expression somewhere between pained and guilty. It didn't stay long though, as she was soon giving you a smile again. \"So, get some rest! I'll give you a tour in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yawned, her warm breath and open mouth being an unintentional reminder of how your day was spent. Daisy didn't seem to notice, closing her mouth and blinking tiredly. She rolled over, turning off the lamp, leaving you only the faint light of the moon outside to see by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night.\" She muttered, settling in. The pillow you were on shifting as she did so. You followed suit, rolling over and closing your eyes. But, after trying for some time, you couldn't sleep... you were in a foreign setting, and quite a dangerous one for the size you were at. As comfortable as the pillow was, and as kind as Daisy had been, you were still rather on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you tried to, sleep would eventually come...</span></div></div>",

Yours, however, were wide open, staring at her. She had changed... into nothing. Her body was on full display. A pair of C-cup boobs stared at you, bouncing with her steps. Between her legs was a gap, giving you a shadowy glimpse of her most private of parts. Your face was grew very hot very quickly, and probably more red than a super mushroom. You couldn't tear your eyes off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was clearly very athletic, with toned abs and a perceptible layer of muscle across her body. Her skin was tanned, leaving only her crotch and chest a pale white. She had clearly shaved or waxed recently, as you couldn't see a single loose hair, apart from what was on her head, anywhere on her body. Even as she stepped up to the bed, finishing up her stretch with one hand on her hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, at this angle, you had a much better view of her, and lower lips. Her body towered up above you, the shadows across her body highlighting her muscled curvature. Lower, her labia wasn't exactly \"in full bloom\", but the twin lines of pinkish flesh still stood out to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched Daisy's eyes open, your heart thudding in your chest as her eyes locked onto you. A second passed. She froze up like a deer in the headlights, her face quickly turning a dark shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few agonizing seconds passed, your eyes locked together. Daisy's mouth opened and closed a few times, apparently trying to find the right words. Her arm slowly lowered off her hip, rigid at her side. You were frozen as well, and your face was at least as red as hers was. You hoped she couldn't see how hard you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Daisy stammered, trying to formulate words. Her arms slowly rose up to cross her chest, almost defensively. This was enough embarrassment to get you to look away, spinning 180 degrees and sitting down on the pillow. You could hear her slowly and carefully sit down on the bed, the mattress and pillow you were on tilting slightly towards her massive body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm used to... ya'know... sleeping naked...\" She managed to get out finally. \"I didn't even... I didn't even think about what I was doing. Just running on reflexes.\" She finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, unsure of what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-okay.\" You said stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of you moved until Daisy cleared her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\" She said, her embarrassed tone cracking through her faux bravado. \"Let's get some sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, you heard and felt Daisy move, getting under the covers. A booming clap later and the room was dark. She fidgeted in the near-darkness of the room, now only lit by moonlight, as you slowly relaxed into a lying position. Not that you were <i>actually</i> relaxed, but you were doing your best considering the giant, nude, and hot princess laying next to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment passed, an awkward silence in the air. Sure, you should both be sleeping, but you were fairly sure that she wouldn't be any more relaxed than you. Your assumptions proved correct as you heard her roll over, and you were able to look into her massive eyes on the next pillow over, looking at you apprehensively.</span></div></div>",

Taking a breath, you stood up and marched across the pillows, right up to the giant face of the princess, and set your hand on her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped a little, her eyes opening. She stayed silent until you stepped back into her line of sight. You nodded, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in her seemed to melt away, leaving just her massive blush behind. \u201cOh, good.\u201d She breathed. \u201cI was afraid you would refuse and then it would be even <i>worse</i>.

At least you received the mercy of blacking out BEFORE the burning sensation could get any more agonizing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an uncertain amount of time, you slowly and groggily awoke, confused as to how you could\u2019ve survived Princess Daisy\u2019s gut. You tried to run, but found yourself unable to move. Getting concerned, you looked up to see Daisy, tears in her eyes, although it was upside-down from your perspective. Stranger still, your vision was orange for some reason.

She\u2019d never had anyone as a sentient part of her body before, but then again, she\u2019d never eaten anyone before.

You finally opened your eyes and got surprised to see that you are not in your home anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are what looks to be in the middle of a cave, but it wasn't just any sort of cave. This cavern appeared to have a few objects around it which almost making it less like a cave and more like someone's bedroom; there are pictures on the wall, a few furnitures scattered around the chamber, a large rug that you are standing on, a curtain behind you, a chandelier on the ceiling, and even a large bed at the corner. Another thing that shocked you was how huge everything looks, making you think that you are in a giant's cave with giant objects around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the designs of the furnitures, you noticed how fancy they look, like something you find inside some royal castle. Just why would they would be found in such place is beyond you. You look around the chamber and found out that nobody is in here so far or at least that what you thought at first after hearing a sound coming from a small lake with a waterfall above it; the lake was located at the very corner of the cave/room. It sounded like bubbles coming out of it and you (being curious) decided to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly approach the lake when you got there and stare at it to see where is it coming from. You did see some bubbles coming from underwater and realized that whoever's causing is currently submerged in the lake, but how is that possible? You look and make out a large shape underwater, and it was getting bigger....because it was coming to the surface!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ducked as you expect that you'll get splashed by the current caused by the giant, but only smaller ones where formed which only pushed you a bit. After you got up from the ground, you finally get to see the giant at it's glory (well somewhat). The only thing you saw from the giant was the head and it's one the most strangest one you ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant didn't look quite human at all. Instead, you see a light blue-skined creature that looked like some sort of an aquatic creature, judging by the fact that it could breathe underwater. The face looked feminine, making you believe that the creature was female. She has hazel-colored eyes and jewel earrings on her fin-like ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have seriously no idea what kind of creature is this. Is it a mermaid? A sea monster? An alien? You don't know at the moment but looking at her face, you wonder if she could see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she saw you?</span></div></div>",

Instead, it just one empty bluish-purple chamber with glowing pink spots spectacled all over the walls, ceiling, and even the ground which made this place at least brighter than you ever expected. There were drops of acid coming from the ceiling; you realize this after one lands on your arm which slightly burns you, but didn't dissolve your flesh since you quickly dry it off. Thankfully, the drops don't fall often and they are pretty easy to avoid. Suddenly, you stepped on something on the fleshy ground. You look down and immediately became disgusted when you discovered that the object you stepped on was a nearly digested fish corpse lying in the middle of this stomach chamber; you can see it's bones and even organs popping out of it's body. You shiver just by looking at it as you will be soon joining this fish once you stay here much longer. This probably won't happen because right at the end of this stomach chamber is an opening that may lead somewhere. Now filled with hope, you run towards the exit, thinking that it was a route to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got there, you were further confused to find that it was some sort of tunnel-like path. You first think that this was her small intestine, but you look ahead and saw two paths in front of you; small intestines only have one way so this was completely odd to you. Of course, she wasn't human so maybe the anatomy of her race is very different to humans; you're probably still inside her stomach. At the end, you decided to go take the left path, but you saw two more paths ahead and take the one on the right. The next thing you saw is yet another two-way path and followed by another, and another, and some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her stomach is like a maze.\" you said to yourself. You seriously have no idea where you going, but hopefully is anything that will get you out of here. Finally, you come across a small chamber that has not two, but three paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already have enough of this and hope that each of one of them leads somewhere. However, you suddenly hear a series of faint noises coming from each tunnels. You though they may been her organs, but hearing closely they don't sound anything like them, almost like some sounds of living creatures make, including....talking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich path do you take?</span></div></div>",

The light snoring was barely audible over the soft trickle of the waterfall behind you, so you knew she was at least asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of travel, you were rather winded. Your clothes were heavy with the water she\u2019d splashed on you earlier, and it wasn\u2019t easy to cross the somewhat rough floor in them.

No longer held down, you continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took you maybe 30 minutes altogether to reach the bed, and it was larger than you had previously thought.

You could get to the top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand over hand, you pulled yourself up the blanket from the floor. It was plush, and surprisingly easy to grip. It still took you nearly 20 minutes to reach the top of the bed, chest heaving as you fell onto the comfortable blanket. A moments rest, then onward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to you the fish lady continued to snore, now the sound was louder, but still gentle in your opinion.

You weren\u2019t sure what guided you to choose this option, but you were ready, and kinda eager, to give it a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving towards her legs, you carefully picked your way across the plush blue surface of the bed. As you got close to her shin the ground dipped down, thanks to the weight of the massive sea creature resting on the bed. You considered your options: either slide down and climb from the bottom, or run and jump onto her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a few steps back as you prepared to jump. You were tired of climbing, to be honest, and the less you had to do, the better your life would be. With a grunt you threw yourself towards her leg, frantically scrambling for a handhold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to find that despite her scales, her legs were very difficult to get a grip on. Between the slight dampness that still clung to her and the smoother than expected texture of her scales, you barely kept yourself on her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting with effort, you pulled yourself up to the top of her leg, or the back you supposed. Catching your breath you took a moment to take in the leg you stood on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA darker blue than her belly, but not too dark, and the scales criss crossed across her body, each no bigger then your own hand. If you were normal sized, you might not have even felt them with your fingers. Shockingly, you found yourself absentmindedly caressing her leg, but her distant snoring pulled you back to reality. You had a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, you looked towards her head, but found it blocked by the low twin hills of her rear. Warmth invaded your face as you began walking along her leg. Just another obstacle, you muttered to yourself, trying to ignore some inner feelings on the manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did find yourself slipping from time to time, her scales smooth and wet. They were not the best for walking, barefoot as you were. After a few minutes, you found yourself where her legs met, at the base of her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scales did give way to skin; light blue, warm, and soft. You pulled your hand back quickly from her lower cheek, blushing profusely now, trying to look away from her rear. Instead you found your gaze following the crevice of her butt, stopping to stare down into the gorge between her legs, where a large shadow lay where her legs merged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head, looking back up at her butt. This was risky enough, if he was being honest. Invading her privacy and space like this, even if she was some sort of gigantic sea creature. She might not appreciate it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou steeled your nerves, and began ascending the rise. If was easier than her legs at least, her skin here allowed your hands and feet to sink in and pull yourself up. Soon enough, you were simply walking to the crest of her left cheek. Still blushing, but less so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom here you could see her vast back, covered in the same scales as her legs, rising up to her neck. Her head was cradled in her arms, and you couldn\u2019t see her face. Her body rose and fell with her breath, breaking any illusion you might have had that you weren\u2019t walking on a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, for some reason, you felt like you had a few options here...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there a moment, admiring her body and considering these ideas...</span></div></div>",

You could hear... the waterfall across the room, and under that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery careful breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze on her cheek, noticing that her snoring had gone, replaced with quiet, controlled, and obviously awake, breathing. There was a tense moment before you felt the cheek beneath you tense up slightly, and the breathing jump for a moment. You supposed that both of you were found out now... but you were still in the more precarious situation. She definitely knew where you were and, while she might have noticed some time ago, it wasn't giving her any sense of privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure what do do and, maybe, she noticed, her head and torso slowly turning till she had you in view. Her body tilted to the left, and you stumbled for a handhold, eventually deciding to just fall to your hands and knees, despite the situation. She studied you for a moment, and you noticed the slightest hint of a dark blue blush on her face. Despite the situation, you had to admit she was rather beautiful. She cleared he throat, vibrating you and her butt along with the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooo... what are you doing on my ass?\" Her expression flickered, turning slightly insulted for only a moment before returning to the more bewildered look. \"Who, or what, are you, even.\" Her voice, though accusatory was loud, but not as loud as you had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to stand, but decided against it. \"I'm [name], a Human.\" You cleared your throat before continuing. \"I, uh, was looking to get your attention?\" You winced at your choice of phrase, and your hesitation. You waited, sheepishly, for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... damnit, I can't even hear you from there.\" She thought for a moment. \"Here...\" She said, her body shifting more. You did your best to stay upright with the slight movements, and managed to not fall over. You watched, in slight awe, one of her hands move over to her rear, settling her palm up on her other cheek. \"I'll bring you closer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hesitated a moment, enough to hear her huff in amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you, I haven't even heard what must be a very <i>interesting</i> story.\" She drew out the sentence, bobbing her hand and sending small ripples across her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot hesitating this time, for what reason you can't tell, you jumped from your crouching position on her cheek and leaped onto her hand. Each finger still dwarfed you, and you once again noticed that even her thumb a little over twice the height of you. A moment passed as you walked along her palm to get closer to the center, and as you reached it she brought her hand up and in front of her. It was a dizzying experience, and made your empty stomach churn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, and you, re situated, before she re-focused on you. Her face was looming over you, cupped in her hand. She really was rather beautiful... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So.\" Her voice resounded around you, again softer than you had expected. \"How about that story you were trying to tell me, little ass man?\" A smirk had appeared on her face, obviously taunting you at this point. You stood on her palm, deciding to go from the top. Introducing yourself, and walking her through your little adventure up to that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you told her your story her face inched slightly closer, and her expression became unreadable. It was kind of unnerving. Once you finished, you smiled sheepishly up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled back, before responding. </span></div></div>",

You should be dead, you thought as you took in your surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on a light blue surface; smooth, soft and surprisingly warm. To either side of you were large blue walls, same as the ground. A ways ahead of you there was a divot in the ground and past that the surface split into two thick, darker blue pillars which rose up and away from where you were. Around the mass you were on was a vast plain that looked kinda like a quilt, a mix of various colors from silver to gold. Out beyond that, the cave from before loomed, trying to remind you of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground was moving slightly, rising up and down in a natural and soothing rhythm.

You watched one of her hands descend, settling palm up next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the hint and climbed on, staying low as the Princess sat up on her knees, moving to lay down on her front. She was careful to keep her hand level as she adjusted her position before lowering you to the bed, now directly in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto waited for you to hop off of her hand, not directly in front of her face. Her warm breath washed over you as you got situated. You hadn\u2019t really considered that you were only in your underwear, and now that you were this close to her, directly in her scrutiny, you were getting a bit conscious of your lack of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ruto noticed, she didn\u2019t say anything. In front of you, her mouth continued the friendly smile from before, and it was mesmerizing to so the massive blue lips part as she talked. Interestingly, her inner mouth was the same pinkish red as any human. You pulled your eyes away from her mouth and focused on one of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, her massive eye was quite intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, my idea here.\u201d She started, tilting her head slightly. \u201cIts a bit of a trust exercise, since I feel that it would be better if you could trust me a bit more.\u201d She pursed her lips in consideration, or maybe hesitation, before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts pretty simple. I\u2019ll smile, and you\u2019ll touch my teeth for a minute. After a minute, we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</span></div></div>",

If you can\u2019t do it, just shout! We\u2019ll stop, and we can try again later.\u201d You nodded, and she smiled, full mouth of teeth directly in front of you. Razor sharp points, made to slice through flesh. You swallowed hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer warm breath still fell on you from above, out her nose, as you closed the distance between her mouth and you. If her breath was warm, her mouth was warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth were clean, thankfully. Pearly white. You were, however, still a bit too low to touch her tooth with her lip in the way.. You considered her bottom lip, then steeled your nerves. A step-stool then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your foot touched her bottom lip, the purplish surface quivered. She mush not have been expecting that. It quickly tensed, becoming a much more stable, but plush, platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping up, you could now easily reach her teeth. You were practically inside her mouth, if she opened her teeth you were sure she could simply close her lips and you\u2019d be completely enclosed in her mouth. You doubted she would eat you, probably. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking the thought out of your mind, you quickly reached out and touched her teeth. They were warm and slick with saliva. You shuddered a moment, then started counting in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the lip beneath you tilted, knocking you off and back onto the bed. Ruto\u2019s head lifted up and away, angling to try and look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped back, her hands clapping as she spotted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?\u201d She smiled down at you, teeth on full display. Surprisingly, the sight didn\u2019t bother you as much. She continued. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to step up on my lip though, I guess you couldn\u2019t reach, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, a slight blush creeping up on your face.

A gentle amount of force pressed against you as she gave you a huge kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have lasted forever, but she eventually pulled you away, and now she was the one smiling bashfully. Well, you both were. \u201cConsider that a gift.\u201d She said quietly. \u201cFor making me feel good about myself again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised a brow.

It\u2019s not that you were a pervert or anything, but it was certainly a sight despite the shadows covering it, or how much of her privates were under her body, hidden against the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto chuckled softly overhead, finally managing to get you to look up. She didn\u2019t look mad though; surprisingly she was smiling, her expression teasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine the view at your size, but don\u2019t be so embarrassed.

You quickly stabilized yourself as Ruto began to shift around you. She leaned back, resting against the pillows behind her, spreading her legs out into a huge canyon behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, nice and bright!\u201d She said, like it was a great victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you had to agree. Her shifting had revealed herself to you completely. The entirety of her pussy was on display, bathed in the soft light of the room. It was easily three times your height, absolutely massive, and quite intimidating. You were a few inches away, a few yards at your size, and yet you could feel the temperature rising, emanating from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up as Ruto laughed, probably at your apprehension. Her face seemed far away, her entire torso between you and her head. She was smiling, but you thought you could make out the faint traces of her blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t bite! I think you\u2019ll find that I don\u2019t have teeth behind these lips.\u201d She said, her tone teasing. Her hand lowered to her lips, two fingers spreading them open and revealing herself fully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vagina was a bright pink, in contrast to her blue scales and skin. You could see her clit perched at the top of her lips, and towards the bottom, a glistening hole, her moist tunnel twitching rhythmically. It was also utterly massive, and wholly intimidating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yeah, no teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard, your face somehow feeling even hotter. But...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan you even move?</span></div></div>",

The cows were massive, the closest one rising at least 500 feet into the sky! The ceiling seemed way too high up, and the whole barn seemed too big to exist.

A girl, tall (utterly massive to you) with red hair that fell just past her waist.  A long purple skirt reached down to her ankles, a leather apron covering that.

From this distance you could see her chest rise and fall with each sleeping breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded to nobody in particular, your mission decided. Get her attention, get some help. Or, at least get her to notice you. You had considered that she might not be nice, but looking at her face, you could almost feel a warmth radiating from her. It didn\u2019t hurt that she was also rather beautiful, if a bit dirty from farm work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you began your march, and as you approached, the enormity of the sleeping giantess and your goal hit you. She was larger than anything, excluding mountains and such, you had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer boots were touching the stone floor, sticking out from under her skirt. Was it even a skirt, you pondered as you continued your approach. It was really long... you shook your head, clearing it. No distractions. That boot was your first hurdle, climbing it would be the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally reached her, and realized something else: the hay. Falling in at your size would be suicide, you\u2019d either die in the fall through the many thick strands of hay, or get lost and starve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shivered at both outcomes. Just climb, and don\u2019t fall. Easy. You pumped yourself up and grabbed ahold of the work boots. There were a lot of small nicks and holes, so climbing was relatively easy, and you reached something you hadn\u2019t considered: her skirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could simply climb over it onto the dress/skirt thing. As was your original plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, under would be far safer. Falling would mean landing on her dress and sliding out, or being able to continue the climb from the other side of the skirt.

Surprising, considering that she was clearly at least a farm hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawled up her leg, the inside of the dress slid against your back. It wasn't very heavily set on you, but it was noticeable. It made your efforts to go further a bit more difficult.

It only lasted a couple of seconds, and you were quickly able to reason out that she must have bent her other leg up and into the air. For you, this meant you no longer had the skirt pressing into your back. You could also see up ahead of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, rather close considering, you could see her belt press down on her dress, leaving only a narrow passage for you to crawl through. A bit claustrophobic, but you figured you made your bed, now you have to sleep on it. Your eyes shifted, and you blushed a moment as you considered her underwear.

It had a relatively small body and small feet, long slender arms and a pink, oddly-shaped head. Also, it had two tails, each with a gem, and there was a third, red gem in the middle of its forehead. And... it was undeniably a her, you could judge because its reproductive organs were out for the world to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as she began to... stir?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw she arms in the air and gave a yawn,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">MMeeeeees...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stared at her, stunned by the mere existence of such creature, and wondered what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it looked like she knew something was wrong, because it suddenly started looking around, her golden eyes scanning around carefully around, until they landed... right upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, both you and the creature stared at each other; despite your size, it looked like she could see you clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Mesprit?</span>\" she moaned curiously,<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Mesprit!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched at the titan flew down, right towards you; startled, you turned tail and attempted to run away, but before you could, a powerful, invisible force blocked your attempts to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, you inexplicably began floating in the air, and flew straight into the creature's awaiting hand; you discovered her eyes glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you registered the expression she was staring at you with...</span></div></div>",

Soon after the rubbing assault stopped and you heard the creature cry out the same thing it had cried out many times before. <span class=\"cpink\">\"Mesprit!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, you can only lead to the conclusion that this is its name, either species or individual.

You began to feel uncomfortable just by looking it; something bad was slowly going to happen. You were about to jump off her hand to escape, but she claps her both of her hands together around you.

After that, you were now coated in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Mesprit!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant creature finally lets go of you, but you were now floating in the air.

You scream at the top of your lungs from the unexpectedness of your situation, but that was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now getting flinged back and forth like a toy airplane in the air. You scream as your view is spiraling around you and on the urge to throw up. Down below, the creature was laughing at your demise. \"Stop this right now!\" You yelled as she still levitates you around. She didn't listen and continues to make you fling, spin, make several poses, and among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for several seconds until the pink giantess has enough and releases you. You fall onto her hand with your head spinning. When you finally got to your senses, you look up and wonder what she wants to do now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You soon got your answer when you opened your eyes and saw nothing but tall grass around you. Why is this? Why are you so small? Are you dreaming right now? You stood there and jump up and down a few times to wake yourself up, but it wasn't working as this was all too real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat isn't the only thing you noticed strange, but the fact that you were in a middle of nowhere. You don't know where ever you are but it sure is hot and humid around here. You don't want stay here and sweat like crazy, you should find a cool spot around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, it didn't take you long enough to find something better than a cool spot: a large building that was just close to where you are. This building was large; even at normal height. It was completely white plus it looks highly advanced and futuristic. You don't know who lives here, but your mind was immediately made up and decided to go there to get some cool air. You made way out of the grass blades and onto the dirty path, walking to the giant structure. You come across a series of giant steps and realized that you need to climb up to get there but sadly, the steps were too smooth to climb over which it's impossible to get inside. Crap, now you're forced to stand there as the bright sun heats you up and burns your skin down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a noise coming the building and you look up to see that someone is coming out. You back away for a bit to see who this giant is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a young girl with short purple hair that was tied up by a golden hairpin and wide grin. She wears what looks like a purple and blue dress that was made of rags and stitches and a pair of lavender sandals. The giant girl looked kinda cute, but she also look a little strange too; almost like a nonhuman being. You watch as she walks down the steps until her sandals now lands next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her giant feet and you don't know why, but you were beginning to get a little fixated at them. You watch as her toes wiggle a bit and shifts her feet around in the sandals; you could see some sight sweat sliding down. This strange little girl have some adorable feet plus it looks like you could get cool from the heat on them. Without hesitation, you make your way and make a leap towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou successfully grab onto her foot and (despite being covered in sweat) made you way on top of it. You rub yourself on the foot until you got wet from it's sweat; now you were getting cooler. With you being on top of the foot, you were slowly getting a bit attracted to it; maybe you could play with her feet later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

It seems, however, that this walk could hardly be considered a walk, more like a short trip to a destination 2 meters away, that destination being a sun chair purely made of wood, firmly planted into the ground. The sun chair also has a foldable umbrella, probably to make shade if the sun becomes too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a moment your ride comes to a halt as the girl sits down and flings her feet up. With very little control over your situation, you fly dozens of meters off the ground and start to see your life flash before your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the moment you landed you expected to explode but surprisingly... it didn't happen?

You felt so small, so tiny compared to the world you were seeing. You seem to be in a giant hall, one that you would guess is holding parties and such. Looking around, you were by a giant table as well as a giant seat. Both so big, wooden and dwarfed you so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little bit worried and concerned about your size, seeing just how small you were. You were so tiny, and so miniscule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark outside, as you can see the opening, although to you just the small opening was like staring at the moon to you. No one was in the hall, so you guess that was good. You don\u2019t have to worry about anyone small, but that is also still concerning. You won\u2019t be doing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a while, you suddenly hear loud bumps. So loud as it made you jump and freak out a bit. You take a couple steps back, although in the grander scheme of things, those couple of steps back literally meant nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around, freaking out a bit as you try to wonder what is going on. You finally saw the source come into the giant hall and... well it was the most beautiful thing you have ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiant, towering like a colossus. She was so big, yet at the same time so beautiful. She was far away, so you could see the entire body of this woman. She had blonde curly hair, and a red outfit that covered her upper body.

That was something to note, as you were loving her design.<br>\r\n\u2028As you look over her even more, she came closer and closer as you got to see how big this beauty was to you. She was towering, and you felt so insignificant to her. When she finally stopped and placed her giant red boot near you, you felt like you were going to get stepped on for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so big, and you were actually pretty much loving it. You were loving how small you were, and how tiny you were. You wore a giant smile on your face as you were actually liking the view you got. You got to see right under her skirt, and a bit of her panties. She reached for something onto the table, and you were quick to piece it together as she lifted a cup to her mouth. It was tea?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like this girl is pretty wealthy given the size and the general stereotype. She wore a smile on her face as she goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant blonde moved and shifted around, taking a seat as she began to drink. She seems so elegant, so one step above you regardless of what she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, so insanely beautiful. You also somewhat suspect that her body is, well totally fit under her clothes. You highly suspect that, given her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wore a smile on your face as you look right at her, trying to wonder what you are going to do? You are so small that you are somewhat confident you won\u2019t be able to get her attention. So the next best thing would be to climb on top of her body.<br>\r\n\u2028So that is what you are about to do, as you start moving and start heading closer to her boot. It was so big to you, as big as a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t let that stop you though, as you got moving and got even closer to the giant boot that was ahead of you. You start scaling up it, making no doubt good speed as you get on top. She was still enjoying her peace and drinking her tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get right up on top, you relax a bit as you look up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this girl, there was a bit of you that relieved you. Being small around her, well you don\u2019t mind. She was so much to you, and you really like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what you do is simply, you hold the boot and get ready. Get ready just in case she gets moving once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich she did, as your timing was impeccable. She got u-p, standing tall as you get ready for a hard ordeal. The second she started moving and started turning, you see the entire world around you shift around. Shift around like you were in a high speed car. <br>\r\n\u2028It was hard to believe just how fast you were moving, and it was just this girl\u2019s walking speed. It lasted for a while until she took a bit of a break, pulling out her phone as it starts ringing. You can see her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, this is Karin Kanzuki,\u201d She said as you were thankful for that. Now you have a name for this giant beauty. Karin, that name sounds Japanese. But she is speaking english?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless you were piecing it together. As she started moving and heading away while she was talking. You were not really understanding what she was saying, as she was strolling back and forth so quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shift around as you see her walk out of the hall and into the area next to it, letting you see the large estate that she has. Her mansion was massive and you were amazed. You saw cheery blossom\u2019s as well, so that confirmed you were in Japan. Once she hung, she wore a beautiful smile, a no doubt beautiful smile as you were loving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved around for a little while as she headed somewhere. You were not really sure, but it would seem she wanted to get there quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while she arrived __________</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you hung onto the giant beauty\u2019s foot, you were making sure you would not fall. her shoe was shiny and didn\u2019t give you much to grab onto. Thankfully your size let you grab the things that most people would not even see. You were that small you could see crevices in there. \u2028\u2028Which is good for you, no doubt about that. You wait for a while to see where she was going, until finally she arrived where you wanted her to. Her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to contain yourself from squealing with excitement, your mind running with what is going to happen. You are pretty sure she will sleep, and that is what you are hoping for. Guess you just have to wait and relax until than though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came around though, as she moved and sat down onto the bed. You quickly piece it together and get down. She\u2019s going to take off her shoes, with you on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could spot you, but you are not really sure you want that right now. You just want to stay small and stay hidden, preferably playing on her giant sexy body.<br>\r\n\u2028Of course this means staying small and staying low. You had a plan, but it was so risky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her hands down and pulled off the other boot, placing it at the side as you could see her giant stretching feet. Her feet was giant in general, but given your size they were massive! The weird thing is, you were kind of hoping to go to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are not normally a foot guy, but this situation does change your mind a bit. Regardless you are focusing on what is about to happen. She brought her hands to the boot and started pulling it off as you waste no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning up the boot and jumping towards the nearest finger you can. You leap onto it and get right above her fingernail. Hugging her giant finger as you were hoping this would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and see her pull the shoe off, the fingers flying around as it was hard to really understand what was happening. She was moving around at such an insane speed it left you so stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept doing this until you could not hold for much longer, dropping down and falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would think you would fall to the ground, but you get caught by a giant blonde curly world. Getting in as you land on one of her hair pieces. You were on her hair! You were still with this beauty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, you grab the hair and watch the world shift around. Since you could not see anything under her hair, you just had to imagine what was happening. Her whole body was shifting rapidly as you assume she is changing her clothes. You could not see it though, especially when she turned off the lights and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid her head back as you get buried underneath her hair. When she turned off the light, you waited for a little while longer to play on her body. When you found that she was finished and officially sleeping, you get moving. Making your way through the blonde jungle as you eventually get out, standing on her pillow as you were given an amazing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark, so of course you were not getting the best view but what you got was enough. She was in nothing but her Lacey underwear. Letting you see her powerful and honestly toned body. This girl must walk out pretty often, cause her body showed.<br>\r\n\u2028Despite all the effort she did, you can\u2019t help but let your eyes go to her breast. You were no doubt going to go and have your fun at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move and get away as you walk across her shoulder, letting you feel her tough it is. You are amazed as you feel this. Despite her rich persona, she clearly is a fighter or an athlete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t let yourself rest though, as you get moving and running to her. You run over and stand on her chest as you look at the two giant breasts, Only for a second though, cause you then turn to see her sleeping face. Seeing that it was... well sleeping.<br>\r\n\u2028She was sleeping right now, her eyelids closed and relaxed. Which means for the entire night, you can have your fun with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t even get your smile away as you go right back. Climbing up and scaling her giant sleeping body. You wore a smile on your face as you keep doing that, making your way down her body and to her bra. You looked right over the bra as you wore a smile, making your way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou touch the bra and scale it, climbing up as you know you just had to get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an odd situation you have found yourself in. You were stuck on a giant girl that you wanted to be on. You didn\u2019t even give her your name, yet you were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren\u2019t really thinking about your future right now, cause why would you. The only thing on your mind was her body and what fun you can have,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the top of her bra and walk to the edge, seeing a small bump on the bra as it did not take a genius to realise what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were her nipples, man you love that. You wore a smile on your face as you head over and look down. You felt like you were on a hill as you glanced down to her. You could not even shift your eye away, even if you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did not get crazy though, as you look down and try to think about what you are going to do. You think about it for a real long time until you have come to your choice. You are going to __________</span></div></div>",

You don't remember anything from last night and to make matters worse you don't recognize anything from your surroundings. You appear to be on some kind of wooden bridge with the ocean right in front of you. The bridge stops at the ocean and your wondering where you are, the beach that is left and right seems to go on forever. You see a giant wooden barrel next to you and wonder what that would store. You finally turn around and became scared at what you see. Behind you seem to be a town and the town seemed to be massive, a unbelievable size. Even at a distant you could still tell the houses were built for giants. That's when you saw another thing come into view and it all made sense. It was young girl dressed in a harem outfit. She had purple hair, tan skin and ears that pointed out like an elves. You know exactly who this girl is, she is the half genie hero Shantae. From the Shantae game series. Those aren't giant houses, their the houses of the residents of Scuttle Town and you aren't on a bridge, your on a dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Shantae run towards the Dock and thinking quickly, you hide on the other side of the barrel. When she finally steps near you, your frankly amazed at the size advantage she has on you. You couldn't even come past the pointed tips of her shoes. You look up and consider whether you should get her help. Thinking about Shantae in the game quickly made you decide what to do. Shantae is a hero and a guardian in the games. She will help you no matter what. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out from behind the barrel and yell up to Shantae. This worked as she looks directly down at you. At first she had a mix look of surprise and confusion. However that look went away when she started to smile ___________</span></div></div>",

You could swear the whole dock was shaking underneath you as Shantae walked all the way back to the barrel that served as your hiding spot shortly ago, towering above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were impressed by her size alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched the titaness suddenly becoming shorter as she knelt down and extended a hand towards you. The motion wasn't exactly slow, and you instinctively jumped back, avoiding ending up in the excited half-genie's hand, which ended up grasping the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't want to do that, but your body was faster than your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae pouted for a moment, then spoke soothing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be scared, little guy, I'm not going to hurt you. Here,\" she said, once more bringing her hand to you, only in a much slower fashion and, instead of going for the grab, she stopped with her palm up at a short distance from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted you to climb on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words and her reassuring smile were enough to convince you, and you stepped onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" the half-genie giantess said, bringing her hand to her face while standing back onto her feet; the moment she did, her palm shook as you traveled far up into the air. A fall from here would probably be lethal for someone your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who are you? How did you get so small? Wait...\" she interrupted before you could even talk; she looked around,<br>\r\n\"Hmm... maybe this is not the best place to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou too looked around. Thinking about it, you were out in the open, and if anyone came up to Shantae right now, friend or foe, you doubted they'd expect seeing her talking to a small person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Agreed.\" you spoke for the first time she the half-genie laid eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" she said, before adopting another smile,<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go!... Home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wai-\" you couldn't even finish as her hand closed in a fist, trapping you from the waist down; without giving you any time to protest about her hasty behavior, Shantae quickly turned around and sprinted towards a lighthouse at the end of the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short, though dizzying ride, you found yourself being placed down onto a stool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head to rid it from the invading sense of nausea you were feeling while the giant half-genie knelt down before the stool, placing her hands on the floor so she was standing at eye level with you, more or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I was saying, how did you get so small?\" she asked, her voice loud enough to make your ears ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to wait for a few moments, because you were still in the middle of recovery from the ride she gave you; once you didn't feel like throwing up anymore, you forcefully swallowed a lump in your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... want some water?\" Shantae offered, but you shook a finger, silently telling that you were fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" you began speaking,<br>\r\n\"I don't know how I got this small. I just... kind of woke up, and I was like this.\" you tried to explain, even though you couldn't quite figure this out yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds odd.\" Shantae commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is.\" you agreed, though not mentioning it was even weirder that you found yourself stranded in a video game. From the outfit she was wearing, you could tell you must have ended in 'Half-Genie Hero'; you wondered if the events occurring in the game have happened already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae pondered another question. It didn't look like it to her, but she still felt the need to ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing in front of my house? I mean, I don't think you were trying to attack me.\" she said, wearing a smile,<br>\r\n\"You're too small to be a bad guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeez, for a hero, she had all the finesse of the stool you were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I have no idea why I was in front of your house, either.\" you told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you were hiding...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to see things my way,  everything is just gigantic.\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"I woke up in front of your house and decided to hide and wait. Then, you came out.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae appeared to be thinking. Then, after a few moments, she looked back at you with a sweeter smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... that sounds plausible. Everything must look scary from your point of view.\" she emphatically said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... not as scary as you're thinking.\" you replied,<br>\r\n\"But still, everything's pretty big so... yeah, it's a bit intimidating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Anyway, I still need help! Can you do that? I mean... you're a hero!\" you praised, letting the fan side of you take over for a moment,<br>\r\n\"You saved this place so many times a-and it was amazing every time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, thank you.\" she said, gently moving a hand to pick you from your wooden perch, giving a warm smile in response to your praising,<br>\r\n\"And, sure, I can no doubt do something for you! I think I know what to do...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I mean, you're not a bad guy, so you came to the right half-genie!...

Don't worry, small one,\" she said, picking you in hand and shooting a reassuring smile,<br>\r\n\"I won't let her get her hands on you! In fact, I won't let any of my enemies get their hands on you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe statement alone and Shantae's determined face made it hard to not believe her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, seeing as you really didn't have any other choice, you had to agree and accept the fact she was keeping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then.\" you said, sighing,<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae smiled massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise you won't regret this.\" she declared, rising to her full height; sitting on her palm at such height was impressive and you tried not to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you murmured,<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Shantae...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you fell silent, wanting to think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, the half-genie could tell something was wrong with you and, after a few minutes of just staring, she asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you alright? You sorta zoned out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... it's a bit much to take in.\" you admitted after doing some thinking,<br>\r\n\"But don't worry, I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShantae didn't look too pleased with your answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" the purple-haired giantess said,<br>\r\n\"If you're gonna stay here, I can't have you sulking all the time. I've got to help you, and that means I have to cheer you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shantae, there's no n-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I think I know how to do just that!\" she happily declared, interrupting you, before looking at you with a grin.</span></div></div>",

However you stopped looking at the desk when the outside door opened and in came a panicked woman. She rushed over towards the desk and answered the call. You watch all this happen from a distance as you got a good look at the gigantic woman. She had heels on with stocking covering her legs. She had a long black skirt on which stopped when it met her purple and white top. She had her hair done up into a bun and has a pair of glasses on. She was also very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\" She said as she answered the phone \"Oh hello Scout\" You could hear her sound annoyed when she realized who it was \"Yes I got the flowers, I put them in a really special place.\" you could see the flowers in the bin and you laugh out loud at that.

You're standing on the middle of a path and by the looks of it, it leads to a city of some sort. \"How did I even get here?\" you said in confusion. You couldn't help but feel scared at the moment. \"Maybe I can find and ask someone in that city for help.\" you made you way across the path that leads to the huge city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you ran into a huge shadow; huge enough for you to stop. Was this some kind of a large object? You look behind to see something that made you even more nervous than before: a large vending machine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy cow, that's got to be the biggest vending machine in the world!\" you shouted. Is this really a giant machine? or are you very small? Your second question was answered when you notice a giant discarded soda can next to you. This giant world felt very dangerous to you, more than ever before. \"I can't imagine how big the inhabitants are in this world.\" you said as you were shivering a bit with fear. You look at the city that was ahead of you, maybe it's best not to seek help anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran out of the path and across the outskirts of the city itself. \"I think I'm better off living like a vermin in someone's house or something.\" you said. You were passing behind a couple of large buildings until you immediately tripped on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck?!\" you said in shock. You notice what looks like a giant poster. You walk towards it to see what kind of poster it is out of curiousity. This was the part were you were now completely dumbfounded at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has a picture of a strange humanoid being that has some features of a squid. The poster itself looks like some sort of fashion advertisement. \"This can't real...\" you said. Are you in a alien planet or something? Your thoughts were interrupted when you hear some music playing somewhere. \"It must be coming from the city.\" you said as you decided to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made into the city (although you were hiding at a corner of a large building) and see that the city itself was basically a plaza. The square itself was covered by a bunch of giant squid-people which were just like the one you saw in the poster from before; you were very afraid indeed and thought that they were going to eat you alive. The music you heard earlier was coming from that large TV screen that was at a building. The TV screen itself featured a duo of similar creatures.</span></div></div>",

But nothing you thougth of could explain the pain. It wasn't a hangover - you were much to busy to get smashed on a wednesday. And you hadn't been sick in ages. No meds, no drugs, there was nothing you had taken that could have such an effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headache got even stronger. Blurry images formed infront of your eyes. A place appeared... one that you had never seen before. An enormous city, made of steel, huge spires of metal piercing the sky, flooded in ugly neon lights. Below, tight and crowded streets. It was a metropolis, for sure.<br>\r\nBut then, somehow, your view of the strange city changed. You slowly descended, towards the streets and then underneath. When you could see again, you saw another city. But this one was much cruder and disheveled. Houses were built out of discarded metal plates. A slew of people rushed through narrow paths, scurrying from place to place. Many unsavoury faces were hanging around, giving you an uneasy feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, your vision went dark - and the pain subsided. With a start, you got up.<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed was the lack of light. All around you was nothing but pitch blackness. Not even a window. The second thing was the hardness of the floor. Had you fallen out of your bed? You reached around, trying to get a hold of anything - to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggled to get on your feet, your eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness. Not that you could see anything more. Wherever you were seemed to be completely devoid of furniture. The walls were completely blank. You reached out your hand and touched the surface. Metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled forward. The room was narrow, but long. All you could do was to walk into one direction and hope to find any way of finding out, where you were.<br>\r\nFortunately, you didn't have to wait long. A small glimmer of light appeared at the end of this metal tunnel. Finally you could get some bearing on your surroundings. With a light jog, you reached the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd stopped dead in your tracks.<br>\r\nThe room before you looked absolutely alien to you, for two reasons. First of all, you didn't know any place like this. The furniture and architecture was completely different to what you were used to.<br>\r\nNot that that mattered much. A much greater reason for your bafflement was the simple fact that everything in this room was HUGE! You could barely make out the ceiling of the gigantic room, simple items towered over you. Wherever you were - you were very small. Two inches at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your mind reeling, you hadn't even been able to really take in the room. After a while you noticed, you were standing in a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The high stools, the long wooden tables, a pinball machine leaned against the wall. You were in a bar, all right.<br>\r\nThough not a very successful one. Absolutely no one was in. You would have thought that the establishment was closed were it not for the extremely bored looking woman behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou froze as you saw her. The woman absolutely towered over you, rising above you like a skyscraper. You were barely even the size of her ankle! Your breathing stopped as you took in her nearly incomprehensible size.<br>\r\nBut on top of that there was another reason for your transfixion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was gorgeous, in every possible way. Long, black hair flowed down her back, unkempt but soft. It reached down all the way to her behind, which was clad in a daringly short leather skirt. It's only security were the two large suspenders snaking up her sides and over her shoulders. The two large straps were pushed aside though by an - and you couldn't help but blush - absolutely massive chest, covered by a very tight and very short, white tank top. It didn't even reach down to her belly, simply cutting off right below her cleavage. Even from down here, you could see just how much larger a single one of her breasts was than you.<br>\r\nYou swallowed, hard. A strange feeling arose in your stomach. You wouldn't have minded visiting a strange place like this, but your minuscule size made this completely terrifying. Every instinct in your body screamed at you to seek cover and hide. But you also knew you couldn't survive on your own. Help from a giant was the most important thing right now if you wanted to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that the only person you could see was an absolute bombshell certainly influenced your decision. Someone this beautiful couldn't be evil, right?<br>\r\nAt least you tried rationalizing it. But as you approached the gargantuan women, your fear of her grew just as much as your admiration. As you finally came around the counter, you were confronted with her enormous red boots. She was crossing her legs, leaning on one foot while tapping the ground impatiently with the other. You flinched as the image of you crushed beneath those boots entered your mind.<br>\r\nWith a shake of your head, you banished the thought. You needed help. Now the only thing you had to do was to figure out a way to contact this gorgeous giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing the counter she was leaning against was an option. The surface was everything but smooth, worn down with the years. Ridges and dents scarred the surface, which would make perfect footholds. The only thing worrying you was, just how tall the counter was. It would be a long way to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another opportunity, however. The giantess' boots weren't in the best condition, and you could spy a small hole in one of them. Still, it was large enough to crawl into. You knew from experience just how sensitive feet could be. If you were lucky, all it would take was a single poke for the giantess to notice you. Of course, this would be incredibly dangerous. If she so much as shifted her weigh, you might end as a splatter on her floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final option was to make enough noise for her to notice you. Looking around, you could see some large glass bottles, full with a dark brown liquid, probably whiskey, collecting dust in the corner. If you tipped those over, the giantess would surely notice. You could only hope that she would understand you making a mess to get her attention.</span></div></div>",

Getting the only person capable of helping you, especially a giantess like this, angry at you was not something you wanted to experience. Ending up underfoot was also something you'd rather avoid. You walked up to the counter. The enormous woman continued to stay at her place. You could only hope that she would remain there until you had finished your climb, or your effort would be in vain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing onto the first of many dents, you pushed your way upwards. The climb was long and uneventful, except for the small melody, the giantess began to whistle half-way through. But she kept standing behind the counter until finally, as you crawled over the edge, you could get a good look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was slouched over, propping herself up with her elbows resting on the counter. Her face was framed by her hands, which were covered by thick, fingerless gloves. With worry you noticed the steel plates covering the knuckles. She was carrying a bored expression, and kept changing up her whistle. Her eyes were large and a warm brown, her lips full and pale.<br>\r\nYour eyes wandered lower and once again, you were met by her absolutely gargantuan chest. Warmth shot on to your cheeks. You couldn't help but stare. Her tank top wasn't doing a very good job of hiding her form, quite the opposite. It hugged every single curve of her body. Because of her pose, you got a good look at her cleavage as well.<br>\r\nQuickly, you averted your eyes. You were in a strange world and only a fraction of your size, but getting aroused by a woman capable of snuffing out your meager existence with a single fingertip might have been the most absurd thing yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you struggled to look anywhere but the enormous breasts in front of you, your eyes wandered even lower. You were stunned, when you saw the woman's exposed stomach. You hadn't noticed just how muscular this woman was. There was no ounce of fat, just large and well defined abs. Looking up, you saw that her biceps was just as large.<br>\r\nSomehow, the woman had become even more intimidating. The thought that it wouldn't even take her the slightest effort to wipe you out entered your mind and suddenly you regretted not running as far away from this giantess as you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were here now. And even though you were scared, the rational part of your brain told you that you had to ask her for help. She may be gigantic, but she looked like a normal human. And though she was intimidating, surely she would help a person in need. You needed to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question was, how? </span></div></div>",

The giantess sadly wasn't looking at the counter. Her head in her hands, she instead stared into the empty bar, whistling a soft melody. There was no other way to get her to notice you - you had to climb her.<br>\r\nAs you got closer to her right elbow, you swallowed. Was this a good idea? Her biceps alone was larger than you! One wrong movement, and the gigantic muscle would turn you into paste!<br>\r\nSwallowing your fear, you continued. Hopeful, you poked her arm, but you didn't even make a dent in her skin. A punch with all your might got you the same result, only that your hand now hurt as well. With a sigh, you accepted your fate. You simply weren't strong enough to get her to feel you, which made your journey to her face unavoidable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed your hands right into the gap where her lower arm met her biceps. Her skin was firm and unyielding. Perfect for you to climb her. Digging your fingers into her flesh, you pulled yourself upward and with a skip, landed on her enormous muscle.<br>\r\nIt would be a steep climb from here on. She was leaning on her elbows after all, and so her upper arm was almost a vertical wall in front of you. But there was hope: a thick strand of hair had escaped the rest and was dangling right below her shoulder. If you could get up there you could hold on to it, making the rest of the way much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began your climb and soon, you encountered another enemy - the heat. The bar wasn't exactly well ventilated, and so a thin layer of sweat was covering the arms of the gargantuan woman. More than once, you almost slipped. Which might not have been so bad, a small voice in the back of your had said. After all, if you fell now, there was only one place you would end up: right in the woman's top.<br>\r\nOf course, you couldn't pay that voice any mind. As enticing as it sounded, you hadn't planned on ending your life by diving into a titan sized cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, finally, you grabbed a hold of the thick strand of hair. Quickly, you entangled your hands as much as you could into it, forming an all natural safety knot. Now, you could simply climb your way up.<br>\r\nYou followed the hair until you were at eye level with the giantess. It was now or never. Your only chance. You opened your mouth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"HELP! Down here, Miss, please help me!\"</b></span></div></div>",

Haven't heard of something like this, either. Hey, cheer up!\" Tifa said as she saw your expression fall. \"Whatever magic brought you here, there must be a way to reverse it, right? Why don't you try casting the spell again?\"<br>\r\nYou looked up at her, puzzled. \"Spell?\"<br>\r\nTifa's expression changed once more, this time to worry. \"Don't tell me... you can't use magic?\"<br>\r\nYou shook your head.<br>\r\n\"Okay... that changes everything. I just thought this was a funny mishap, you know? But if you can't use magic, then I don't even know where to begin.\"<br>\r\n\"isn't there anyone who would? Maybe a mage or something... I don't know. Someone who knows about this kinda stuff!\" You yelled in frustration.<br>\r\n\"Well, its not that easy. For a start, I don't know anyone like this, and even if I did, the materia to pull a stunt like this is way above my pay grade. Hell, I barely manage to keep this hole running. I can't spend money on a fancy spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou broke down, falling to your knees on the gigantic bar counter. You had thought that simply making contact would be enough to solve this problem. But even the giantess, a native to this world, had no idea how to help you. Reality came crashing in. You were stuck here - and at a minuscule size at that.<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't sulk!\" Tifa let her finger softly brush against your head. Was she... petting you? \"I know its scary, but at least your safe with me. You can stay here for as long as you like, little girl.\" She laughed. \"After all, taking care of you should barely cost me anything. And hey, maybe I can find somebody who knows enough magic to send you back.\"<br>\r\nHope rose in your chest and you looked up. Tifa's face hovered above you, a warm and kind smile on her lips. At least you weren't alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But hey, lets not just stand around here.

Something about it rubbed you the wrong way...<br>\r\n\"Which also means that no one knows you're here, right?\" The giantess asked again.<br>\r\nYou didn't like the question.

Soon, her enormous face felt your entire field of vision.<br>\r\n\"Yeah... which is why I need your help!\" you yelled up towards her.

Magic in this world?\" you asked, completely thrown for a loop.<br>\r\nTifa only raised an eyebrow. \"What, there's none in yours? I thought you ended up here because of some magical mishap.\"<br>\r\nYou shook your head. \"There is no such thing in my world! But if there is in yours, maybe there is someone who could help me? Could you bring me to one of these mages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa snorted, the wind blowing out of her nose knocking you on to your butt.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't afford that. This place doesn't get very busy, so getting all the way up to the upper city would be pretty hard. Besides, the Shinra keep a tight leash on anything that powerful. And you don't want them getting their hands on you. They'd sooner give you to one of their weird scientists to dissect, then actually help you.\"<br>\r\nA shiver ran down your spine. That was the last thing you wanted.<br>\r\n\"So, you're gonna stay with me for the time being, little girl... I promise you, it'll be fun.\" Suddenly, she brought you almost directly to her mouth. Her voice dropped to a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>At least for one of us...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reeled backwards. The way she said that, the way she was looking at you - suddenly, it all made sense.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that? You've gotta help me!\" you yelled, though you couldn't mask the begging tone in your voice.<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't help you return to your world, so I'm gonna take care of you,\" Tifa smirked, \"but I can't exactly take care of you for free. And if you haven't noticed: this world isn't exactly the best. A lot is going wrong, and quite frankly, it's stressing me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked you up and down. You shivered under her hungry gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now I have you to take care of that... and if you want to stay here, you better make yourself useful and listen to me. You won't like it out there. Now, for your first task...\"</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You gets shrunken and ends up in a random world based on various popular media. However unlike many similar stories like this, you don't meet up with a character at the very beginning instead you end up at a certain location spot and which character you meet will be  up to the reader themselves to decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Each chapters must be a paragraph and have some effort put into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No character choices. You must choose a specific location to start the story and which character you meet up will be up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Use decent grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Any fetish is allowed as long as they're involved alongside with the main theme of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The protagonist can have any type of personality he/she could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Don't end the story so quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Deaths are okay, but put some effort into them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Unlike my other stories, this one not always be focused on survival but any type of situation you could think up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11/22/2017 update:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you SuperKirby2, Lover of all giantesses, revan92, Mr. Phorcys, 152, and everyone else for all the chapters you have added so far. With now over 100 chapters and 2000 views, I never knew my story could end up becoming so popular with the help of each of your support. Once again, thank you very much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are some bit of advices on those who wanted to make an addition:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't be afraid of adding a character that's already been added before. Remember you are only adding locations not characters, For example, if you want to make story about encountering Princess Zelda in a location even though someone else already did that in another, then go right ahead. No separate chapters are connected to each other so write at your own pace if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You don't have to add a well-known location like Peach's castle or Konohagakure, you can just add a random spot like in the middle of an open field or heck even on/in a character's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI encourage you guys to keep up the good work as always and don't worry about me, I'll try my best to add as well. At the meantime, make sure to check out my other stories as they too need some love as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n06/21/2019 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this time, the story's rating has now jumped from 13+ to 18+ giving everyone the freedom to write whatever fits their style whatever they want. Any chapters with violent, sexual or other contents that are common in older rated stories are accepted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there's still a few limits that you must follow. Just because you can write whatever you want does not mean there's no rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No extreme sexual content with underage characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so damn obvious why stuff like this should never be in the story. I don't want to see a story involving NSFW material with young characters because it's seriously messed up. So please don't go too far with this sort of stuff with the chapter involve around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No rebirthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still tolerate Insertion stuff....even if that's not my cup of tea. However, I can't really make sense with rebirthing stuff (I mean how can't you be turn into a newborn just by going inside reproductive organs) so I'm afraid this sort of stuff aren't allowed. My apologizes to all you fans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toilet stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I'm fine with some bodily functions like sweat, boogers, and so on. However, I'm not okay with pooping, peeing and other stuff that is commonly seen on the toilet. Seriously, I'm terribly grossed out by this sort of stuff. Of course, that doesn't mean everyone can't do their business as long it happens off-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you have it guys, go extra nuts and write what's ever in your mind ;)</td>",
