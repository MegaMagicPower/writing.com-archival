He sat there in his bed for a good 10 minutes, before he realized that he was dreaming. <span class=\"cmaroon\">Why am I having these dreams?\"</span> <span class=\"cblack\">He sat there for an hour thinking, and then fell asleep again. The moment he fell asleep he started having that dream again.</span><br>\r\nAs he was looking around, he saw a figure fighting heartless. As the mystery person was fighting, Roxas noticed his unusual sword. On closer inspection, he saw that it wasn't a sword, but a Keyblade. After another minute the heartless were gone. The mystery person suddenly looked over and spotted Roxas. Cooley and calmly the person started walking over to Roxas. Roxas, out of instinct, wielded his Keyblade. At the sight of this, the mystery person also, wielded his Keyblade. They stood there for a fee moments in silence then Roxas broke it. <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"Who are you?\"</span><span class=\"cplum\">\"My name is Sora.</span><span class=\"cmaroon\">\"What are you doing in my dream\"?</span><span class=\"cplum\">\"I believe I am not in your dream, but you are in mine\".</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cmaroon\">I don't know who you are, but I don't want you in my dream!</span>With those words, Roxas charges at sora. Sora manages to easily evade this attack. Then, Sora strikes back with a blow. Sora gets a direct hit, and Roxas gets launched across the room.<span class=\"cmaroon\">You little jerk!</span>With that Roxas makes another attempt. This time Sora blocks with his Keyblade. The only thing that bugged Roxas was that Sora was using the Kingdom Key as well. But he thought there was only one of each key. Roxas now losing the clash, decided he had to act. He ducked, dodging Sora's attack by inches. Then spun around and attempted to hit Sora by surprise. But, to Roxas' surprise, Sora was one step ahead of him, and with one simple move, blocked Roxas' attack and hit Roxas with amazing strength. Roxas collapsed almost unconscious. Before Roxas fell into the black darkness, Sora whispered in his ear: <span class=\"cplum\">\"Did you really think you could beat.......your somebody?\"</span>And in the next moment, Sora had disappeared. </span></div></div>",

He wasn't able to remeber anything that had happened that night. After resting for a couple hours, Roxas decides to go outside. All of a sudden, part of his memory started to return. He fell to the ground, unable to move. His head started to hurt again. After three minutes, everything stopped and went back to normal. He could faintly remember someone, a shadow of a person. While in his thoughts, he didn't see his best friend, Axel, walk up to him. <span class=\"cred\">HEY ROXAS!!!</span> <span class=\"cmaroon\">Wha..?
