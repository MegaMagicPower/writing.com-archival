Whenever he tried to move his neck more than a couple of inches it would hurt, and for days his chest still pulsed with pain as his ribs healed back together. Although he had to admit, it was significantly better from being bedridden at the local Pokemon Center, and the swelling around his tongue-scarf was gone. His boss, a Lucario, was most understanding about the whole affair, and how he wouldn't be able to give it his all at work. Aside from a scolding nag the moment he came off the office elevator, Will got to work at his own pace. As long as the deadlines were met by the end of the shift, some leeway could be given to doing it all by his non-dominant paw. It meant that for the next month he would be working extra hard and skipping out on weekends to blow off steam...but it was all worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus was it worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirginia Huffman defending her world title against Shoshana Glassfall, and him in the front row! It was the biggest match in recent history, with tens of thousands of fans packing the arena and countless millions watching around the world from their screens. William used his company vacation days to camp out weeks before the tickets went out and drained his wallet in the attempt to get as close as he possibly could to his favorite Goddess. He didn't want to miss this for the world. For the last two years, Shoshana, a Snorlax, had been wrecking her way through the wrestling circuits of the world like a force of nature, with almost every opponent she's faced having been pinned and beaten down to submission, not unlike courses at one of her meals. With a near-perfect victory score only brought down by her humbling first bout, to say that Shoshana was William's favorite Giantess was an understatement. She was more akin to a second sun in the sky that brought him out of his bed every morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana may not have been the biggest giantess ever, being a 'mere' 15 feet tall and 16 feet wide in her stomach, but that didn't diminish her overwhelming charisma and beauty. Her blubber was perfectly proportioned all around her body, just plush enough to be inviting but still firm enough that it didn't wobble without end when she moved. She had a face that looked like it was stolen from a statue made in tribute to a legendary, and when she would flash that warm smile and soaked in all the lights and cameras, you could mistake her for a real-life angel. Everything about her screamed for attention, her spirit alone making others feel small the same way her height and weight did. Shoshana Glassfall was born to be not just a star, but a dominating force that everyone else could only look upon with awe. She had taken down women bigger than her without once twisting her model-like visage into a frown or even mild concern. She made her victories look so effortless it was like she was dancing around her opponents, and you almost forgot what crushing power she had inside her engorged frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost forget.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam certainly wouldn't be forgetting that anytime soon. The sight of Shoshana picking Virginia up and hurling the Dragonite over the ropes would be ingrained in his memory for years, even if Virginia hadn't gone rolling into the stands, right over William. It wasn't as bad as it could have been, though. He had just been knocked down by one of Virginia's legs, not squashed directly under her body like those other poor/lucky souls. Heck, he hadn't even lost consciousness. While waiting for the medics to get to him, he had managed to sit up just in time to see Shoshana get Virginia into a leg lock and make her submit. Shoshana Glassfall was now the world champion, and William had been there to witness it. It was the greatest day of his life, and many tears were shed. Not just tears of pain, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a doubt, worth the injuries and medical expenses. You can't buy a moment like that, you can only accept the price...as high as they were. As he finished dressing a couple of days later, pulling his pants up and then zipping and buttoning them one-handed, William heard his doorbell ring. Standing on the other side was a Zoroark in a gray suit. But William's eyes had not even registered the Pokemon's presence before they looked past him to the much more surprising sight in front of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Shoshana Glassfall! The world champion, the Alluring Leviathan here! Parked in front of his house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sitting back in her carriage, a reconfigured limousine with an open, padded bed to allow the world champion to sit back and lounge as she was driven everywhere. She was wearing a black, embroidered skirt and a tight-fitting blouse tied underneath her bosom, giving her belly ample space to rest free and comfortable across her legs. Her hair was pinned up behind her head in a Ponyta, with solid gold bracelets as big as monster-truck tires around her left wrist. She tapped her pudgy digits across the screen of her phone, a phone so big it could double as William's television set, with her gaze concealed behind a pair of aviator sunglasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister Tipton?\" The Zoroark asked. \"...Mister Tipton!\" He repeated himself, raising his voice a little and touching the Greninja on his unbroken shoulder to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" William blinked before his mind caught up with the context of the situation of blushed profusely. \"O-oh, yes! Th-that's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Eugene, Ms. Glassfall's manager.\" The shock of the situation did not recede, but as William's mind, all abuzz with exhilaration adapted to the feeling other parts of his brain joined the party, he recognized the man now. He blinked again, realizing that the Zoroark was...pretty small. He had only come up to the frog's tongue, and although he was pretty tall himself, he had always thought that everything associated with Shoshana would be...bigger than him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Glassfall heard about the injuries you and others experienced during her title bout, and she's been going around on a tour to visit you all and show her appreciation for your support. Would you like to meet her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam brought his left paw to his mouth to keep himself from screaming in affirmation. The Zoroark got the point. Following behind Eugene, he walked up to the sidewalk, marveling at the fact that he was now even closer to Shoshana than he had been during her match. Even while reclining she was a monument of size and strength that William almost feared to get too close to, some primal sense warning him of the danger of being crushed or trampled by this beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoshana!\" Eugene yelled. She turned from her phone and looked down at the two men, her expression momentarily blanks as if she did not know why she was here. \"This is William Tipton. He was in the second row at your match!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Front, actually,\" William corrected with a quiet sense of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...another one of my fans,\" Shoshana said, leaning down to get a better look at him. Her voice felt like a tank of honey had been dumped on his head. \"I hope that Dragonite didn't bang you up too much when I sent her flying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No,\" William sputtered, then he repeated louder, \"No! I came out of it pretty OK! I even stayed awake long enough to see you win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did?\" The Snorlax's face lit up at that. \"Thank you so much. It means a lot to me to know all you little people are cheering me on. It wouldn't be half as fun to win if I didn't have my fans watching me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bet!\" William said, barely hearing what she was saying. Just the fact she was talking to him made his heart want to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me give you something to remember me by.\" And without letting him respond she reached one paw out, hooked it under William's good arm, and picked him up. Like an antique doll, she carried him up and over to her belly, setting him down gently enough that he didn't cry out in pain. As close as he was now, William couldn't catch his breath. He was sitting on Shoshana Glassfall's belly, looking past the canyon of her cleavage at her flawless face as big as a window. He had never felt so small before now, which meant that he had never seen her so huge before. With one hand supporting him, Shoshana plunged her other in-between her boobs and pulled out a pen the size of a shower rod. \"Hold still a sec,\" she said, and to William's eternal joy she signed 'Shoshana' across his cast in glittering silver letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how about a picture?\" she asked, and again she didn't wait for him to respond, she just turned him around and brought him up to her breasts. Into her breasts, actually. She held him so tight his lower body was sucked into her cleavage. Not that it mattered. When she extended her arm and snapped a selfie only William's head ended up in the picture. The rest of it was Shoshana's still shaded face, her lips pursed as if blowing a kiss. To William, it was the best picture he ever had. \"Be sure to keep cheering me on,\" Shoshana said as she deposited him, one-handed, back on the ground. William felt woozy, swaying in place. He needed a minute to catch the breath that had been squeezed out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet,\u201d he said meekly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William was smiling dopily underneath his tongue scarf, his eyes half-lidded as his whole body shuddered periodically in bliss. He felt as if he had gone to heaven and settled down on Cloud Nine because that's what he thought was a more realistic scenario than meeting the Alluring Leviathan. He wanted to say more, perhaps wish his idol good luck as the new world champion, maybe promise her he'd be there for her next bout despite his saving being non-existent now. But even if he had mustered up the courage to spit something out, it would have been drowned out by her manager's throat clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! I do hate to bog this excursion down with legalities, but we didn't come here just for an autograph.\" The short Soroark explained after a fit of wet hacking. He walked over to the front of the limousine to bring out a sizeable thick stack of papers from the front passenger seat. \"Utterly painless, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana lifted her shades, looking down at her Zoroark manager in mild disbelief. \"Oh Arceus, Gene...\" The scene would have been comical if there wasn't the undercurrent of inevitable tragedy to it. \"I thought I told you that wasn't necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe short Zoroark turned around with surprising confidence. \"Ms. Glassfall, with all the respect that is due, you are in no position to make that judgment.\" To see the short fox getting in his client's face (figuratively speaking) and telling her to shut up was like seeing an ant try to frighten off a cow. \"And I won't let this Greninja railroad you into a corner with frivolous lawsuits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-lawsuits?!\" William was quickly roused from his ecstatic stupor and found himself in a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, and I'm here to deliver you mine.\" The Zoroark pushed the stack of papers into William's good arm. \"My client, Shoshana Glassfall, has experienced severe emotional anguish from your injuries and is in a position to sue you for psychological damages upwards of twenty million dollars. Of course, this can all be avoided if you just sign this non-disclosure agreement denying any such events happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana, normally so cool and composed, looked weary-eyed as she palmed her chubby face. \"Uh...uh, sure. Yeah, I'll sign. I wasn't going to sue in the first place, but...\" Eugene cut him off by pushing a pen into his mouth forcefully. The frog narrowed his eyes at the illusion fox. Now that was just dickish. Reluctantly, he maneuvered the pen past his tongue scarf to sign his name on the dotted line. He spat the writing instrument out gave the legal documents back. \"So...I'm not getting sued?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for emotional distress, at least.\" The manager put the stack of papers back in the front seat, only to come back and remove a thinner assortment from his grey coat. \"You ARE however getting sued over your breach of contract. You posted online several photos of yourself at the hospital recovering from your injuries, explicitly stating you got them from my client's title bout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did!\" William protested. \"That had to be one of the best days of my whole life, I felt lucky to have been there! Of course, I was going to share some photos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Shoshana shifted her bulk around in her carriage so she could swing one leg and then the other down to the ground. Then she stood up, not only towering over her manager but looming over him with her mountain of belly fat looking ready to avalanche all over the two. \"Gene.\" She said slowly. \"Put that away, apologize to Mr. Tipton, and get back in the car. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. G-Glassfall.\" He stuttered, trying to still be cool underneath his client's shadow. \"Understand that I am acting in your best interests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I have done to him,\" she said, her voice slow but holding back a flood of rage, \"is show my appreciation for his support. I cherish all my fans, that is how generous I am. But to my enemies-\" And like a viper, her hand darted out and grabbed the Zoroark, her speed, and agility shocking to anyone unfamiliar with how counter-intuitively athletic giantesses are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a trick I used in the junior circuits. The crowd always loved it.\" With one hand she grabbed her manager by both arms, and with the other, she grabbed both legs. Then she looped the Zoroark across the front of her belly, stretching him taut until he uttered a shriek of pain. An old trick in giantess-on-normie matches, a crowd favorite, but Shoshana had her twist on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping up a few feet into the air, she belly-flopped onto William's lawn, with Eugene crushed under hundreds upon hundreds of pounds of fat. Shoshana had enough practice and experience to know how to deliver just enough force to be as punishing as possible without killing the poor thing outright, but it looked like both would need casts for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Shoshana stood up, she found her manager driven into the very soil, his body sinking a few inches deeper than the crater the champ's belly had made. He was breathing, gasping short, ragged breaths, but he wasn't going to speak or move anytime soon. \"Consider that your pink slip, Gene.\" She smirked, before turning her gaze over to the Greninja. \"Sorry 'bout busting up your lawn. Those lawyer types get on my nerves fast, and he's sued people for less before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no worries.\" William smiled, blushing. That ecstatic stupor has returned to him in full force. Not only did he get to see Shoshana do one of her old fashioned wrestling moves, but she also saved him from the evils of lawyers! It was like something out of a fairy tale...well, if the princess was a prince and the hero was a sumo giantess. Okay, nothing like a fairy tale, but it still felt all so magical. \"...hey, do you need a new manager now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana breathed out a heavy sigh that almost threatened to blow him over. \"Yeah, I guess. They're a dime a dozen. But it's a total hassle, trying to get a good deal, having to put up with all their entitled attitudes...\" she looked down at her little fan and saw that the more she talked, the wider his smile got. She smiled back. \"Why you ask? Know anyone who could all this Snorlax?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\" William almost shouted, catching the Snorlax by surprise. \"I mean, uh, I-I work for a talent agency that oversees the affairs of people in the music business. I'm n-not a manager myself and we've never had a wrestler for a client, but...\" the Greninja tried to cover his face with his tongue scarf. Arceus, he was blowing it! Why did he even bring that up?! Now she probably thinks that he's some sort of desperate creep or...or...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana couldn't take it anymore. After holding it in for so long, she burst out in a fit of giggles that forced William out from his self-depreciation. \"Hahaha! Oh Arceus, you...you're just adorable!\" The fat Snorlax bent down and cupped the small froggy into her paws, raising him high into the air before talking to him again. \"Alright Willy, I'm sold. Let's get this squared away. Where do ya work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...306 Wagstaff Street.\" The Greninja blinked. Was she being serious, or could this all be a big joke? \"You know...they probably won't take you on. L-like I said they mostly stick to people in music, and even if they did, I'm just an accountant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can be very persuasive.\" Was all she said on that matter before she dropped William into her monumental bosom. She began walking down the street, having forgotten about her carriage. Without Eugene to drive it, it was nothing more than a waste of space to her. \"Now...do you know how I got so big, Willy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam gasped as he found his body suddenly swallowed up to his armpits in soft, quivering breast flab, where the top of his head grazed Shoshana's chubby chin. The cast on his right arm began to chafe as the rest of his body broke out in a sweat. It was warm, he could hear her heartbeat, exhale and inhale. \"U-uh...\" he stuttered, struggling to crane his neck to meet her gaze. \"You got big by, er...eating, Ms. Shoshana...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, Willy.\" The Snorlax beamed down at him with a toothy smile. \"Good Ol' fashioned gluttony, nothing more. Most of my managers in the past, they knew that too. But for some strange reason...they didn't want me to go all out. Said that they were scared of me getting 'too big'. You, however...you don't look like you know what 'too big' means.\" She didn\u2019t go out of her way to knock over any of the other pedestrians on the sidewalk. It just happened naturally. With her ass spanning most of the sidewalk she simply bowled over anyone who couldn\u2019t get out of the way fast enough, and while crossing one street she hip-checked a car, actually turning it 90 degrees and denting a door, just because it had crept into the crosswalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha...I guess you got a point there!\" William blushed and would have tried to hide it if his good arm wasn't enveloped in plush boob fat. \"I mean, I spent almost my whole savings on seeing your fight, got my arm nearly knocked off during it, and I don't regret any of it. I guess I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like big girls?\" She finished for him. \"I could tell, Willy. Now, with that in mind...I do have one teensy tiny itty bitty rule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana twisted the frog in her breasts around, not too quickly but still forcefully. He looked up and saw her smile has taken on a more serious, almost threatening tone. \"Never tell me I can't eat...got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course, Shoshana!\" He agreed, perhaps a little too eagerly. Satisfied with this response, she turned him around again, casually making her way to...</span></div></div>",

The front door had practically exploded as she heaved her massive frame through. The worst part was that, as monstrously obese as she was, she was shamelessly clothed in a tight-fitting blouse that didn't reach her stomach and a skirt that barely covered anything at all.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer gargantuan, barely-contained breasts loomed in front of her. The blouse she had on looked more like a bra really, groaning and buckling with her slightest motion, the many straps that held it together creaking. Heck, everyone could see both of her nipples poking out shamelessly, which she didn't bother covering up! Probably because nothing else would fit her colossal chest, but still.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSitting in the shadow of those giant boobs was an overfed, blubbery, fully-exposed belly that spilled obesely over her barely visible shorts. That belly was enormous in its own right, but the Snorlax's hourglass form meant it looked small compared to her gigantic tits and ass.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer hips and ass stretched out several feet away from her, in equal proportion to her gargantuan chest to balance out all her weight. It was like a shelf made of two massive fat globes, supported by huge thick thighs, and was pretty much fully exposed as it consumed her tiny skirt between its cheeks. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs she lumbered over to the buffet table, the very ground shook under her feet, and the floor cracked under her weight. Giantesses were pretty rare around the Pokemon World, and Snorlax was equally so. No one had ever seen such an enormous Snorlax before, and pretty much every customer thought of the same thing: better grab your last servings now, because there would be nothing left once this Wailord was through with it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShoshana, on the other hand, was having the time of her life. 'Arceus, I just love being a big girl' she thought with a grin, as she lumbered towards the buffet table for the ninth time.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She loved how the entire restaurant shook as she walked. She loved how the floor cracked under her weight. She loved how she felt her every bulging, blubbery curve wobble, bounce, and jiggle with her slightest motion. She loved how her clothes groaned, struggling to contain all of her and barely hanging on.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She even loved those whispers alluding to her gluttony, her fatness, her overwhelming hugeness, and the stares of mild horror as she lumbered past other diners, their entire tables falling under her massive shadow. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"How many times has she gone back...?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I don't know, I lost count after her 25th plate...\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey did have a point though. Why bother going back and forth, since she devoured plate after plate so quickly anyway? \"Plate...?\" offered one of the waiters by the buffet unsurely, holding up a plate as Shoshana's shadow loomed over him massively. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe looked ahead, the fat lower roll of Shoshana's belly bulging onto the buffet table before him and almost knocking off the nearest trays of food. He and the rest of the waiters had to refill those trays several times that night thanks to her, and word from the kitchen where they were running low on food...<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe looked up, barely able to see her plump face looking down at him past her mammoth rack, forming a roof over his head with nipples exposed. \"Don't bother, lil' guy,\" she said, as she proceeded to pick up the entire tray of pork chops right off the buffet table.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The waiter could only gawk as Shoshana picked out a couple of pork chops at a time straight out of the buffet tray, shoveling them into her mouth like chips. The entire tray was emptied within seconds, but Shoshana had one more display of shameless gluttony.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The gargantuan Snorlax lifted the tray over her head and proceeded to pour all the oil and fat leftover in the tray right into her mouth, her fat arms and giant tits wobbling as she shook out every last drop. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Refill!\" she grinned, setting the emptied tray back down and licking her oily fingers and lips clean. She then turned her attention to the next tray, stacked with fried chicken...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"S-sorry, she just finished a tour talking to her fans, so she's hungry...\" apologized William who had appeared next to the overfed belly of his massive soon to be a client. He gave it a few soothing rubs, the buffet table shaking as the heavy gut that rested on it jiggled. Another couple was standing behind her in the buffet line, several feet away since her giant ass projected so far behind. They were watching the enormous Shoshana dump tray after tray of food into her mouth piggishly, not leaving anything to the rest of the diners. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I wonder how he handles her? Poor guy\" whispered the slightly heavy-set Persian to her husband, both of them staring wide-eyed at the gigantic booty bulging before them. That ass could crush their car!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Remind me never to comment on the size of your ass again\" gulped her husband, affectionately patting her sizeable rump, which looked minuscule compared to the gargantuan behind in front of them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n The incident at Paul\u2019s Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord was unique. She had gone all out like that before, at different little buffet places all across her travels. Normally, her current manager would throw a panic attack and did everything in their power to get her to stop, to varying success. However, with the Greninja, she didn't stop until she decided to stop. He placated the owners of the place and offered platitudes to the other guests who didn't get to eat, but other than that he let her go wild. After that, she went over to Willy\u2019s workplace to get it all squared away. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n Over the next few days, Public displays of fatness like the one at Paul\u2019s Sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord became a regular thing for the proud and ever-growing Snorlax. She didn't care if most folks thought she was \"too fat\" for whatever she wore. She purposely flaunted what she got, and boy did she have a lot.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u201cDear Arceus-!\u201d gasped William, who had not seen his new client since that day. Being Shoshana\u2019s manager was surprisingly pawed off, with him being bogged down in her expense reports and scheduling her events as World Champion. It was a lot, but he was doing surprisingly well for someone who had no experience in this kind of work. This morning he managed to make a big enough dent in the paperwork to see his new client. He watched the monstrously fat Snorlax struggling to squeeze herself through the store's doorway.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n He watched as not just the doorway, but also chunks of the surrounding wall cracked and flew off as Shoshana's curves helped her bulldoze her way inside. Wearing a tiny crop top that barely stretched over her giant tits, areolas showing and a nipple already poking out, belly fully exposed, and tiny shorts that were all but swallowed between her buttocks, it was clear Shoshana wasn't ashamed to show off her overgrown figure.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n And towering over everyone, her head pressing against the shop's ceiling, she was quite a sight indeed. The fact that she was munching on a box of pastries with her face covered in sugar and cream added to her overall obese appearance. \"Willy!\" she called, waving a fat, wobbling arm and proceeding to lumber over to her lil\u2019 Froggie. William gasped again, feeling the entire store shake under her friend's every heavy footstep, the ground cracking under her feet. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n 'Wow. Has she...has she gotten bigger since I saw her last\u2026?\u2019 thought William, as he watched the Snorlax Shoshana approach, every bulging curve wobbling with fat. The side of Shoshana's gigantic bosom smashed against a display, sending it flying. Her vast, swaying hips and booty collided with a shelf, which crashed to the ground.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n To observers staring at her, which was everyone, Shoshana didn't seem to notice the destruction her colossal curves were causing, continuing her bulldozing walk through the store. But Shoshana did notice; she just pretended to ignore it. 'Arceus, this store can't even handle all my curves' she thought with a grin and a bite of her lip, as she felt her giant boobs and hips knock stuff over. She felt everything-the<br>\r\n heavy wobbling of her fat, the ground cracking underneath her, the entire store shaking, even her nipples slowly starting to poke out of her rapidly failing top...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n She looked at the many faces staring at her, different Pokemon, all dwarfed by her hugeness. She could barely see them past the vast area her tits took up in front of her, cleavage jiggling and jostling as everything around shook with her weight. She loved the feeling of being so enormous.  'How could anyone get so...so...so HUGE?' gulped William, just as Shoshana arrived in front of him, the gargantuan Snorlax's shadow looming over. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"And here I thought you couldn't get any FATTER...\" chided William, who couldn't help but rub the enormous, fully-exposed belly before him, giving that keg like gut a two-handed wobble. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Oh, be quiet\" grinned Shoshana, licking her lips after dumping the last of the pastries into her mouth piggishly. One of the many straps of her top snapped, and her other nipple poked out for all to see, fabric yielding to her weighty, gigantic breast. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Shoshana, your ummm...everyone can see you...\" whispered William.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Shoshana grinned even wider than before. By no means was she ashamed in the slightest. \u201cThe trials of being so voluptuous, Will, not much I can do about that!\u201d she said, trying to tuck her mammoth breast in but only causing her giant bosom to wobble heavily. She could feel everyone staring, staring at those monstrous, exposed boobs bursting out of their prison.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n Now, why did Shoshana want to meet up with William?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>William drifted too close to Shoshana as the entrance to the mall shrunk behind them. For this, he was bowled over by one of her thighs. Better give me my space,\" Shoshana smiled, not in the least bit sorry for her actions. Weighing in at a ton and a half and standing at a significantly taller height from when she first found herself on her soon to be manager's lawn, the Snorlax didn't need to try to send her itty bitty Frog flying away from her bouncing, body while in motion. Her fat jiggled like a lava lamp but each roll had the kick of a cannonball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam knew this well by now. Barley ten minutes could elapse before she was hip-checking, belly-bumping or ass-crashing into him. Often on purpose, but sometimes because she genuinely forgot he was there.  But as dangerous as she was to get close to...the Greninja was too smitten to keep his distance. His wandering red eyes kept focusing around every curve his idol possessed, and she was all too well aware of this. She was in charge, and despite him being her boss, it felt more like being her trained pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing he didn't like about his situation was how easy it was to get into the groove of it. As pets go, he was certainly an adored one, with blood rushing up underneath his tongue scarf every time Shoshana called him her lil' Froggie. As soon as he was on the ground he was pushing himself back to his feet, apologizing to the alluring leviathan and skipping to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana looked down and gave her manager a wide grin. \"I didn't hurt your arm, did I?\" She asked, this time sounding much more genuine. It was still bound in a cast, but it was healing quickly. With a shake of his head, she focused her thoughts on two things: food and clothes. Whichever order they came in, it wouldn't matter. The voluptuous world champ began to rub and paw at her stomach. It felt so empty right now, having digested most of the buffet she had cleaned out before she decided to go clothes shopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-would you like me to go-go get you some food, Shosh?\" William asked, feeling comfortable enough around her at this point to refer to her as such. Like a cobra she snatched Steve by his shirt, almost tearing it as she pulled him onto her belly. Beneath him, her black hole of a stomach roared like a force of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always in the mood for food, Silly Willy,\" she smiled, a hungry, happy glee in her eyes as she teased her Greninja. She sniffed the air, her gaze drifting over William's shoulder. \"Mhmm...they is a hot dog stand nearby. Could you be a dear and run your skinny legs over there? I wanna eat before I get some new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\" William blurted, sliding off Shoshana's plush belly when she let go of him. Obediently, he bolted to the food vendor. The Snorlax preached down and grabbed the waistband of her spandex shorts; when she yanked on them she felt a rip appear on her left thigh. She let out a curt snort of air from her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheap crap.\" It wasn't the shorts' fault, though. Women's fashion was increasingly limited the larger you got, as there was only so much stretch spandex or lycra could give. Her shorts were already making a valiant effort at containing her bountiful backside. The car-sized carriage needed shorts or pants measured not with several X's before an L but in square yardage. The only goal of her pants was to cover enough to keep her decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this pair was just barely doing that, though they were honestly trying. It's just that reaching from the top of her butt cleavage around and down along the bottom curve of her cheeks took everything they had. The bottom of her shorts disappeared into the fold where butt met leg, squeezing to make the fat of her thighs pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed a whole new wardrobe, having outgrown almost everything she owned. But that was just a convenient excuse for her desire for more. And really, wasn't wanting something enough to justify taking it? When she stopped her musings, William was by her side, holding two trays loaded down with chili dogs and fries. He knew better than to ask if she was still hungry, instead just holding them out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" she commanded, even before one dog had disappeared into her mouth. Of course, all the food was gone by the time William came back with two more trays. It all felt so good. To feel herself transforming, becoming fatter and bigger and hungrier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...that that's all they had,\" William announced worryingly, holding out one minuscule tray in front of him. Shoshana took it, dumped all the food into her mouth at once, and swallowed. \"Yo...you're still hungry, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Shoshana belched, rubbing the sides of her belly. Her eyes were half-closed, a lazy smile lighting up her face. After coming down from her high, It only diminished slightly when she noticed her how despondent her Greninja was. \"Aww, don't beat yourself up, Willy. It's not your fault they ran out of food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam perked up at that, just in time for Shoshana to grab him again and shove him right into her belly. \"Hehe...go on, give it a feel. See how big it is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There...uh, there's nothing else like it,\" William said, turning his head so he didn't get a face full of the belly. He pawed fat fistfuls of her flesh, horny as all hell despite the manhandling the Snorlax was giving him. She dragged him on top of the great sphere like it was a mattress for him to stretch on. \"Uh...should I keep rubbing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana said nothing but conveyed affirmation through a wink and a smile. She walked to the plus-sized Polemon fashion boutique in the mall, savoring her feast up until this point but acutely aware of how everyone around her was staring at her. \"Welcome!\" a perky, 500 lb Delphox women greeted the Snorlax. She must have noticed the Greninja perched atop her tummy, but she ignored him. \"Are you here to check out our new designer line? Just got it yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that sounds fun!\" The alluring leviathan was led by the Delphox to a set of dressing rooms near the back. Catering to the largest of the large meant there wasn't much floor space for anything except private rooms to try on and model clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and get comfortable and I'll find some outfits for you to try. Is there anything, in particular, you'd like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything form-fitting,\" Shoshana replied, sashaying her ass subconsciously for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was your size I would too,\" the clerk smiled. \"I've got some ideas. Be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and make sure they're brightly colored. I'm not trying to blend in or anything.\" Shoshana squeezed her way into the dressing room. It was just large enough for her to turn around, looking herself all over in the ring of mirrors that ran on every wall. She noticed William sneaking behind her and instinctively backed up, pinning him in place. \"And where do you think you're going, Silly Willy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Greninja hasped as he suddenly found hundreds and hundreds of pounds worth of butt flesh pressed upon his body. \"I-it's just that...this is the women's dressing room...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's just a silly opinion your having~\" The Snorlax smiled with a wink. While your there, though, my booty needs some attention. Could I trouble you for a massage?\" He had no choice but to obey, and he was starting to get uncomfortable turned on again when the clerk returned pushing a cart filled with tent-sized garments. Shoshana let her Willy free and began peeling the skin-tight spandex off of herself. The frog was getting a strip show, complete with multiple mirrors so he couldn't look away. The clerk handed her the first piece, a bright blue tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're boyfriend is so cute! Wish my boyfriend was half as appreciative.\" the clerk commentated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boyfriend?\" Shoshana tilted her head. She looked down at her manager, beyond flustered and embarrassed, and was waiting for his client to correct the statement. He shrunk his face underneath his tongue scarf and bit into it hard. \"...Thanks, I guess he is a little dreamboat, isn't he? I only had to convince him to be my client to go out with me on a date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam let out a series of coughs and hacks as he choked on his saliva. He swallowed on reflex from the shock and it went down the wrong tube. Shoshana gave her lil' Froggie a cool look, giggling a little from the show. \"What did you think this was, a typical manager/client excursion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoshana left the dressing room wearing a pink fluorescent tube top and a pair of hot pink leggings with the word 'Eat' printed three times on each butt cheek, giving the impression of a chant. William followed behind her, pushing two carts of more clothing that put a definite strain on his limited muscular prowess. Not that he would complain. He was the boyfriend of Shoshana Glassfall. He had no reason to not be happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce rung up Shoshana walked out of the boutique, looking back to make sure Willy was keeping up with her and managing all the bags of clothing. \"Hey...\" she stopped to give the Greninja some help with the many articles of clothing he was carrying. \"Sorry about...everything. I guess I kinda got so rapt in going on a date with you that...I forgot to tell you it was one. So...can we pretend that you brought all these clothes for me from home and we just got here at the mall? So we can go on a...real date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alan never saw himself as an important person. Yes, all life was sacred, but as long as there were other people in the world that were firefighters, policemen, or just those with a degree in nuclear engineering, it wouldn\u2019t be a worse world without him than with all the other folks who would train themselves to help others and save lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...yet it were only eleven inches of ballistic glass that separated him from the aerated chemicals of an alien world, an invisible cloud of toxic compounds that resembled no law of science or matter that none of all humanity\u2019s knowledge of the world could define. An atmosphere that was a complete enigma as to how any one creature, even if native to another planet could survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn even bigger enigma as to how there <i>was</i> one creature that could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring was Alan\u2019s job every day, both the easiest and hardest job he would ever know. Staring through the window as stiff as a board, debating the hours away over whether he was thankful or resented that the gases inside were invisible, enabling him to see the lone being inside with utmost clarity. It were a series spanning months that he was required to observe; once, in a point in time that felt so long ago, there was another human in that cell. A woman that, as he thought he himself looked, didn\u2019t seem any more beautiful than she did ugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, those days when the standing on guard was so easy. If too sick to know he was there or too embarrassed to make eye contact, she would spend most of the time laying about, back when the blanket of her cot could shroud her entirely. Most days she wouldn\u2019t even leave bed outside of getting her daily meals, the very last thing that would inspire her to move. He hated the food at the office, and the food they served the subjects was likely no better, but its taste didn\u2019t diminish her appetite. She would eat from her trays till she were cleaning it with her tongue, its sub-par flavors inviting the last spark of life that she would ever know as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeek by week, the schedule stayed the same. She would lay about, eat breakfast, lay, eat lunch, lay, eat supper, sleep. Then that morning when one breakfast wasn\u2019t enough to help her feel, she asked for more. Another tray came for breakfast. Two would come for lunch, two again for dinner. Thus came the schedule for another week till two was so little that she was sobbing in hunger. Even a third tray couldn\u2019t cure her hunger pains, nor four, but it was by her fifth that she was full enough to sit still, belly so round and bloated that she lumbered back to bed with a slight waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy another week, breakfast was <i>twelve.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood became her drive in life, her time between naps spent waiting in anticipation for the next banquet to be prepared for her. The change meant progress at last, and her dining sessions were accompanied by scientists in three layers of hazmat suits. They would take questions from her, preferably \u2018yes or no\u2019 ones for when her mouth was too occupied with chewing to give lengthy responses, but with the silence the transparent wall had abandoned Alan to, he could only notice and care for the change that took over her physical form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was once a modest chest came a pair of definite points that touched the front of her jumpsuit, and from them came a swollen set of milk-filled orbs that billowed past the size of her head, even after the excess calories fattened up her cheeks and chin and her stomach was burdened by so much natural lard that even in its most empty state was a capacious sphere of paunch that sprung liberally off her abdomen. It weight crumpled the cot and metal chairs that her cell provided her, but by that point her trim rear had evolved into a hovering landmass of adipose floating along her legs that even two seats wouldn\u2019t contain, forming her figure\u2019s absolute widest point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch she was forced to eat her meals without something to sit on, but witnessing the scientists enter her room gave reference for a definite change in height, nearing the size of a grown mean even when she was sitting on the floor. New jumpsuits would be brought in every week or so to contain her ever-ballooning figure, the scientists increasingly nervous with their turns in entering her cell, probably due to the fear she\u2019d develop the hunger and ability to eat them, and under his steely facade Alan was amongst them. If it came to happen where she\u2019d grab one of them and swallow them whole, he figured he\u2019d be the first running out the door, probably before the alarms were even going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet an alarm was never pulled. If growing to perhaps the largest band fattest person in human history was the price, having food seemed enough for her. The regular schedule was allowed to resume around her glutting, save for her to answer questions in written form, her face was so often stuffed. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, suit change, sleep. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, suit change, sleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anywhere there was another case such as hers, that this change in size was something medical science could relate to and cure, the last doubt that this wasn\u2019t human course was a rip that, when she was venturing to sleep one night, opened a gap to observe the skin on her stomach. A non-human shade of black, striped by green around her waist. The scientists tore the rip wider to observe the large splotch of the color that painted her stomach\u2019s curvature, but if the change gave her any feeling, it was a numbing that curbed any interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing meant more surface area, and more surface area meant more land to plot, the virus, parasite or whatever had infected her noticed. It blanketed her torso and spread to her limbs, and the shift in color twisted about whatever joints or human anatomy they passed over, hands and feet turning to puny nubs adhered to the blobby girths of her arms and legs. Last came her head, hair dying itself a glossy green lined with black striped and bluish splotches, then her face morphed beyond whatever humanity she had left; her lips receded, her nose sealed itself shut before completely flattening into a patch of empty skin, and her pupils disappeared and left her irises two solid discs of blue, outlined by black lashes resembling eyeliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the first eye contact she\u2019d ever made with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one night, he\u2019d gone from the spectator to the second party in a mute conversation separated by the glass. She\u2019d stare at him, and he\u2019d stare back, concentrating and calculating the thoughts that one another\u2019s eyes had even when she was hogging herself on mountains of cafeteria trays sitting at either side of her, or when scientists were taking her measurements and drawing samples of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScientists that he was steadily growing to hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bastards...in the same room as everything he wanted so much of at the moment, but didn\u2019t even realize what they had. Getting to feel around her huge, no doubt relentlessly soft stomach with no errant of affection. Getting to feed her and make her bigger like it was only their jobs. She knew it, too. He could be wearing a bag over his mask, and the little twitches his body would emit could tell anybody with an eye for detail that he wanted to be with her so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat blank stare became a hammy expression of hunger, grunting out in pleasure that filled his ears with the noise when the wall left him deaf. She\u2019d scratch herself more than too many times for it to be natural itching; she was feeling her own dimensions, hands sloping around the rolls and curves to her obtuse size with a coy grin aimed right at him. Walking anywhere in her dome was a jiggly saunter that let him see something else when he was used to seeing whatever there was when she was seated...and he had to see it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeing her for more than a second would mean he would be fired, maybe arrested, but if he was too weak to resist and he typed those nine digits in that would release her, they wouldn\u2019t have enough time. If her ability to swagger about with no visible pain could indicate her size, she could overpower any human being with a gun. Maybe even sustain a bullet blast with all that blubber. If it was anything between her taking him up in glee or her crushing him beneath her behind in some act of dominance, he\u2019d fantasized about it late at night, and hate himself all the more for being a good little soldier and staying at his post whenever going home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see his life out of work firsthand, and her measures came all the more desperate. When her ass widened to such a size that it surpassed the bed, she put the pillow at its end and, pointing so that he would picture it as his own head, squeezed it in between the seismic intensity that left only a few metal pipes of the frame. Then it became so big that she could just approach the door backwards for no reason than just to press it against the entire glass wall which, when it was your entire line of sight, made it all that was left to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what was it today? What was that wild, crazy antic she had in mind to top the last in seducing him into opening the door?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing. Twelve feet tall, even wider, all she had on her mind was standing against the door, her titanic gut smooshed against the door. She had an almost thankful smile creased along her blobby white cheeks, like she knew she\u2019d already won and was grateful for him being such a good sport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...is she right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Alan gives into temptation. He frees her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Alan remains strong. She has to resort to more underhanded tactics...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Alan opens the door, but shift over to a village near the laboratory, the first to feel the effects of the released gases...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>How does one manage to fall in love with a thing that is so patently not a human, and yet so resembles one in all the correct ways? Does one chalk it up as a mere lust, shallow puppy love that can\u2019t go deeper then worshipful affection? Does one leave the love to ferment in limerence, to attempt to stop obsessing about having their feelings reciprocated and fall back out of the love they were in? Or...does one act on their knee-jerk reactions from their more carnal emotions and take the first step down an uncertain path? Alan thought very long and very hard on these questions as he sat in his little guard chair, doing his job and observing the \u2018subject\u2019 smoosh her globular, inky black stomach into the doorway she expected him to open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a good solid ten minutes of this intense self-reflection, enough time for the once human inside her glass bubble to think she might need to try another way to coax her sentry...he stands up from his metallic chair, having decided. Slowly, he walks around the circumference of the transparent dome, the object of his fantasies never leaving his line of sight, while she stared back with a smile on her chubby cheeks. She knew exactly what Alan was doing, and Alan knew she knew. It had come to Alan\u2019s attention, during his rigorous self-critique of himself moments ago, that he lacked real purpose in his life. Growing up he always had dreams about becoming a politician or a doctor or even a chef, but he never acted on those dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe assumed that was all they were, dreams. And so dreamless, he went into college and found that he did not know what to do with himself. He honestly couldn't even remember what exactly he chose to major in at the end, but he did remember he decided through trial and error. It was the major with the least amount of classes, the least amount of critical work on his part, and after he graduated he took up the offer of a shady governmental organization whose name did not come up when he typed it into a search engine on the internet. There was nothing exceptional or special about him, he summarized, and the only important thing he may ever do was give in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGive in and let her out, along with all the poisonous, alien gas that had presumably changed her into the siren she was now. Why not? Perhaps if he stopped being the person he was before and become something new like her, he might put more value into his own life. Alan stopped in front of the heavy metal doors that were fastened into the thick glass, the code to open it drilled into his head if an emergency occurs and he was the only one around to stop it, like right now. He looked up past the wrought steel frame to observe her one last time before he did the deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still smiling, but now the expression seemed more animated. Her humongous, quivering breasts inflated and deflated rapidly with each breath she took into her lungs, she must have been excited. To go outside? To be with him? Whatever it was, he would know very shortly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne - One - One - Six - Two - Zero - One - Nine - Five. With that, the locks that kept the heavy door in place were parted and he slipped briskly inside as the alarms sounded off, alerting the world that an unscheduled opening of the test subject\u2019s quarters had occurred. He was in a small hallway now, with the door behind him open and the door in front of him closed. This one didn't have a lock, the scientists didn't think there would be a need for one. They were regretting that decision now as a hoard of men white lab coats rushed down from various parts of the facility towards his location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too late. He was already opening the second door. A nanosecond after he did, it exploded back with enough velocity to crush trees into splinters, yet miraculously Alan was saved from the heavy doors swinging into the glass wall beside him, whizzing past his form by mere inches. And then, a second after that was warmth. The once human turned great beauty made physical contact with her guard for the first time as her stygian black abdomen flooded into the corridor after the door parted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not consider himself a religious man, but as the pillowy, heated stomach flesh pooled against his torso and brushed up near his face, he understood that if Heaven was real, she was an Angel. His knees went like gelatin as he suddenly found it very difficult to stand on his own accord, and tentatively he raised his smothered hands through the onyx skinned blubber to explore. It was beyond amazing to the touch, prompting the usually stone-faced man to twist his lips into a goofy smile as with little effort, he pushed his arms into the soft flesh, finding it yielded past his wrists. The scientists outside were not as ecstatic. They were stricken with fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of their hazmat suits, they felt a gentle itching sensation across their skin for a moment, only for it to pass. For someone who wasn\u2019t working with the mysterious gas that was only contained within the subject for the longest time, they probably wouldn't even give it a second thought. For the men in lab coats...they went pale in the face. Some fell to feet. Some wanted to be angry but couldn't through the tears welling up in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were infected now. And soon the rest of the world? \u201cHello...Alan.\u201d The guard felt an ethereal, soft and feminine voice ring out gently in his ears and the warm blubber receded away from his grasp, if only so that he can see her fully from beyond the horizon of her stomach. He stepped into her glass bubble, warm blood rushing to his cheeks as he was now being conversed with the women of his dreams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence, and Alan realized that she was waiting for him to respond. \u201cHe-hello\u2026\u201d he stuttered out nervously. He wished he thought about what he was going to say to her in his intense thinking earlier. He decided to go with the first thing he thought of. \u201cYou...you know my name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great titan of beauty and gluttony giggled airily, sending her soft frame into a fit of quivering and jiggles. \u201cI know more than your name, Alan. I know how many seconds its been since you came into the world, I know which test in the fifth grade made you feel like garbage when you studied as hard as you could and still got an F, I know what the weather was like when you last saw your parents for the holidays, and I know that I\u2019ve been the focus of your dreams for the past week and a half\u2026\u201d A subtle pink aura began to form around Alan\u2019s body as he was lifted into the air and the ground fell away from him. What was happening to Alan defied all-natural law, but it could be surmised that she was a psychic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind felt like mush as he tried to process all that was going on, but any coherent thought was evaporated as he was settled down gently atop the dome of her globular gut, and it took every ounce of willpower for him not to wrap his arms around her exposed bosom that was now mere inches away from him. \u201cOh,\u201d Was all Alan could say in response.  \u201c...may I ask what your name is?\u201d He felt her right hand, still in possession of fingers despite them being softened down into chubby nubs, gently fold against the back of his neck, and involuntarily he leaned into her grasp. Her smile grew as he reveled in her touch, and she thought it was so cute when he let out that soft sigh of pure contentment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me...hmm, how about Maria? That seems like a good name, right? I mean, I had one before...but who I was before doesn't matter much anymore, to me at least.\" She put a bit of pressure against Alan's head, forcing his body to slide across her soft belly against her chest, and only when he sunk his arms into their sloshing sides and gave in to his carnal desires did she stop. \"Any more questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...I know you u-used me to get out of here...and I think that I'm okay with be-being used.\" This managed to catch Maria off guard. Alan's voice was slightly muffled through some layers of the cozy breast flab, but not enough for her to read his mind to get a more clear answer. \"But I wanted to know if...i-if...I can be more than just a tool...if you could think about me the same way that I\u2019ve been thinking about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI put you through a lot, it\u2019s only natural you want me after all my shenanigans.\u201d She leaned her head forward so that her chubby chins would rest atop Alan\u2019s fuzzy hair, letting out a chuckle as it tickled at her lard coated neck.\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a possibility, I\u2019d be lying if I said that I didn\u2019t think you were adorable. And that self-depreciative monologue you gave yourself earlier won you some sympathy points...how about this? Let\u2019s get out of here, make a few memories together, see if we\u2019re a good fit. Sound good?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlan nodded through the yielding tit fat. With her guard secured snug in between her two mammaries, she slowly bent down until she was on all fours, as that was the only way she could exit through the relatively narrow door frame and hallway to her freedom. The same hand that gently guided Alan across her stomach abruptly ripped off the heavy metal slab and tossed it to the side before she crawled her way inside. The thick, bulletproof glass around her cracked and chipped against the onslaught of her soft, unearthly natural blubber. The scientists outside could only watch in horror as the specimen exited her confines, standing tall and proud before their fear-stricken frames. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was going to happen now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Maria's stomach grumbles. Food. Now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Alan starts to itch. Changing so soon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Maria and Alan make some memories~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Cut to the village...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the population decreasing of scientists who hadn\u2019t realized from the alarms and labwide itching epidemic what\u2019d been forced on them, Maria carrying Alan around the facility may have been the most and least normal thing in the facility. Any action to witness before fleeing from the blimpy, pear-shaped hot zone came down to despaired chaos as the entirely, absolutely, and <i>irrevocably</i> infected and sure-to-transform scientists bargained with the truth to escape with their species intact. Some were still damp and sudsy after wasting soap trying to scrub the invulnerable pathogen, her presence dashing those last cruel glimmers of hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone without Alan\u2019s taste in change wanted to linger about, if there was still no (proven) assurance it wasn\u2019t too late that their new lives were guaranteed. Apart from the few scientists who\u2019d given up and were left sobbing on the floor, that meant all the space Alan would want to have Maria all to himself. Wedged in the crick of her elbows, his nearest arm would stroke the fatty ripple of neck underneath her hair, and occasionally she would thank him by bowing her head down and sponging his form with the pudge of her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer supernatural intuition toured them deeper into the compound, guiding her through corners and passageways so distinctly not towards any of the compound\u2019s numerous exits, but considering what he\u2019d spent weeks getting to know about her, he knew that getting fresh air wasn\u2019t her biggest need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing on a date was one of those other so-called \u2018dreams\u2019 Alan would often ponder. Falling in love wasn\u2019t his biggest goal in life as much as just finding himself a stable household, but if that other half ever did show up in his life, he would\u2019ve likely gone the traditional route. Maybe treat her to a ritzy dinner overlooking the city skyline, not loot the cafeteria to a newly hollowed-out science compound. Maybe he\u2019d eat something himself, not just have his own fill and watch as his girlfriend pillaged the kitchen\u2019s freezer for its stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, just a crazy thought, he\u2019d be seated with her at a <i>table</i>, not be literally splayed atop his date, and for her to be small enough that he couldn\u2019t use his whole arms and legs to wrap around her middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one of the five senses being over-encumbered could nullify the other four, it was his sense of touch\u2019s fault that he was legally blind and deaf. On Maria\u2019s roomy lap sat her little friend and romantic, and on his own sat the full weight of her belly, legs submerged in the fleshy caverns underneath so his feet sitting in darkness far from where her stomach and torso met. To embed himself in and caress the belly fat of Maria\u2019s species and describe it was to defy the human dictionary; too smooth to compare to fur, yet too soft to compare to skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Maria, his little massage may have been both her payment and profit. Her powers commandeered the preservative-laden rations to their doom in the fatty cocoon he was so busy feeling up, packing her cheeks with as many bland meats or grits that they could without choking and compact it into the tightly packed furnace of digestion inside of her. Each bite he could hear came with a little spurt in size, distending a few little extra inches of belly against him and putting extra weight upon his knees. Her cushiness prevented his legs from succumbing to such intense mass that would\u2019ve normally pestled their bones, but said mass came as a blunt reminder that to her, if she were out of that cell and him knowing the code was now useless, he was merely an object. She could be as nice or as cruel to him as she desired, but a being of her size to grow and eat was a natural force, and for any amount of violence or screaming at her to try and control that was to make a raging tornado disappear by politely asking for it to leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and if realizing that guaranteed their lives together would be elongated, then he would be whatever she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought that earned him Maria parting her legs slightly wider, inviting him to sink in a little deeper into the massive, fatty trench. His thoughts were too soaked in adrenaline for her to pinpoint if he knew that she was reading his mind again, but the fact that he\u2019d swear such loyalty made her wish he could read her mind back, to let him kno that as right he may have been, she really did like the little guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such, when a question began budding in his head, she paused in her feast and awaited for him to ask first, casting a polite smile. \u201cSo Maria, If it\u2019s not too personal a question, what exactly are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and much quicker than he\u2019d ask someone in in alien body for only a week, \u201cI, Alan, am what\u2019s known as a Meloetta.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard her voice carry that last bit of gibberish with the confidence of saying which number came after five. \u201c...and a Meloetta is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed in to answer, but any word to answer with got caught in her throat, and she could only give a nervous chuckle. \u201cHonestly? Aside from that It\u2019s what I am, I have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Alan replied, disappointed, If she could know everything about him in a first meeting, he wanted to do the same for her. \u201cWait, if you have no idea, then how do you know that you are one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst seeing my own reflection, I guess.\u201d She conceded. \u201cWhen I\u2019d shed the last of my human body and saw myself as I am now, that was the first word I could think of. From then,\u201d Her eyes lingered at a window at an adjacent wall, observing herself in contemplation, \u201cnothing. When that word entered my brain, I knew I had the power to read minds, have telekinesis, and even that I have a beautiful singing voice, and I haven\u2019t needed to sing a note to see if it were true. What a Meloetta is, however? Wherever they come from, or how I\u2019d become one myself? I have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...whatever did turn you into this...\u201d Here came the true question. Likely everybody\u2019s first, but cast aside by his own infatuation, \u201cdo you think it\u2019ll change me, too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize if this scares you, Alan, but perhaps.\u201d Her eyes twitched to the wall itself, but focused on open space, like some intangible object was outside that only she could sense. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve opened that door, I could feel the itch. All their minds, all in the span of a minute, I could feel everybody in the lab feel the cell\u2019s air enter their lungs. Still I can hear their thoughts. They\u2019re running, getting farther away, but their minds are being warped, perhaps like mine has.\u201d She spanned her gaze on the horizon blocked by the building around them, but focused back down on Alan. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, though. Even though you\u2019ve been the closest to me, I haven\u2019t sensed anything of the sort from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood, Alan thought. Some extra time to be around her, sane and aware of her love to her. Time to ask questions, as well, maybe enough to fit his long, long list of ones that he had in mind, but then came a sudden shiver from his muscles, a sensation that blocked off his attempts to speak. That of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: ...intense hunger. Here it comes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: ...just a sneeze. Turns out that the virus affects 999,999 out of 1,000,000 people, and by crazy luck, Alan is that 1,000,000th person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: ...his center of gravity shifting. She\u2019s going to roll on top of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: ...Maria\u2019s stomach roaring. That means digestion, and digestion means <i>growth.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: ...a song coming up! (or something else.) </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The obsidian black-toned abdominal fat that was currently smothering Alan's lower body and pressing up against his torso suddenly lurched out even further for a moment as the food-stuffed organ deep inside let out a booming roar akin to a thousand thunderstorms. The former's guard's skeleton was shaken around violently, forcing him to shimmy away reluctantly from his personal Heaven. An eager moan of satisfaction rang out in the air before Maria bit down softly onto her lower lip, her cherubic face an expression of pure contentment as her body began working on her biggest meal yet. It crossed the still human male's mind that he should probably move farther away from his date. The various gurgles and sloshes emanating from that ebony sphere setting off alarms in his head that forewarned him of something like a nuclear bomb about to hit a significant metropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut try as Alan might he couldn't will himself to move an inch farther than he already had from the Meloetta. Even now, he felt too safe and too secure atop her warm, soft frame to think that a few innocent gurgles could be an indication of something ominous to come. So with a mental shrug, he repressed his doubts and relished in the ecstatic visage plastered onto Maria's face, taking the liberty to give the same stomach that rattled his bones to the core a few affectionate rubs. The Meloetta's smile grew wider as she felt those individual pats; she couldn't detect an ounce of hesitation enter her guard's mind as he stayed close to her. Her heart began to swell with a fondness for the little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the rest of her body followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Alan's eyes, the tautness of the stygian surface he petted evaporated into the ether as the billowing, spongy flesh ballooned into his open palms, almost like it was trying to return the affection he gave it. \"A-Alan...~\" Maria let out a heavy huff of air as the rest of her already enormous form slowly but surely inflated with more lard, an intoxicated look in her eyes as she gazed past the horizon of her growing belly on her guard. \"You...you're going to have to climb...un-unless you want to get buried alive.\" She gave him a suggestive wink as her saggy cheeks blew up with fresh fat, the slurry of calories in her system threatening to eclipse the human's frame while the thigh flesh he was sitting upon rose up around his own. Alan blinked a few times before the meaning of her words sunk in, and rather cheerfully, he briskly hopped up upon that pillowy, doughy mound that was her belly before he was lost to the cresting sea of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracks in the cafeteria's concrete floor spiderwebbed away from the increasing weight that Maria was putting on, hundreds of pounds worth of food being filtered into velveteen adipose tissue as the great organ inside bubbled and sploshed the bland food into nutrients. Alan trekked up the veritable mountain that was the Meloetta's stomach, the yielding slope underneath him wanting to swallow his knees and elbows like he was just another bit of food that she failed to push into her maw. Both of them were lost in their euphoria, the obese titan delighting in every centimeter her guard took across her midriff, the guard content to the brim to hear her soft groans of glee that he was responsible for. \"Don't go missing in there~\" Maria gestured to her steadily more heaving bosom as her human shimmed close to where it collided with wrecking-ball of a gut. \"You've got to walk the valley...before you reach the summit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Maria,\" Alan responded softly, struggling to hear his voice over the still thunderous roaring that the Meloetta's stomach was giving out. Meloetta...what a curious word he thought as he gingerly pushed himself through the crevice between those milk-filled orbs. It sounded like someone took the words 'melody', a sequence of musical notes pleasing to the ears, combined it with 'pirouette,' a graceful twirl found in ballet, and then added 'Etta' for the sake of drawing attention to femininity. He wondered since she could read his mind if she agreed with his thought process, but if he wanted to find out, he'd have to pry his face out of the pillowy fat he was smothered in, which was wholly unacceptable. The human stretched his legs, groping as much of his 'date' as he could from his doughy confines,  the amount of affection he put into his kneading enough to stir Maria with a deep moan of satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe constant rumble brought Alan even closer to Nirvana than he already was, safe in the warmth of Maria's massive body and lost to pure contentment. \"Hey now, don't fall asleep on me~\" The Meloetta giggled as she brought her hands to the top of her enormous chest, pushing apart her pillowy tit flab to reveal your form to her smiling visage. He let out a yawn, realizing that his comfortable surroundings were rapidly depleting his stamina, his limbs now struggling to crawl up the still inflating flab tiredness permeated his form. He manages to push his head, shoulders, and arms out from the mushy ravine before he putters out, making it look like he was floating in a pool of dark, viscous water. \"Cozy?\" Maria's breath washes over his from as she speaks, deep and thick as meadowgrass and only adding to his general sleepiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...\" Alan smiled as he surveyed his surroundings from his new perch. Maria's growth appeared to had stopped, or at least slowed to the point where the naked human eye couldn't detect it, and what a sight it was to behold! Her growth spurt left her from twelve feet hight to fifteen feet, and her already immeasurable weight was now heavy enough to force deep, twin craters in the clinically sterile floor around her buttocks. Aside from his head and shoulders, her breasts were now big enough to keep the rest of his from hidden from the outside world, and if she wanted to, she could probably force the rest of him down, and he wouldn't make a single deformation on the outside, forever vanished. \"How about you, you've never eaten that much food before, are you sure you don't have a stomach ache?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guh... No, just- uurrp- hungry.\" Maria let out a gentle belch as the last of the fattening soup inside her stomach was drained away into her system, one final portion of caloric sludge to scoop up into fat. Alan's own famished body protested as he jerked upright in the quivering ocean that was her breast fat. Alan had watched her guzzle hundreds of pounds worth of food just minutes ago, the same food that was designated to last a hundred scientists that (used to) work in the facility for a month. The same food that he complained of being void of flavor and now was missing after skipping breakfast today. After her gluttony left the cafeteria empty of anything edible, he couldn' t believe that she could somehow still be hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, yes, he could. After watching this woman transform from a lean human like himself to the veritable titan of obesity she was now, it was probably a good idea to stop being surprised at how much she could pack away inside the stomach of hers. \"Is...Is there any food here left that I can get for you?\" He put aside the needs of his own body as it punished him for letting his stomach go empty. \"I thought I saw a vending machine down the hall, maybe I could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alan, please~\" The Meloetta interrupted him with a gentle tone of voice, the smile on her face contorting slightly to express sympathy. \"As much as I adore how much you're willing to sacrifice for my happiness, you're hardly going to be useful for me if you die of starvation.\" She leaned in and nuzzled the top of his head with her bloated cheek, prompting an elated murr of joy to escape from his throat. Then, much to his disappointment, a familiar pink aura came around his form as he was psychically lifted away from Maria's warm chest and all too soon set down on the floor by her side, shivering from the sudden cold. He barely had any physical contact like that for the longest time, and now that was deprived of it, he realized how much he wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you keep making that face, it's going to stay like that~\" Maria teased as she gently bumped her blubbery hip into his from, knocking him down on his back from the force nonetheless, but succeeding in wiping away his frown and replacing it with a smile. \"You have a beautiful smile, you know, I'm not just saying that. Go and get yourself something to eat, you can last a minute without me.\" With a sigh of resignation but also contentment, Alan obeyed and trotted out dutifully from the cafeteria towards the vending machine, leaving the Meloetta by herself. He had left his wallet back at his home, but he found that he didn't need it as he saw that same flabby hip must have smashed the device as Maria came through the hallway earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't realized it before, but now that Alan was paying attention to his own body again, he discovered that he was utterly starving. The adrenaline from before must have been muddling with his sense of self-preservation, or maybe Maria was mentally blocking himself from thinking about it so he could focus on her. Whatever it was, it was in the past, and now was the time to eat something for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Alan eats...and eats...and eats\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: A figure comes down the hallway. It's a scientist! And he knows Alan opened the door. And he's l i v i d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: A figure comes down the hallway. It's a scientist...well, she WAS a scientist. And she smells food~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Alan heads back to the Cafeteria. What's Maria doing?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You look at the name printed out on your sheet and back at the house again, then again, and again and again, scrutinizing each number and letter that quite concisely matches your directions, but again you triple, quadruple and quintuple check, scared to approach the house with its nicely tended lawn, its white picket fence, and its overall crystal-perfect definition of nuclear suburbia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t the home a high school bully would get. This was where a pair of newlyweds would move to raise their children. Bullies had to live in some seedy neighborhood or a ratty apartment downtown, or anywhere else somebody who made you throw up in the cafeteria <i>deserved</i> to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing yourself one last look, you read the home\u2019s number again, and it\u2019s the exact same number as when you checked five seconds ago. Realizing that the neighbors are probably staring at a strange parked car still running at the street curb, you shut off the engine and step out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand align with the path to the patio steps, puttering over all the insults or comebacks you hated yourself for not hurling at him when his hulking arms were holding you to the lockers with that shitty smirk on his beak. Six years of petty fantasies of getting payback, countless nights of anger repressed since the day that asshole was rewarded for the shit he pulled with a high-school diploma had led to this day, the last few seconds before seeing those red eyes again. If it ended with a fight, a war of insults, or just stomping on his talons and walking home with the last blow dealt, it would be the end of the Creston Wrencast saga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou memorize the golden ones, the quips you <i>really</i> wanted to speak in the moment, take one last breath, then put one foot ahead of the other. Up you go to the red front door, a looming slab of wood way too redundant for a towering, hulking beast like a senior Creston...six years he must\u2019ve spent lifting weights and chugging protein shakes to become even more of a behemoth. Eh, it can be more than fists that win a fight, and you\u2019d been training with words since graduation. Licking the roof of your mouth, flexing out your fingers, and cracking your neck, you hammer your fist on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cComing!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s that voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat voice that was laughing when you were locked alone in the girl\u2019s room, tied to the flag pole in a blizzard, or dangled by his claws, screaming as you were held upside-down a hundred feet in the air as he flapped high above the schoolyards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>His</i> voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damn near entire house buckles and groans with the very foundations flexing under the movements of his host...you were right. He\u2019s massive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Fucking</i> massive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, god.\u201d You whisper, your attempts to cure the shakes all fail miserably as they come back renewed, the air hot and loud as it goes in and out of your lungs, \u201cOh my god...oh my god, oh god, oh god oh god oh god ogodogodogodogodogodogod...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe full immensity of the homeowner\u2019s mass approaches the doorway, some tons upon tons of bodily strength that could gruesomely end as much as they pleased the life of a mere human that rubbed them the wrong way, all about to open the last barrier between you and your worst tormentor. It peels from the frame...and the training is gone. Just like back in the hallways, your body just gives up, a childish squeak escaping you as your arms clamp around your head, a perfect stress ball for a hormonal eighteen-year old with a taste for blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door pulls away entirely, opening up the sounds caused by Creston\u2019s bodily mass warping the very foundations of his house. Damnit, this was a mistake. It\u2019s just going to happen again. It\u2019s gonna hurt, it\u2019s gonna be embarrassing, and a single sob comes out as your legs seize and let you fall to the wooden floor, anticipating the first blow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes just a peek, getting the briefest sight of Creston after six years. There\u2019s that shade of blue, the same as the blur when his fist was about to land in your face, but nobody hits you. You allow another, now much longer look at him...but down at the floor, there\u2019s somehow so much and too little to see of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the courage to unfold and rise, and with more and more of Creston visible, you slowly fill with shock, seeing you were never staring at him to begin with...well, not entirely him. It was his <i>stomach</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching your feet and vision to re-acquaint yourself with the Corvisquire\u2019s face, you note an extra two feet that inflate the once eight-foot bird to a definite ten, likely due soon for an eleventh. You recognize those red eyes, that gray beak, and that hat of scruffy black hair that you\u2019d last seen on graduation day, but you\u2019re now forced to see them over cheeks injected with twenty pounds of lard each, his round head sinking like quicksand into a doughnut-shaped chin infesting his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was once a Herculean set of trapezoidal muscles now sits fat-addled shoulder each spanning over a yard wide...nay, there had to be some incredible muscles to allow himself to stand upright, let alone maneuver about his own home, but the bulk of his feathered arms is instead wobbling, round adipose around the bones that renders his wings absolutely useless for flight...if they even <i>can</i> still be defined as wings, and sitting somewhere above brow level is a chest draped by a capacious gamer shirt with breasts hanging inside like a set of pillowy sandbags, too swollen and round to even be mistaken for feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust gazing upon Creston\u2019s face is enough to make <i>you</i> feel fifty pounds heavier, a MASSIVE compliment when only his fingers and talons are what aren\u2019t wider than your waist...and that\u2019s only the chest up. To think that even a <i>fat</i> Pok\u00e9mon could get to such a size, a feat accomplished by a muscular health-demon like Creston floors you as everything below the chin, his torso, legs, stomach...good <i>god</i>, his stomach, are bloated and rounded to such caricatured degrees that it traps him in his own house like a ship in a bottle, even when the door is so blatantly widened to accommodate his size. Sitting a mere breath\u2019s distance from your face, his wrecking-ball like belly leaps off his torso in a leviathanic globe of feathers and adipose, avalanching with a magnitude of perhaps ten tons that permanently merges its underside with a greedy amount of the floor below, the legs supporting them containted only by parachute-sized shorts that conform entirely to the skin of the blobby legs and buttocks they are trying to contain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ourageously obese raven rolls his eyes, probably having just gotten his seventeenth stare in the week. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC...Creston Wrencast?\u201d You shake out instead of any of the brilliant one-liners you\u2019d rehearsed for days in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s me.\u201d If a bit more slow and breath-y, his voice is the same as that old, smooth baritone. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You don\u2019t...\u201d Another chance for a quip, and it\u2019s shot dead on sight. \u201cYou don\u2019t r-remember m-me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember you from...\u201d The question goes mute when his own brain answers it for him. His eyes adjust to the size difference, seeing the dwarfed figure before him past the size difference and acknowledging that you\u2019re not the teenager he\u2019d assumed of you, that you\u2019re a few years past high school...<i>eight</i> years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...oh my god.\u201d He utters quietly, face flush with awe and shock as you watch the memories come at once through the quivers of surprise that overtake his blobby features. \u201c...Ian? Ian Spetzer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motherfucker, you think. Four years of torturing you, and he doesn\u2019t remember your name? You want to explode at him, punch him right in that fat gut of his, leap up and claw at his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...but then you remember that <i>is</i> your name. Damn. The bastard\u2019s so fat that you\u2019d forgotten your own name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d You peep out. \u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreston...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: ...is overwhelmed by guilt, and bursts into tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: ...towers over you menacingly, and stomps forward to grab you!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The second you warble out your affirmation in a voice that made no effort to hide how anxious and uneasy you were, Creston, the gigantic mountain of lard in front of you, the bane of your years in high school so long ago...looked like he was about to cry. The bloated raven Pokemon blinked it's red, nightmare eyes rapidly and took a step back into his house on his massive foot, prompting an eruption of wobbles and jiggles to appear across his fat blubber. He smiled the most pained, forced smile you had ever seen on his beak, no, in your entire life, and a chuckle rose from the depts of his obese frame. \"I-Ian...God, I never thought that I would see you again!\" The way his words came out was bifurcated; on the one hand, he sounds happy to see his favorite stress ball once more, but on the other, like you were some monster he put away long ago. \"Do you...uh...w-w-want to come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had not come all this way to go into the surprisingly cozy looking home of your high school bully; you had come to have this big, epic showdown on his porch, to spit the greatest 'you suck' speech ever devised, after rehearsing with yourself in the mirror for months. But after Creston posed the question, you were silent for what felt like a millennium, though it might have been closer to about five seconds. And after that five seconds, you finally muster enough courage to form a response. \"S-sure.\" You wanted to say more. You wanted to say so much more; you poured days of energy into making sure every word you said when this moment came would go right, but you couldn't get another word out?! \"Thank you...\" You add haphazardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreston's smile went down an iota of forcefulness and became just the slightest more natural as he maneuvered his mountainous body backward so that you had enough room to head inside his home. His absurdly globular stomach still took up much of the space inside, but at least you could step past the doorway. Eventually, you did just that, after forcing yourself to move into what could only be the grimy, horrifying inner sanctum that was Creston's house. The outside looked fine, almost cute with the bright, pastel colors and the freshly tended flowers, but it had to be an act. Inside, you were sure to expect a vermin-infested shed, covered in stains of God knows what, with squeaking stairs and leaking roofs and all the hallmarks of your typical broken home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what you expected to see was not what you saw at all. Beyond the sliver of open space that the titanic sphere of feathers and fat that Creston's stomach afforded you, what could be seen can only be described as...comfy. To your immediate right was a living room that, aside from the heightened proportions to accommodate its host, mirrored your own with warm, soft colors as ample light came in from the windows. To your left you had a harder time seeing, it was the room that the Corvisquire backed into so that you may enter, but it looked something akin to a kitchen...if kitchens had vaulted ceilings, more than at least two fridges, and a dining table that looked like it felled a redwood for its construction. The whole place seemed to remind you of your old childhood home; only your high school bully was squatting in it and exaggerated everything so it could stand a chance against his impossible height and weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up past the sloping mass of blue blubber, you saw Creston studying your face, but the moment you made eye contact, it was him that flinched away, not you. A slightly red hue rose from his permanently stuffed looking cheeks. \"Y-yeah, you're not the first to do a double-take inside. People look at me, and they expect me to have at least a candy wrapper on the floor.\" You noticed some pride edge up into his voice now, but it was a ghost of the testosterone-fueled variant you were acquainted with. Aside from some warping in the furniture's wooden supports, you had to agree, this place, or at least what you could see of his living room, was kept in good condition. \"Why don't you sit down? Can I g-get you something to eat? Drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May-maybe some coffee, if it's not too much trouble.\" Well, look at you two stuttering messes, you thought. Here you were, in the much elusive Wrencrest residence, which you had always pictured as far away and fear-inducing as the concept of Hell, having your old tormentor wait on you as you made your way to his oversized sofa, and what were you doing? Nothing, if fidgeting with your thumbs in the indent Creston made with his huge ass, could be considered something. The house shook and quaked once more as the equally fidgety looking raven Pokemon went into the kitchen behind him to get your drink. \"Holy shit\u2026!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch a glimpse of Creston's backside after he turned around, and you couldn't help but stare until it wobbled out of view. You couldn't see how your high school bully had changed since you saw him last in the back earlier, but now you could, and it was all you could fucking think about long after you had been left alone in his living room. Two blobular globes of feathered adipose quaked and bounced with each step the raven took, as big and round and blue as twin O-type stars in a binary system. Even when Creston was the stereotypical jock bully he was at eighteen, the one impressive thing about his physique aside from his rippling muscles was his behind, the object of every cheerleader and other girl student's desire. Now his ass was so fucking massive it was giving his stomach, which you THOUGHT was his most significant asset, a run for its money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Ian?\" You blink rapidly and shake yourself out from your daze. Creston was in front of you once again, holding a large cup of coffee in one paw, and a human-sized cup in the other. He leans forward to set your mug down on the coffee table, inadvertently shoving his wrecking-ball-sized stomach mere inches away from your face. The intense confrontation was over in a second, however, and he leaned back before shifting over to a loveseat.  \"C-can I sit down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised at that; you didn't think that he needed your permission to sit down in his own home. \"Oh! Uh, yeah. S-sure.\" With your approval, Creston slid his rear end down on the poor loveseat as quietly as the creaking wood would permit, keeping his ruby-red eyes downcast. There was a stretch of silence; the smell of grease and sugar wafted in from the kitchen, filling the air and making you hungry. \"You know, I had, like, a whole speech prepared. Wrote it out and everything. But I came in here and just forgot it all...\" you spoke up suddenly, a nervous chuckle escaping from your lungs as you look up at the massive Raven pokemon opposite you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreston, in response, took a deep breath of air through his beak, pushing his inflated chest and stomach out even further. He looked like he didn't know how to respond. Then, he forced himself to gaze at you, his old victim, in the eyes. \"I'm...I'm sorry,\" he said in a rush of air. \"I...I don't know what else to say, or what I could even say. There's nothing I could say that could ever make up for what I did. I h-hurt you, and I\u2026\" He trailed off, obviously not sure how to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, feeling the sincerity of his words, even if it was the last thing you were expecting to hear from him when you planned this visit out. You swallowed a lump in your throat, your mouth suddenly feeling as dry as a desert. \"Why, um, why was I the one?\" Creston tilted his head at you, chins and neck fat wobbling as he did so, confused by your choice of words. \"I could be remembering wrong, but...I never saw you ever do what you did with me with anyone else. Why was I the only one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Why did you only target me for all your pranks and insults and humiliating abuse?' was the unasked question. Creston understood, though. The bloated bird took in a shuddering breath as if he had been expecting this. \"...I've been seeing some big psychiatrists over in the city recently. I've only been to, like, three appointments so far, but it's been helping, I think. Umm\u2026\" He glanced up briefly. \"He says I have a thing called...I don't know. I-I can't remember how he explained it to me. It's like, I always had trouble paying attention to stuff, and I don't think about the consequences before I do things.\" You didn't say anything, so he pressed on. \"So, like, I was always jealous of how you could show up to class and get good grades while I put in twice as much effort and barely graduated. I hated you, or, I thought I hated you, and I thought you deserved all that stuff that I did. When I wasn't going after you, I was working out, and...well, I might have picked up an eating habit after school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words came tumbling out faster now, as he grew more comfortable speaking his mind. He looked back down at the table now, unable to look anywhere else. \"I thought it was so fucking unfair that you had friends and a college scholarship, and I had assholes who pretended to like me because I was good at playing on their football team. I'm not like that anymore. Or if I am, I have meds to make it go away.\" He shuddered, his whole fat frame jiggling as he did so. \"I'm...I'm just so fucking sorry, Ian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when all is said and done?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Ian forgives Creston and tries to get to know him better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Ian forgives Creston...but he's still pretty mad after all that he's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Haha! It was all an act! Creston hasn't changed a bit, and Ian has nowhere to go...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Creston's stomach roars. All this emotional baggage really stirs the appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: qbhfel</span></div></div>",
