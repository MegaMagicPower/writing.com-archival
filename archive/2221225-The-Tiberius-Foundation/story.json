Organizations of heros and villains alike, all having banded together for the sake of strength in numbers against one another. One of these has managed to keep itself hidden from the public eye, an organization that has been slowly gaining numbers, working from the shadows under the thumb of it's leader; a man by the name of Tiberius Femur. This facility is dedicated to training along with basic operations, readying the villains of the future as well as teaching old dogs new tricks. It's processes of selection are a mystery to all except those already selected and even then it's not unthinkable that you'll never be seen again once you step beyond the threshold of whatever dark corner of the world you'll be sucked into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we begin our little adventure though, you must choose between one of three characters who you'll be 'playing as' through this little adventure. Each of them with their own reasons for being brought into this little madhouse and their own goals they seek to find. Be it power, survival, or something far more cunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe-Lion<br>\r\nSeries of Origin: Kidd Video<br>\r\nOccupation: Cover band musican, henchwoman<br>\r\nSpecies: Cat<br>\r\nReason for Entry into the Tiberius Foundation: Striking out on her own as a result of surviving her universe's destruction<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatyana Tushenko<br>\r\nSeries of Origin: Animalympics<br>\r\nOccupation: Olympic Gymnast<br>\r\nCountry of Origin: Euraisa, most likely Russia<br>\r\nSpecies: Sable<br>\r\nReason for entry into Tiberius Foundation: Following a tragic attack, was saved on the orders of Tiberius Femur in exchange for her servitude<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy Hopps<br>\r\nSeries of Origin: Zootopia, a universe within the Disney Collective<br>\r\nOccupation: Officer of the Zootopia Police Department, New Recruit of the Interdimensional Defenders<br>\r\nSpecies: Rabbit<br>\r\nReason for Entry into the Tiberius Foundation: Undercover police work, attempting to join the organization as a mole on the inside.</span></div></div>",

A humble machine rolling along the iron tracks, it's wood and cushion insides a stark contrast to the sleek outside. With the light of the moon coming in through the windows, She-Lion stared into her pocket mirror slicking back her fur. On the back of her mirror, there was a picture of her fellow Copycats, who were not as fortunate as her when the universe they once inhabited imploded. With a sigh, She-Lion tossed her mirror into the rucksack she had tied to her keytar. She didn't want to think about home right now. Not when she had the chance to begin anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor months after her universe's destruction, she wandered the streets of any universe that wouldn't chase her off. She knew she could play her instrument to save her life, so much of her 'band's' performances were nothing but recorded covers. She was all to happy to accept handout, about all she felt good for. But one day, a ticket was dropped at her feet. A ticket with a note claiming whatever this Tiberius Foundation was would be exactly what she was looking for. So here she was, riding the rails towards this magical place that claimed to be the answers to all her prayers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trolley itself was driverless, so there was no one in beside herself and a small rabbit girl sitting off to the side. She was sleeping, she had been ever since she was thrown in. The bunny had a small sack beside her, and whatever was inside was pleasing to smell.</span></div></div>",

She could barely remember she was training, keeping her eyes on her figure in the mirror. As she had had done this so many times at night. A good amount of training before bed would always lead to a heavy sleep. But the lights went out, and her tail couldn't twitch incontrollably to tell her that something terrible was happening. So many years of commands from coaches and herself had dampened it\u2019s ability to move without her consent. She was unaware, but soon she would be as a terrible pain came for her. And then the darkness came.<br>\r\n She had faint memories of her coach standing beside my bed, I could feel so many things sticking out of me. He was near to tears as a\u2026sheep? Something made her think it was a sheep\u2026he told Bruno that the accident left her far more damaged than they could believe. She couldn't hear many of the details as a heart monitor beside her beeped away. She could hear a few words, explosion and assassin to name a few.<br>\r\nBut those words made no sense, why would anyone want to assassinate her? What had she done to deserve such a fate? It had been so many years sense the great change happened throughout her homeland. The day 'The Wall' fell and the government that gave so much to her efforts fell apart. She remembered hearing of it on the radio as she began her morning stretches, the wall had fallen and everything changed. But that all ment so  little to Tatanya now as she lay in that terrible cot.<br>\r\nHe said she was lucky she could still breathe. But she couldn't move. She couldn't feel anything but the devices that were pumping who knows what inside of her. She could see the flashes of paparazzi and the cards sent by whatever of her family was left. She could smell the horrible odor of the skunk in the other room. She could hear so much around her and she could even manage to speak after a few days, but she could not move. She would try every now and again, but she would either feel one of the things hooked up to her or her body would twitch in pain until she would stop trying.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it.\u201d Those words went through her head constantly, \u201cThis is the moment, the moment that I've been dreading for so long.\u201d <br>\r\nEvery athlete she ever studied, every gymnast she either trained under or worked with, they all had encountered that moment in their life where it's over. Where everything they've ever worked for will never be reachable again, at least not without an impossible miracle. Even for some of her fellow competitors in the Animalympics. For Bolt Jenkins, it was a heart palpitation that stopped him dead on the tracks both figuratively and literally. For Quackimoto, a filthy trick by a cheating rival left his legs broken and one hand busted. He would pull through thanks to technology, even managing to be a top performer in the Specials years later.<br>\r\nBut this was the end for me, I knew it. All of her years of training would soon be brought to an end with nothing more. What else would there be for me?. Some would say that \u201cYou had a good run\u201d but no. That wasn't enough for me. All her life, Tatyana had always been told good enough was never enough. She just couldn't believe what was happening. Day after day, those thoughts continued to cross the sable's mind. Wether it was because of her condition or not, a sick bubbling feeling disturbed every attempt at sleep. She feared that this would be her life now, or rather the end of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, <b><i>he</i></b> came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was certainly no creature Tatyana had ever seen before. His posture and the bulges in his oversized trenchcoat made her think he was some kind of ape. He stared at her unmoving body behind dark blue glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a shame. All those years you sunk into your career and now it's all over.\" He spoke with a deep baratone voice, mixing it with an American accent. \"Certainly no life for someone of your high caliber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatyana rolled her eyes, it was the only way she could show her annoyance. Whoever this stranger was, he certainly had no business speaking to her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you like me to fix it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me right Ms. Tushenko. You clearly need my help. I'd love to give to you too, you could say I've been a fan of your work for quite a long time. All I ask in return is that you come to my organization and work for me. Think of it like a sponsorship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all the strength she could muster, Tatyana nodded her head. What other choice did she have? Never we she allow herself to be bedridden if there was an alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" With speed that rivaled Tatyana in her prime, the hidden figures jabbed the sable with a needle. As her world began to black out, she could hear her new 'sponser' say one last thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you can call me Tiberius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she even opened her eyes, Tatyana took notice of her body. She could move. Opening her eyes, she found herself laying down on an operating table in a white room. The patient's gown she was wearing flapped as she jumped off the table in surprise. It was then she noticed something new. She wasn't just healed, she was rejuvenated! Back to the impeccable form she had sculptured herself into for the Animalympics so many years ago.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While news of the formation of the Interdimensional Defenders had reached her, she had never expected to be contacted by them. And yet there she was in a ZPD interrogation office with a taller female fox then she had ever seen in her life explaining how Judy had been selected for a dangerous undercover mission. Of course, Judy was rather upset that her partner Nick Wilde had not been allowed to join in, but the fox she spoke to, Carmelita by name, was firm in her orders. Within a few short months, Judy had become one of the first heroes of the Disney Collective to join the Interdimensional Defenders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd boy was her first assignment something else she wasn't expecting. With only one extra month to learn her new identity, Judy had been tasked with going undercover into an organization known as The Tiberius Foundation. Undercover work was nothing new to her, having been on ZPD for years. But as Judy sat in the back of that filthy cab as it drove on through a road to nowhere, her paws curled with worry. Maybe it was from the lack of Nick's sarcastic quips to liven up the trip, it could have been from the fear of her new job and the realization that failure here could mean anything from capture to straight up death, or maybe it was the jalapeno and garlic laden stench of the cab itself. Bottom of the line was, Judy was in a deep hole and she knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cab came to a four-way intersection far off from the bright lights of Zootopia, the vehicle came to a halt. The driver, his face hidden by the divider, called out. \"Alright Miss Irontail, this is where you wanted me to bring you. I ain't one judge though, but I really don't see what you want out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright sir.\" Judy said, thankful she hadn't slipped up on her new name. \"Nothing ol' February Irontail needs to relax but fresh air.\" She gave the steep fare to the cab driver and stepped out of the taxi, which sped off the moment her paws hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy pulled a note from her jean shorts, they were the coordinates her contact from the Foundation gave her. And yet there was nothing here that seemed out of the ordinary. A small patch of countryside, tilled dirt on all sides. And yet as Judy took a few steps forward, her ears stood up on end along with her fur. Her nose, finally through with the stench of the cab, found itself immersed in a new odor. A vile concoction that was a cross between rotten carrots and the corpses she often saw at the morgue. Before she could even cover her nose with her paws however, a dark shadow covered her. Everything went black amid a cold blow to the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But ever since I joined this site, I've always wanted to host an interactive. And here it is, fleeting though it may be. Feel free to add if you wish, but I am telling you this to let you know this won't be here forever. But who knows? If I find a thread I love, I might just make it into a story with credit given to those who helped. Or even add it on to something that's been in my head for years at this point <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with the bad news over with...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThink of this as a crossover story. As the reader, you will take on the place of one of three characters as they try to find their place in a dark, interuniversal organization known as the Tiberius Foundation. These characters are here for their own reasons and as such their success is measured differently. But beware, you can't expect to seemlessly work your way into the Tiberius Foundation. It's leadership is a multi-pronged pitchfork of evil and both it's workers and the experiments they conduct can be rather deadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll learn about your three choices as you go forward, but there is some more you should know about....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Tiberius Femur<br>\r\nUniverse of Origin: Unknown<br>\r\nOccupation: Villain, Foundation Leader<br>\r\nNot much is known about this dark individual, what few picture exist of him in the recently formed Interuniversal Defenders database is that he's a portly human looking guy who wears is prone to wearing anything from a supervillain cape ensemble, to a classic black hat and moustache combo. Reportedly he makes his own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyberclaw<br>\r\nUniverse of Origin: Fallout<br>\r\nSpecies: Hybrid of Commonwealth Deathclaw and Brotherhood of Steel technology<br>\r\nOccupation: Tiberius' Top Enforcer<br>\r\nWhen the Brotherhood of Steel attempted a project to create animal soldiers known as The Robotic Option Initiative, this terrible creature was but one result. Often described as a patchwork quilt of scales and steel, this monster stands above the members of it's group in terms of vicious brutality. Though glitchy in the head at times, it's loyalty to Tiberius and the rest of the team is unwavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaroness Von Bon Bon<br>\r\nUniverse of Origin: Cuphead<br>\r\nSpecies: Candy Toon<br>\r\nOccupation: Baroness of the Inkwell Archipelago, Owner of The Sweet Spot Casino<br>\r\nWhen the Cup brothers ended the reign of the Devil on the Inkwell Islands, his casino was up for grabs. Upon winning it in a landslide auction, this crafty baroness went right to work sprucing the place up. It's rumored that construction led her to discovering Tiberius Femur and even deeper rumors claim she has a deep crush on him. If so, it would certainly explain how fast her influence grew over the islands, with the punishment for losing a bet no longer your soul, but your property. Today, Baroness Von Bon Bon rules over the archipelago with very little resistence. Though posh and proper, don't underestimate her if she corners you in a dark alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddle T<br>\r\nUniverse of Origin: Kirby<br>\r\nSpecies: A Waddle Dee, one of many born with a green coloration<br>\r\nOccupation: Pet of Tiberius<br>\r\nAccording to rumors, this Waddle Dee was a gift given to Tiberius by King Dedede as a gesture of friendship. Following the customs of the species, Tiberius gave it a meal and a place to sleep, it's loyalty has been matched only by that of Cyberclaw ever since. Though not much of a fighter, this creature can take a lot of punishment and takes after it's master.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Glacia +Frostbyte<br>\r\nUniverse of Origin: Equestria Girls<br>\r\nSpecies: G: Human, F:Ice Wolf<br>\r\nOccupation: Scientist, Head Researcher at the Tiberius Foundation<br>\r\nFiles on this mysterious person and his pet appear to have been lost to a mysterious reset taken within the EG universe. From what little has been dug up about him, he spends his time researching an odd creature that has taken residence around the Tiberius Foundation. His pet and partner Frostbyte is deadly. The duo's loyalty to Tiberius and his gang seems to be based on a 'scratch my back, I scratch yours' partnership, though it seems ready to snap at any moment.<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can imagine, this story will involve tfs, corruption or hypnosis (depending on the path taken) and no doubt loads of violence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I will be working on my own threads, you are all welcome to add your own points. I would like to be informed on your ideas before you add, but that is optional. Here are some ground rules though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Considering the short time this interactive has, I would appreciate it if there are no eternal choice loops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. If you want to add, please make your add-ons of quality. No two sentence points please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Try to keep toilet things out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. While I will allow sexual themes in some cases, this is not meant to be a fic all about sex.
