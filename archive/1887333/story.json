Specifical their blubber! The thought of it frying and cooking and the taste...well, it was enough to get him drooling. Most fried foods did, whether it was squid, seaweed bread, or giant crab. Katara knew this and never missed an opportunity to be his personal chef, cooking their breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. Of course, she didn't eat any of that stuff. She KNEW how fattening it was. Which was why she was currently waiting impatiently outside of their igloo for him, calling,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sokka! SOOOOK-KAAAA!\" She stood with a just-fried fish, thinking he had gotten lost somewhere and the smell'd lure him back. \"Where is he? He never passes up a meal...\" Her answer came sooner than expected as she spotted him coming over a snow hill with...four big seals, fresh from the hunt. She shrugged, if nothing else he was dedicated to the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, i'm coming!\" He answered back, annoyed. As any siblings do, the two of them got on each other's nerves often. \"I told you, we've got to save up stock for the future!\" He took the fish from Katara and stepped inside as he began to bite into the crispy skin, his sister following him. She sighed, knowing full well they'd probably be through the whole sled of seal by next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember that i'm not a firebender,\" Katara retorted, \"This food isn't exactly easy to keep warm while you're out doing whatever!\" Regardless she set done two stools for the both of them around a table, which Sokka gladly sat down on without any further remarks. Mainly because he was too busy chewing through the last of the fish, usually a full meal for someone of smaller stomach. Katara couldn't help but notice his butt jiggling as he sat, despite his thick pants meant to keep warmth in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Maybe add a little extra butter to the crab.\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"URRRRP!\"</i> Sokka belched as he polished off the fish, tossing the bones in a nearby basket. \"Sooo, what's for lunch?\" He said expectantly.</span></div></div>",
