            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking a deep breath as he closed his textbook, Odd tried to calm himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been studying for a while now, but Chemistry had never been one of his better subjects. In his opinion, it really didn't matter whether the abbreviation for Aluminum was Al or La. It was all basically the same junk anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed out of the library to return his books to his locker, Odd promised himself that he would try to study again later. Right now, it just wasn't working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his locker, Odd was suddenly bombarded by a wave of papers as they flew past his face to gently flutter down onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was another thing he needed to add to his To Do List: Clean out his locker before whatever was growing inside became sentient enough to attack and/or devour him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down to pick up the agressive papers, Odd frowned yet again. A few of them were flyers advertising past games, dances, school events and the like. The majority, however, were tests, papers, and assignments he had gotten back from his classes; all of them sporting less than stellar marks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet he had been managing to get by in his other classes, if only barely. Such was why it was imperative he passed his next Chemistry exam on Friday; in reality, his Chemistry Midterm. He had to get at least a high C on it if he wanted to stay in the team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling as he stuffed the offending papers back into his locker, Odd shoved thoughts of cleaning it and of Chemistry away. Glancing at one of the digital clocks that lined the hallway, Odd noticed that the period, a study period for himself, would soon be over and lunch would begin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If I head to the cafeteria now, I'll proably be able to get a good spot in the line.' Odd thought to himself as he began to stroll towards Cadic Acadamy's cafeteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrightening up all of sudden, Odd remembered that today was also Tuesday, the cafeteria served fried chicken, one of his favorite dishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in response to his thoughts, Odds stomach growled and his pace quickened slightly. Patting it as if to assure it that it would soon be fed, Odd felt a spark of pride at the fact that athletic had kept his body in peak condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith barely an ounce of fat to be found, in fact, Odd would go as far to say that, if Ulrich was Cadic Acadamy 's king in the looks department, he would be first in line for succession of that throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'And that may be sooner than he thinks!' Odd though and mentally chuckled as he remembered how Ulrich had put on nearly ten pounds in a month. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Odd was curious as to what had facilitated Ulrich's recent weight gain. One would think that the Coach, would have monitered Ulrich's food intake and exercise at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Ulrich had been a bit more active socially lately, going to parties and such, and he had been visiting Yumi's family a lot recently too. Of Japanese descent, or so Odd thought, Yumi's family probably had a good deal of rich recipes at their disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich seemed to be handling the situation well, though, if he had really lost three pounds like he had said earlier. But honestly, Odd questioned that statement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a week ago, he and Ulrich had went over to the community recreation center to shoot a few hoops in one of the indoor courts, since even in Califronia, the air had a chilly nip to it this time of year. As they both began to get rather hot after a few minutes, and the indoor courts tended to stay stuffy, they had decided to pull off their t-shirts to cool off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Ulrich swiveled around on the cement, his movements just a tad more sluggish than usual, Odd had noticed that his friend's abs had practically become invisible under a miniscule, yet noticeable, layer of fat. Additionally, as the team was changing back into their normal clothes after practice one day, Odd had noticed Ulrich having a bit of trouble buttoning his jeans. A problem his friend probably wouldn't have if the jeans he wore weren't fairly tight to begin with. Though Odd really shouldn't speak on that fact; he wore tight jeans himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimply put; it didn't look like Ulrich was losing weight, but then again, Odd was probably thinking too much into his friend's weight to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing the doors to the cafeteria open, Odd caught sight of Ulrich sitting at their usual table with Yumi, vigorously tearing apart a chicken breast. Yumi, on Ulrich's left, was chuckling slightly at her boyfriend's appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Or maybe not...' Odd thought to himself, his own stomach clawing at his insides as he got in line for some chicken of his own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd, who had been on the verge of sleep when the date of his Chemistry final had been told to the class, however, didn't realize that his Chemistry Midterm was actually tomorrow, instead of on Friday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glaring at the talk show currently on his television, Odd frowned and grabbed yet another handful of doritos and stuffing them into his mouth. Readjusting himself in the leather recliner in his living room, he began to channel surf once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had never before felt so stupid in his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Chemistry Midterm, which he had thought to have been on Friday of that week one month ago, had actually been on Wednesday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine his shock and horror as his Chemistry teacher had passed out the exam. He had spent fifteen minutes of the class just staring at the paper in outrgiht ramification. And while, once he managed to get over his shock, did try his utmost on the test, the result was inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe failed, coming only a few points short of passing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough even if he had gotten those few extra points, the result would have only been a low D, a far cry away from the high C he had needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, while the Coach had despised having to do so, he had had to kick Odd off of the team.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's worse, having been shaken up by his release from the team, Odd had been too despondent to properly stuady for the midterms in his other classes, garnering lackluster marks in the rest of his classes as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisgusted with himself, Odd had become more withdrawn, and began staying inside surfing the net, but mostly watching television on even the sunniest of Saturdays, though those were becoming more and more infrequent with the arrival of Winter and Christmas break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the holidays had come and gone, and Odd was loathe to return to school after the break of nearly a month on Monday, the day after tomorrow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow as he heard the doorbell ring, Odd sighed before heaving himseld up to go see who was disturbing him on such a wonderful day to b lazy. He wasn't exactly presentable in a crumb-covered tank top and his boxers, but oh well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through the peephole in his front door, Odd found his visitor to be none other than Ulrich, clad in jeans and a light jacket appropriaye for the nippyness outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door to let his friend in, Odd shivered as the cold air rushed in as well, wrapping itself around his bare legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ulrich.\" Odd muttered boredly as he quickly shut the door, \"What brings you here today? How'd your break go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing really, my break went well. Just though I'd drop by. Thought you might wanna run or jump?\" Ulrich asked as he walked over to find a seat on the leather sofa in the room, brushing away a few plastic twinkies wrappers in doing so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd snorted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to shoot some hoops? I'm not on team.\" Odd said, as Ulrich sighed. \"We've been over this Ulrich; I'm done with athletic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" But you were managing before! You do bad on one Chemistry test and you fall apart!\" Ulrich attempted, \"You could still make it back onto the team if you applied yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know so much about that. I failed that midterm hardcore. I'd have to make an A in Chemistry from now on to get the high C average to play on the team.\" Odd reasoned, flopping back down into his recliner and returning to munching his chips, \"And that's just not gonna happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...you could get a tutor or something! How about Jeremy, or Yumi. Any of them would help you if you asked.\" Ulrich fired back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing dejectedly, Odd held his face in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm only trying to help, man.\" Ulrich said after a pause, \"I mean, look at yourself! You're wasting away!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich got up from his spot on the sofa to yank his friend up out of the recliner he was cradled in to guide him over to a mirror hung on one of the walls and then fluidly pulled Odd's tank top over his head and off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And by wasting away I mean getting fat.\" Ulrich remarked as he gave his friend's stomach a few good pats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd sighed as he looked at his reflection in the mirror. It wasn't as if he didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd's less active lifestyle following his departure from the athletic team, in addition to the fattening foods that had been around him over the holidays, hadn't been good for Odd's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Odd had noted one morning as he stepped onto the scales after his shower, he had even outmatched Ulrich; his friend had gained nine pounds in a month, whereas Odd's body had seen an amazing fifteen pound growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at himself in the mirror, Odd saw for the first time what those fifteen pounds had done to him. His arms and legs, once contoured, now appeared slightly flabby, only vestiges of the muscles that were once there. His face, one angled, not had a bit of a puffed look to it, and Odd had discovered one morning that, if he tilted his face a certain way, he had a double chin, if only a slight one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich turned Odd so the two then were able to see a side profile, and Odd grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rear had grown as well, straining the fabric of his boxers where the fabric had once hung loosely. Odd had already abandoned the underwear that had been snug on him to begin with as he knew, now, they would be uncomfortably tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, their was his stomach. His abs, which he had bragged of only a month prior, had vanished. Now they would only appear if Odd tried his utmost when flexing. In their place, a wall of fat threatened to cascade over his boxers; Chad was on the verge of developing a beginner's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging Ulrich off, Odd gave his friend a reproachful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I don't need a bra yet.\" Odd muttered somehwat sarcastically, \"And you're one to lecture somebody about their weight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ulrich could stop him, Odd had lifted up the bottom of Ulrich's shirt, clicking his tongue at the layer of fat that pushed over Ulrich's jeans slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to your diet, Ulrich?\" Odd asked cunningly, noticing that his friend seemed to be in a new pair of jeans as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich had continued to talk about his diet for the remainder over the past month, but as Odd expected, no one had seen any pounds melting away. And yet, after Odd had been kicked off of the team, that issue becoming the top priority for their circle of friends, Ulrich had talked about his diet less and less. Apparently, it had been put onto the back burner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm working on it...\" Ulrich muttered agitated, pulling his shirt back down, \"Yumi's grandmother is the best cook you'll ever meet. And the woman won't let you leave the table without having seconds, and prefers it if you have thirds!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how exactly is Yumi not the size of an elephant?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls. You know how they are about watching what they eat. You should see her uncle - he's humongous.\" Ulrich replied with wide eyes as Odd returned to his recliner for the second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Well, good luck with THAT then. Being surrounded by rich dishes all the time must be why you're putting on the pounds. I noticed you're wearing new jeans. Move up to size 34's?\" Odd taunted, offering Ulrich some chips as the brunette returned to his seat on the sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprising Odd by taking a generous handful, Ulrich frowned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You noticed huh? My 32s were constricting me just a bit too much for my liking these days.\" Ulrich offered, \"But you're bound to have moved up a size too there, Shamoo.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd reached over to take a drink from a soda sitting on an end table next to his recliner before replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh...good stuff...and probably, yeah. Except I've been at home ever since the break started, so I've just been walking around in my underwear.\" Odd said as Ulrich made a face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, gross.\" Ulrich said, shuddering slightly, \"But seriously though, what are we going to do? We're both getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd shrugged and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. We're not exactly svelte anymore.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought I wouldn't be getting fat until my thirties...\" Ulrich said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. You're still on the team, at least.\" Odd replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but you're not having at least two portions of rich food shoved down your throat every time you go visit your girlfriend, are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd's shoulders slumped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a girlfriend at the moment, so no.\" Chad said morosely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Ulrich asked, slightly surprised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd shook his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WAS too devoted to basketball.\" Odd said blandly, crumbling up the chip bag and getting up as the last of the chips entered his mouth. \"I think I'll have some ice cream now. Want some?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich could only shake his head sadly, but found himself saying yes anyway. Ice cream sounded good right now. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His eyes staring at a poster advertising a new bakery. It featured a ginormous slice of triple chocolate layer cake drowned in hot fudge and topped off with a castle of whipped cream, a cherry on top, and two scoops of vanilla ice cream on the side: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come try the new, mouthwatering Triple Chocolate Monster,\" it read. Odd began drooling over this delicious dessert and Ulrich pulled him away from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd hungry,\" Odd said in a caveman-like voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, seriously? Because me too!\" Ulrich said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go. We have to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd set off for the store, located just around the corner and a few shops down. The moment they entered the store, he ran up to the counter and asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get a Triple Chocolate Monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich joined Odd at the front counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it two Triple Chocolate Monsters,\" Ulrich told the rotund baker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two!?\" the man questioned them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, two,\" Ulrich told him slowly, holding up two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that'll be $13.45.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOdd took out a ten and Ulrich took out a pile of coins and laid them on the counter. He began to count them, but Odd gave him a look and Ulrich stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just pay,\" Odd told him, taking out four ones. The baker kindly, yet slightly confused, accepted the money and handed Odd the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Ulrich said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, the man returned to the counter with two very large pieces of cake drowned in fudge and whip cream, each with a neatly placed cherry on the top of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Odd told the man, and they both sat down at a table for two with their desserts. Immediately, they dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the chocolate touched Odd's taste buds, he was in heaven. In fifteen minutes, Ulrich and Odd were both finished with their morning desserts. Their stomachs were bloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Triple Chocolate Monster,\" Odd said, beginning to stand up. \"Are you feeling alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUlrich replied with a loud burp and then, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'm having the time of my life! I've never splurged like that before! I never knew eating junk food would be so much fun! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
