He was lean and hungry-looking, and despite his tailored suit, there was something off-putting about him, a vague sense of soot and sulfur. But he knew your name. He knew you were fresh out of a relationship, knew you had just been laid off from your job, he knew everything about you. And though what he was offering was impossible...you knew, somehow, that it wasn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the power of a god,\" he said. \"Oh, there are limits \u2013 you can't get too flashy with it, or literally become a weapon of mass destruction. But you won't use it for anything like that. You aren't the flashy type.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I don't get,\" you say, \"is why me? Why are you offering this to me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple,\" he says, with a razor smile. \"My whole job is to make things worse. And with these powers, you will increase evil in the world. Maybe a lot, maybe a little, who's to say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I mean, these powers...I could be a superhero. Change my shape to anything? Change my size to anything from dust to the size of a refrigerator? Relatively immune to damage? I could, like, fight crime with these powers. Make the world a better place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? No. Some people would. And you think you will. And that's cute, but you're right now thinking about how you could use this to become, like, a middle-school girl's bra.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I don't care! Like I said...I'm evil. You're gonna use this to creep on women and stuff. Maybe men too. Again, I don't care. But you aren't gonna use this for good, we both know that. Now...with that said...are you gonna sign?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hands you a glowing pen. \"You're not lying about Hell, right?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No! There's not real Hell, not for most people, you either get reincarnated or if you're really bad, like Hitler or someone, your soul gets destroyed. You <i>can</i> move up the ranks, of course, if you're good or bad enough \u2013 and you might just find yourself working for me in a few hundred years \u2013 but that's not bad at all, no sir. Now, you gonna sign, and help make this world a worse place?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the demon, and back to the form.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I don't have all day. You get power, the world gets more awful. Win-win, right?\" </span></div></div>",

Hell, no, but you just signed on with a demon, you aren't the kind of guy who's going to be restrained by ethics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many old fantasies bubble up. One of them was the very first one you remember -- the one the demon mentioned, the time you imagined being Julie Smith's bra back in seventh grade. Or the one where you were gonna camp out in the women's dorm at your old college. Or the one where you were going to transform into the panty hose of that secretary at work. Or that one where you were gonna be shrunk to insect size in a changing room...or that other one....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many options. You could choose any of them. Well, not Julie Smith's bra...I mean, that would be silly, she lives in Scranton. But you could probably find a kid who looked like her at the local junior high. Okay, again, so wrong...but you've given up on morals. Then again, college girls are legal, and while your old college is a couple hours away, there's a college a couple blocks from where you are now. That secretary at work is still there, of course...and there's a mall a couple of miles from here...or....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a few minutes of dithering, but you decide that this is the perfect way to start. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also looked as close to your childhood crush as you could remember. It was the perfect disguise for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat exactly were you doing here? You weren't going to do anything <i>to</i> the girls here; you were a weirdo and a creep, sure, but not a monster. But, you had come all the way here and gone through the effort of sneaking in; you were going to use this power for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat original thought about being a bra floated back into your mind. It'd be pretty fun, right? And no one was getting hurt, so no skin off your back. All you had to do was sneak into the locker room and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would be a pretty passive way to spend the day, though. Maybe you'd shrink down instead, so you could keep <i>some</i> agency. Of course, that leaves the question of where to shrink. The locker room still seems reasonable, but it'd be pretty dangerous and you're not exactly experienced with this power. Maybe a classroom, where everyone is sitting peacefully, would be a better testing ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo rush.

To think, you woke up this morning expecting a perfectly normal day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room had a faint... smell, to it. Not overpowering, but underneath the floor wax and cleaner, you caught the signs of exertion: sweat. Your mind began to wander again, pictures of sweat and effort filling your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy shit,</i> you think, <i>I'm aroused?!</i> And, true to the form you've taken, you feel a slight dampening between your legs. You've felt a vagina before, but never from this side. <i>Neat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clock catches your eye. Twenty 'til; probably enough time to find a suitable spot to transform. Did you still want to be a bra? You saw a strap dangling from a bench, and you were sure that you could become it easily enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, now that you're here, now that you're breathing in this locker room air, maybe you don't want to join a girl as she's <i>leaving</i> the gym. You could shrink down, slip into a locker, and become a piece of gym clothing. It'd be a bit of a wait, but that payoff...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course, nothing says you have to be a piece of clothing. Maybe just, shrink down and watch or something. Be a voyeur, enjoy the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, I'm a perv.\"</span></div></div>",

There will be time to become a seventh-grade volleyball player's shorts. For now, keep it simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go over to the bra hanging from the bench. It's an A cup, but that's okay; not like you expected these girls to be wearing DDs. You do wonder a little why some girls put their clothes back in their lockers and some didn't, but you shrug -- probably an organization thing, not worth worrying about. What you do check quick is the dress laying next to the bra. It takes you a moment to adjust it based on your current stature, but it's a pretty straightforward and functional dress for a girl built a lot like you presently are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right, this will work. Now, how to do this? You could throw away the bra and just replace it, but that's kind of rude. Poor girl would lose her bra! No, you focus, and lay your hand on top of it, and imagine yourself merging into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink in surprise. No...you don't blink. You can't blink. You're a bra. A small, basic white bra laying next to a dress that now dwarfs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's agonizing waiting for your owner to come back in. Will she be tall? Short? Blonde hair, or brown, or -- oh, could she be a redhead? You've always liked redheads. No matter, it's going to be awesome. When you finally hear the an echo of feminine voices approaching, you find yourself aroused all over again. This time, it's not a dampness in your legs, because you don't have them; instead, the feeling is all over and through you. This is going to be awesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girls pass you by, chattering away; you're below hip-height, and you have a great view of them as they begin to strip down. For a moment, you're a little disappointed -- one of them looks a lot like Julie Smith, but with a flatter chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your disappointment lasts only a moment, as a skinny redhead walks over and looms over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep forgetting to put your clothes in your locker?\" calls the girl who looks like Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got distracted,\" your owner says. \"And you know how Janezich is, if you get out ten seconds late....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna get something stolen someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put my purse in my locker,\" the girl says, taking off her shirt and sportsbra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, my. She isn't a sixth-grader. Probably seventh grade, maybe eighth. Those breasts are spectacular. Small, sure, but firm and perky. You would be salivating if you weren't made of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour owner stuffs clothes into her locker, and pulls out her purse. She's wearing only panties, and you are quite happy that luck brought you to this girl. She puts on some deodorant, and slams the locker shut. And then she turns back to you.</span></div></div>",

Cute, lightly freckled, little button nose, wide smile, dull red hair shining with sweat. You tried to take it all in but in just a moment she was on you, her palms filling the sky as she reached for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, this is something else~</i>. You're practically purring in your head; it feels like your whole body's become a big, thirsty erogenous zone. Her fingers, soft, with short-clipped nails, ran along your straps as she slung you around her shoulders. It's a massage, slow and sweet, and you only look forward to its conclusion because of what's waiting after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts stare down at you, small pink nipples acting as targets for your form. You know that at full size that this girl would be practically flat, but from this point of view she was a mountain of bust, and you a waiting climber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Annd... Contact.</i> You feel it more than see it, the soft flesh filling your every nook and cranny. She clips the back together and adjusts; her chest moves in you, and you move with it, a dance that strokes your fancy, lifting your mind to higher and higher heights. You were one with her now, and as she slipped her dress over you did not lament the loss of the outside world. This girl, who's name you did not know and whose face you hardly saw, was everything. Her beating heart, her uneven breaths, her lilting voice each sent waves of pleasure ricocheting through you. And despite it all, she didn't have a clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of your mind a small voice berates you, but you push it aside. No one's getting hurt, and anyway this is why that devil gave you this Power in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" she says, probably to her friend though from your vantage it was hard to tell and harder to care, \"Let's get going...\"</span></div></div>",

Bras serve a purpose, and while this girl is at best a high A cup, you are too, and with each step she takes, the soft-yet-firm orbs you hold strain against you, while you hold them in place, a dance you were literally designed for. But it's so much more than that. All your senses spread through the bra -- you can pinpoint them if you want, look from a spot in the bra, but if you don't, the sense gets smeared around it. And that means that you can smell and taste and feel this young girl, the dry sweat on her young flesh, the delightful nubbins of her nipples. You are more aroused than you ever thought possible, and you've been incredibly aroused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outside world is distant to you; this girl is everything. You do catch snippets here and there -- she has homework, maybe get together later -- but you pay it little heed. You simply ride with the girl as she rides a bus, then hops off and heads home. Each step is rapturous, each breath delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, and then, just when you thought you had reached your apex, she goes up to her room to read for class, as she always does, laying face down on her bed. Not that you know she always does this. You discover it as the world tilts and the girl's breasts push hard up against you, pinning you against the fabric of her dress, which is pinned against the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays like that for over an hour, reading and texting and so forth. Then she gets up, and goes about the nightly routine. You sense that there is dinner being eaten and conversations with family; you hear a mother, a father, and a sister -- older sister, maybe? You're not sure, and you're finding it very hard to pay attention. Even when your owner speaks, and her voice rumbles through you, it feels more like a force of nature than conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is the greatest seven hours of your life, but alas, all good things must come to an end. Your owner finally strips the dress that had covered you off, and you see her looking in the mirror briefly. She's in a bathroom, and there's water running in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's a very pretty young thing, and you are disappointed as she slips her hands behind her and unclasps you, dumping you atop the dress on the floor. You feel a bit cold, and sad, but you do at least get one final great view of the girl sliding her panties off, and dropping them on top of you. She then steps into the shower to clean up before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is part of you that feels very much like sitting still. You realize, distantly, that by merging with the bra, you have taken on the bra as part of yourself, and that part calls to you like a siren, telling you to wait with it, just a wash and a few days of waiting, and she'll wear you again, you can wait....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you can taste and smell the panties above you. And that gives you an idea. True, those panties are used, but if you're quick, there should be a fresh pair on the counter. You've been a bra; why not try her other underwear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the call of staying a bra is strong enough that you think maybe you should decouple, and become animate again. No, not a full-sized guy, that would creep the girl out. But if you transformed into an inch-tall person, you could explore the house, get the lay of the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to think about, but little time, the girl won't shower forever.</span></div></div>",

That demon wasn't kidding around; all you had to do was think about looking college-aged, and poof, suddenly your skin was smoother, your hair was fuller, and your body was stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, now you've got the hang of this. Turning back to normal, you jump in your car and set the navigation towards the closest place of higher education: Harmony Valley College. You could see it now; women of all builds and colors and backgrounds, in the prime of their youths...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head; no point in finishing before you've began, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few blocks felt like miles, but soon enough you were pulling your car into a parking spot just beyond the campus outskirts. For a quick second you wonder if it'll be okay to just leave it there, but whatever. You won't take too long. This is just a trial run, after all; a test of The Power, nothing more. And if you end up liking it here, you can always come back by bus next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, where too? The college, of course, but it's a big place. Do you want to head to the on campus gym, check out the sweaty babes as the work their hard bodies? Maybe just stop in a class and admire the female work ethic? No, you were here for the full co-ed experience. You needed to find a girl, hitch a ride, and be just an insignificant passenger on her daily routine. Probably. At least, that's where you're gonna start. And for that, you need to go to the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick google search reveals that, for some reason, Harmony Valley still has gender-segregated dorms. On one hand, convenient, so you can guarantee your time with a lady. On the other hand, a hassle, because you wouldn't be very inconspicuous strolling into a women's dorm like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, The Power. Focusing on your ideas of femininity, you felt yourself change. \"Jesus,\" you exclaim, feeling the weight on your chest as your new boobs dragged you down. \"Guess I went a little overboard.\" You check yourself out in the car's mirror; damn, were you smokin'. Flawless skin, hourglass figure, massive rack... Yeah, you over-tuned it. You want invisible, blending in, not \"barbie doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne body adjustment and a short walk later, you find yourself entering Hurlbut Hall. A funny name, but the student site said there was history behind it so who are you to judge? Standing in the hall's entrance, you are suddenly struck with a sense of confusion. Now what? You guess you could just pick a room at random and sneak in, but that seemed like leaving a lot to fate. Then again, just picking a girl because she looked good was also kinda chancy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if today's adventure doesn't pan out perfectly, you had plenty more opportunities in the future.</span></div></div>",

Center Mall, the one stop spot for all sorts of shopping, and now, for shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could you have chosen anywhere else? Your first inklings of this whole fetish were developed at a mall just like this one, when you were just a boy watching teenage girls pick out shoes at Payless. You'd nearly forgotten, but those fantasy's of getting caught up in the footsteps of passing women had helped shape what'd you'd come to enjoy. It was only fitting that you'd honor that time by testing out the new power here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, \"here\" is a big place. Center Mall was three stories of commerce gone wild, with stores catering to every niche and need. The bottom floor had the clothes and shoes belonging to the big chains; Hot Topic, Old Navy, Foot Locker, Dick's, just to name a few. The second floor was half taken up by the food court, which in turn was half local American chains and half more exotic tastes from around the world. The rest of the floor was dedicated to more diverse stores. You recall watching a cute pink haired girl leaving an anime shop, and a couple of nerdy types gathering around a game store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third floor... Well, you've never been up there. That's where the mall kept the weirder stores. The directory only gave names, like \"House of Pleasure\" and \"Dom's Palace.\" A coworker told you that there was a wide selection of sex shops up there, although you doubted a mall this big would really have a floor dedicated to just kinks. Still... could be worth a look.</span></div></div>",

You wake up to the sight of the demon hovering above you, talking on his phone which look like a red samsung phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, um I think I'll have the cheesy breadsticks, pepperoni pizza large.

You soon began to glow bright as your body began to shift and contort to the form you were thinking of. When the light faded, you were now a fine bodied woman with light lavender hair done into a ponytail. You had amber eyes that matched your crimson red long earrings, with a gold necklace to complete the ensemble. You were wearing a purple tube top, along with purple bellbottom pants to match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn kid, your hot!\" The demon smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's princess to you Mr. Demon.\" You smile playfully, as he examines your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies your royalness.\" The demon smirked and looked at the necklace. \"Hey maybe you can use this power for good~\" A hint of sarcasm was in his voice as he was transfixed on the necklace. You then smirked playfully swatted his hand away, going 'ah-ah-ah'. You smirk and then spin around, soon being surrounded by another flash of light and turning into a princess. You had long raven black hair, light blue eyes with matching snowflake earrings, and lovely moon necklace with a snowflake in the center. Wearing and completing the outfit with a lovely blue snow gown with snowman and snowflake designs on the rim of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do like this dress, say um are my clothes apart of me because I shapeshift?\" You ask curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

And then one otherwise normal workday, you're called into the boss's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm what?\" you gasp, blindsided by this news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fired. And you should be lucky that's all we're doing.

You hated to admit it, but these reports were all really, dreadfully accurate. Brenda caught you drooling over rear, Thomas complained about you feeling up his biceps, and Lydia protested your theft of her work shoes. Damn, were you really this obvious?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss flips the screen back around to her, frowning. \"You understand why we have to let you go now, right? And, don't think you're getting any sort of severance, either. You've lost the right to that.\" You open your mouth to complain, but she shuts you off. \"Or, would you rather we let these cases go public? Any judge in the country will get you registered as a sex offender just by glancing at these reports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slump in your chair. \"Can I at least have a box to gather my things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, you were parked at a small coffee shop a few blocks down, nursing an ice tea and trying to gather your thoughts. Where would you go from here? You'd never get a reference from your old place, your marketable skills had long since gone rusty, and you didn't exactly have enough money to live the rest of your life on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoping, you stare out into the shop. The waitresses here were your favorite part of this place. It was run by a young lady, fresh out of college with a business degree, and she wasn't shy about only hiring her friends. And as luck would have it, she had some smoking friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ana-Marie,\" you mumbled, staring at the name tag of the bright looking girl who was helping a table across the room. She bent down to hand the group their drinks, giving you a fine look at her rear assets. Her short skirt didn't hide <i>anything.</i> You felt warm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly warm. Was there something wrong with this tea? Your heart begins to beat faster, but despite the panic rising in your throat you find yourself unable to avert your eyes, forced to watch Ana-Marie's fine ass bounce as she stood back up, her cheeks wiggling as she began to walk away. Your insides twisted, and suddenly you caught a massive whiff of brimstone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe encounter rushed back to you, as everything went dark.</span></div></div>",

You don't know why this happened, but for the moment, you aren't questioning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only concern you have is what Ana-Marie's plans are, but if you get to hang out as her panties, you're willing to chance it.</span></div></div>",

You sin in life, then if you want to go through the pearly gates you've gotta let your soul be cleansed. And it's not a pleasant sort of cleaning, more steel wool than wash cloth, if you get what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... if I had signed that contract...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing would have happened! Listen, I already told you, I hadn't lied.

In fact,\" he says, grabbing the contract and very quickly changing some lines, \"I'll sweeten the pot. Look, see, if you sign here then the moment you die you'll start work for me. No Purgatory, no punishments, no reincarnation, just a rewarding job you can really enjoy.\" He's smiling now, but the expression looks strained and his eyes don't smile with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's a tempting offer. \"Is what he said all true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angel's smile dims, but does not go out. \"His words are honeyed but honest. I must advise against such actions, however. Heaven's realms turn their backs to those who do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What is she on about?</i> Shaking your head, you look down at the contract. It offers such power... and a ticket out of an afterlife of punishment? \"Okay,\" you say, clenching your eyes. \"I've decided.\" Looking at first the angel, then at the devil, you sigh. \"Give me the pen. I'll do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon shouts with glee. \"Ha! It's a good deal for both of us, isn't it. In your face, lady!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's not smiling, however. Her face suddenly looks a whole lot fiercer. \"This choice of yours was a mistake you will regret.\" Her eyes fade to pure white, her body sprouting wings of pure light.

I earned that soul, damn it, and you know that.\" The devil pouted, holding the unsigned clipboard in his hands.

What are you going to do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns, and vanishes, her last words drifting on the empty wind, lingering long after she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A punishment to fit the crime.\"</span></div></div>",
