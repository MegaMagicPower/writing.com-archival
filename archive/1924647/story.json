When you bought your mansion you thought that it wouldn't be that hard to keep it clean, and as much as you hate to admit it, you were wrong. You had to much work to do to keep things tidy, make sure the plant were watered, tend to the garden and let alone take the time to prepare yourself a decent meal. So you decided to hire some help, but only what you thought was necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe number one thing that needed to be addressed was the lack of food, because there was no way that you would last much longer due to the lack of food in your tiny stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl you hired to make sure that both you And your new employes was the highly recommended twenty two year old Kelly. From what you heard she she was a fantastic chef and was normally quite professional, as long as you liked her food that is. She would often get mad and go of to practice her cooking not giving the person who disliked the dish she severe, until she is sure that she has improved, but if you insulted one of her greater works she would get sad and comfort eat until she felt better. You were also told that she was on the plus side, but that didn't sound so odd for some one with her job. From the picture you saw of her you thought that she was rather cute, she had blond hair that went down just past her shoulders. She had blue eyes that went well with her hair. She was flashing a bright smile, revealing her pearly white teeth. Judging by the objects in the picture you would say that she was at least five and a half feet tall. She had a not very big, but still noticeable belly on her, confirming that she was plus sized (if she was even big enough to be called that).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that would need to be taken care of and was only slightly less important then the need for food to operate, and that was the need to have a clean home. You had hired three maids hired to help with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head maid's name is Jennifer, she had only ever worked at one home but that was because she was so good at her job that she was never replaced, but recently the mistress of the house became suspicious that had had been sleeping with the master of the house (which she didn't) and she was fired. Her references all said that she is a sweet, kind and innocent girl who would never do something that she thought was wrong (these being the masters, her friends and families words, not not the mistress's). Jennifer came with a little more info then Kelly. She is five foot nine, she weighed a hundred twelve pounds. She has brown hair and eyes and is twenty four. From her picture you could tell that she is very attractive, she had a nice smile and a cute button nose, she had a tiny body...well except for her nice b- you cut off your own impure thoughts and slapped your self for drooling (or what you called drooling) over a girl you don't even know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other maid you hired name is Gracie. From what you heard she was a huge flirt, she had been know to tease her master or mistress with sultry comments, but never did any thing. Despite being a huge flirt she was very kind and understanding. She is twenty three She is rather short only being an inch shorter than five feet. She was a normal weight for some one her age but because of her height was a bit pudgy. She has short red hair and hazel eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last maid you hired was Alex, new to being a maid she did not have much experience, then again you didn't have much experience hiring them, but she seemed like a nice girl in need of a job so you gave her one. She seemed like the kind of girl who kept to herself and might be a little shy. She has black hair and green eyes. She is rather tall, being six foot three inches, you and her were about the same height. In her picture she was wearing rather loose clothes that kept her body covered, but even through her baggy clothes that she has a very large re- 'Stop doing that!' You yell in your head. 'If I keep thinking like this their all going to want to quit because they'll think I'm a huge pervert!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe least urgent matter was the state the plants around your home were in, so you hired a gardener named Beth, two years ago when Beth was only nineteen, her husband Phil, was shot and killed in a mugging. Since then she spends all of her time working, and hasn't really said much to any one since then ether. She is a dirty blond with blue eyes that always seem sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you realize some thing. You had hired an All. Female. Staff! Now you knew that they were going to think you were a perv. Lately you haven't been acting like your self. You've been forgetful, messy, and...pervy! You walk over to a near by mirror, look at yourself and ask allowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman.L, a nice, witty, smart, young man. You have never been quite good with the lady's and, despite trying you've never had \"long term relationship\" but that will eventually change with all these women around...hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa.B, a sweet, innocent, young woman with a taste for cute girls. You have never be quite open about your sexuality with any one, but something about the sweet girls who now work for you makes you want to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, pick another way to start,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. Same start, but with deffernt girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB. Your rich father has just passed (he hadn't even mention that he was sick until now,) and you inherit his money, mansion and find out he had a staff of those women already working for him. (This choice also means a slightly different backstory for you and some of the girls.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr pick from even More ways to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit: The proportions of the girls have been changed to be more realistic.</span></div></div>",

But it was true.

She's only been here a few hours, most of that time he was unconscious, and you think he moves so fast that he's all ready got her naked?\" Asked Kelly, shooting Gracie a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't believe it, he seems to kind to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue you started swearing and making noises while trying to snap Jennifer out of her trance, that without knowing the situation, could sound wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay maybe their doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gracie was busy tainting Kelly mind, you were still trying to get Jennifer to come back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is she so embarrassed that she just shut down?' \"Come on snap out of it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Jennifer began to open and shut her eyes over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what?\" Said Jennifer trying to figure out what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I fix her,\" You said sounding very stupid. \"Oh I'm mean, are you okay? What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, I...I was just kind of tur-ah I-I mean aro-no. S-surprised, I don't handle being...surprised very well,\" Jennifer said stumbling with her words. 'That was a close one, I almost said some thing stupid.' \"Um, you're welcome anyways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well, I should go check on the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer nods and leave to go see______ <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, but this is still to good to be true, I must be dreaming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed.

That's different for you though, she just kind of asked me out for no reason that I could think of, but you seem to have genuine feelings for me.

She didn't tell you but she had heard your earlier conversation with Gracie, which is why she felt so bad about telling you how she felt, but now she felt at ease. You made small talk until Gracie and Alex came back into the room, neather of them hearing a single word from your and Jennifer's previous conversations, and took their seats and as if she was waiting for you all to sit down, came through the kitchen door and before long she had laid out all of the food.

The natural choice for Gracie's nickname was Grace. Jennifer was a little harder, you didn't want to go with just a shorter version of her name but eventually decided on Jenjen, and she seemed to like it. When you asked Kelly if it was okay for you to give her a nickname she had already come up with one herself, which was Ellie. Al seemed like a bad choice for Alex since it was too unfeminine for her girly personality so you went with Lexi. Beth didn't want one since the name you were calling her was already short for Bethany, but the new names that you  called them by were just the one of the things about them. The other was that they had all gotten bigger, not taller bigger more like...wider bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen ever a girl was on a break Kelly would bring them lots of sweets to keep their spirits up, but while their spirits were being kept up, their weight was being pushed up.They had all gained ten pounds the first week and even more the second due to the large meals and sweets Kelly was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock knock knock. \"Mr.Norman, may I come in?\" Asked Alex from the out side of your office door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Lexi come on in.\" Alex opened the door and entered your office. She walked up to your desk and placed a plate on it, which normally was covered with papers but thanks to your hard work and motivation from Gracie, now only had ten pieces of paper on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We thought that you might be hungry so we had Kelly whip you up something quick for you to snack on.\" Alex usually wore baggy clothes when ever she left the house which hid her new weight rather well, but when she wore her maids outfit like she was know, it was quite obvious that she was getting quite chubby. Her weight was distributed well throughout her body, but one could easily tell that a good portion of it was going to her lower half. Her thighs had gotten thicker but remained smooth, her hips flared out to her sides and even though you tried desperately not to stare you couldn't help but notice how much bigger, rounder and fuller her butt had become. The skirt of her maids uniform tried desperately to keep it covered but when ever she bent over to clean something up any one could see the white thong that were once panties, digging into her growing rear's crack and if her butt continued to expand like it was, not only would swallow her panties whole, but it would also make her skirt unable to keep her covered and new pairs of both would need to be bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sweet of you to do but I'm just about done here and I don't want to spoil my appetite for my date with Grace.\" You said still busy with the remaining paper work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Miss.Kelly will be upset if I return it to the kitchen, what should I do with it?\" Asked Alex after picking up the plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you eat it and just tell her I did!\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but I'm not hun-\" Before she could finish her sentence Alex's stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your stomach seems to disagree.\" You said after shifting your focus from your paper work to Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm hungry, but I still don't want it.\" Alex replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I-um, don't know if you've noticed but, I've been getting...bigger, recently and I've been trying to slim down before I get even fatter.\" Alex poked her belly and watched as the finger sunk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I noticed, you have been getting bigger but you're not fat, you're barely even chubby, and if you don't mind me saying, you carry it very well and it make you look very cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really? Thank you very much...um, so can I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you may.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex took the plate and was about t leave when you asked one last question to ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Lexi, could you tell Grace to get ready for our date?\" Alex nodded and closed the door behind her, and you went back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finished your paper work you and Gracie leave the house for,</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the past two weeks Alex was not the only one who had gained weight, Gracie had grown quite a bit too. Her formally pudgy form was because of her shorter stature, but her new Fat form was because of Kelly's cooking. Her bigger belly drooped down to just above her crotch. Above her stomach and just below her breast, there was a new roll of flab forming. Her breast had also grown quite a bit thanks to her weight gain, not as much as her stomach area had, but it was still enough to be noticeable. Her rear hadn't grown as much as Alex's had but it still had become bigger then it was, her thighs had grown thicker and her hips wider, her ass had become fuller and rounder and just like you thought, she had one of those faces that looked pretty no matter what size she was, which was a good thing since her red hair drew attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Grace, where to?\" You asked as Gracie got into your car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the movie theaters, I've been wanting to see this one for a very long time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the car into reverse and backed up onto the main road. \"What's the movie called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called [Insert name of current movie here].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think I've heard of that, isn't it suppose to be really raunchy or something<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's going to be awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived at the theater you got the tickets while Gracie got a small popcorn and a small soda for you, and a large popcorn and large soda for herself, along with several different kinds of candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Gracie sat in the very top row of the theater. You pulled out your pocket watch and began to look at the picture inside while the previews were going, until you saw that Gracie was looking at you so you quickly closed it and hid it in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, there is something else you could be looking at while we wait.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cheeks went bright red. \"Grace! Don't start that now! It's fine when you make jokes at the house but we're in a public!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ashamed of me?!\" Gracie asked looking insulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, that's not it I just-um well...embarrassed would be more accrete, and not even of you just the jokes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not as comforting as you think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry I'm just um, not really good at this whole dating thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could have fooled me.\" Gracie said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine don't apologize, you're just out of practice...I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks for being so understanding.\" You patted Gracie in the shoulder and gave her a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, so, forgive me for asking but...who was that girl in that picture, she looked quite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, she's no one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then why keep a picture of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave it alone okay! I said she's no one so just drop it!\" You said sternly but did not yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I-I shouldn't have said anything.\"  Gracie apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped, just please, don't ask about her again.\" You discreetly wiped you eyes with your sleeve when Gracie was focused on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look it's starting.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both got quiet and Gracie began to eat her snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie was...different, then the kinds you normaly watched. It wants really your kind of movie and you lost interest very quickly. During the last forty minutes of the movie you were to bored to keep your eyes open and you dozed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you like the movie?\" Gracie asked as you both left the theater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh!* Don't patronize me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...you know you look pretty cute when you sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome, but I bet you'd look better sleeping in My bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest Grace, I told you already that I don't do that on a first date.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normaly it's the girl who says that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've got guy friends who make less jokes then you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? I bet none of them are will to do what I am though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrived home you took Gracie up to her room, thanked her for a...interesting evening and kissed her good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least your getting back out there.\" You said to yourself as you walked to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opend your door and colsed it behind you. You changed into your night clothes and plopped down on your bed.</span></div></div>",

You walked over to your door, opened it and walked to your study.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Mr. Norman okay?\" Alex asked as Gracie entered the dining room. It was breakfast time but they were all too worried about you to do any actual eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said he was fine but I think he was lying.\" Gracie said as she sat down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After we're done eating we should go make sure he really is okay...who am I kidding I can't eat knowing he might be sad.\" Jennifer pushed her plate away and got up from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should bring him something to eat?\" Alex suggested and Beth nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get right on it!\" Kelly ran off into the kitchen to begin on making you something to cheer you up, while the other girls walked up to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Norman? Are you okay in there...Mr. Norman,\" When Alex didn't hear you say anything she turned to face the other girls. \"I don't think he's in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright every one split up, if you find him make sure he's okay then come find the rest of us!\" Gracie said, the other girls nodded and went of in separate detections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into your study and picked a book up from one of the bookshelves. You opened up the book, it had been hollowed out by you to hold a key, you took it out of the book and walked over to your chair and pulled a box out from underneath it. You used the key to unlock the box, you sat down in the chair and opened the box. It had a old lighter, a necklace along with many other things and was full of photos. You pulled out the lighter and began to play with it, you'd flick your wrist away from you to open the cap, light it, close the cap and then do it again over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh finally I found you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head to the door and see Jennifer standing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the other girls in the house Jennifer had grown. Her chin had evolved into a doable chin and she had grown puffy cheeks. Her stomach had become a large, soft mound ofoo flesh. Her hips and thighs were growing thicker and wider by the day, but her main attraction was her breast. While it was probably mostly Kelly's fault because of her cooking , but it could also have something to do with the fact that Jennifer's crazy ability to keep eating no mater what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer, please leave...sorry, I just need some time alone.\" You said still playing with the lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but I can't do that, you're obviously sad and I just can't leave you alone when you're like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine.\" Jennifer walked over to you and saw you playing with the lighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not planing on burning down this beautiful house are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I would never taint this gift with a crime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer sat on the arm of your chair. \"Who gave it to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girlfriend did, it's very important to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...you have a girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I HAD a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep something from you ex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's not a ex, she can never be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was the love of my life, when my parents died I became very depressed and she took such good care of me,\" Tears began to roll down your face. \"When I took up smoking she wanted me to stop but she knew that it helped me when I was feeling down so she let me, she even bought me this lighter. The day I finally worked up the nerve to buy her a ring so I could ask her to marry me...she died in a house fire. That day I lost the will to live, I didn't want to live without her, I wasn't suicidal but I felt that if I died I wouldn't care, but then I thought that if gave up, it would be like I was throwing away all the work she had done to get me to a better place would be in vain and I could never do that to her. I quit smoking and I promised myself that I would never feel as sad as I did that day ever again! I did a pretty good job actually, but sometimes things would get to me and I'd look at some stuff that reminds me of my resolve and I feel better, I haven't had to in a long time but when I went on that date with Grace it reminded me of her and last night I had a dream about her, so I decided to come look at some of her pictures.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer hugged you tight. \"That is the saddest thing I've ever heard! I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I feel better know, sometimes I just need some time alone...but it feels much better to talk to someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer gave you a kiss on the forehead. \"You're so brave to do this on your own for so long but you don't need to do it alone, you have us to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that's almost exactly what she said when she found out about my depression, you know...you kind of remind me of her, you look a lot alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer picked a photo up out of the box. \"Is this her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's us four years ago when she turned twenty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...she's beautiful...and you think I look like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you don't see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe I looked like her two weeks ago, before I got fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, your not fat, just a little rounder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, you just told me your pain and I'm complaining about how I've gained weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, don't worry it's fine, I told you what's been bothering me and you told me what's bothering you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a awesome guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're a awsome girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean it, you're kind, understanding, attractive,\" Jennifer leaned her head close to yours.\" smart, funny, attractive,\" Jennifer's face was now as close as it could be without tuching. \"generous...attractive-\" Jennifer passionately kissed you on the lips and you were caught off guard, but you decided to,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPush her away. You need to control yourself, you don't want to hurt Gracie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiss her back. You know that you and Gracie don't have anything special, you need someone who can give you something special and Jennifer can.</span></div></div>",

Her eyes went wide with shock, but she soon closed them so she could enjoy the moment. You wrapped your arms around her and pulled her in close to you, your chest pressing into her soft breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both finally parted for air, Jennifer's expression changed from one of shock to one of amazement. \"You are a wonderful kisser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't have a great kiss without two people can you?\" You said giving Jennifer a bright smile and she smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy you're feeling better...OH NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what is it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh um such a idiot!

You sat down and started by apologizing for making them all worry so much, then you told them everything that you had told Jennifer, (minus the parts specifically relating to her,) and when you finished every ones faces changed to one of pity and sadness for your misfortune (except for Beth's which was one of sympathy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex cupped her hands over her mouth. \"You poor man, I'm so sorry, if you ever need a shoulder to cry on I'm here for you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea, I would never of made those jokes if I did and I'll never make them again, please forgive me.\" Gracie apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll make you something extra special any time you are in need of a pick me up!\" Kelly said almost crying for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Beth mouthed something to you some thing along the lines of, \"Maybe we can talk in the garden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd while you were happy to see that they cared, you couldn't accept their offers. \"You're all so nice to say all of that but you don't have to do any thing for me or change yourselves to make me feel better, just knowing that you all care is enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you ever change your mind and need some comforting we'll all be here for you!\" Jennifer offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...do you want some of the pick me ups I already made?\" Kelly gestured toward a cart that was piled high with sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have some but I'm not really hungry, why don't we all share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're supposed to be yours.\" Kelly pouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they're mine then I can do what I want with them, and I want to share them with all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce all of the sweets were gone you asked to speak with Gracie alone and the other girls gave you your privacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Norman?\" Gracie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, listen I really enjoyed my self last night and I really like you but, I just don't think we're right for each other, you deserve someone who can make you happy but I just don't think I'm the one who can do that, we just don't have what it takes to work as a coup-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to keep going, I know your right, and you deserve someone who can make you happy too, and if you need a nudge in the right detection I think that Jennifer and you would make a cute couple...and she's got quite a appetite, perfect for fattening!\" Gracie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......One day you are going to make some weirdo a Very happy person, and if You need a some help going in the right direction I think I can set you up with someone\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you want to set me up with some one go right ahead</span></div></div>",

So, if you don't mind me asking...why dose she interest you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie began playing with her red hair. \"It's kind of a lot of things, she's so shy and it's so cute, she's very pretty and artistic,\" Although it never really came up much in conversation you knew this was true. You were privileged to see one of her drawings once and it proved that she was very talented. \"She's also really nice and smart, never really heard her tell an jokes but I'm sure she's funny, and well...she's got a rally nice...well, um-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ass?\" You said finishing Gracie's sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...that lovely thing.\" Gracie blushed bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...do you know if she, um...you know, like girls the same way you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the thing...I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want me to find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if it's not too much trouble that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh!* No no, I'll do it, I'm just not too used to this sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, you're a great person for doing this for me after you've had such a rotten day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I enjoy helping people...anyways I guess I should go talk to her already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got up and left for Alex's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnock knock knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex opened her door. \"Oh Mr. Norman, did you change your mind about needing a shoulder to cry on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shock your head. \"No no, I just wanted to get to know you better, after all you've been here for two weeks now and I barely know any thing about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex bit her lip nervously. \"Right now, in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sure...just give me a minute, I was...organizing my clothes and...I don't want you to see my underwear.\" You nodded and Alex turned closed her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited out side of her door and while you did you could hear her cleaning up...something. It didn't sound like clothes being moved, more like something scratching tougher, kind of like paper or books. She was probably drawing something that she didn't want you to see, which was weird since she normally wasn't too secretive about that. She probably just didn't want you to see it until it was done or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take to long for Alex to open the door open. She brushed some of her hair out of her face and let you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer room was very neat, since she was a maid though it didn't come as a shock. You glazed over at one of her dressers and saw that one of her drawers was slightly ajar, so ether she was organizing her clothes of she was Very committed to her lie...or maybe she hid something in it, although it didn't matter since you weren't going to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what did you want to know about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aw crap, really should have thought about this more!' \"Hmmm, well this may be a bit personal but, are you in a relationship right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex bit her bottom lip again. \"Oh, um no, I don't have a anyone like that in my life right know,\" 'Alright so at least I know she's single.' \"So...how are things between you and Ms. Gracie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, remember how me and Grace were talking alone,\" Alex nodded. \"Well we were talking about how it would be a good idea if we saw other people, we're still going to be Great friends, it's just that we don't really have enough in common to be anything other than that.\" 'Well we do have a simaler taste in women, but that's the problem isn't it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's eyes lit up for a fraction of a second before dimming down. \"Oh...at least you're both still going to be friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so, at least I can be happy about that. Oh, I almost forgot, I also wanted to know if you've drawn anything new.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Um, actually I have, but they're mostly ones of you and me and the other girls.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why dont you show me some of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...okay fine, here.\" Alex handded you her sketch book and you started to look through it, when you got to your and Gracie's page you excused yourself so that you could tell Gracie that,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of pictures and notes were about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of pictures and notes were about Gracie. </span></div></div>",

I don't know if I should be flattered or a bit weirded out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, they do say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and those pictures were pretty realistic,\" You looked Gracie up and down. \"although I do think she exaggerated some of your features.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Which ones?\" Gracie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you're hair was longer and shinier, eyes brighter and...well...you were a bit...thicker, but I'm sure that was just a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie laughed. \"Or maybe you're just too nice of a guy yo tell me how fat I've gotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm a nice guy, but you're not fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever you say,\" Gracie said rolling her eyes. \"Anyways, what do you think I should do now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next step you should take, in my opinion of course, is to start hanging out more, you know watch tv, talk, maybe see if she might give you some art lessons, just make sure that you're work doesn't start to slip up in the process.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea, we're both done with work so I think I'll try to spend the rest of the day with her.\" Gracie got up and walked out of the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's settled I should probably go check in on Jenjen.\" You too got up from your seat and left for Jennifer's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked up the main staircase you saw Gracie at Alex's door.

Heh, okay...I um...uh I think that sounds like a-uh good idea.\" You said struggling with your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer gave you a kiss on the lips. \"You're so cute when you're nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jennifer began to kiss passionately. You held Jennifer around the waist and you slipped you hand under her shirt and slid your hand upward toward her bra, but before you could unhook it you were interrupted by,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex going into a Very loud laughing fit. \"Okay seriously, what's going on with Lexi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cellphone starts ringing. \"I'm so sorry, I wish I could stay but I have to take this.\"</span></div></div>",

I GAVE AWAY TOO MUCH!!!' \"Um, I mean uh-\" You trid to come up with a way to cover up what you said, but couldn't think fast enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer placed her hand over her mouth. Jennifer went deep into her thought proses on how she came too her conclusion. \"...So that must mean that...Grace Likes Lexi! Wow, I really didn't peg Grace as someone who, well...went that way.\" Jennifer was obviously surprised at her own thought, but it made too much sense for it to be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let your arms down and made a heavy sigh. \"Alright you figured it out,\" You placed your left hand on Jennifer's shoulder before you continued. \"But you can't tell anyone you did, we should just stay out of it and see how things play out before we say anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer nodded in agrement. \"That dose seem like the thing to do,\" Jennifer hugged you again but still looked in your eyes. \"So, what do you want to do now?\" A deep red blush came to your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving second thoughts about moving so fast you pulled away from Jennifer. \"Um listen, I think we should um, take things slower,\" Jennifer looked confused, after all you were about to get to second base. \"I don't feel like I'm starting something new, I feel like I'm picking up where I left off, and that's not what I want. I want to like you because of you, not because you remind me of her. So lets just take things slow and when things feel right, then we can speed up. After all, you are a beautiful person who deserves at least that much.\" Jennifer gave you a warm smile and then another hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you in close to her, squishing you up agents her large breast and stomach. \"You are a awsome guy, most of the the guys I dated were just dying to get my bra off, you had the chance to do that but you didn't think it would be fair for me.\" Your cheeks somehow became even redder at being pulled into Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wraped your arms around Jennifer and held her tight. 'Shes so...so...soft, this feels so nice...this feels so...GAHHH, LET GO OF HER PERVERT!!! AFTER THAT SPEECH I JUST GAVE HER SHES GOING TO THINK I'M CRAZY.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things got a little more 'touchy' between you and Jennifer thought it was mostly only hugging and cuddling, (something you thought was JUST on the line of what was appropriate,) things between Gracie and Alex also started to get romantic...or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex was kind enough to let Gracie look through her room but when Gracie looked in Alex's closest, she was stunned. \"Wow Lexi, you have such nice clothes,\" Gracie grabbed one of the many shirts and was surprised at how...skimpy it was. \"How come you never wear any of these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blushed and started push her pointer fingers together. \"Um I don't...don't really have the confidence to uh...wear them, and now,\" Alex looked down at her stomach and pinched some of her fat. \"I don't think I have the body to wear them any more.\" Alex let go of her stomach and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aww, I can't stand to see her like this, have to think something to cheer her up.' \"Why would you say that? You still look like you could pull it off, in fact, I think you'd look a lot more attractive in it now then when you were tiny.\" 'Hey that was pretty go-wait, oh man I'm starting to sound like Norman...I wonder if this is what it's like in his head.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex looked at the shirt and blushed. \"Y-you can't you mean that. I-I've gotten so...so fat, how could I look...good in it,\" Alex looked down at her stomach. \"I'm so fat an ugly now, how could...someone, find me attractive now, especially in something so raveling.\" Tears started to well up in Alex's eyes, And Gracie's heart almost broke at the site of the adorable girl so sad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie hurried over to Alex and gave her a hug. \"Shhh, it's okay, you're not ugly, you're absolutely adorable and that Tiny bit of chub just makes you look even cuter,\" 'Geeze I really am starting to sound like Norman, that chubby chaser must be rubbing off on me...but this dose feel really nice.' \"And you're such a sweet, cleaver and artistic girl, any...person, would be lucky to be with you.\" Alex pulled away from Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her sleeve Alex wiped the tears out of her eyes and she blushed. \"D-do you mean that? Y-you really think I'm...cute,\" Gracie nodded her head. \"T-thank you so much Grace, that means a lot coming from someone as...pretty as you are, hehe.\" 'I hope she's not just trying to be nice...I hope she doesn't think I'm just being nice, ohh why dose talking to girls have to be so hard, especially pretty ones.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She thinks I'm pretty, or is she just being nice?' \"You kinda took a pause there, do really think I'm pretty, or did you have to think about what you were going to say?\" 'Oh man, I hope I she doesn't take that the wrong way.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's started to panic. \"What n-no! I-I just um...get nervous when people complement me...well, more nervous...I really do think you're pretty though, really Really pretty, hehe.\" 'Stop laughing she's going to think I'm weird.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I, thank you...you know, it might be good for your self-esteem to try some of your...outfits.\" 'Please say yes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Grace, okay, but be nice.\"</span></div></div>",

I s-should just change out of this...I feel so...weird in these they're just not, well, me.\" 'I hope she doesn't think I'm a big coward...I just don't want her to see me like this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Aww, I want to see her in that so bad, she'll look so good in it!

Alex's increase in size made the blouse only reach a inch or so past her belly, the neck line was already wide to give of a generous amont of cleavage, but even that was not enough, Alex had to undo the top two buttons and even that was not enough to keep the other buttons from being strained, but any more and Alex's white bra would be visible. Alex's skirt wasn't doing any better at keeping her coverd ether. She had to use both hand to keep her front hidden, completely unaware that in doing so she was lifting up the back of skirt, leaving her large rear and her white panties (now not much more then a thong) on full view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex blushed deep red at Gracie's comment. \"D-do really mean that?

SHE LIKES GIRLS!!! Yes, yes, yes!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no, did that slip out, what do I say? If I tell her it was a mistake and I don't like girls, I can't just come out and tell her that do later, and if I tell he I do like girls she might feel uncomfortable around me and I'll never get to talk to her again! Ohhh now I can never be with her!' \"I-um...I don't uh, I l-li-no um-\" Alex's 'explanation' was interrupted when Gracie pulled her closer and started to rub her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex you don't have to be nervous, I'm not the kind of person who's going to make fun of you because you like girls, in fact...I, like...girls too, well, I'm not sure if like girls, more like A girl.\" 'Well this is going WAY faster than Norman said it should...now I'm even complaining like him, normally I'd love for things to be advancing toward the bed so quickly...what am I thinking I still do, this is great!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She likes A girl...maybe I should ask her who it is...it could be me!' \"Y-you do, w-who is s-she, d-dose s-she live here?\" 'Please say yes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie's blushed yet again. \"Yes...she dose, she's really cute, and smart and clever.\" 'Please take the hint, I'm not going to be able to just come out and say it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait...didn't she say the same thing to...wait.' \"Is it m-me,\" Gracie smiled and nodded her head. \"It is me!

When you met Jennifer she was a Very thin girl with abnormally large breast (even for a girl of normal weight) with little to no curves, but now two weeks later she did. She had gained weight but if had only met her you would only think she was only five pounds overweight. Her hips were wider and her butt was no longer flat but round and gave her a new hourglass shape to replace her rectangle, and her breast had grown even larger, if you had to guess you would say they C cups before, but now were pushing double D's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder how big her breast would be if she got a little chubbier...STOP THINKING LIKE THAT, I'm being such a pervert and I'm going to ruin this wonderful moment!'

OH, um nothing I've just got a lot on my mind, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I understand, you've had a long day, you don't have to-*yawn.*,\" Jennifer nuzzled her head into your chest and closed her eyes. \"Sorry, I guess I got tiered running around looking for you all day, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently moved Jennifer off of you and you got up from her bed. \"Alright, I'll go so that you can get some sleep, I've got something's that I need to do any ways.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer opened her eyes. \"Don't go, I want you to lay with me.\" She begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deep red. \"M-me? You w-want me to lay with you while you...sleep? W-why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just feel safe when you're with me.\" Jennifer said as she closed her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, um I'm still going to be near by, you don't need to be afraid, okay...Jenjen...Jennifer?\" While you were talking Jennifer nodded of so you took your leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Such a sweet girl,\" You thought as you walked down the main stair case to the first floor. 'I should do something special for her since she's been so kind to me today, maybe I'll have Kelly cook up something extra sweet, just for her, but first I need to get some exercise, I've been so busy I haven't been swimming in a while, hmmm, maybe tomorrow me and Jenjen can go swimming together. Heh, I'd like to see her in a swim suit...geez I'm getting worse and worse. Alright just stop thinking and get to the pool, then you can concentrate on swimming.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk you had made it to the indoor pool, it was cold but you changed out of your clothes and into your swim trunks and dived in just the same. You did ten laps around the whole pool, by that time a hour had passed and you got out. You toweld of, changed back into your clothes and headed to your room. Once in your room you checked the time, nine thirty seven. You decided that it was about that you went to bed, so you changed out of your pants, removed your shirt and laid down in your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night you hear some on bumping around, you go investigate and find a robber, you scare him away and decide to hire a male security guard, that Beth might take a shining to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of the night you wake up a have a half hour coughing fit, Jennifer nurses you back to health, but hire on a doctor incase any one else gets sick or hurt, and Kelly starts hanging around the doctor since they are so nice to her. </span></div></div>",

It was a half a hour before you finally stopped coughing and Jennifer asked if you were alright. \"What's wrong, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...know...but I'm...fine now...don't worry.\" You said, still trying to get your breathing back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer wrapped her arm around you. \"But, I do worry about you...I love you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Jennifer with shock, you knew that she liked you but you didn't expect her to say That to you so soon. \"Jennifer...do you...mean that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, so...do you feel the same?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer...I...lo...lo...give me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say it, if you don't feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...no, I do...just...give me...a minute,\" Jennifer sat in quiet while you caught your breath. \"Jennifer, I do feel the same way, I've never felt this way about any one so soon before. You are such a sweet girl, after I left you earlier I was having...thoughts about you and that I should do something to thank you for being you kind to me. I tried to get my mind off of you but I couldn't and I-*cough* *cough*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much for saying that but if you're still not feeling well!\" Jennifer said worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm *cough* fine, and you need to hear this. I tried to get my *cough* mind off of you but I couldn't and I might have um, went swimming in water that was uh, way too *cough* cold trying keep my mind off of you, that's probably *cough* why I'm coughing so much right now. I feel so weird *cough* when I'm around you, I feel happy and nervous *cough* at the same time, after all I've never been good with *cough* beautiful girls, especially the ones I love, Jennifer, I love you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer gave you a big hug, squishing her breast up against your chest. \"I don't know if I'm hugging you because you're so sweet or because I feel bad for getting you sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's not your *cough* fault I got sick, it's mine for *cough* not being able to deal with how *cough* wonderful you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sweet it is,\" Jennifer let go of you and smiled. \"So, how about I stay the night with you, to make sure that you're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed deep red. \"Uh I don't *cough* know, I um...uh-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you worried about what the others will think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so *cough* much the others as just Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm pretty sure she's sharing a room with some one too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Um, I still don't *cough* know...alright...I guess.\" You said as you laid back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer laid down beside you and wrapped her arm around you. \"Good, because I wasn't going to go any ways. So what were thinking about when you said you were having \"thoughts\" about me earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your stomach knot up at Jennifer's question. \"Um...nothing...just *cough* about how wonderful you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay *yawn*, sorry, sleepy.\" Jennifer pulled herself closer to you and fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up the the next morning Jennifer was still sleeping. You still weren't feeling your best but you got up anyways, you being sick got you thinking, what if you or one of the other girls got hurt or sick and needed immediate attention. You needed to hire a doctor, but who to hire was the question. You had come across one doctor that you thought of hiring along with the other girls, but decided that a doctor wasn't necessary at the time. Who was that person again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, he nice young man with short brown hair and brown eyes. He is twenty four years old prodigy who graduated med school when he was eighteen. He is very fun to be around and is a great joke teller. He immediately takes a liking to Kelly and they start to spend time together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShara, she is a kind young woman with long black hair and green eyes. She is twenty four and like Jack graduated med school early. She is a quiet woman, not shy like Alex or closed of Beth, just not very talkitve, something that Kelly for some reason likes and starts to hang around her.</span></div></div>",

No I wasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hide it, we all know you like him, you've been spending a lot of time with him lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so what, you've been spending a lot of time with Alex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's because we're-\" Alex shot Gracie a look. \"Friends, were supposed to spend time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same for me and Norman. We're friends, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I got you! I said that you were hanging around him, not that you were more than friends, but you said that you were only friends which means that you're not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I...no uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If none of this was true then you'd be able to dispute it better, just admit it and this can be over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how did we go from talking about the new guy to this.\" Alex said, finally adding something to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, the new guy, so what do you think his type is?\" Alex gave Gracie another discreet elbow to the stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer let out a sigh of relief that the subject had been changed. 'That was close, I don't think I'm ready to come out about my relationship with Norman just yet.' Jennifer thought to herself while Gracie continued to talk about Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, what are girls talking about?\" Kelly asked as she came into the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had really plumped up since she arrived. She had gained the most weight out of the five girls, she was already a bit big when she started but now she was getting a little fat. She had a double chin and puffy checks that gave her a round face. Her breast had grown only slightly compared to her lower half. Her thighs were thicker and her butt was wider and her hips flared out to her sides along with her love-handles. Her stomach hung down over part of her panties and stuck out half a foot, making her have to upgrade her wardrobe once or twice since she started working for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The new doctor.\" Gracie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked confused. \"New doctor? What new doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'd know if you didn't spend so much time in the kitchen.\" Gracie answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mr. Norman hired him incase-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, him? It's a guy doctor?\" Kelly said, interrupting Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, are you getting ideas?\" Gracie said suggestively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was just curious ab-\" Kelly stopped herself when she saw Jack coming down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get my room set up once I get my office together, just so I'm ready.\" He said as he reached the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay now I am, just a little bit.\" Kelly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first I'm going to get acquainted with these four,\" Jack walked over to the Kelly and the others. \"Hi, I'm Jack the new house doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jack learned all of the girls names he left for his office and Norman left for his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was really nice.\" Kelly said, blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he was really funny.\" Agreed Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he seems like he will be a joy to have around.\" Added Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how about I make a special dinner to welcome him?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, but um, could you make it a lite one, please,\" Alex placed her hands on her stomach. \"I'm not really feeling too fond of food right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, Lexi don't feel bad,\" Gracie placed a hand on Alex's plump shoulder. \"You still look very pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex gave Gracie a quick hug. \"Thank you very much...never mind then...I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright if I want to get it done on time I should get started.\" Kelly said as she turned and walked to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we've still got more cleaning to do so let's hurry up!\" Jennifer said as she left Gracie alone with Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright here are the choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollow Kelly while she gets dinner ready, and gets a visiter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFollow Gracie as she tries to get Alex to stop worrying about her weight. </span></div></div>",

Oh well, I'll try harder.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor almost ten minutes Alex and Gracie had been cleaning quietly, only exchanging glances every now and then, until Gracie broke the silence. \"Hey Alex, can I talk to you about something...it's important.\" She said as she put her duster away, a strange tone of discomfort in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-of course...anything f-for you Gracie...\" Alex said, turning to her\u2026girlfriend? Had she even called her that yet? 'She sounds so upset, I wonder what she wants. What am I thinking; I know exactly what she wants to talk about...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, how long have we been seeing each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I think about two weeks or so...b-but it's hard to k-keep track of time when I'm s-spending it with you.\" Alex said as she started to panic on the inside. 'What am I saying? I'm only going to make this harder for myself saying things like that. I've known for days this was coming, it's so obvious, she doesn't look at me the same way anymore, she gets upset every time I mention my weight, I just wish I was strong enough to keep it from happening.' While she criticized herself in her head, Alex failed to notice the deep red blush that came to Gracie's face, thanks to her thoughtful words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...eh, thank you...but, over that time...I've stopped feeling the way I used to when I'm around you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I was right, though I wish I wasn't...but I guess there has to be a limit to how kind someone can be before they have to stop faking their feelings.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex, I never thought I would say this to you or anyone else but\u2026but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to form in Alex's eyes. \u2018I\u2019m breaking up with you! Just say it, why are you torturing me? I won\u2019t get mad; you'll always a special place in my heart, no matter what! ...I haven't even gotten a chance to tell her that yet...it doesn't matter! It's too late for me to tell her that-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stupid! Why did I blurt that out?! It's only going to make it hurt more when she tells me it's over! I hate myself so much for this! I can't believe...I-I can't believe that-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so, so much, Alex!\" Gracie said as she wrapped her arms around Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I didn't say that!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie took a steep back from the hug when she felt something cold and wet hit her back, but still kept her hands on Alex\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAlex, why are you crying? Did I say it wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-no! You said it p-perfect\u2026I just didn\u2019t expect you to say it at all\u2026let alone f-first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why are you cry-wait\u2026why didn\u2019t you expect me to say it at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026I thought y-you were going to break up with m-me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie frowned as she took her hands off Alex\u2019s shoulders and placed them on her hips in fist. \u201cAlex, we\u2019ve been dating for two weeks now\u2026or so,\u201d Gracie blushed. \u201cI kind of lose track of time when I\u2019m with you, too. Anyways, in that time we haven\u2019t had sex once. So if I haven\u2019t dumped you for that then I\u2019m not going to dump you for any other reason, so why do you think I would?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026got\u2026I\u2019ve gained\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou thought I would dump you because you got chubby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot chubby\u2026fat. Y-you don\u2019t need to s-sugarcoat it. Sugarcoated things are what got me this fat in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, if you\u2019re fat, what does that make me? I weighed more than you when we met, I weighed more than you when we got together, I weigh more than you now, and I\u2019m more than a foot shorter than you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026you were saying all those things about Jack\u2026I thought that\u2026I got to fat for me to be enough for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, like you getting fat will make you not enough for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what does-Gracie\u2026do you l-like me fat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor the last time Alex, you are not fat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust answer the question Gracie!\u201d Alex yelled, her teats coming back to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhh, Alex\u2026okay, I\u2019ll come clean. I like you this-no! I love you this way Alex, I mean, c\u2019mon, it\u2019s me.

I\u2019ve never said I love you to anyone else in my entire life, and I\u2019m always gonna feel that way, no matter how much you weigh!

I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders\u2026and a little off the rest of me, too,\u201d Alex let out a small laugh as she brought Gracie back into the hug. \u201cAnd I just want you to know I feel exactly the same way as you do\u2026\u201d Alex moved her hand lower to Gracie\u2019s right love handle. \u201cExactly.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Gracie turned around to look at you and like she said she was naked (not that you could see). \"Aw you can peek, we're going to be dating soon, you know you want to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm going to respect you and not peek.\" You said keeping your eyes covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can respect me by looking at me and telling me I have a nice body!\" Gracie was doing a great job at tempting you as you actually contemplated moving your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....Fine, but cover your...parts, first.\" Gracie rolled her eyes. She put her arm on her breast and a hand over her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can look now.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou removed your hand from your face and saw Gracie in all her expanded glory. Her formally pudgy form was because of her shorter stature, but her new Fat form was because of Kelly's cooking. Her panty lines borders were being invaded by her bigger belly, it drooped down to just above her crotch and soon she wouldn't even need her hand to cover it in the absence of her panties. Above her stomach and just below her breast, there was a new roll of flab forming. Her breast had also grown quite a bit thanks to her weight gain, not as much as her stomach area had, but it was still enough to be noticeable. You couldn't see her rear since her front was facing you, but you could tell that her thighs had grown thicker and her hips wider, and just like you thought, she had one of those faces that looked pretty no matter what size she was, which was a good thing since her red hair drew attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a very nice body Grace, happy?\" You placed your hand back over your eyes before Grace decided to move her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for telling me my fat self still looks good,\" Gracie slapped her stomach to make her point and though you couldn't see her do it, you could still hear it. \"so where are we going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you're not fat, and well, I know it might sound selfish but, I haven't gone to my favorite restaurant in a long time and I was hoping, that we could go there?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'm fine with it, as long as I get to fill my fat belly.\" Gracie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Because if you want we ca-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Don't you believe I'm hungry? Here, feel, it's empty!\" Gracie forcibly took your hand and placed it on her. It was soft and squishy but it wasn't empty, it felt more like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grace...this isn't your stomach is it.\"  You said completing your thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's my boob!\" You quickly yank your hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MISS GRACIE! WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!?!\" You yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry, was I being a bad girl,\" Said Gracie in a kinky tone. \"Dose this bad girl need a spanking to teach her a lesson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it I'm gone, come find me when you're dressed ready to go, and being dressed in your birthday suit doesn't count!\" You walked out of Gracie's room and closed the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gracie continued to get ready, you got dressed up too, you put on a nice suit, slicked back your hair and ate a few mints, you had brushed your teeth a few times already today but you can never be too careful, which is why you were now basically going through a entire bottle of swallowable mouth wash, you couldn't feel your tongue but hopefully that would wear off and it would be worth it when you kissed Gracie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you finished of the bottle, Gracie came into the same room as you and you hid it before she saw it. You looked up and saw  that Gracie was wearing a beautiful black dress that hugged her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woph, yow clen ep ness!\" Your tongue was still numb and your words got messed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that!?\" You bit down on your tongue to get the feeling back and tried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Ahem.* What I meant to saw was, wow, you clean up nice!\" You said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you,\" Gracie got closer to you. \"But to be honest, I prefer to be dirty,\" Gracie leaned in and kissed you on the lips. \"*Cough.* Oh my god! What did you do, drink a whole bottle of mouthwash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no... Well, almost,\" You joked. \"Well lets hurry up and get to my car so we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can fit inside of it that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrived you got a private table in the back, you ordered your favorite dish and Gracie ordered, well, it would be easier to say what she didn't order. Romantic music was played, the decor was beautiful, great smells filled the air, the food was great and the wine...the wine might have been a bit too good, but all and all it was a great date...or it was until you...well, you've never really been able to hold your liquor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, ya lock so pretty! *Hic!* Yer bloo eyes er so beautiful!\" You were really struggling with your words at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My eyes are hazel...you're drunk off your ass aren't you?!\" Asked Gracie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesh, I candt hondol ma licker...an da mothwish didin hep.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say, you're not even done with your first glass. If you knew you were going to get This drunk, why did you drink so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I waned ta empers ya sa yad *Hic!* Lak maferghaha.\" You were now losing you ability to make understandable words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I can't even understand you any more, we need to sober you up!\" Gracie called for a waiter to bring you some coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Na na, I wand ma wine!\" You said after you were given a large cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm pretty sure if you finish this glass you're going to get liver poisoning!\" Gracie protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd ya waried? Ib get ta libers?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're terrible!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya er rite...I tink in gana pauss ou naw.\" You were now Very close to losing consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finish your coffee and then you can pass out!\" You took the cup and chugged it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-wasn't that h-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot? Yes, yes it was!\" While half a glass of wine could make you drunk off your ass, a cup of coffee could send you straight back to sobriety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the date progressed normaly and all in all, wasn't so bad...at least that's what you thought. As soon as you and Gracie got to your car she started complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god that was terrible!\" She said after getting into the driver seat of your car (she didn't want to risk you still being drunk).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry about that, I didn't meen to get so...wasted!\" You said getting into the passenger seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that was the fun part, I mean seriously, I couldn't tell if the theme was supposed to be Paris, Rome or some other third thing.\" Gracie pulled out of the parking lot and onto the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's supposed to be...hmm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food was good but there were these two dishes and one was raw and the other was burnt.\" She said continuing her rant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never had sushi or cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e before have you?\" You asked sarcasticly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when that guy started to play that violin in right next to us, I mean, I like the violin, but normaly only in rock bands.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well next time I'll tip him to play a roc-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait? You told him to play that! Wow, you really must want me in bed.\" Gracie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I just think I should do every thing I can to make a lady happy on a date, I obviously failed on this one though.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want to salvage and make me really happy you could sleep with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you arrived back at the house everyone asked how the date went (even Beth seemed a bit interested) and, minus the part about you getting drunk, you and Gracie told them everything. Soon Gracie started getting tired so you took her up to her room. You walked in and Gracie laid down on her bed, and onec she looked comfortable you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.Leave the room and closed the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nB.Closed the door and locked it!</span></div></div>",

Her chin had evolved into a doable chin and she had grown puffy cheeks. Her stomach had become a large, soft mound ofoo flesh. Her hips and thighs were growing thicker and wider by the day, but her main attraction was her breast. While it was probably mostly Kelly's fault because of her cooking , but it could also have something to do with the fact that Jennifer could eat a crazy ability to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it will be over soon.\" Replied Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess s-*sigh*-maybe I should go to bed.

You shoved it in her mouth and she chewed and swallowed it and got visibly bigger. You continued to feed her, Kelly brought you several more trays of food out to help satisfy the girls gluttony, and when it was the girl must have weighed six hundred pounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, now I really need a belly rub!\" You lent over to begin massaging her stomach again, but you were woken up before you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the girl who had woken you up and realized it was the same girl from your dream.

You loved a girl with curves, the more the better. You loved how the fat would spreed so generously throughout their body's, making everything you love abou a woman bigger, larger breast to hold, a wider ass to grab and squeeze, a big stomach to cuddle up with and so much more, but none of that ment you would turn down a thin girl who liked you, in fact you've only had one big girlfriend, who eventually broke up with you because she found out you liked fat girls, just like every other girl you've dated. Every girl you had ever dated had at one point caught you staring at another girl, you were never really good at the whole \"monogamous\" thing and had even had one (or two or however you'd refer to it,) where you were dating two girls at the same time, it obviously didn't end well but was very enjoyable while it lasted. One thing that all of your girlfriends knew about was that you were a Huge pervert. You take advantage of the fact that a strange would think that you were just being over friendly, when in reality you were admiring their body's, although some of them would figure you out and get away away from you, but hopefully that wouldn't be the case with these new girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to a mirror and gave your self a once over.

You sat down and started to go through the letters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see, junk, junk, possibly important, important...hmmm something from dad, it's junk but it looks important...whatever I'll just read it, not like I have to write him back or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened up the letter and started reading it in your head. 'Dear ____(your name was too smudged to read) if you are reading this it means that I have passed away,' Your eyes went wide. 'I know we never really got along much since you mother died and I'd like to try and make it up to you by leaving you everything, my money, the family business, the mansion and the staff who took care of it, their names are Kelly, Jennifer, Gracie, Alexis and Bethany,' You let out a sigh. 'Leave it to dad to hire on a all female staff after mo-wait, Beth? She works for him now?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were younger you were best friends with a young girl named Bethany (you called her Beth). Beth did not have the easiest childhood, her parents died while she was young and her aunt (who lived very far away,) supported her. When Beth started hanging around at your home, your parents treated her like another child and even let her stay over on the weekends and sometimes even during the week. Beth grew so close to your parents that she accidentally called them mom and dad once. Flattered that she thought o them that way, your parents decided to let her call them that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brushed away the thought for now and started to read the letter again. 'Kelly will be cooking for you and the other girls, it is very hard to put her cooking into words so I'm not going to attempt to, she is a very kind young lady but can be very serious at time and be carful not to accidentally insult her cooking as she can become very upset about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer is going to be your head maid, she is very good at what she dose, but can be a bit nervous at times, and be nice to her as she can take things too seriously at times so be careful with your choice of words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie is another maid, you will also want to be careful what you say around her, as she can turn anything you say into some kind of sexual innuendo, and she can be quite a flirt, you should also know not to take anything she says seriously without any proof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex is yet another maid, she will be very shy around at first, but if you haven't changed since the last time I've seen you she should warm up to you soon enough. She is a Very gifted artist but she doesn't like to talk about it much though, so if you see her drawing in her down time don't look at it unless she offers to show you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany is the gardener, you should now the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suggest you come the mansion as soon as you can, incase you forgot the address is ________(once again the writing was smudged) and if you need to call before you come the phone number is 3-555-255-3555.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that this might not get rid of all the bad blood between us, and that you still might be mad at me, but now that I'm here with only a few minutes left, I know that I have to do it anyways. I am s' On that S, the letter ends. \"He must have died while he was still writing this...I guess I should honor his last request and go take things over.\" You looked around your messy apartment. \"It's going to take me a while to he ready to move though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you began packing, you sold you furniture and quit your old job (since you would have new furniture at your new house, along with with a new job). Looked in the mirror and,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecked your hair, you are Norman. L.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChecked your makeup, you are Lisa. B.</span></div></div>",

I though that I should look as professional as possible for them since I'm their new boss...is that the right word for this?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually the word would be master.\" Replied Beth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? I don't like that. They should just use my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to tell them that...so, what are you waiting for, get out of the rain and into your nice warm house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you shook off some rain from your umbrella you walked inside. It felt good to be back in your childhood home, a little weird, but good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth sat you down in the foyer. \"I'm sure you have a million questions, and I've got just as many answers so ask away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess my first question is why dad didn't tell me he was sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth is up until two mouths ago dad didn't even tell any of us he was, another month passed before dad told us it was terminal and well...last week...he-he...passed away and for the past month and a half ago he started to think more and he just thought it would be best not to bother you with his problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost completely unbothered by Beth's response, you asked your next question. \"Alright then, so...why are you-er-why Were you working for dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess this would have to come out some time, two years ago...Phil was shot and killed during a mugging.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide. \"I-I can't believe it...Phil, Beth why didn't you tell me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I didn't want to worry you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth stopped talking when you hugged her. \"Beth don't you Ever feel like you can't confide in me...I can't even imagine how horrible you must feel, losing the love of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's okay, he wouldn't want me to spend the rest of my life missing him I mean, I still do but, I try not to dwell on it,\" Beth broke away from your embrace. \"Anyways after Phil...passed, I got really sad, I couldn't afford to stay in our old home on my salary and well...long story short dad said that I could come stay with him and he offered me a job as the gardener...I really like it here so I figured that I should stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures, he Would use you while you were vulnerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not good to speak ill of the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...then I guess I have one more question for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, where am I going to sleep?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're still getting dads room ready so for now in you're old room...do you remember how to get there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, speaking of which I think I'm going to turn in now...you should get some rest too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Beth a pat on the back and went of to you're old room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got there you heard some one come up behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around and saw, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer, the head maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie, the short flirty maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex, the shy, artsy maid.</span></div></div>",

She knows very little about you other than the few times your father had talked about you, and to be honest...she's not your biggest fan, she thinks you are a spoiled brat who ran away from home because you weren't satisfied with what you had, along with many other things, but must serve you none the less. She is VERY strict with the other girls about getting their work done, but when all the work that needs to be done is dealt with she is very nice and fun to be around (which is only about three hours a day) but maybe you can get her to be a bit nicer to the others...once you get her to be nicer to you of course. She is a very attractive girl with a heart shaped face, beautiful features, a cute mole underneath her left eye and has shoulder length hair. Sophie has a slim and fit body, something that being around you should change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby.<br>\r\nAge: 22<br>\r\nHeight: 5 foot 5.<br>\r\nWeight: 124pounds.<br>\r\nEye color: Green.<br>\r\nHair color: Brown.<br>\r\nJob at the mansion: Maid/adviser.<br>\r\nInformation: Ruby is a young British girl with a lovely accent. Ruby absolutely adored your father, he was a kind man who donated to charity's often, he took good care of every on who worked for him among many other wonderful thing (he must have really changed after you left home), but the way she feels about you...not so much. While Sophie just didn't like you, Ruby flat out hates you, you have never met, but she has her reasons, though hopefully you can change her mind...or else having her as an adviser on your work could be a Very unpleasant experience. Ruby has a very cute face, fair skin, hair that goes half way down her back and she has a very generous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole.  <br>\r\nAge: 23.<br>\r\nHeight: 5 foot 6. <br>\r\nWeight:147 pounds.<br>\r\nEye color: White.<br>\r\nHair color: White.<br>\r\nJob at the mansion: Maid/personal assistant (or something along those lines).<br>\r\nInformation: As you can tell by her eye and hair color Nicole is a albino girl (I don't know why but I think they are Really cute and just wanted to add one to the story). Nicole isn't very good at dealing with death or meeting new people, so this may not be the highlight of her life. She is very shy around people she is close to, and doesn't speak very confidently, but is even worse around you, even after she gets to know you better her behavior doesn't change much. Just like all of of the other girls she is very attractive, but in more of a cute and adorable way, she is about thirty pounds overweight but it only adds to her cuteness, she has beautiful skin and well kept hair that reaches all the way down to her very large rear end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlene.<br>\r\nAge: 25.<br>\r\nHeight: 5 foot 9.<br>\r\nWeight: 325 pounds.<br>\r\nEye color: Blue.<br>\r\nHair color: Dirty blond.<br>\r\nJob at the mansion: Chef<br>\r\nInformation: Ilene seems to be the only one who likes you right away. She loves to make food from all around the world and has become over weight because of all of the food she taste test, but much more then you'd think you could from 'taste testing'. The only thing she loves to make more then food from different places, is sweets from different places. Ilene, for lack of better words, is a very cool person. She loves to be around the other girls (and you) almost as much as she likes to cook. She has smooth skin that is rather pale since she spends most of her time in the kitchen, not as pale as Nicole of course. Her extra weight has distributed very evenly throughout her body. Her face is round but still beautiful and over all she is still very attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda.<br>\r\nAge: 28.<br>\r\nHeight: 5 foot 9.<br>\r\nWeight: 124 pounds.<br>\r\nEye color: Hazel.<br>\r\nHair color: Black.<br>\r\nJob at the mansion: Doctor/unofficial gardener.<br>\r\nInformation: Miranda is a very kind yet...suggestive person. She doesn't have much work to do around the house as no one gets sick or hurt on a regular basis and spends most of her time tending to the mansions garden. She loves flowers and keeps some in her office, so long as no one is allergic that is. Miranda is very motherly to the other girls, something reflective of someone in her position. Miranda is very knowledgeable about almost all fields of medicine, from the most minor case of the sniffles to the most serious of surgical procedures (something she hopes she never has to use). Miranda has beautiful tan skin (from being in the garden so much) that almost seems to glow, she has a hourglass figure with wide hips, a slim waist and large breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that we know these new girls, who are you, Norman or Lisa?</span></div></div>",

'This place hasn't changed in years,' You thought as you parked you car at the entrance. 'Well, the plants look a better.' You opend the car door, pulled a box out of the passenger seat an carried it to the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter struggling with box for awhile you finally gave up and just knocked on the door with your foot. When the door finally opend there was a attractive girl black hair that reached her shoulders in a maids uniform, the skirt was black with white frills going around the bottom. The top was black and had sleves that went to her wrist, and had white frills around her sleeves and neck, puffed out shoulders and a white apron that went down past the skirt.  \"Humph, I guess you're the late masters son,\" You nodded your head at the girl. \"You probably want me to carry thet box for you then?\" The girl outstretched her arms in anticipation of the box being handed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shook your head and entered. \"No no, I can handle it, my box anyways, it's not your problem,\" The girl honestly looked surprised at what you said. \"You can tell me where I can put it down though...it is pretty heavy.\" The sighed and pointed to the side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you put the box down you turned around to face the girl again and gave her a smile. \"What ever, I'm Sophie your head maid, blah blah blah (she is actually saying blah blah blah), the master bedroom is at the top of the stairs, blah blah blah, I've go work to do and I don't really care what you do just don't make a mess...good bye.\" Sophie turned away from you and started to walk away but you grabbed her wrist before she could get far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get the feeling you don't like me, why is that?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie her arm away from you. \"I'm not going to waste my time explaining myself to some rich kid!\" After Sophie stormed off you were left alone in the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well she's just a ray of sunshine,' You turned and picked up the box again 'Alright, time to get these up those stairs...this is not going to be easy.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you lugged the box up the stairs you put it down and opend the doors to the master bed room. Inside you saw yet another maid. She was wearing a similar outfit to Shopie only instead of being black, it was pink, but it also seemed to be a bit...tighter then the one on Sophie. The girl had white hair and pale skin...too pale to from a lack of sun, the girl was probably a albino. The girl didn't seem to notice you enter since she kept dusting...ether that or she just chose to ignore you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked ovr to the girl and placed your hand on her shoulder, scaring her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl jumped up and spun around. Your assumptions about her being albino were correct since she also had white eyes, she was beautiful, a bit pudgy, but still beautiful. She was shaking and looked afraid you. \"No no, don't be afraid, I won't bite...that was lame, dose any one actually think, oh watch out, that freak is going to bite me,\" The girls fear started to melt away and she started to laugh. \"That's better, you're the one person I've met today who doesn't seem to hate me...granted I've only meet one other girl today. Anyways my name is Norman, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed and started to mumble her response. \"He-hello Mr. N-Norman, m-my n-name is Ni-Nicole...hi.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole huh, that's a pretty name,\" 'AM I FLIRTING WITH A GIRL I DON'T EVEN KNOW...well she dose seem to apreciate the compliment.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank y-you...I-I should go...I don't w-want waste any more of y-your time, I-I have work to do anyways.\" Before you could say another word the girl rushed out of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well this place is full of attractive-INTERESTING, this place is full of Interesting people...geez, I'm such a pervert. Well it's starting to get pretty late, I should probably,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA. Meet the rest of the girls before I have to go to bed.'

You mouthed for help (no words would have come out anyways) but she just looked at you, blushed then giggled and went back to dusting the vase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finally got you to your fathers old office (you recognized it since it was the only room you weren't allowed in) Sophie opend the door dragged you in and placed you down in a chair behind a desk. \"Huh...so this is what this room looks like.\" You said as you looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie shot you a look of disbelief. \"You've never been in here before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I haven't, my father said I was annoying to be around when he wasn't busy...let alone when he actualy had work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of annoying hobbies did you have as a kid?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I liked to read as kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um...anyways, you've got a lot of work to do and I have to help you with it until you have the hang of things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie put a HUGE stack of paper work on your desk and you both got to work on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what you're doing and Sophie calls in Ruby for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't that bad at the paper work and you and Sophie Actually finish with time to spare...maybe use that time to get her to like you.</span></div></div>",

She had long brown hair that went half way down her back. She was wearing the same kind of maids uniform as Sophie and Nicole, only instead of being black or pink it was blue, it also had a bigger...bust-line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stormed over to your desk and picked up one of the many documents that you were currently working on. \"Is this all that you've got done,\" The woman spoke with a lovely British accent...even if it was with a angry tone. \"You're going to ruin the late masters business with this kind of work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly what I was telling him,\" Sophie added. \"I've been trying to show him how to do it since seven o'clock but nothing seems to get through his thick skull!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I still here so at least that much got through....don't say that aloud.' \"I'm sorry but I was never any good with this kind of stuff, I was always a hands on kind of guy.

I guess Ms. Ilene went um, a bit overboard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I can eat all of this on my own,\" You looked up from the tray to Nicole. \"Maybe we could share?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's face went even redder and she bean to pull at her long white hair. \"Oh um, I don't know, I'm uh, supposed to be cleaning in here, and Ms. Sophie gets mad when work doesn't get done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that why you didn't help me earlier, because you're afraid of Sophie,\" Nicole simply nodded in respose. \"Well I've got paper work to do and I've got to eat, just take a couple bites when you want them while you're cleaning and if you aren't done cleaning when Sophie gets back I'll tell her that I kept distracting you or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, alright...thank you, Mr. Norman.\" Nicole took one of the many finger sandwiches and began to nibble on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just call me Norman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Nicole finished the sandwich she walked over to one of the bookshelves and started dusting it. When she had to dust the lower shelves, instead of squatting down to do it like someone normally would, she bent over. Her white hair fell to her sides allowing you to see something that her hair once hid, her big butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow, she's giant rear, she's really beautiful a-I'M DOING IT A-wait, why would she be cleaning like that unless, dose she like me? Should I try to talk to her, hmmm, I guess talking wouldn't hurt anything...but how far should I go,'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust flirt with her. She bent over like that because she's not used to cleaning around men, but she dose like you she just doesn't say it because she thinks she likes someone else...but doesn't admit to ether to ether until later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHit on her full on. She wasn't trying flirt with you, but is faltered by your complements and admits she likes you, and things might go somewhere...eventually.</span></div></div>",

'That was much better.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled sheepishly back. \"My name is Nicole, um, it's very nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet you too Nicole, that's a very pretty name by the way.\" You said sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, um, thank you very much...oh! I'm sorry, please come in,\" Nicole blushed and stepped aside to let you in. \"The other girls just went to bed, I was just finishing up some chores, so please try not to make too much noise okay, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be, I'll make as little noise as possible.\" You said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, um, would you like me to get you anything, maybe some tea?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am feeling a little peckish, could I have something to munch on, if it's not to much trouble that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her head. \"Not at all...please wait here, I'll be right back.\" Nicole turned around and walked away, giving you a very good look at her large rear while she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down in one of the love-seats 'Wow, she's really pretty, and she got a really-no, stop it now before you screw things up.' You thought to yourself while you waited for her to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nicole walked back into the foyer a minute later she was holding a tray that had a plate of cookies and a glass of milk on it. \"I hope these are okay, I'm not really good with preparing food, and these were the only thing that were ready, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine, I love cookies,\" You took one of the cookies off the plate a took a bite. \"Mmmm, these are great, do you want some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, um, you won't mind?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I have offered you any if I did?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right, sorry.\" Nicole said before picking up a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't be, you didn't do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, okay,\" Nicole looked at you and blushed but then quickly looked away. \"Sorry um, I'm just a bit nervous, I'm not really good at meeting new people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just a little shy, don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, for being so nice to me. I've been having a bad couple weeks since the late mast-Er, your father ...passed...sorry, I know you've probably had it worse though, he was your father after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel bad, I'm sure that a lot of people miss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Nicole looked down at the plate and all of the cookies had been eaten. \"Oh, I guess I should get to bed now, I've go a busy morning and I think you do too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, it was very nice to get to know you. I'll see you in the morning I guess.\" You got up from the love-seat and walked up to the master bedroom. You closed the door behind you before changing out of your clothes and laying down in the bed. 'I hope all the other girls here will be as nice as Nicole, as cute too.' You thought to yourself as you closed your eyes and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning you were woken up by,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, she is your personal servant after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie, she has a lot of work for you to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlene, it's not her that wakes you up but the smell of her food.</span></div></div>",

I had a weird dream, something about fire or chili flakes or, no, it's gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...oh! I came to ask you, um, if you wanted me to bring you some breakfast in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but I think I'd rater eat with every one else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll wait for you in the dining room, would you like me to get you a plate ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice thank you, could you get me a plate of scrambled eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it will be ready when you come down.\" Nicole turned around and left your room to get your breakfast  ready while you got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you opened the door to the dining room your your nose was bombarded with wonderful smells from the food that had been spread out across the table. You sat at the head of the table where your eggs had been set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, every one this is Ms. Lisa...oh! Um I hope that you like the eggs, Ms. Ilene worked very hard on them.\" Nicole said before gesturing to the large woman next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, eggs are a simple dish to prepare, but I still hope you like them.\" Said the woman who would have to be Ilene. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I will,\" You took a bite out of the eggs and your eyes lit up. \"These are wonderful, and they defiantly don't taste simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you but really it wasn't that hard, I had more trouble with Sophie's French-toast.\" Ilene said while pointing to the much slimmer girl who sat next to her who wore a maids uniform similar to the one that Nicole wore only it was black instead of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still really good though.\" You said before taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlene smiled. \"Well it's good to here that you like my cooking, after all you will be eating it a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah um, it's really good, it's hard not to like anything she makes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good food for every meal? Sounds great!\" You said with a big smile. After that there wasn't much dialogue between you and the other girls. Once each girl finished their food they left the room soon after, except for Nicole, who waited for you to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your eggs Ms. Lisa?\" Nicole asked after you took the last bite out of your food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head. \"Yes they were very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like anything else to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...oh!

'I wonder if I still remember where the doctors office is?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it no problem and you get to meet Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't find it and end up talking to a different girl before meeting Miranda.</span></div></div>",

So, do you take good care of the others too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, Nicole just been having some problems recently that I've been helping her with. Truthfully though normally I don't have much to do around here most of the time, of course in my line of work that's a good thing, but it can be a bit boring sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any hobbies to kill the time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I take care of the garden and the plants around the house. I guess I'm sort of the unofficial gardener, I actually grew all the flowers in this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Their all so beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, my doctors gloves aren't the only ones with green thumbs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I get it, that's clever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I also grow some medicinal herbs for when I think that anything stronger is unnecessary, also for when I want to-no that's not a good one, it's too serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...oh! Now I get it, sorry I can be a bit slow sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" Miranda got up from her chair and patted the seat. \"Here come sit down you'll be more comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sat down on her desk before she answered you. \"I'll be fine, I've got a built in cushion, now sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so,\" You walked over to the chair and sat down in it. \"So Miranda, what else do you do here, I mean you must do something other than tending to the house plants and garden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sometimes the other girls come to me for advice for both medical and non-medical problems. Things that worry them, things they are afraid of, things about relationships and I won't get into any of that. Sometimes it makes me feel more like a head doctor than a medical one, but as long as I'm helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a very kind thing of you to do, so speaking of relationships are you in one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to be, but not any more, my work doesn't really leave room for me to be in a relationship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad, you're a very kind and...attractive woman, maybe you could take spend more time away the house when you have free time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a solution to the problem I'm having, anyways I've got some things to take care of in the garden, sorry if you wanted to talk more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine...maybe,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should go meet the other girls, but I'll talk to you later.\" You walk out of Miranda's office and almost immediately run into Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could come with you, maybe I'll pick up a new hobby.\" You go gardening with Miranda and after you bring some fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs to Ilene.</span></div></div>",

'Or more, more is good too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I haven't heard anything about you until your father died and when he did you show up from out of nowhere and take his home and business, so forgive me if I'm not quick to think that you are more than a ungrateful brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I didn't stay in touch with my father was because he didn't...approve, of who I am and he didn't try to contact me ether, I wasn't exactly the daughter he wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have been a pretty awful kid for him not to like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I was a good kid, I did everything I was told to and was very well behaved but I did One thing that he didn't approve of and he shut me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...lets just say it was had something to do with who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I guess you seem nice...but I don't know if I'm ready to call you a friend yet...tell you what, I'll give you a chance to convince me that you're worth being friends with.\" Sophie sat down in a bench that was underneath a window in the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds fair enough, I guess I should start by asking if you have any hobbies.\" You said after sitting down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I like to...never mind ask something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can tell me, I'm great at keeping secrets, I would give you some examples but then what kind of secret keeper would I be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...but don't laugh, I like...to...sing. Not really though, I mostly just sing along to songs that I play in my room and I'm no good at it ether. I know all the words but I can't carry a tone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That seems normal, I do that too sometimes.' You thought. \"Aw, how cute.\" Your eyes widened. 'Ah crap I mixed those two up didn't I.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks, I guess that's better than you laughing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry...let me try again.

Miranda is kind of like a sister to me since she's always looking out for me, and the others of course. Ruby and Nicole are nice too but they can get on my nerves when they don't get their work done, they can be so lazy sometimes and that's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, I made pretty good friends with Miranda and I'm some what acquainted with Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute, I'm supposed to be the one asking you stuff, hmm, do you have a boyfriend? That seems like something I should know about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, no I don't, I haven't had one in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're pretty, I'm sure you could get one soon if you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...you're really pretty too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so, I have to admit I haven't been in a relationship for while ether.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, we're bonding already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess so, alright we can be friends, but your nowhere near as close to me as Ilene...anyways I should really finish cleaning, maybe I can drop by your room later and we can get to know each other some more.\" Sophie said before she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face went a little red at the thought of her in your room. \"Y-yeah that...that sounds good.\" Sophie then walked away and soon turned a corner. 'Really nice...hmm, I wonder what time it is,' You looked around for a clock on the walls. 'What, one thirty, aw man I missed lunch. I hope I can talk to every one else before dinner, I should probably go talk to that Ilene and find out when it is so I don't miss it, I hope I don't get sidetracked, well if it's Nicole I'll make a exception.' You got up from the bench and started on your way to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make it to the kitchen without running into anyone and you start to talk with Ilene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do run it someone, luckily it is Nicole and you start to talk with her even more.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a similar uniform as Jennifer, only it was purple instead of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I don't like it ether,\" Agreed a much shorter girl in a pink version of the maids uniform that looked a little snug. \"It's the only part of the original house that hasn't been changed...maybe it's haunted, that could explain how so many of the books get off their shelf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, there is no such thing as ghost, I'm sure that the shelves are just uneven.\" Replied the taller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, sorry Alex.\" Nicole walked over to Alex and began to help pick up the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to apologize, this place is a little creepy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, you're a really good friend. I feel like you're the only one I can be me around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get that, I know we can both be really shy with the others, it's because we understand each other that we make such good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I wish I could be as open with the others as I am with you, but I get nervous when talk to them. I was good with Mr. Harold, but that was-never mind...oh! So...do you think his son is going to be nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he is, are you feeling nervous again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sorry, this whole thing is just unsettling to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex hugged Nicole. \"I know this has been hard on you but you will start to feel better once you meet him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Finally, I found the library...and now I feel like a idiot for having to enter on the second floor, but I can't remember how to get in from the first,' You thought to yourself while you stood in front of the door to the library. 'I hope those two girls like me, it would be awkward if they don't...no no, that's selfish, if they don't want to like me they don't have to...but I hope they do.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ah-ahcoo! S-sorry, it's really dusty over here.\" Alex apologized after she let out a cute sneeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sniff* it's okay, it's really bad over here too, I wish we didn't have to clean in here, it's so creepy sometimes.\" Complained Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm the only one who can reach the higher shelves, and we're only good at working with each other so I guess you're stuck with me, but on the bright side we get to spend most of the morning outside when we clean the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sure, the pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, sorry. Listen we're almost done so lets just finish up here and we can go somewhere you actually like, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...thank you.\" Nicole said with sheepish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright I just need to get to the ladder and I can go down to the ground floor and meet the two cleaning in here...now where is it?' You began you walk around the poorly lit second floor of the library looking for the way down. You had your arms out so that you could feel around, but it back fired when you knocked some books off of a shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Thud thud thud*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UM...H-HELLO, IS SOMEONE THERE?!\" Alex yelled when she heard the noise you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah sorry, I'll pick it up,\" You bent over and blindly picked up all of the books (or what looked like all the books) before you spoke again. \"There, alright I'll be right down...as soon as I find that damn ladder...sorry.\" You looked around for a minute or so before you located the ladder and climbed down slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" Alex asked going back to her shy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Norman, your new boss person-Er something.\" You said introducing yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're Mr. Harold's son, uh, I'm Nicole and this is Ms. Alex, it's nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it's nice to meet both of you too. I thought that I would come say hello to you two first and see how the library is looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been taking care of it for a long time, I hope you like it.\" Said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've both done a great job, I'm surprised it's still in such good condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you, Mr. Norman, it's very hard to keep it this way.\" Said Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just putting away the last few books and then we were going to go relax for a little while before bed, you're welcome to join us if you want.\" Alex offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow Alex and Nicole up to one of there bedroom's where you get to know them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ask if they can make a quick pit stop at the kitchen to grab a snack, and you meet Ilene and Kelly before heading to Nicole's bed room.</span></div></div>",

That's so nice to hear,\" Nicole shifted her gaze from you to Alex. \"Sorry, I know you're always telling me that but um, it means more coming from a guy, especially a han-never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex let go of Nicole and gave her a pat on the back. \"It's okay, I know what you mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay um, anyways Mr. Norman, why don't you tell us  about yourself, uh, if you don't mind.\" Nicole asked as her cheeks went a little red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. Hmm, I'm trying to think of a way to talk about myself without sounding narcissistic. Well  I guess I should start with that I'm a good guy, I'm trust worthy, I don't like to see people who are in pain or are upset and I would never say anything to hurt someone...I guess that makes what I said about how pretty Nicole is a little less meaningful but I did mean it,\" After your said what you did you took in your exact words. 'How pretty Nicole is, so stupid, she's going to think I'm coming onto her,' You looked at Nicole and gauged her reaction to what you said and she seemed unfazed. 'Phew, she doesn't look like she cares...is that a good or a bad thing? Whatever just say something before you kill the moment with silence!' \"Oh sorry, I drifted of there didn't I? Anyways I don't really like secrets but if a friend asks me to keep one I will, as long as I'm not hurting anyone else by keeping it, so if you ever want to talk you can trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really nice Mr. Norman but, that's more about what you do for other people, not about you, I meant like what you do for fun or uh...if we can be expecting to see a girlfriend around here.\" Nicole said blushing even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm, I don't really do anything spacial for fun, and as for a girlfriend, I haven't dated in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex tilted her head in confusion. \"Huh, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lowered your head and stared at the floor. \"I...don't like to talk about it...it's really personal.\" You said solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.\" Alex apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, don't be sorry you didn't know,\" You said changing your tone from depressed to sincere. \"I hate to make someone feel bad, so please don't, I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sorry I made you feel that way.\" Alex apologized again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're a apologetic people aren't we...wait what time is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...nine forty five, wow we've been talking to a while.\" Alex said after glancing at a clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, aw man, I was hoping to get to know at least two of the other girls before they started to head off to bed, but don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the short time we spent together and I hope I get to know you two better another time, but I'll leave you to get ready for bed, I'll see you both in the morning though, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm hmm, I'll be the one waking you up in the morning.\" Nicole said blushing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said goodnight to both Nicole and Alex before walking out into the hallway, but it wasn't long before Nicole came after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mr. Norman, can you wait a moment?\" Asked Nicole soon after you left her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's the matter?\" You asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you're...uh, going the wrong way, your room is that way.\" Nicole said pointing in the opposite detection you were walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Man I'm really turned around, would you mind showing me where it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, follow me.\" Nicole turned around and started to walk in the detection she pointed to and you followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole eventually stopped in front of a door and opened it to let you in. \"Uh Nicole, I think you got turned around too, this is my fathers room-Er, his old room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but no, you will be staying in the master bed room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously, it's going to be a little weird sleeping in the same room that a dead guy used to, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I guess so, I...I never really thought about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it shouldn't be to bad, I could get used to it...hopefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm *sniff* sure you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and saw Nicole on the verge of tears. \"What's the matter, did I say something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wiped her eyes with her sleeve. \"No *sniff*, it's just being in this room, it reminds me of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really miss him huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, every one here dose, he meant a lot to all of us. He was like a father to all of us, I know that's kind of stupid to say to you of all people, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no,  I understand, if you lose someone you love it hurts every bit as much no matter how you are related to them, and it's good to miss someone when they're gone, but not to spend the rest of your life mourning theirs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sniff*, thanks, that makes me feel better...I should go, I don't want to bug you any more than I already have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to, if you want to talk some more just sit down and start.\" You sat down on the bed and gave it a pat as to invite Nicole to sit with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if you don't mind.\" Nicole said before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would I have said anything if I did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's on your mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't want to say anything but, I was nervous about meeting you, that you might not like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that's just stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could probably have worded that better but Nicole, you're a great girl, there is absolutely no reason for me not to like you. You're so kind and beautiful any one would be lucky to have you as a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-beautiful? Do you really think I look beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ah crap she caught it that time, it's okay just come up with something quick.' \"Um, of course...\" 'Damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thank you...um, you look...nice, too. Sorry, that wasn't a very good complement, was it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nicole continued to talk for quite some time before,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex came looking for Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nicole fall asleep in your bed.</span></div></div>",

'Mmmm, I stayed up way too late with Mr. Norman last night. I wish I could sleep a little longer but if I don't get Mr. Norman out of bed soon Ms. Sophie will get mad at me,' Nicole sat up in bed and wiped the sleep out of her eyes. When she opened her eyes she saw that she was still in your room, in your bed, next to you. 'Oh no! D-did we...sleep together? No I'm probably worrying about nothing, but I still need to find out.' Nicole put a hand on your shoulder and tried to gently wake you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, wh-whats going on,\" You asked still half asleep. When you finally opened your eyes and saw Nicole under the same blanket you quickly got out of your bed. \"D-did we sleep together, I mean, we obviously did in the normal way but, did we do it in the way where there's not much sleeping?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I don't know, do you think we um, did, in that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we both still have our clothes on and nether of us remember, so unless we decided to put our clothes back on and completely forget about it, I think we're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right, I guess I was too panicked to really think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I was worried for a minute, I'm relieved we didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I'm sorry I had you so worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's not you, you are a very beautiful girl, very sweet girl and I'm sorry if I made it sound like you were not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's pale cheeks went red and a sheepish smile came to her face. \"Thank you, it's always nice to hear that from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it's just I've never had very good luck when it comes to women. N-not that sleeping with you would be a bad thing I just don't want to ruin our friendship and not because we couldn't be more than that I just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's okay, I get what you're trying to say...oh! Um, I think we should get ready for breakfast, before the others wake up and start to wonder where we are, especially Gracie. She can make wild assumptions about this kind of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this was hard to explain to ourselves, let alone the rest of the house.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Nicole left your room so that you could both change into some fresh clothes but soon met up again to get on with the day. You and Nicole walked down  the main starecase and into the kitchen, where two women who wore chef outfits were arguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she'll hate that, trust me, she is my best friend after all.\" Said the much larger of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think she'll love it, trust me, I am the better chef after all.\" Said the one who was more or less the same size as Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'm the better chef!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, are we interrupting something?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"YES,\" They yelled at the same time before turning to face you. \"Wait, who are you?\" They asked speaking in unison again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Kelly, Ilene, this is Mr. Norman, the late masters son.\" Nicole said from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...well, sorry you had to see that...anyways, what would you like for breakfast?\" Asked the thiner one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about some waffles, as long as you don't get in a fight over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we can handle it, right Kelly?\" Asked the larger one, who would have to be Ilene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, they will be the best waffles you've ever had,\" Kelly said before guiding you and Nicole into the dining room. \"Now leave us alone, we don't cook well while we are being watched!\" Kelly then walked back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they always like this?\" You asked while you walked over to the table and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When they are cooking yes, but when they're not they are really nice,\" Nicole said before sitting down next to you. \"The other girls should be here soon, they're all really nice too, but some of them can be a handful as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds...interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt t long before the the other girls started to arrive. The first two enter the dining room were,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer and Sophie. You say hello again to Jennifer and try to get to know the other girl but she isn't interested in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Gracie.

So you're the new master,\" You nodded your head. \"I am so fired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm not going to fire you, but I do hope that you were just kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course...maybe I should just shut up and eat,\" Gracie paused and looked at your eyes. \"You would like to see that wouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what?\" You asked, feeling confused (or maybe worried).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think I can't see you eying my stomach.\" Gracie said before giving her stomach a pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, no I wasn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie sat down next to you and smiled. \"Hey it's okay, you like 'em big, that's just good news for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-that's crazy, I don't have a size preference for women.\" You lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you do like big women, just not more than thinner women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess so, but the body isn't the only thing, the personality is important too.

He is just a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I like him that way too.\" Alex added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, getting friend zoned by two girls at the same time, that's gotta hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only met them yesterday so not really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ding ding ding, breakfast is ready,\" Ilene said as she and Kelly brought trays of food. \"Hey, where  is every one else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The smell of your cooking must have scared them away.\" Kelly said as she put two trays down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you saw earlier you knew that you should steep in before Ilene and Kelly start to go at it again. \"I think they might just be sleeping in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we made all this food, and there's not enough people to eat it all.\" Ilene said after setting two more trays down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's face went red again. \"Um, I could eat a little extra, if that would help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know some one who would like to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it okay if I eat somewhere else, please?\" You asked only half joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are going to eat here like every one else...almost, every one else.\" Kelly said before sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we at least eat quietly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me, mouths are for eating at meal time any way.\" Ilene said as she sat down too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast you want to meet the other girls, but who do you bring with you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to take Nicole, but she ate too much and can't get up yet so you stay with her until she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole is fine and you've bugged enough for today so you take either Alex or Gracie or both of them with you.</span></div></div>",

Poor girl is going to starve herself if she keeps eating the way she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe looked well fed to m-\u201d You stopped walking and froze in the middle of the hallway when your sentence was cut short by Gracie slapping you across the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019m so sorry, It was a reflex I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d She said quickly after hitting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no, it\u2019s fine I deserved that, I just meant she was eating pretty well earlier, I guess I should have said that the first time,\u201d You said while rubbing your cheek. \u201cSo I guess you slapping me means that you\u2019re really worried about her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda, she dose eat, though most of the time she only nibbles on stuff, and that's cute and everything but I'd still feel better if she ate more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your being serious and aren't just setting me up for some kind of feeder joke, I'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never use someone I'm worried about as a set up for a stupid joke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright than...I guess I could invite her to my room later on for a snack or something, after I've met every one first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dose it really have to be in your room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I was just making a suggestion, but if you have a better place or idea than I'll do that instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me that you wont try anything alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I wont try anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie smiled and started to walk again. \"Good, now than, how about I introduce you to the other girls, they should be up by-\" Gracie was cut off when another girl in a black version of the maid uniform slammed into her and knocked the girl  over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Gracie watch where you're going,\" The other girl said as she picked herself up of the ground. \"I've got to hurry up and eat breakfast before I fall farther behind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry Sophie but you missed breakfast, everything was eaten.\" Gracie apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I sleep in this one time and I miss my favorite meal of the day...wait a minute, who\u2019s this?\" Sophie asked, pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a friend of Nicole's.\" Gracie said cutting you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend of Nicole's huh, how come I've never met him before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lives kinda far away, but he's going to be in town for a few weeks so Nicole invited him to stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as he doesn\u2019t mess up the house I guess it's okay. Anyways, since there's no breakfast for me to eat I guess I should get to work.\" Sophie said before walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, mind telling me what that was about?\" You asked after Sophie was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, wait until she knows you better before you tell her who you are, because doing that know would be a mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's pretend I understand why, won't she notice that I live her now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only have to pretend you're not you until she likes you, then she should have no problem with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm just going to to go with this for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now how about we go meet every one already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me, do you have a idea on who to start with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I do, I thought we could kill two birds with one stone by stopping by the garden,\" After that Gracie took you by the hand and lead you outside. Once you were in the garden Gracie walked you over to two girls in the middle of the garden, one with black hair and one with brownish blond. \"Beth, Miranda, this is Norman, he's the late masters son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is? I saw some pictures of him from when he was a kid around the house, and I have to say I wasn't expecting him to look like this.\" Said the girl with black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, he turned out really cute. What do you think Beth?\" Gracie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\" Said the girl with the brownish blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Miranda, you and Beth weren't at breakfast, did you both sleep in wink wink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never have breakfast with the rest of you, and I'm not sure how Beth spends her mornings.\" Replied Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just going to ignore that last part huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand but anyways, Norman. What have you been up to since you got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My invisibility must have worn off...don't say that.' You thought to yourself before talking aloud. \"I've been trying to meet every one since I got here last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, who have you met so far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I got here I talked with Jennifer for a short time, then I went to the library where I meet Alex and Nicole. After we talked for a while Nicole showed me up to her room where the three of us talked for a while before it got late and I left for my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you had a long night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It didn't end there. After I walked a few feet towards my old room, Nicole came after me and told me that I was going to be staying in my fathers room. Once I got there I said something stupid and upset Nicole but I fixed it, but after that we spent a long time talking, And This morning I meet Ilene, Kelly, Gracie and Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nicole was up pretty late with you huh, do you remember what time she left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I...um, fell asleep before she left and I don't remember the time, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor Nicole's been having trouble sleeping, I offered her to come sleep with me but she always says no.\" Gracie said, sounding upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to help her with that, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promised that you weren't going to try anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I wasn't trying anything, I just thought I could try and help her with that later on while were having that snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two talking about?\" Miranda Asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norman here has taking a shining to Nicole and he invited her to come up to his room later, but I made him promise that he wouldn't try anything.\" Gracie said Interrupting you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this like the thing with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinda...that reminds me, if you two see Sophie or Ruby, Norman is a friend of Nicole's from out of town, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, alright. Anyways I should get back to my office, but feel free to stop by any time you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've still got to introduce Nicole's friend to Ruby before lunch, so we better get moving too.\" After that Gracie too you by the hand again and led you back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you met Ruby it was pretty much the same as with Sophie, only Gracie did most of the talking, and you barely ever heard Ruby say two words. The rest of the day was uneventful, but know it was almost over and you still had a promise to keep and after a quick trip for snacks you were ready for Nicole to come to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright, Nicole should be here any minute, all I have to do is get her to have a little snack and then make sure she gets to bed on time.' You thought to yourself while you waited for Nicole to enter your room, and you didn't have to wait long before,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole arrives and you offer her something to eat while you talk. When Nicole finishes the snacks it isn't long before she starts to fall asleep, in your bed, with you, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie comes in to clean and is confused as to why you are in the late masters bedroom. When Sophie starts asking questions you start feel bad for lying to her and come clean and apologize, and when Nicole arrives you invite Sophie to stay for snack time.</span></div></div>",

I'm sure he's a nice guy, like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish he could be like like you, you're so nice you're defending him even though you don't know him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm throwing Gracie under the bus but I can't keep lying, I'm not a friend of Nicole's, I'm Norman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norman is the name of...You're...you son of a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please forgive me, Gracie said that I should wait until you got to know me before I told you who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't blame poor Gracie you jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not trying to blame her but it's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right, and what kind of creep are you to pretend to be Nicole's friend for some weird reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't pretending to be her friend I really am, I was just pretending that I knew her before last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock knock knock* \"Mr. Norman I'm here, are you in there?\" Nicole asked from the other side of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You invited her to your room you sicko!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nicole but don't come in yet,\" You yelled at the door before turning back to Sophie. \"It's not what you think, Gracie was worried about how little Nicole's been eating and sleeping so I offed to talk to her and have a little snack with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and if you don't believe me you can stay and make sure I don't try anything, even though I already promised Gracie I wouldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...but only because I want to make sure you treat Nicole right, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" You then turned away from the Sophie and opened your door. \"Sorry about that Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I don't mind waiting...for you,\" Nicole walked into your room buty froze when she saw Sophie. \"Oh...um, you shouldn't be in here. This is late ,asters room. Sorry Sophie I wont lose sight of him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Nicole, I told her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, I'm sorry for lying to you Sophie. You know I don't like to lie to people, right?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. So than how did he convince you to lie?\" Sophie asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He didn't. Gracie told me to say that he was my friend from out of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright than, now that that's settled how about some snacks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sat down on your bed and nodded her head. \"Um, Okay, goodbye Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm staying.\" Sophie said before sitting down next to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I thought it was just going to be me and Mr. Norman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would like that wouldn't he.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He, is standing right here...anyways, do you want something sweet or salty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...what kind of stuff do you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have plain or spicy chips for salty, and some chocolate covered caramels for sweet, sorry I don't have a wide array of snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...could I have some of those chocolate thingy's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have all of them if you want,\" You said before handing the bag to Nicole. \"And what do you want Sophie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie took a bag of chips from you and opened them. \"I'll have some of these,\" Sophie reached into the bag and pulled out a single chip and tossed it in her mouth. \"Hot, hot, hot!\" Sophie let go of the bag and used her hand's to fan her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole give her some of the chocolate's, the milk in them should help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened the bag and gave some of the candy's to Sophie. She quickly tossed them into her mouth and a look of relief came to her face. \"*Sigh*, thank you so much, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bent over and picked the bag up from the floor. \"I must have grabbed the really spicy kind by mistake, tell you what, these can be mine and you can have the plain kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way you can eat those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...then I just wont have anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mr. Norman, what did you want to talk to me about, did I do something wrong?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's nothing like that. I hoping that we could just talk, like we did last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night. What was she doing talking to you last night?'\" Sophie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me, Nicole and Alex were-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex was there, never mind then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Sophie...you don't really seem to like Mr. Norman, so why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I don't trust him alone with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't like him but, you should, he's really nice and, um...\" Nicole's eyes started to open and shut. \"Um...Um, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, are you okay?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened her eyes again and kept them open. \"Um, Yeah...I've been kind of tierd all day...I didn't sleep to well last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you sorry, did you keep her up all night or something?\" Sophie asked angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm just sorry she didn't sleep well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, so Nicole do you want to go to your room so that you can get some rest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...no I...no...\" Nicole's eyes closed again but this time she kept them closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie stood up from your bed, put her hand on Sophie's shoulder and shook her slightly. \"Nicole? Nicole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave her alone, she's tiered.\" You got up and slowly laid Nicole down on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'm not leaving you alone with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm not moving her, she feel asleep at a good time which is what I promised Gracie. I also promised her that I wouldn't try anything, and bedside's, look at her, she's sleeping so peacefully.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but if she stay's, I stay too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay with me, so, do yo u have a sleeping bag or-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sleeping next to her, I don't want anything to happen to her while I sleep.\" Sophie said as she walked over too the other side of your bed and then lied down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess I'll just sleep on the floor.\" You then grabbed a extra pillow and blanket out of your bedroom closet and set yourself up on the floor and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sophie had no trouble getting a good night's rest, but did Nicole?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's internal clock tells her to wake up early again, and when she sees Sophie sleeping next to her she freaks out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sleeps well into the afternoon and wakes up well rested, but worried she's making a habit out of sleeping in your bed.</span></div></div>",

Nicole opened her eyes and saw Sophie sleeping right next to her. \"Eeep!\" Out of shock Nicole rolled out if your bed and fell onto the floor with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, Nicole what's wrong...Nicole?\" Sophie said as she jerked up in our bed. Sophie looked around but didn't see Nicole. Then she looked at you, still sleeping on the floor, and threw a pillow at you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't act like you don\u2019t know you creep, what did you do with Nicole?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Sophie...I'm down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie leaned over and looked at the floor and saw Nicole laying on there. \"Nicole, what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know either?\" Nicole asked as she picked herself up off of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Sophie asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean...did we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole.\" You interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes are on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...oh!

O-Or any one else. We just fell asleep at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's really all that happened than fine,\" Sophie said before walking to your bedroom door. \"I'm going to go down stairs, I don't want to miss breakfast two days in a row. I don't even know how I made it One day without French-toast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for sticking up for me, Nicole.\" You said after Sophie left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you're welcome, I'm sure that you would have done the same.\" Nicole said blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you would ever end up on the opposite end of this situation. You're too sweet to ever do anything wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-thanks...you, too.\" Nicole said as her face went even redder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it, you're a really nice girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're a really nice guy...oh! Um, we should get down stairs, before we miss breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we don't want Gracie getting any ideas either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...well, lets go.\" Nicole said before you both walked out of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nicole made it half way down the hall before Gracie spotted you and walked after you. \"Hey beautiful! How did you sleep?\" She asked once she caught up to both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hi Gracie,\" Nicole said not even bothering to stop walking or to even look at Gracie. \"I slept pretty well actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I bet that bed in the master bedroom is comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stopped walking and faced Gracie. \"W-What do you mean?\" She asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stopped by your room again last night, and again you weren't there. So I thought you must still be up with Norman and I went to his room to tell him off for keeping you up so late, but when I got there you were asleep in his bed with Sophie, and he sleeping on the floor. Now while I'm happy that you were getting good sleep And Norman was respecting you, I am a little jealous that Sophie got to share a bed with you. Which reminds me,\" Gracie said before giving you a kiss on the cheek. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracie!\" You yelled at the same time as Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be jealous, Nicole. I was just thanking him the only way I know how.\" Gracie said with a shrug of her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not...I don't...*Sigh*, okay.\" Nicole said before starting to walk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hadn't made it even a whole five feet before a door went flying open, hitting you in the face and knocking you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jennifer who had accidentally knocked you onto your back, and while she wasn't quick to figure out what happened, she Was quick to make sure you were okay once she did. She had dropped down to her knees and was hunched over you, her disproportionally large breast pressed against your chest. \"I am so sorry, are you okay?\" She apologized with a very worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I-I think so...\" You replied after the stars faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I think...y-your nose is bleeding!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want Gracie to kiss your booboo and make it all better?\" Gracie asked with a cutesy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracie! Don't make jokes he's hurt!\" Nicole said worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer got off of her knees and began to help you up. \"I think we should get him to Miranda, he might have a broken nose!\u201d Accompanied by Gracie and Nicole, Jennifer slowly escorted you down stairs and into the house doctor's office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, what happened to you?\" Miranda asked as Jennifer sat you down in a chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I walked into a door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, you don't need to lie to me, is he hitting you again?\" Miranda joked as she began to examine your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not. Funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your nose is only bruised, and so is your funny bone,\" Miranda then put her hand into her coat pocket and after fishing around in it she pulled a bandage out of it. \"This will keep you nasal passages open so it can heal properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you just have this on you?\" You asked as Miranda applied the bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be happy that I did, I don't have any of these anywhere else. So consider yourself lucky...there, all patched up. Just keep that on and your nose will be better in about two weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's okay?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, now that I think about it he might have some head trauma as well,\" Miranda said before she started to examine your head. \"Yup, you've got a pretty big bump there. I'm going to have to ask that one of you look after him for the day to make sure he's really okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it, this is my fault after all.\" Jennifer offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's not your fault. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Besides, I'm a grown man, I can look after myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hear you say that when you slip into a coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I'm in a coma I wouldn't be able to say anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, now Jennifer, I want you to come to me if starts feeling drowsy. Oh, and as for your nose Norman, no lying on your face, no sports, and no kissing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't really planing on doing any of that, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And no picking it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I, five?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, you should hurry up and get to breakfast before you miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be joining us today?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I've been wanting to read up on some boring medical stuff that probably don't care about, and I wanted to show Beth...some thing in the garden that you probably don't care about either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure have been spending a lot of time with Beth lately, I'm starting to think something is going on between you two.\" Gracie said with a suggestive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I get hungry I can always have a few fresh strawberry\u2019s.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignoring me again, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be used to this by now...*Sigh*.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, the doctors office is closed, come back later.\" Miranda said as she showed you all out, closing the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know about you three, but I'm going to get some breakfast before it's too late.\" Gracie said as she turned to leave for the dinning room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm a little hungry, too. See you soon...\" Nicole said before following Gracie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this has been a eventful morning.\" You complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again I'm really sorry.\" Jennifer apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I wasn't talking about you, just this whole morning in general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay...hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing just, weren't you wearing that yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah I guess so...guess that means Nicole is, too...and probably Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be easier if you don't ask, it's not that important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I guess we should go have breakfast now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...you're going to need to show me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really hit you that hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'm just quiet used to being back in this house yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, just follow me.\" Jennifer took your hand and lead you through the hallway to the dining room, but when you got there,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it on time for breakfast, but the whole time both Sophie and Ruby looked at you funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, Nicole, Gracie and Jennifer were to late for breakfast, and would have to wait until launch to eat.</span></div></div>",

So how about I take you out, anywhere you want tonight, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-This is really out of nowhere but, okay. If it will make you feel better, but only if I pay for your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine by me, as long as I pay for yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie started to giggle to herself. \"Kiss, kiss, kiss!\" She chanted from the sidelines of your conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gracie!\" You, Nicole and Jennifer shouted at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's right, he can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me say this now, this is not a date, just a apology.\" You stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer nodded her head in agreement. \"Right, I feel the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm going to go find Alex...we need to get to work.\" Nicole said before leaving the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what were you planning on doing today?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wandering around mostly, although I was hoping on getting to do something productive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess I'll be tagging along, I need to keep a eye on you after all, but if I start bugging you tell me and I can just check in on you every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you'll be fine. Now let's go.\" This time it was you who took someone by the hand and lead them off somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Sophie...\" Gracie said once she and Sophie were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you were leading Jennifer around looking for someone to talk to. Nicole had found Alex, and was insistent that they get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really? You've never been in a hurry to clean the pool before, is something wrong?\" Alex asked sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her head back and forth. \"No...it's nothing. Lets just get to work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my best friend Nicole, I can always tell when you are upset, and you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole tried to put on a fake smile, but still looked upset. \"I said it's nothing...I'd be stupid to think anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, because that's going to convince me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I'm just...stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not! Why would you say something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's true! I...I should have known.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Known what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That he wouldn't like me, they...they never like me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had finally found someone to talk to. It was the busty maid with a British accent, Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello there Mr. Nicole's friend. How are you enjoying your stay here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So either Sophie didn't tell her, or she hasn't gotten a chance to.' You thought to yourself before speaking any actual words. \"Oh, you have a British accent.\" You said stating the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and you have a American accent, and the sky is blue and water is wet, isn't the world full of surprises.\" Even when she was being sarcastic Ruby's voice made her sound polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I just didn't notice. When I first spoke to you I only heard you say two words since Gracie was doing most of the talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she'll do that. So...what-uh...what happened to your nose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you had to be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, whatever that means. Oi, Jen, you're being really quiet, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer snapped out of her daze and looked at Ruby. \"Hmm? Oh, nothing, I'm just thinking about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak up girl, no point in you just standing there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing, really, don't mind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're not going to contribute to the conversation then why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when 'Mr. Nicole's friend' hurt his nose he also hit his head, so I'm keeping an eye on him to make sure he's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't Nicole be doing that? He's her mate after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mate?! I'm not her mate, we're just friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what it means, idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry, yeah I think I've...I've...heard that before-do you hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like...crying?\"</span></div></div>",

What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you crying! Are you okay? Are you hurt, is there something I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm fine,\" Nicole said as she wiped the tears from her eyes. \"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?! Someone was actually crying, how did you hear her we were on the other side of the house?!\" Ruby said when see came into the room and saw Nicole's pale cheeks were red from all her crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other side of the planet isn\u2019t far enough to keep me from knowing when someone I care about is sad! Now Nicole, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some one you care about? So you-\" Nicole smiled again but this time it was genuine. \"Nothing, not any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, that's not going to work, and I'm not leaving you until you tell me what's wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't say, it\u2019s embarrassing.\" Nicole said as her cheeks went red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This may sound rude but, I don't care, you're my friend and I can't just leave you when you're sad! So the sooner you tell me the sooner I can help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can't...you...I can't tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can, you can tell me-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you seriously this dense? She can't tell you because it's about you! She obviously likes you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby!\" Nicole yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No that can't be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Ruby's right.

'Does that mean he doesn't like me back?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have hurt you to see me ask Jennifer to dinner. That's why you are upset, isn\u2019t it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be. It's my fault, I never thought you would like me back. So I didn't think me asking Jennifer to a apology dinner would hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did you say you like me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Alex, let's leave these two alone. You too Je-where the hell did she go? She is always doing this, that little scatterbrain.\" Ruby said as she stormed out of the room, Alex followed and closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stood up when the others were gone and her cheeks went so red it seemed imposable for them to grow any redder. \"S-So, do you really like me back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and laughed a little bit. \"Sorry, I know shouldn't be laughing but, you were right, this is embarrassing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sunk her head down \"S-So you don't...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, Er-I mean...Yes, I do. I guess I should have told you, but I was worried I might mess things up between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...you...*Sniff*,\" Nicole's eyes began to water again. \"I'm sorry, I'm just so-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Please don't start crying again, I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish, please,\" Nicole wiped her eyes and smiled again. \"These are happy tears, I'm just so happy to hear that!\"<br>\r\n         <br>\r\n\"Heh, and I'm happy to see you smile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, thank you. Um, so...should we...kiss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're forgetting something.\" You said pointing at your nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, how about a hug for now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hug? Um...I...okay.\" You held out your arms and Nicole sheepishly inched her way closer to you. When Nicole was close enough you wrapped your arms around her and pulled her close to you, while her arms dangled helplessly to her sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know a hug is normally a two person activity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Come on. You can do this, you hug Alex all the time. It's the same thing just...better!' Nicole thought before she slowly began to wrap her arms around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had her arms around you she didn't stop squeezing you. \"Owtch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes went wide again as she pushed herself away from you.\"I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's okay. I just wasn't expecting someone as small as you to be so strong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'S-Small? Since when am I small? He must only be trying to be nice...I don't think I mind though.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we just need to get used to each other. Tell you what, since I'm taking Jennifer out to dinner, I'll take you out to lunch. Does that sound good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Is this a date-date or an apology-date?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A real date. First the lunch date with you and then the apology dinner with Jennifer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT-Two dates on the same day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that going to be a problem? Because I can reschedule with Jennifer like that!\" You said snapping your fingers to demonstration your point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt'll be fine as long as I come first.\" After you get back from your date with Nicole you start to feel sick and concussed. So you have to reschedule anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you don't mind, sorry.\" You move dinner with Jennifer to the weekend that way you can have some more time to get to know Nicole, but something happens after it that Really upsets Nicole.</span></div></div>",

I did that yesterday, too. Why am I eating so much around him? Maybe it's because I feel so comfortable around him. What ever the reason it has to stop! I can't gain anymore weight, especially now that I have someone to be skinny for.' Nicole's silence worried you a bit but eventually she spoke again. \"Yeah it's a really nice place. We normally go there for girls-night, but sometimes just me and Alex go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I just another one of your girl friends...that sounded better in my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm the girlfriend. You're the boyfriend...you are my boyfriend, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, aren't you my girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, of course!

Um, okay...\" Nicole began to look even more nervous as she inched her way closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Nicole's shyness was cute you couldn't just watch her struggle. \"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just don't want to hurt you by accident.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let me help.\" You then used your hand to genitally move Nicole's head to the side and slowly leaned forward until your lips met hers. The kiss only lasted for a minute before you let out a quiet groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gently pulled away and looked at you with a worried expression. \"Are you okay?! Did I hit your nose...o-or was the kiss bad?\" Nicole asked sounding sad at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's okay. let's just try again...ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was bad, wasn't it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it was good! Really good, it actually left me light headed! Which is normally a good thing, but when you might have a concussion, not so much...ugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wrapped her arm around you and began to pull you along. \"Come on, I'm taking you to see Miranda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took you through the house back to house doctors office and once inside she sat you down in the same spot as last time. \"*Sigh*, what happened to him this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's starting to feel concussed.\" Nicole said worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh, and when did it start?\" Miranda asked as she began to examine you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's cheeks went red again. \"W-When I...kissed him.\" She said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda rolled her eyes. \"What did I tell you?! Not only could you have caused further damage to your nose but you were also depriving your brain of oxygen, which Yours need as much as it can get, as well as-wait...Nicole you kissed him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Nicole! Though, don't you think you could do better than him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize you said that right in my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah and I really like him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, calm down you two love birds I was just kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not in love!\" You protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes widened in shock. \"W-We're not? I...I thought we were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to ruin that relationship, Romeo.\" Miranda mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean it! I just didn't know if she liked me that much yet. I didn't want to ruin things but, I guess I just did that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I love you too much to be mad at you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stopped examining you and smiled. \"Then all is right, except for the fact that you have a concussion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it serious?!\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I'm going to need to keep a eye on him to make sure it stays that way, but I've still got stuff need to do in here so his time wandering around today is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll stay, too. He's my boyfriend and it's my job to make sure he's okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you've got stuff to do, too. I'll see you tonight though, maybe we can fall asleep together on purpose this time.\" You offered. 'Did I just say that?! I'm horrible.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's cheeks went red yet again. \"M-Maybe...I'm gonna go now,\" Nicole then leaned over and kissed you on the forehead. \"I'll miss you.\" Nicole turned around and hurried out of the room and left you alone with Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Norman, what are your intentions with my Nicole?\" Miranda asked when Nicole was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, more jokes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm being completely serious. We all look out for each other here, any one of us would ask the same question...though we might each word it a little differently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Nicole is a wonderful girl, I would never do anything to disrespect or hurt her, even if we were only friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'll believe that after you invited her to sleep with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate myself for saying that, but she didn't seem to mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're a good looking guy, I couldn't say that I would mind either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so-wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracie was right, it is funny to make you confused.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be the rest of my day, isn't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Miranda continued to...joke, with you, Nicole was humming happily to herself while she walked through the hall. 'I'm so happy he's okay, I don't think I could handle losing two Leroy men in my life, especially now that I'm dating one. I can't believe I actually went on a date with Mr. Norman! This has been the best day ever and it's not even dinner time yet! Which reminds me, I can't eat too much tonight and no matter what he says I'm not having a snack toni-'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole!\" Gracie yelled as she came up behind her, derailing Nicole's train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*, hi Gracie, what do you want?\" Nicole asked before Gracie pulled her into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm never letting you out of my sight again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I'll be joining you and Norman when you have your little 'snack time' tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that, I don't think I'm going to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been eating to much lately and I don't want to gain any more weight. Especially since I have a boyfriend now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Boyfriend? Aww, how cute! You and Norman will make a great couple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow...you took that better that I thought you would!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you think I was going to say? Your happiness is all that matters to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus it will be that much easier for me to float the idea of a three-way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I guess now is not the time, oh well. Anyways, why weren't you going to have snack time with Norman, again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm eating too much! ...S-Sorry, I didn't mean to snap like that. I've just been feeling a little touchy about my weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, can I be touchy with your weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gracie! I'm being serious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know and I'm sorry. Hmm, if you're really worried about eating too much I can make sure you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really? How would you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll join you in you for snack time and when I think you've eaten enough I'll tell you to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea! Thank you so much,\" Nicole smiled and hugged Gracie tight. \"I really do like spending time with Mr. Norman and this way I don't have miss any time with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's still calling him 'Mr.' Noman? Kinky!' Gracie thought while the hug continued, which she eventually realized. \"Are you enjoying yourself, sweetheart?\" Gracie asked suggestively before trying to 'enjoy' the hug herself, namely by taking a hold of Nicole's love-handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracie,\" Nicole yelled before pushing herself away from Gracie. \"I'm going to find Alex, um, thank you again, I'll see you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss goodbye?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole frowned. \"Goodbye Gracie.\" She then turned and walked away to find Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor at least an hour all you and Miranda did was sit quietly while she worked, but eventually she finished. \"That's about it, I'm finally all caught up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean I can actually do something instead of sitting here for the rest of the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not, but I'll still need to keep a eye on you.\"</span></div></div>",

What was-oh right my phone,\" Miranda stuck her hand into her pocket, pulled out her phone and began to read a text. \"It's about time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, am I going to have to sit here even longer?!\" You asked feeling a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Beth just texted me that a lot of the vegetables finally came in and she needs my help to pick them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She texted you? The garden is twenty feet from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She likes to text rather than talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a little weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call her weird! She's just not a talkative person,\" Miranda said before standing up and grabbing you hand. \"Now come on, where I go, you go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it with these people and holding hands?' You thought while Miranda dragged you outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce outside Miranda let go of your hand and walked over to Beth. \"Alright Beth, lets get started. I heard on the news yesterday that there's going to be a bad storm in the morning and I know Kelly wont be happy if her ingredients are ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, so that's why all the food she makes taste so good, she uses fresh ingredients.\" You said as you walked over to the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked at you for a while before she even acted like you where there. \"Yeah...\" It wasn't much though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...you were right, Miranda, she isn't very talkative. Why is that?\" You asked like Beth wasn't even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, she just doesn't.\" Miranda said sounding a little testy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it does, I'm a very caring and understanding person, you can tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really up to Beth, is it okay if I tell him?\" Miranda asked Beth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth looked at you blankly for a while before she shook her head. \"It's fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess I should just get right into it. A few years ago...Beth was engaged, but before she and her fiance got married...he was shot and killed in a mugging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! Th-that's horrible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, since then she hasn't talked very much, but a few months ago she started to open up, then your father died. The only man she's gotten close to since her fiance died and then she almost completely stopped talking, again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that...I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay...she may not talk much, but that doesn't keep her from having fun every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I know how it feels to lose someone you love, too, and I'm not talking about my father. You see...I was going to be engaged once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth's eyes widened. \"You were...what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, don't tell Nicole, I don't know how she'll react if she heard any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded her head. \"I understand, we'll-well, I'll, keep it quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. It's a long story, so I'll keep it short. I used to be in love with a girl that I grew up with, well, I still do love her but...anyways. We had been dating since we were sixteen I think. We dated until I was twenty, which is when I finally worked up the nerve to ask her to marry me. I went out and bought the most expensive ring I could , but before I could give it to her she...she died in a house fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's terrible! I'm so sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's okay,\" You said forcing a smile. \"Sure I miss her, more than anything else, but I've come to terms with her passing, even though she was so young. Though sometimes I stop to think about her and get a little sad that she's gone, but I tough it out because I know she wouldn't want me to stay sad. You know, my date with Nicole was the first time I had a date when I didn't feel sad after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must really like her then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, she's a great-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sentence was cut short when Beth hugged you out of nowhere. She wrapped her arms around you, held you tight and buried her head in your chest. \"Sorry...I'm so sorry.\" As she held you close with her head in your chest, you could feel tears hitting your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...there, there,\" You said as you awkwardly hugged Beth back. \"It's-uh...okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, Beth,\" Miranda cooed before placing a hand on Beth's back. \"Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth then broke away from your awkward hug and switched to Miranda and did the same to her as to you. She wrapped her arms around tight Miranda and buried her head in her chest. When Beth finally calmed down you offered her to talk to you any time she needed to. Miranda then examined you one more time and when she was done, she told you that you would be fine and that you could leave if you wanted to. \"Are you sure that you don't need any help picking the vegetables?\" You asked, making sure you weren't needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me and Beth should be able to handle it. You go have fun with Nicole, but not too much fun!\" Miranda warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't planing on doing the thing you were probably thinking but, okay.\" You said before starting to walk out of the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you hurt yourself again I'm not going to help you, well, it's my job to so I will, but I won't be happy about it!\" Miranda yelled just before you re-entered the house. You walked through the house...but where are you going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo see Nicole of course, you're not going to let anything rain on your parade...or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to see Nicole...and not the other thing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With all her work done for the day, Nicole was in her room with Gracie, waiting for you to show up for 'snack time'. Nicole, for the first time in two nights, had changed into her pajamas. Her bottoms were pink just like her top (the same goes for probably everything else she owned), but the top had a dog's black paw print. It was an older pair and was tight on her, but Gracie had convinced her to wear it. Her stomach made her top ride up on it and couldn't keep the last two inches of it her stomach covered. Her breast stretched out the neck hole and left a little more of her breast on view than it should have and it even stretched out the paw print a little bit. While her bottoms were stretched tight across her expanded thighs, rear, and dug into her hips, giving her a slight muffin-top. \"I'm not to sure about this Gracie. This is all really tight,\" Nicole said while trying to pull her top just a little bit lower. \"Are you sure he's going to like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie sat down next to Nicole on her bed and then scouted closer to her. \"I know I do.\" She said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm changing.\" Nicole said plainly as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie reached for Nicole's arm and pulled her back down onto her bed. \"No don't, I'm sorry, I'm just trying to be supportive, but I'll shut up...but you can trust me, he'll love it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I'm feeling...big, I think I'm gonna change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you look great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the-one-two-three-four-Fourth time, you look great! Feel better now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little bit...so you're su-\" Nicole stopped when she got the death-glare from Gracie. \"Sorry...I'm just nervous...I-I've never dressed this way for a boy before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, have you dressed this way for a Girl before?\" Gracie asked with a raised eyebrow and a suggestive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-NO! Th-That's not what I meant! I just meant that I...I mean I...I didn't...NO!\" Nicole managed to stammer out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If not, then why are you getting so defensive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I...I'm not...I don't...my tummy hurts.\" Nicole pouted before clutching her 'tummy' in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie gave Nicole a pout. \"Aww, sooo-cute! Alwight, iwf I makin' you tummy huwt I stop.\" Gracie said with a puppy dog face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it! This whole situation is making me feel...not good...I think I should change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go again, for the fifth and final time. You. Look. Fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I just really, Really, want to impress Norman...but, I...I feel to big for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my-what did I just say! Nicole, just because you a little on the heavy side, doesn't mean you can't be attractive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying that...I know there's at least one plus side.\" Nicole said before poking a finger into one of her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie let a few short giggles before stopping herself. \"I think you're over looking a...Bigger, more, southern, plus side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't...Oh! W-What's so good about a big belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie quietly muttered something to herself before saying something more...understandable. \"Behind that, Nicole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" Nicole asked before turning her head in a cute attempt to see behind herself. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Nicole! Okay, let's try this. Just fill in the blank. I like big-blanks-and I can not lie. Get it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, I love you but, sometimes you can be a little slow, so I'm just going going to say it. You've got a big butt Nicole!\" Gracie said very bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gracie! That's so rude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No princess, it's a complement!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is? G-Guy's like girl's w-with big...butt's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, how long has it been since you've seen the world above that rock?\" Gracie asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What rock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Along time then, huh. Anyways, yes some guy's do like a girl with a big...rear-end, as you're probably more used to hearing. Oh, and some girl's like 'em, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think I want to change now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if on cue, you entered. \"Hello! Sorry I took so long, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce seeing you Gracie lounged at you and grabbed you tight. \"I'm so happy to see you! Please take me away from this horribly repetitive conversation, anywhere, I don't care...but preferably somewhere with a bed...or couch...or anywhere we can lay down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Gracie,\" You said plainly, trying to pry the clingy girl off of you and once you did, you turned your gaze from Gracie to Nicole, but once you saw her your cheeks went red and you turned your head away. \"Oh...I didn't realize you were changing, Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I'm not.\" Nicole said feeling really confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your head back to Nicole and looked her over again. 'Sorry, I don't know what I was thinking.' You thought to yourself. \"Well, I was only looking at one spot,\" You said aloud. \"Stupid, said the out loud thing in my head and the in my head thing out loud...that one was supposed to be in my head, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you he'd like it!\" Gracie joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you're such a pervert!\" Sophie said as she came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes widened. \"S-Sophie! What are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, this is why I took so long-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't trust this guy with you, especially since you two are...dating now, but it looks like I didn't have to worry about you two being alone, do I Gracie? Hey, should I invite everyone else, since it's such a big party in here?\" Sophie asked sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is becoming less and less what I wanted it to be.\" Nicole said glumly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look on the bright side, Nicole.\" Gracie said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That three-way just became a foursome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I want to leave my room now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a awkward silence until you decided to break it. \"So...I-uh, went into the kitchen and grabbed enough snacks for me, you and Sophie,\" You said looking at Nicole. \"But now that Gracie is here I don't think there's enough, so she can have mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you sure? You didn't have anything last time, either.\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't,\" Gracie asked, faking a surprised tone. \"That's just another nail in you F.A. coffin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F.A? What the heck is a F.A.?\" Sophie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Gracie, please explain that phrase that no-one else here knows but you?\" You asked with a smug tone that only Gracie picked up on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Never-mind.\" Gracie said with a role of her eyes. 'Damn, first Miranda and now Norman...I'm losing my edge!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile came to your face as you let a short chuckle out. \"Alright then, this is for you, Nicole.\" You said before handing a brown paper bag to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened the bag and looked inside. \"Cookie's!\" She squealed happily, but before she took a bite out of one she looked to Gracie, who nodded her head, and then she took a bite out of a cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Sophie, I noticed that this is your favorite and while it's not breakfast, well, here.\" You said before passing a plastic container to Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie took the lid off of the container as she sat down on the floor and when she saw what was inside her face lit up. \"French-toast! Thank you s-Er...thanks...\" Though excited at first, her tone changed when she remembered who she was talking to, then perked up again when she took her first bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for Gracie...\" You said before tossing Gracie her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie caught her snack, looked at it and then stared at you blankly. \"An apple...Nicole gets cookies, Sophie gets French-toast...and you were going to have a apple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like apples, but if you don't I can always go get you something different.\" You offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be fine, thanks.\" Gracie said, motioning the apple at you and then taking a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Nicole who was happily nibbling on her first cookie and Gracie sitting next to her, taking what could only be described as 'angry', bites out of of her apple. Nicole's bed wasn't as big as yours (not that hers was small yours was just much bigger) and there was only enough room for two the way they were sitting, and while you wanted to sit with Nicole, you didn't want to listen to any ideas that Gracie might have for tuning it into a three person space. So you just opted for sitting next to Sophie on the floor, but when you did Sophie gave you a look and then scouted away from you, not even bothering to stop munching on her French-toast. You tried to make her feel more comfortable by giving her a smile, but that only made a confused look come to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What the hell?! Why are you smiling at me? Your girlfriend is right there, smile at her,' As if her thought's had 'somewhat', affected your actions, you then looked at Nicole, then you smile faded away. 'That's...a little better I guess...but why did you stop smiling? Man, you're acting extra weird tonight, aren't you?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then muttered something under your breath, so quietly only someone close to you could hear, which Sophie was. You closed your eyes and pushed yourself off of the floor. \"I'm sorry.\" You said before walking Nicole's bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Norman, where are you going?\" Nicole asked worryingly when you reached the door. You looked back at her but didn't say anything, then you just left.</span></div></div>",

When Ruby learned that you were held up in your room, they had no choice but to tell her who you were and she didn't take it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly opened the door barely enough for you to see out. \"I'm sorry...but I just want to alone...please.\" You then tried to close the door but Sophie used her hand to keep it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!

What happened to him now?\" Miranda asked as she and Beth came down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing yet, but I'll tell you what's going to happen to him if HE HURTS NICOLE!!!\" Sophie yelled yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda blinked a few times before speaking again. \"...So it's not what's wrong with him it's what he did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, me, Norman, Nicole and Gracie were having a fine time in Nicole's room-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda laughed. \u201cDid you have fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...When out of nowhere he looked at Nicole, frowned, said a girls name and left!\" Sophie said after Miranda made her suggestive outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sighed and turned to Beth. \"You don't think he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth nodded her head. \"Yeah...poor Norman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two talking about?\" Sophie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda started to fish around in the pockets of her doctors coat and eventually pulled out nines stethoscopes. \"Why don't we all find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Nicole, not saying a word, only taking the occasional deep breath. \"M-Mr. Norman, I'm so sorry, just tell me what I did wrong and I'll never do it again,\" Nicole looked at you expecting a response, but was met with silence. \"Was I eating too much? I know I've been eating a lot and that I've gained a lot of weight, but I can eat less and I can lose weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, isn't it...okay, I'll stop eating, I'll work out, I'll do what even it takes for you to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" Nicole's eyes widened, you had finally said something after being so awkwardly silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What...Oh! D-Do you want me to stop eating? ...Oka-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't take this anymore.\" You said as you stood on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong,\" Nicole asked worryingly. \"Please tell me...you're scaring me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and started to laugh, which given the situation, was a little...disturbing, to Nicole. \"I'm sorry, I'm doing it again! It's just, you have to be, the sweetest girl in the whole world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though you've done nothing wrong, even though you've been the most perfect girl, you'd still change yourself, just to make me happy. I don't deserve you in the slightest way! You should never think that how much you weigh, or how big you are, will ever affect how I feel about you! I told you before I don't have a size preference in women, b-but...uh, e-even if I did, that would never make me love you less, or make me want to lose weight for me, I'd be the one who would need to change, not you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mr. Norman, you...you...I...I'M SO SORRY!\" Nicole said as she broke down crying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, don't start crying again,\" You begged as you sat back down pulled Nicole into a hug. \"It's not you fault, it's mine, I really need to think more before I act, because every time I don't, I end up hurting you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole genitally pushed herself away from you. \"S-So...if...if I didn't make you upset...what did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want to tell this, I didn't want to upset you, but I made you so sad by keeping you in the dark. So I'll tell you...\" You then told Nicole what you did Miranda and Beth, only instead of making it the short version, you told the long one instead. \"...Which is why, when I looked at you and thought of how happy you make me, just by being in the same room as you...I couldn't help but think of her and I didn't want to get so emotional over her in front of you, so I left, but if I knew what it would do to you I wouldn't have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Norman...I can't even begin to say how sorry I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I am, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So...if you, I mean...if...never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You can ask or tell me anything, you don't need to be shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...promise you wont get mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, now what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I feel really bad for even wondering this but, if she was...still alive and you had to pick, between me or her, w-which of us would you choose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, I can't blame you for wondering that. I've actually been asked that before, but the answer is always the same, her-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...I understand, if I were you I'd-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, with you, I'd probably die trying to find a way to have you both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I think I'd be willing to share.\" Nicole said as she laid down on your bed. After what Nicole said, there was a loud thud and the someone yelled Gracie's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't...know.\" Nicole said while she got comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you about to fall asleep,\" Nothing. You smiled, got up, covered Nicole with a blanket and walked out of your room. \"She really likes my bed...wait, what are you all looking at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen no-one said anything you looked at Miranda who then started to whistle \"What did you say?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Miranda said as she pulled one of the stethoscopes. \"It's more like what you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...One, why do you keep such weird stuff in your pockets, and two, you spied on me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...we kinda all did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm guessing that when Gracie heard Nicole say she'd be willing to share...wait, where is Gracie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-She punched the wall...so Jennifer took her downstairs to ice her hand.\" Replied Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what that noise was. ...So...you heard...everything, I said?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...we're all...sorry, I guess.\" Ruby said with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but don't get used to this sympathy! Just because you lost someone doesn't change how we feel about you!\" Sophie added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...don't talk like that.\" Beth asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's fine, they don't have to like me if they don't want to, but that's not going to stop me from being nice to either of you!\" You said giving them both a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, creep. Anyways, now that this whole thing has been sorted out we need you to start on some paperwork to do in the morning, we need to sort out the rest of the will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norman...are you sure you're going to be okay?\" Beth asked, speaking the most words you have ever heard her say at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like I said, sometimes I get sad, but I tough it out. Anyway, I should find somewhere to sleep-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? You've got a big bed in your room?\" Miranda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Because...Nicole's sleeping there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, from what you've told me you've done it before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's one thing to do it by accident, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'm sure she'd be happy to wake up next to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, she is under the blanket, I could sleep on top of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and go to bed already!\" Sophie yelled before pushing you back into your room and closing the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Nicole laying down in your bed. Before you left she was spread out across most of the bed, but now she was laying on just one side. You then changed out of your day-clothes (making sure that Nicole's eyes were still shut while you did) and into your night-clothes. Once you were changed you laid down next to Nicole and when you did Nicole's eyes opened shortly before closing again. \"My Norman.\" She said before wrapping her arm around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning you wake up, but is it on your own or dose Nicole wake you up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up on your own to see that Nicole isn't in bed any more, so you go to look for her and when you do, she has just hung up her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wakes you up with a kiss and tells you Ilene and Kelly made you both a couples breakfast, but you get her to eat most of it.</span></div></div>",

She had changed out of her pajamas and into her maids uniform and was just about to leave her room when she remembered something. 'It's been a few day's since I've checked my messages, I wonder if I've got any new ones?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened up a drawer, pulled out her phone and started to check her messages. \"Let's see...oh there's a whole bunch! Lets see, one from Abbey, three from Alex...*Sigh*, twenty seven from Gracie, two from Kim, one from Nick, two from Rebe-wait, Nick,\" Nicole checked the message which told Nicole to call him as soon as she could. \"...Nick? Um, hey, you said you had something to tell me? ...You got transferred...only thirty minutes away? Th-That's great! I can see you all the time now, when can I come visit you? ...Y-You're coming here?! W-When...t-ten days?! ...W-What do you mean? Of course I'm excited! Th-That should give me just enough time to get ready for you...what kid? Oh you mean Mr. Norman? H-He's really nice I...yes he's a guy...you didn't mind when I worked for his father...what's that supposed to mean? You think I'm some girl who's going to sleep with any young guy who waves a bunch of money in my face? ...No, I'm sorry, but you need to trust me more...okay, I'll see you soon...I love you, too, bye.\" Nicole hung up her phone and let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock, knock, knock.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole? Are you in there?\" You asked from the outside Nicole's bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEP,\" Nicole fumbled with her phone before shoving it back in the drawer. \"Um, y-yeah, come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened the door and came in. \"Hey, where did you go? I woke and you weren't there, I got a little worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I um, couldn't sleep so I, uh, got up early...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Nicole? You look like you've got something on your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, uh...no, I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but if that changes tell me and I'll do whatever I can to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay...h-how about we get some breakfast, it will be our first one as a couple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great, but every meal is only going to get better with the more time we spend together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're so sweet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, that was pretty corny-\" *growl* \"...D-Did I just make you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's cheeks went red. \"I-I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's fine, I think it was actually pretty cute,\" You said smiling. \"Well...more than cute actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh-never-mind. How about we go and get something in your big hungry belly?\" You asked before putting your hand on Nicole's stomach and pressed on it lightly. 'I hope I'm not coming on too strong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's blush went an even deeper shade of red at you touch and you could feel her trying to suck her stomach in. \"I'm sorry...um, maybe I shouldn't eat anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, that's unhealthy. You'll only end up eating more later. If you really think you need to...lose weight, you should just try to have something healthy...\" You regretfully suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, y-yeah, I think I'll do that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...alright...if that's what you want...\" You said feeling a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole began to nervously play with a lock of her hair, pulling at it hand over hand. \"M-Mr. Norman...what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I want you to drop that Mr. thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You know that's not what I meant...do you really not care whether or not I lose weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*, I guess I would be pretty disappointed...but you do whatever you want, I'll be the one who changes, not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's okay...it's not a big deal, you want it and I need to do it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Wait, do you mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't have to help, but um, if you do you could see me in some really s...work out clothes. You don't need to worry, I'll-uh, be tiny for you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole...I think you misunderstood me. I didn't mean I would be disappointed if you Didn't lose weight...but if you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-You...l-like me...fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't call you fat...just a little chubby, but that's beside the point. I really don't have a size preference in women...but I do tend to lean more towards...*eh-hm*, bigger women...well, maybe more than lean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So...you do think I look good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, no, better than good, beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really, you think I'm beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't the first word that came to mind but yeah, beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I really don't know what to think...do you um, what me to get even...bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no,  I'll love you at any size...but...I can't say I would be upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't...this is just so weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's what I want to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! N-No I didn't mean y-you I...\" Nicole lowered her head and her eyes started to water. \"...I just don't know what to say or do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to do anything...like I said, I'll change myself for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to do that...and I want to make you happy no matter what it takes but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're this unsure then you don't need to do anything for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am sure...I want to make you happy anyway I can...but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole tells you that the reason she's so conflicted is because of the man she just talked to on the phone, but dose she do it now, or just before he arrives?</span></div></div>",

You smiled to yourself and placed a hand on her shoulder and gently started to shake her awake. \"Hey, wake up. I hate to do this but you aren't going to sleep well tonight if you nap all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? I feel asleep? I just sat down to to take a rest. I guess I was really tiered...\" Nicole said while she slowly sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd think so, you've been running yourself ragged for a week and a half!\" You said before sitting down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes widened. \"Th-That's right! I need to get back to work!\" Nicole tried to get up but you genitally pulled her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I asked Jennifer and Sophie if you could take the day off to rest and they said it was fine...more or less... So just sit back and relax so you can get some of your energy back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, um, have plenty of energy! I just needed to take a quick rest and I um,  fell asleep, t-that's all! N-Now let me up, I-I've got to get back to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, are you okay? You've been acting strange even since I...you know...I told you what I thought of your weight...is that's what's been bothering you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! I told you I'd do this for you, I've already gained five pounds! Um...I know it's not much though, but I've really been trying and to tell you the truth...\" Nicole looked down. She put her hand on her stomach and started rubbing it lovingly through her maids uniform. \"...I actually kind of like it...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were getting a little softer,\" You said before placing a hand on her shoulder. \"And I'm happy to here that you like it, but if it's not that then what is it? You've really been worrying me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have? I...I didn't mean to. I just, um, didn't want to tell you yet, but I guess today has to be the day that I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? You know you can tell me anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm, which is why I feel so bad. Um...uh...okay, t-the morning after our first date...just before you came into my room...I was talking to someone on my phone that um, I didn't want you to know about for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Who was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Nick and...and he's coming to visit today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, okay, I don't see why you were so worked up over a friend coming to visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...he's not just a friend...he's...my...my b...b...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you...trying to say boyfriend?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?! N-No, I would never have two boyfriends at once! I um, was trying to say...brother...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Heheh, is that all? I thought it was something serious.\" You said smiling, taking Nicole in you arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pushed herself away. \"It is though! He's um, never liked the idea of me being around guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long did you work for my father?\" You asked with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't mind that...he didn't think I would go for some one so much older than me...but you're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Younger, right. Well,\" You took Nicole's hand and squeezed it. \"We both love each other a lot, I think he'll be happy when he sees how happy we make each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...about that, I-uh, didn't exactly tell him about us yet...I'm so sorry...are you mad at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let go of Nicole's hand and let it fall to her side. \"...*Sigh*, I could never get mad at you, but I am mad at myself for not being able to make you think that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes started to water up as she wrapped her arms around you and pulled you into her soft body and you hugged her back. \"I'm so sorry! You are the greatest man I've ever met! I don't deserve you! You've been so kind and gentle with me. When ever you hold me I feel so safe and confident. I think that you're the most attractive man I've ever been with and you make me feel so much more beautiful than I know I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed away from Nicole but kept one arm around her waist. You started to move locks of her white hair out of her face as well as wipe the tears away from pale skin with your other hand and then smiled. \"You are the most beautiful woman I have been with in so long. I can't understand why you can't see that for yourself and while I've tried to convince you of that with words, I think I'll just have to show you how attractive you really are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you, but first, I have a few questions. What would be the most soundproof room in the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...the bedrooms, the music room or the house doctors office. The house doctors office for doctor patient confidentiality, the music room so that no sound can interrupt anyone inside or out of the room and the bedrooms because, um, you know,\" Nicole's cheeks went red. \"They're bedrooms, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm, and which of these rooms is your favorite, the music room, the house doctors office, your room or my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I guess your room...because you're usually there...w-why?\" Nicole asked as her cheeks went an even deeper shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last one and the I'll tell you. When is your brother supposed to get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...not until five...why do you want to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about one...we should have enough time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Time for wha-oh...oh! M-Mr. Norman, do you think we sho-EEP!\" Nicole squealed when you took her hand and led her to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole rolled over and wrapped her arm around you. She pulled you close and you sank into her while she buried her head in you chest. \"I take it you enjoyed yourself,\" Nicole pulled her head out of your chest and nodded. \"Do you know you're beautiful now?\" Nicole nodded her head a second time only much faster, which made you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sat up in your bed and pulled the blankets over her bare chest. \"Um...Norman,\" You were happy about her not calling you Mr. Norman, but unsettled by the concern in her voice. \"That night, when we had our first date, um, just before you came in my room, Gracie and I were talking-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Um, about my size and um...she said that some guys like girls with...um...bigger rears...and I was wondering...do you? Because at first I didn't believe her, but after that...performance, I'm not too sure.\" Nicole said as her cheeks went red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my least favorite part of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You have a least favorite part of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I love every little thing about you! Just...maybe that a little more?\" You said, moving your hand over her love handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole laughed as she put her hand over yours and squeezed it. \"I always though they named these to be ironic, but again, after that performance,\" She said, giving you a shy smile and when she looked in your eyes her smile grew wider. \"I love you so much, you are the most beautiful person I've ever met...and you showed me how beautiful I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used the arm you still had wrapped around Nicole to bring he closer to you. \"Sounds like you're talking to a mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole wrapped her arms around you and pulled you back into her naked form. \"You're so sweet, I never want either of us to ever move from this spot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we never move for this spot then we'll never be able to do that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay, maybe for s-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your brother would probably walk in on us cudgeling...naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd eventually get hungry and need to use the bathro-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you just enjoy the sentiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, hey, can you see what time it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um...it is-oh no, it's four! My brothers going to be here in an hour! I've got to get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Only four?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to shower, get dressed, redo my makeup, untangle my hair. We should Really clean up in here and you've got to shower and get dressed, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't say it, don't say it, DO NOT SAY IT!!!' \"Maybe it would be faster if we shower together?\" 'Why do I bother?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if you really think it will speed things up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...I'm going to forgive myself just this once.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only ten minutes before five when Nicole was finally finishing getting you dressed. \"Almost got it.\" She said while tying your tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe you got me into this...I hate suit's\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry you don't like it, but I'm really happy you're doing this for me. I just want you to make a good impression, if he likes you it'll be easier for me to tell him about us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were going to tell him no matter what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am! I'll tell him before he leaves...I just want him to like you...I really don't want to lose you, I don't think my heart could take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll never do anything to hurt you...but wouldn't it be easier if you told him right away? It'd give him more time to like me...and we wont have to go around telling everyone to pretend we aren't together, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Y-Yeah...um, that would save time...if I didn't already...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay...I'm a little hurt but, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole lowered her head. \"I'm sorry, I really do hate lying...and it's not anything to do with you, really! I just thought this would be easier for me...I know being selfish...but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou placed a finger over Nicole's lip's to silence her. \"Don't be upset, I understand. You do what ever it takes for you feel comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...I think I'll just,</span></div></div>",

Like almost every one else, they had changed into a dress for the occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Gracie? Are you cold? Are you sick?\" Alex asked worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm fine. Just felt like I had to sneeze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex smiled. \"Oh, maybe someone is talking about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile of her own crept onto Gracie's face, but it was much more...something, than Alex's. \"Ooo, I hope it's Nicole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Sigh*, d-don't you think you stop thinking like that? I mean, s-she is with Mr. Norman now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess you're right...normally, but tonight, as far as anyone's concerned, she's single and fair game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-maybe you should stop obsessing over Nicole, Gracie, and start trying to find another girl...o-or guy...or both...or what ever a Gracie is into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie stared at Alex blankly before her sly smile came back to her face. \"...Are you trying to suggest something, Alex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's cheeks went deep red. \"W-What? No, I'm j-just trying to say that...maybe you'd be happier if you were in a...actual r-relationship?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you trying to suggest something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just drop it Gracie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock, knock, knock.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that must be Nick, you get the door, and I\u2019ll go get Nicole!\" Gracie shouted excitedly as she took off running up the main staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex let out a sigh as she straightened out her green dress and opened the front door. \"Hello Nick, it's n-nice to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see you, too. How have you been?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I\u2019m fine, thank you. Why don't you come in, Gracie just went to get Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie hummed to herself as she walked through the hall to Nicole's room. 'So long as I do it in front of Nick, Norman can't say anything about me flirting with Nicole! Heheh, this is gonna to be so-' every thought in Gracie's mind ended abruptly when she opened Nicole's bedroom door. The only thing that Gracie heard was the sound her world shattering. \"You...you two had sex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep red blush came to your face as you finished pulling up the zipper to Nicole's new dress. \"No no, we didn't have sex, I...I was just...h-helping Nicole with her zipper, she was fully clothed when she asked!\" You lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't lie to me about this! I can see it Nicole's eyes! You two had sex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...Good bye dumb luck, you will be missed.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Gracie...you of all people should know what happens, uh, when two people love each other very much...\" Nicole tried to explain, an intense blush coming to her face as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Fine, but call me next time! We could all have some real fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moved form behind Nicole to in front of her and looked at her. \"Nicole? What do you think? Yes? No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I thought,\" You turned from Nicole and to Gracie. \"NO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracie shrugged her shoulders. \"Fine, maybe Alex will be more cooperative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Leave Alex alone Gracie...she, uh...doesn't handle being teased well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw~, Nicowe, is you jelwous?\" Gracie asked in her cutesy but still suggestive tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes widened and she started acting more nervous than normal, so you stepped in to save her. \"Come on Gracie, leave her alone! You know stuff like this upsets her. She's so uncomfortable with the thought that she can't even dispute it,\" Nicole stayed quiet but still nodded her head up and down quickly to show she agreed. \"Now let\u2019s just go down stairs and wait for Nick to get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH! ...Yeah, about that...he's already here...whoops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Ugh.\" You moaned as you put a hand on the side of your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Norman? Are you okay?\" Nicole asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, why wouldn't it be? I've just got a little headache is all...anyways, lets get downstairs before Nick comes up here and sees us, he might figure out we're together!\" You moved your hand away from the side of your head and moved toward the door, but Nicole stopped you by grabbing you hand with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around and saw the same worry that filled Nicole's voice was also in her eyes. \"Um, but...we decided that we were just going to tell him. It wouldn't matter if he saw us together...\" Nicole paused as she squeezed you hand harder. \"...Are you sure you're okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why wouldn't I be?\" You asked with a confused look on you face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap! I broke him...cool!\" Gracie smiled before leaving Nicole's room with the same happy stride as when she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you two are talking about, I'm perfectly fine. I've just got a little stomachache.\" Just as you finished talking Nicole let go of your arm and you left her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole shook her head and then hurried after you. 'I thought he said it was a headache?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you and Nicole reached the bottom of the stairs you saw Alex, Gracie and Miranda standing around the man you assumed to be Nick, while Beth sat quietly on the other side of the foyer in a silver dress. \"Wait, it\u2019s silver? I thought she would have worn something with more of an earthy-wait! Beth is in a dress...Huh.' You thought as you and Nicole walked over to the others. If the man really was Nick, he looked nothing like Nicole. Set aside the fact he had pigment, (his hair was black, eyes brown and skin tan) they shared none of the same facial features and they didn't look to be the same height, in fact, if you weren't told that they were related, you would never have guessed it. Nick was wearing a pair of black jeans and a white t-shirt...while every one else was dressed up. 'Okay, so Nicole makes me wear a suit, but her brother doesn't have to wear anything special at all...lucky.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked over to them, Miranda saw you and smiled. \"Speaking of him, here comes the walking injury now,\" She laughed before looking you up and down. \"Well don't you look nice?\" Miranda joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey at least I tried,\" You motioned towards Miranda's dress, which was really just her doctor\u2019s coat but buttoned all that way up. \"Didn't you have a real dress in those bottomless pockets of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*Eh-hmm*, while those two do...what ever it is they're doing, why don't you give your brother a hug?\" Nick asked with his arms outstretched, while you and Miranda continued to argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled and wrapped her arms around her brother, embarrassing him in a short hug, braking away soon after. \"It's good to see you Nick, um, so how have been? I uh, haven't really talked to you in a week and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, most of that time I've just been packing and not much else. What about you, how have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I've been good, but-uh, there is something I really need to talk to you about,\" Nicole turned away from Nick and to you and Miranda, both of you still arguing. \"Um, Norman, could you stop um, fighting and-uh, introduce yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ended your argument with Miranda and turned to Nick and Nicole. \"Oh, I\u2019m sorry. My name is Norman; it's nice to meet you!\" You said, out stretching your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, nice to meet you, too.\" Nick said as he shook your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He seems nice enough. I have no idea what Nicole was so worried about!' You thought after you broke the handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Nicole said she needed to tell me something important, and apparently you're involved, so speak up! You didn't get her pregnant did you? Because if so you can just save me the trouble and go bury yourself.\" You felt like you should laugh, but after looking in Nick's eyes you realized he wasn't completely joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh...so <i>this</i> is what Nicole was worried about...ugh.' You thought as your heart started to race. \"No no, we haven't...she's not pregnant...\" Not telling someone something isn't the same as lying...right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick...um, I lied to you...the day I called you, I told you that nothing would happen between me and Norman...but-uh, something already did-\" Nick looked back at you with the same stare as only a few moments ago. \"-The day before I called, me and Norman had gone on our first date, and we have gone on several since then...I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked back at Nicole and frowned. \"Why are always apologizing for things that aren't your fault? It's ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm s-Err...I don't know...I just feel like I need to sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this isn't one of those times. I'm sure you've made a good choice this time. Now, I assume that since every one is dressed up that I should expect a fancy meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, too bad Kelly made most of it.\" Ilene said as she entered the room, with Kelly close behind. Just like Miranda, Kelly and Ilene had not dressed up, and simply wore their chef\u2019s uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked straight at Miranda. \"After 'The France Night' incident I had to make sure that Ilene didn't go too far with the foreign foods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda laughed awkwardly at the angry stare she got from Kelly. \"Come on, did you actually think I was going to eat frog legs and snails? What did you think all that salt was for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of whose fault it was...*cough, cough*, Ilene, *cough*...we're all going to enjoy my cooking none the less, now lets all go get seated before things reach room temperature,\" Kelly said before turning towards the kitchen. \"And I wouldn't want to keep everyone else waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat unfortunate meal has been prepared for tonight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly and Ilene have prepared everyone their own meal, yours is a steak dish...prepared with red-wine...Nicole was wondering why you never drank on any of your dates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlene was sneaky and prepared one foreign dish called cuy...she said it was some kind of pork, but before you enter the dining room, Beth pulls you aside and asks if she can 'talk' about you and Nicole, and if you\u2019re happy with her.</span></div></div>",

Once standing in front of the door you set your bags down and then raised a hand to knock, but stopped before it hit the door. You bent over and began to examine your reflection in the doorknob, though it wasn't the most practical last minute mirror, since it did make you look distorted and gold, but all you wanted to do was check to see that your hair was straight and that you hadn't gone over-board on your make up. 'I hope I'm not being vain, I just really want to make a good first impression, after all I am going to be spending a lot of my time with these girls...why am I trying to justify what I'm doing to myself? I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it...I need to get out of my head more often...nope, still here.' You thought, still looking at your distorted reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stood there for a while making sure nothing about you would be off putting, but when the door suddenly opened you found yourself looking at a woman's very thin waist. You quickly straightened yourself out when you realized what you were looking at, but on it's way up, you felt head brushed against something. That 'something', was an unusually large pair of breast, that belonged to the woman, who was now blushing like mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry miss.\" You apologized as your face started to go red, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush began to fade from the woman's face as awkward smile replaced it. \"No, no, it's fine, that's not the first time...something, like that has has happened. *Eh-hm*, sorry, is there something I may help you with, miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, sorry, I'm Lisa-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour introduction was cut short when the woman bowed to you, her sudden movement causing her breast to bounce quite a bit. \"Forgive me mistress, I didn't recognize you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, how were you gonna recognize me in the first place, we've never met before. Uh, you don't have to do that any more.\" You said as your face started to go red from the...view, you were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry,\" The girl apologized before she stood straight again. \"So...you don't recognize me either? ...Well, that's okay, I guess I've changed just as much as you have since we've last spoke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but, you're going to have to be more clear than that if you want me to remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...well it wouldn't be as much fun if I just told you,\" The girl said before letting out a short giggle. \"How about this, \"Ms. Lisa, my mommy told me to wake you up!\", remember now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jennifer? Is that you?\" You asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-hm, it's been a long time, hasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can't tell you how bad I feel that we fell so out of touch, but it's so great to see you now!\" You said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's my fault, too...so, would you like to come in, mistress?\" Jennifer said before stepping aside to let you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head and picked up your bags. \"S-Sure, but stop calling me that, you never used to do it.\" You said before entering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anything you would like me to take up to your room?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No these are my only bags and I can handel them, I don't want to bother you with taking them to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? It is my job to take care of you, it always has been.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that was your mothers job, you were just too good of a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then how about I get you some tea, I just maid it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, if it's not too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing is to much trouble for you. I'll go get it, why don't you go sit down in the living room and when I get back we can do some catching up, do you still remember where that is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I'm just going to drop these of at my room first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you'll be staying in the master bed room now, don't worry we've moved your fathers stuff out and yours in.\" Jennifer said before leaving for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jennifer was gone you took your bags up to your old room and once putting them down you turned back around and turned back around and made your way to the living room. 'It's so good to see Jennifer again, she's really...developed, since I last saw her,' You thought as you sat down in the living room. 'She looks fantastic, she could really stand to gain some weight though, then she would look even-NO! I'm not going to think my friend that way, besides, she isn't like me...even if she did like girl's she wouldn't be like me, I told myself I wouldn't think about her that way but I still am!' Thankfully when Jennifer came into the room you were finally able to stop 'thinking like that'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, I hope it's good.\" Jennifer said as she handed you a cup and then sitting down next in the chair across from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, so...are you the only one here? Because I haven't seen anyone else.\" You said before taking a sip of your tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, every one else went out, I was supposed to go, too, but you were coming today so I stayed behind.\" Jennifer said before taking a sip from her own cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry I kept you from having fun with your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine really, I think I was going to stay behind anyway. I had some stuff I wanted to do and as much as I love them all it's good to have some time to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, what kind of stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been trying to finish this one book, which I was finally able to do. I also took a bath, I've been so busy lately I've only had time to take showers and it was so nice just to relax! Then I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Don't think about her taking a bath, don't think about her taking a bath! ...Damn it, or a shower that's worse!' You thought as Jennifer continued to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's when I opened the door to see you standing there.\" Jennifer said warping up the story of her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that reminds me, what was with that whole bowing thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father told us all to start doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a quick glance a Jennifer's chest, being careful not to look too long. \"Yeah, that seems like something he would do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how have you been lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, p-pretty good, nothing too exciting.\" You said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Hmm, do you have a boyfriend or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, I haven't had a boyfriend in a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, still trying to find mister right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, do you have your eye on a guy though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No...what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't, probably for a different reason than you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What does that mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jennifer?! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jennifer switched your attention from each other to the doorway where you saw,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Sophie. They stayed behind to get paper work ready for you and are now going to take you to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Nicole. Alex stayed behind because she wasn't feeling to well, so Nicole stayed to keep her company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth and Miranda. There's going to be a bad storm today and they stayed to get the plants covered or moved.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I've been reading a lot of different story's from all over that are kind of like this and I'm not sure from which one I got this idea from but let's face it almost none of my story's are original and the ones that are don't usually turn out any good and I end up getting rid of them, but no matter how this one turn out I'm going to keep it on, because I just like the idea to much to get rid of it. Since I don't like male gaining, and still what a choice for a girl I put a lesbian girl as a choice. So any ways in this story you have recintly come into a large amount of money and you have just bought a brand new mansion, but after a month it has become to hard for you to maintain by your self and so you hire some help to make things easier while you work, and letting your subconscious's \"pervy side\" show hire a full female staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can play as ether.<br>\r\nNorman.L, a nice, witty, smart, young man.
