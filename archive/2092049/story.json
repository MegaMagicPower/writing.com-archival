Sarah is the nice and calm leader of the group, Ashley is the loud and stupid one, Jenny is the witty and sarcastic one and Tara is the lazy one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so nervous for this job interview.\" Sarah said to her three roommates Ashley, Jenny and Tara as they each get ready for their day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not. This is gonna be a piece of cake.\" Jenny replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you I could've gotten jobs with me at McDonalds.\" Tara continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Tara. I'd rather be jobless than work among a group of high school dropouts and druggies.\" Jenny answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i dropped out of high school to pursue a modeling career.\" Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like that's turned out well for you.\" Tara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have to go to your minimum wage earning job now?\" Jenny asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I have a job.\" Tara said as she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we enjoy some breakfast at Caroline's before the interview to calm us down?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great idea! She makes the best crepes!\" Ashley answered as the three girls walked out of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Caroline's Diner five minutes later. \"Well if it isn't three of my favorite customers!?\" Caroline said as Sarah, Ashley and Jenny walked into the diner. The delectable scents of mouth watering treats hypnotized the girls as they stuffed their faces with crepes before their big interview. \"You can never go wrong with one of Caroline's meals.\" Ashley said, rubbing her slim but bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, now we just have to not be tempted by the bakery treats.\" Sarah giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only way we'd be tempted is if we were Caroline's size.\" Jenny replied as the three girls laughed on the way to Sarah's sedan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie's Cakery was a relatively new bakery in New York. Only opened for a month, for now, the owner of the shop, Katie, is a recently graduated college student who's dream it was to have a successful bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you must be the interested employees.\" Katie said as Ashley, Sarah and Jenny walked into the small shop. The aroma of fresh bread and chocolate filled the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's us. We'd really like to work at your shop.\" Sarah nervously said as Katie offered the three girls chocolate chip scones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax sweetie. You girls basically have the job already.\" Katie replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you for real?!\" They said in unison and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yea. Your the only three to apply.\" Katie laughed. \"Welcome to the Katie's Cakery Family!\" Katie cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay.\" Jenny sarcastically said as Ashley and Sarah high fived each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do now?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well I can get you your work schedules and uniforms now.  Let's celebrate over cookie cake. My treat!\" Katie said happily as she cut the four girls a treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Home:<br>\r\n\"Ugh never forgetting a toy in a happy meal again.\" Tara sighed to herself as she wiped the barbecue sauce and burger meat off of her dirty apron as Ashley, Sarah and Jenny excitedly walked through the door. \"How'd the interview go?\" Tara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like a said, a piece of cake.\" Jenny said, belching from her delicious piece of cookie cake. \"And how was your day of helping our country become more unhealthy than it already is?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awful. A kid started throwing a temper tantrum in the middle of the shop just because there were five McNuggets in his meal instead of six. Little fat son of a.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Tara! Just be happy we got the job! How about we celebrate with some takeout Chinese, on me.\" Sarah smiled as she pulled out her crumpled up $20 dollar bill from her pocket.  Suddenly, there was a knock at their door. It was Lily, their lazy and sloppy neighbor, clad in a pair of pink sweats and a loose fitting tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I overheard you guys got the job! Congrats!\" Lily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, we're celebrating with some sesame chicken if you'd like to stay.\" Katie offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan.\" Lily replied, waking in and sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today was a good day.\" Sarah thought to herself as her and her friends enjoyed their dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will the next episode be? You decide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the apartment stunk for a week\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, please!\" Sarah shoved herself between them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you just need to get laid, Jenny.\" Ashley snickered. \"You're looking a little stiff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could if I wanted to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saving yourself for marriage or something?\" The blonde laughed. \"Besides, even if you did want to, your boobs aren't big enough to get anyone's attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that you volunteering to pay for a boob job? I thought you only bought bl-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GIRLS!\" Sarah practically roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, alright, Mom, I'll be quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them made it to the Cakery and dumped their coats in their assigned lockers. In each, they found a blue t-shirt with the company logo on the back as well as an apron done in yellow, for maximum visibility. They found Katie in the kitchen, separating out a hunk of dough into cookie-shaped disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good to see you three here bright and early.\" The owner remarked and looked up from her dough. \"So which of you has the most experience baking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah immediately shot her hand up. \"I bake tons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does grass count?\" Ashley asked, which was promptly met with an elbow to the ribs from Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Sarah, you'll be here in back with me. Ashley and Jenny will run the front. We break for lunch in three hours, get cracking.\" Katie said with a clap of her hands and sent her workers off.</span></div></div>",

A few customers come everyday, but it's not this empty.\" Katie said worried as she snacked on some of the treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say business is booming right now.\" Jenny laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gals can have some of the treats if you want. There's a lot to spare.\" Katie said, grabbing a glazed lemon scone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Free dessert!\" Ashley said as she grabbed a few triple chocolate brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's alright?\" Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, she literally just said we could take treats. Why would it not be alright?\" Jenny said as she took some jelly sandwich cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea relax Sarah. Take as much as you want.\"  Katie said with her mouth full. \"As long as you don\"t eat the whole store.\" Katie continued, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt nervous at first, as she had a huge appetite when it came to desserts, and she didn't want to devour the supply, but that's exactly what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Sarah. Don't eat too much before lunch break. Maya's Tacos is right next door!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew you could eat that much!\" Ashley said laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah laughed too but she suddenly had a flashback. A 10 year old, much chubbier, Sarah sat at her kitchen tale where her thin mother  and her sat at the table for dinner. \"Sarah, finish your string beans now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom! I hate string beans!\" Sarah whined as she waddled up to her room. Sarah at this point was 4'8 and 100 pounds. She was quite plump for her age and usually wore elastic clothing such as sweats and leggings. Storming up the stairs, she wheezed from exhaustion as she finally reached her room, and opened her closet to reveal her secret stash. Boxes of donuts, cookies, candies, chocolates and much more stacked in the hidden corner of her closet. Sarah's stomach growled as she began to stuff her face with candies. There was no better feeling in the world. Nothing she enjoyed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah! Get out of your trance!\" Jenny said, snapping her fingers. \"We're going to Maya's Tacos's for lunch. You coming?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, sure.\" Sarah said as the four women temporarily closed up the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya's Tacos was a bustling business right across from the bakery. It was owned by Maya, a slightly chubby woman who had a passion for creating delicious Mexican cuisine. \"Katie, great to see you, chica!\" Maya said, hugging her friend. Maya was thin, but very curvaceous and had a slight jiggle to her body. Her breath wreaked of melted cheese and taco meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Maya. These are my newest employees, Sarah, Ashley and Jenny!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great to met you gals. For your first time here, I'll give you some deep fried tacos, on me.\" Maya said, seating the girls in a booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are great!\" Ashley said as she took a big bite out of her lunch, with taco grease dripping down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! This place is the best!\" Katie said, munching on her taco.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back at the shop, the girls resumed their day, when suddenly a customer came in.\"</span></div></div>",
