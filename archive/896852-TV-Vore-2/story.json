The army fought back valiantly, but against the seven monsters devouring everything in sight, they were helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The only good thing about this,* Tenchi thought, his rarely acknowledged perverted side showing itself, *is that the view is incredible.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monsters devouring the city were actually his friends, fattened up into immensity and grown to skyscraper size.  They were gloriously naked, and impossibly ravenous, devouring anything they found, no matter what it was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoko was the largest, her belly and breasts the biggest.  She was enjoying herself tremendously, grabbing soldiers off of the ground and stuffing them into her flabby maw, devouring and planes helicopters whole.  Whenever a nuclear missile was shot at her, it would simply imbed itself in her fat without detonating, and she would gobble them up eagerly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyeka was the second largest, although not for lack of trying.  Her butt was larger than everyone elses, although she was still incredibly fat all over her body.  She was currently getting a drink, her face lowered into the nearby ocean as she guzzled countless gallons of sea water.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashu was the third largest, and had the most balanced flabby figure of the seven.  She was currently, devouring a skyscraper, greedily chomping through the concrete and gulping it down, slurping up the people inside like candy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiyone was the fourth largest, having grown the most in her breasts, although like the others, she had a prominent belly and butt.  She was attacking the police station, devouring the building and shoving cops and cars into her ravenous maw.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihoshi was the fifth largest, and the calmest seeming of the seven gluttonous giantesses.  She was content to sit down and devour the contents of a gigantic food warehouse she had discovered while eating the financial district, adding more and more to her huge, soft mound of a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyo-Ohki, the sixth largest, who had before this had started had been spending more time in her adult humanoid form, was crawling along her titanic belly, devouring a train track and whatever trains that came along.  She was in her adult humanoid form, and seemed unable to change back due to how fat and huge she was.  She also didn't seem to care, as she was too hungry to think about anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasami was still the shortest and smallest of them of them all, although physically and emotionally she had matured to age 16 before becoming a fat giantess.  Her butt was larger than the rest of her tremendously bloated form, and she was currently resting it on the ruins of a mall as she devoured the people she had amusedly trapped between her flabby legs and belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenchi wondered briefly why they hadn't tried to devour he, his father, or grandfather yet.  Almost immediately after the thought entered his mind he kicked it out, not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth.  He wished Washu would get full soon.  It was rare and getting rarer, but they did get full and not have to eat for several hours.  It'd be good to have her try to figure this out.  He sighed, and decided to wait on top of the building for their rampage to end.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, a Juraian starcruiser, Royalty class, landed near him.  The imposing figure of the current Juraian king, Azusa, stormed out, along with his two wives, Funaho and Misaki.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, brat,\" Azusa said, showing his customary dislike of the boy, \"Why did you call... us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzusa, Misaki, and Funaho stared as the seven ravenous giantesses went about turning Tokyo into more fat for their beautiful bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Azusa said, chuckling and patting Tenchi on the shoulder, \"This explains it.  Good job, lad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenchi gave him an incredulous look.  \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisaki chuckled.  \"All seven?  My my, young man.  Well, at least it's certain I'll get grandchildren from both my daughters now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-haired beauty picked him up and gave him a rib-cracking hug.  Tenchi grunted, and gave Funaho a very confused look.  It was true that all seven of them were pregnant, but what did that have to do with them becoming gluttonous giantesses?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFunaho smiled at him warmly.  \"Suffice to say, Tenchi, this has happened to Misaki and I before.  We'll explain once the girls have eaten their fill for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenchi couldn't quite believe what he was hearing.  But he guessed he had no choice but to wait...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAyeka, after guzzling down several hundred gallons of ocean water, along with a couple whales and many, many ships, turned her attention to a nearby mall.  She pulled the top off of the central glass dome, chomping the girders down, and then reached inside, scooping up screaming, terrified people and stuffing them into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut after a few handfuls of people, she stopped, feeling a pressure in her belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe belched, and sighed in relief.  \u201cFull again at last\u2026 That hunger is maddening\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHi honey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka yelped, seeing a tiny, floating form nearby.  \u201cM-Mother?!\u201d she said, covering her fat breasts as best she could.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMisaki giggled.  \u201cOh, don\u2019t be embarassed, honey.  Mommy went through the same thing when she was carrying you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka blinked in surprise.  \u201cYou mean you became an overly gluttonous lardass like I am now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMisaki smirked.  \u201cNot how I\u2019d put it, but yes.  Now c\u2019mon.  You and Ryoko are the last ones.  Your father and Auntie Funaho are here to help explain what\u2019s going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka nodded, still confused, but wanting to know what was happening to her.  She hefted her tremendous bulk upright, using a forcefield to keep her tremendous ass from pulling her back down, and waddled after her mother.  Her flab jiggled with every step, the layers of fat-laden flesh on her legs piling around her feet with each step, her huge ass quivering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe eventually found the others, save for Ryoko, who was polishing off a giant skyscraper, sitting in a circle around the building Tenchi and the other Juraians had taken up residence on.  Mihoshi was cuddling up to Kiyone, resting her multi-chinned head on Kiyone\u2019s flabby breast, the emerald-haired former cop blushing softly and hugging Mihoshi\u2019s flabby body to her own.  Sasami and Ryo-Ohki were cuddling up together as well, Washu watching the four other flabby giantesses with amusement.  Ayeka sat down next to her.  After a moment, a loud, crass belch erupted from Ryoko.  Ayeka looked over at the former space pirate with irritation as she patted her stomach.  The immensely heavy woman waddled over to the others, caressing her tightly packed belly and chuckling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s up, then?\u201d she asked, looking curiously at Azusa, Funaho, and Misaki.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Azusa said, \u201cIt\u2019s simple, really.  Your hunger and subsequent growth all started once you discovered you were all pregnant, correct?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls all traded worried nods.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMisaki giggled.  \u201cUm, is it okay if I ask how ALL of you became pregnant?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi and the other girls looked pointedly at Washu, who blushed and sighed.  \u201cWell\u2026\u201d she said, \u201cRyoko and Ayeka were getting annoying in their constant fights over Tenchi, so I decided to make a libido enhancer.  It was meant to get the two of them to become so lustful for each other that they wouldn\u2019t be able to help making out whenever they were around each other.  But ah\u2026 in a rather unpleasant accident that for once didn\u2019t involve Mihoshi, it ended up in Tenchi.  Since it was meant to make the subject tremendously aroused around women, and since the seven of us are rather attractive women\u2026 We\u2026 well, we spent the next couple of weeks on our backs as Tenchi pumped every hole he could get his hands on full of cum, Tenchi not letting us get up\u2026 Apparently in males my libido enhancer has the side effect of improving sperm output substantially\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMisaki and Funaho began trading excited giggles, Azusa sweatdropping as he realized that the anniverseries of both his marriages were coming up and they were talking about borrowing the formula to use on him\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAzusa coughed, and said, \u201cWell\u2026 Before you ask the inevitable \u2018What does this have to do with us getting gluttonous and huge, I should point out that males of Juraian royalty have a \u2018unique\u2019 effect on women they get pregnant for the first time.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi blinked.  \u201cEffect?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAzusa sighed.  \u201cBecause of the tremendous power of Juraian royalty, the baby and/or requires a tremendous amount of physical and energy matter to gain that power, and as such alters the body of the mother accordingly to gain that power.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAyeka blinked.  \u201cSo\u2026 How long before we stop growing?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMisaki and Funaho traded looks.  Misaki said, \u201cDear, I\u2019m afraid that Earth and several galaxies around it are doomed.  Your bodies will keep getting larger and larger, consuming more and more.  Soon you\u2019ll be eating stars.  When your babies have enough energy, your bodies will revert back to normal, although you\u2019ll be incredibly fat.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls all traded alarmed looks.  Ayeka turned to her mother and asked, \u201cDid\u2026 Did you\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMisaki nodded.  \u201cMommy devoured several galaxies while she was pregnant with you, Little Ayeka.  Same with Funaho when she was pregnant with Yosho, and the same with Yosho\u2019s first human wife when he got her pregnant with Tenchi\u2019s mother.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi blinked.  \u201cDid my Mom\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAzusa shook his head.  \u201cAchika Kiyone Masaki was impregnated by a human, so she didn\u2019t have to be transported off-planet like Funaho and I.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTransported off-planet\u2026\u201d Kiyone said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAzusa nodded.  \u201cTradition has held that the wife of a Juraian royal is transported to a far-off uninhabitated part of the universe to eat until they are finished and ready to give birth.  After the bodies revert to their normal, albeit incredibly fat selves, surgeons take over and convert the fat to fuel while expertly removing the excess skin and burning it.  No scars left at all.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKiyone nodded.  \u201cSo we could be transported off planet?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAzusa sighed.  \u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019re all far too big to be transported now\u2026 Earth is doomed\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was an outcry from Tenchi and the others.  Azusa silenced them all with a glare, intimidating despite the fact that he was much smaller than the girls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a moment, Azusa said, \u201cIt can\u2019t be helped.  Fortunately, Earth is the only inhabited planet in this area of space and we\u2019re far enough from Juraian space that you won\u2019t have to be killed to save anyone.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKILLED?!\u201d Tenchi said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFunaho sighed.  \u201cIt\u2019s happened before.  An ancestor, a low-level duke, wasn\u2019t careful, and his wife nearly devoured several inhabited planets.  She had to be killed\u2026 She was about your sizes\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls traded nervous looks.  Those looks became even more nervous as their stomachs began to growl, their hunger returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAzusa sighed.  \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s nothing that can be done.  Once you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll all be taken to Jurai for the marriage ceremony.  Fortunately, the babies seem to recognize family and won\u2019t try to eat them, and we can create new planets and stars once you\u2019re all cleared out\u2026 How far along are you all?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi groaned.  \u201cAbout one month\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRyoko, unable to help herself, hefted her tremendous bulk to her feet and began to take bites out of a skyscraper.  Ayeka joined her soon after.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAzusa nodded as the other girls got up and began to eat again.  \u201cWe\u2019ll be back to evacuate your family and some of your friends,\u201d Azusa said, \u201cThe girls will be able to breath in space once they finish eating Earth\u2026\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTenchi nodded numbly, watching his seven apparent fianc\u00e9es devour Japan\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But their fate became drastically altered.  A bolt of blue lightning struck each of them, and they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n======================<br>\r\nA mysterious place...<br>\r\n======================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them reappeared, each one chained to a stone slab.  Their stomachs were bared, arcane writing on each one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina was the first to come to.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unnngh...  What hit me?\" Lina said.  She looked around, and saw nothing save her friend Gourry and her rival Naga strapped down to tables, darkness all around them in every direction.  She scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  Wake up!\" she snapped.  Gourry and Naga both winced at the familiar sound of Lina's voice, and slowly came too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lina?\" Gourry said, \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina sighed, and shook her head.  \"I was hoping you knew.  And what's SHE doing here?\" she said, gesturing with her head to Naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaga scowled.  \"I could ask you the same question, little girl.  I was collecting treasure from a band of vandals when a bolt of lightning struck me.  Since you're here too, I assume it wasn't from you,\" she said.  She smirked, then added, \"Although maaybe it was you, and you're a more inept sorceress than I already thought you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina snarled viciously.  \"I DIDN'T CAST WHATEVER IT WAS THAT BROUGHT US HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGourry shook his head.  \"Ladies, please, calm down.  There has to be an explination for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE IS,\" thundered a voice.  \"I HAVE BROUGHT YOU ALL HERE FOR REVENGE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them traded nervous looks.  \"Who are you, sir?\" Gourry said, looking around for the source of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM THE SERPENT GOD WHOSE SERVANTS YOU DESTROYED,\" the voice thundered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Servants of a serpent god?- Lina thought, confused, -Doesn't ring any bells...-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaga, however, remembered.  \"So you're the god those looneys were worshipping.  The Cult of F'an F'aran.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina and Gourry traded shocked looks, remembering.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INDEED.  I AM F'AN F'ARAN,\" the voice said, a pair of red, glowing eyes appearing above the group.  The three stared at him defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've faced down Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu and lived to exaggerate how easily we destroyed him.  What makes you think you'll fare any better than he did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nF'an chuckled.  \"BECAUSE UNLIKE THAT FOOL RUBY-EYE, I'M NOT GOING TO FIGHT YOU.  I HAVE SOMETHING MUCH WORSE IN MIND FOR YOU THREE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina, Naga, and Gourry all traded nervous looks.  Finally, Naga laughed her trademark laugh, noting with satisfaction the eyes wincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you scare us?  We've overcome everything thrown at us, and we'll overcome this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mouth appeared, a toothy, grinning mouth that made the three adventurers quiver with fear.  \"I RATHER DOUBT THAT.  BECAUSE WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS SIMPLY ENHANCE SOMETHING YOU THREE ALREADY HAVE TO UNIMAGINABLE PORTIONS, AND GRANT YOU AN ABILITY OF MINE.  THAT ABILITY IS THE ABILITY TO SWALLOW ANYTHING WHOLE AND DIGEST IT, AND WHAT I'M GOING TO ENHANCE IS YOUR HUNGER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue lightning struck the three chained down adventurers.  They screamed as the lightning flowed through their bodies, the curse taking effect as they were sent back.

The oldest of these was around 6' in height, with a HUGE mane of bluish hair, as well as two 'antennae' strands that the others did, had the least amount of fur around her ample breasts, the largest of the group, and her hips, a lithe, agile, muscular body, and a sweet, innocent face.  Her long tail lay curled up around her, twitching around slightly as she dreamed pleasant dreams, purring in her sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tail kept twitching wildly about, until finally it began to brush up against her nose.  And despite the fact that it was her own tail, and her own fur, the sensation of tickling was just too much for the poor lead catgirl, whose name was Felicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking herself awake, she frowned when she realized that her making love to Jon Talbain was nothing more than a dream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, nya.  I had best get some breakfast,\" she said, thinking out loud.  But there was a problem.  The alley beside this furniture store they were using as a nest was nice and comfy, but it was far away from anything that could be used as food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try catching some passerby and gulping them down, her jaws were stretchy enough (a trick she gained from Morrigan after she forced her into yet ANOTHER orgy).  But it was still pretty early.  The sun wasn't even up yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach growled irritatedly.  Felicia mewled, looking around, desperate for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And then her eyes fell on her still-sleeping comrades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to salivate, considering eating them.  It wouldn't be as if she was KILLING them.  The deranged Jedah had altered her and a few others during the war against him so that she could absorb the souls of anyone she consumed into her own.  So if she ate them, not only would she be keeping herself healthy, which she was sure the others would want, but she'd also make it so that they could be together forever, all inside of her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would be nice, right?  Her belly being filled and being with her loving friends forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia bit her lip, and her stomach growled again as she wrestled with this moral dilemma...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This younger catgirl has beautiful green hair, and a bit of a belly herself, not that that would stop her.<br>\r\nFelicia reaches out with her oversized pawhands and strokes the flicking ears moving about the green sea of hair before leaning in close to the calm, sleeping face and gaping her jaws impossibly wide.  The smaller catgirl barely stirs as Felicia slides hre sharp canines over her head, swiftly swallowing and pulling it into her bulging throat.<br>\r\nGiving a low croon of enjoyment at the lovely taste of fur and hair, the large catgirl sucks up her companion, a few more swallows pulling her pert breasts and chubby belly into her, her own neck and chest standing out with the mass.  She'd love to enjoy those more, but considering that she's got eight more meals to go, it's best to just eat this one quickly.  She hefts up the stirring catgirl and tosses her head back with a massive gulp, sliding her hips inside and leaving only her legs and cute tail out, which Felicia gladly slurps up wetly!  Once those large paws vanish between her lips, she settles down for a moment, her belly having swollen out to near her own mass!  It's a massive, round globe, and she purrs as she strokes it over, muffling a loud belch between her paws.  One down, and a lot more to go....</span></div></div>",

The youngest of the remaining eight, Piko and Nana, twin sisters with magenta hair, lay curled up in a barcalounger.  Lucy, the tallest and most muscular of the group, with long, firey red hair bound in a ponytail, had decided to rest on a large bed.  Sleeping next to her was a slender young catgirl with short, auburn hair, shorter than Felicia by a head, named Grace.  Cuddling up on a sofa were three other girls, all with shoulder-length hair that was black, white, and purple, named Alto, Annabelle, and Mimi respectively.  Sitting in an armchair was a four-foot tall beauty with orange hair named Arturo.  She was the most gluttonous of the group, and was truly fat, sporting a great, vast gut and breasts almost as huge as Felicia's.  But she wasn't too greedy, and had been sharing food and prey with the others in times of lacking.  She was a good soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all were.  And their kind hearts would strengthen her own once she digested their bodies and souls into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia grinned, and mentally narrowed down the choices the two most delectible morsels of the group, Lucy and Arturo.

She didn't think the orange-haired beauty would, but she wished to make sure.<br>\r\nFelicia knelt before the shorter catgirl and licked her lips, drool spattering her breasts at how huge and round her companion was.  \"Even if I'm doing this to honor them...that doesn't mean I can't enjoy it!\" she thought.  With a purr of delight, she slowly took Arturo's sleeping form against her own, squishing their massive bellies together, and opened her jaws wide.<br>\r\nThe only sound she heard from her small companion was a slightly startled mewl before her jaws consumed Arturo's head, her tongue licking over the soft flesh of her cheeks to calm her, before a gulp pulled the hefty catgirl in up to her shoulders, those massive breasts hanging down over her own.<br>\r\nFelicia's pawhands sank deep into Arturo's huge gut, and she shivered in ecstacy.

A gulp or two later, and Felicia had the smaller catgirl up vertically, rubbing her pawhands over that soft, vast belly, groaning at how wonderful it felt upon her tongue and lips.  She kneaded it a bit with her sharp teeth, hearing her meal starting to squirm and mewl within her, and then swallowed languidly again, pulling Arturo's thick hips down into her.<br>\r\nFrom there, it was just a few swallows down the fat, but short thighs, and after a long slurping gulp, Felicia drew the smaller catgirl's paws and tail inside and felt over the bulges that worked down her heavy body, her paws helping to squeeze the fat, sexy catgirl down to her overfull belly, which now stood out in front of her like a massive globe, the orange-haired beauty's mass nearly doubling her weight!  With another muffled belch, Felicia licked over her lips and started to feel her breasts and huge belly over, groaning t how wonderful it felt to have two of her companions in her...and there were still more, of course!

She let it drop gently when she reached the bed where the two girls layed, smiling as she felt the underside of her belly press down against the ground.  She patted it and whispered, \"Don't worry, kittens.  You'll have some company soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licked her lips hungrily, looking at Lucy's massive, muscular form as she slept, purring softly.  She wasn't touching Grace, but they were close together, so she'd have to be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips and drooling heavily, she leaned forward, almost going on top of her belly as she grabbed Lucy's feet, stuffing them into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia mewled softly, gently slurping over the strong footpaws lovingly for a brief moment, making Lucy giggle.  Felicia then swallowed hard, her neck bulging out as Lucy's feet passed into her gullet, drawing the muscular fem off of the bed.  Felicia started to swallow over and over, Lucy's thick, muscular legs sliding easily past her lips.  Felicia moaned softly, her tongue caressing Lucy's dense, thick flesh, tangy with sweat from her workout earlier in the evening.  Very different from Arturo's soft massiveness, but still delicious in it's own way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Felicia didn't know, however, was that her swallowing was jostling Lucy each time.  Slowly, the amazoness catgirl's eyes fluttered open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn... Felicia?  What are you doing?\"  Lucy said as her hips were sucked into her leader's mouth.  She 'sat up,' and stared in shock, her eyes steadily widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia was starting to panic, when she felt a soft tail touch her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Relax, Felicia.  Just think of what you want to say, and Lucy and I will hear it through my powers,~ said Grace's voice.  The two of them looked over, and saw Grace still laying on the bed, only her tail was touching Felicia, her eyes were open, and she was smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy frowned, but looked down at Felicia expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shrugged, and 'said,' ~I was hungry and couldn't wait.  You guys were all here, and you looked so tasty...  And if you're worried about dying, don't be.  Remember me telling you about that mess with Jedah?  I gained a couple abilities.  Once I digest you, all your souls will be absorbed into me.  We'll be together forever, never alone!  Doesn't that sound nice?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy blinked, and looked at Grace, who was smiling widely, her tail flicking about.  She had been through the worst, and was desperately afraid of being alone, so this idea obviously appealed to her.  Lucy herself thought long and hard.  The idea of being one with Felicia, whom she loved dearly for saving her from that circus, was truly appealing.  She opened her mouth to say something, adjusting herself a little in Felicia's throat.  But as she did, she shifted her legs, trying to get comfortable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped as she noticed for the first time the feeling of Felicia's hot, moist, tightly stretched throatmuscles on her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah... Ahh... That feels good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia, sensing an opportunity, grinned widely.</span></div></div>",

The muscular catgirl gasped quietly and began to squirm, her powerful legs wriggling within Felicia's throat as the predatory female gave her friend a final pleasure.<br>\r\nGrace did not move to join her or Lucy, but squirmed nonetheless, seeming to stroke her pawhands over her own thighs.  Perhaps through her abilities, she could feel Lucy's pleasure and was enjoying it just as much.  With a wide grin, Felicia stroked her lovely meal and thrust her tongue within Lucy's depths, tasting the delicious juices within as the amazon-sized female before her bucked and cried out, releasing a gout of her fluids down the blue-haired catgirl's throat.  Nearby, Grace also shuddered and moaned as she rubbed her thighs together.  With a low mental chuckle, Felicia rubbed her tongue along the flesh and fur of Lucy's groin, slipping her tongue in and out of the cleft between her thighs to make sure she licked up all those juices before continuing, taking a huge swallow to pull those strong hips down, slurping Lucy's wriggling, giggling body up to her breasts.<br>\r\nNow Grace began to crawl over, pressing her body up to Felicia's growing tummy, while the bloated catgirl purred in delight and began working over Lucy's firm breasts, her huge ears flicking as her friend's pawhands caressed her head.<br>\r\nShe reached up with her own paw to stroke Grace's beautiful cheek, before lifting herself up and taking several strong swallows, the last of which had her slurping up her meal's long shock of hair, before the largest of all her companions lay within her massive gut, the dome of her belly now larger than she was, and with Grace up against her, Felicia felt wonderful!</span></div></div>",

We wouldn't have had much of a life at all, if it weren't for you.  If we can sate you, or please you in any way, then I'm happy to help.\"<br>\r\nThe other two purred gently and nodded their agreement.

She murled, running her tongue over the teen's lightly curled, ivory hair, and face, gently caressing her as she swallowed.  Her neck, stretched open already by Lucy and Arturo earlier, easily expands to accept Annabelle as Felicia gently works in the slender shoulders of the catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia mewled happily, as Annabelle purred contentedly, her eyes closed as she felt herself being hugged all over by Felicia's warm, moist gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia purred, and swallowed Annabelle's shoulders, her mouth distending enough to let her petite breasts into Felicia's jaws.  The elder catgirl murled softly, gently flicking her tongue over them, elicting pleased moans from inside her gullet.  She wasn't old enough to start producing milk, like Grace, Lucy, Felicia herself and Arturo were, but her breasts were still soft to Felicia's tongue and sensitive enough for waves of pleasure to be sent through Annabelle's body with each slurp.  After several long, wonderful moments of this, Felicia gulped again, her neck expanding as Annabelle slid further down into her.  Another quick swallow pushed in the teen catgirl's slender stomach, leaving her hips in Felicia's jaws.  Felicia murled, and decided to pleasure Annabelle for giving her such a wonderful gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle meeped, her legs going stiff as Felicia's tongue pressed into her womanhood, and she moaned, her tail swishing excitedly as Felicia pleasured her.  She was brought to orgasm quickly by Felicia's skilled tongue, and sighed contentedly.  Felicia mewled happily, lapping up her juices, and swallowed her hips, leaving only her legs and tail outside her jaws.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabelle's head was pressed through a ring of flesh into a warmer place, and she felt her lips press up against another soft pair.  She blinked in the darkness, but didn't break the kiss, instead just savoring it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was nice, whoever that was,\" Annabelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were her next course, huh, Anna?\" said a voice Anna recognized as Lucy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna giggled.  \"Yeah.  Now scooch over and make some room for me, she's almost done with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia mewled softly as she felt the conversation taking place in her belly, and giggled.  She took several long, slurping gulps, Annabelle's legs vanishing down her throat.  Her belly bulged out once more, and she licked her lips happily, burping softly and purring as she felt Annabelle get comfortable inside her stomach with the others.  She licked her lips and turned to the others just in time to see black-haired Alto and purple-haired Mimi climax from Grace's ministrations.  The auburn-haired catgirl looked up, licking her lips clean as she rose from between Mimi's legs, and pulled her tail from Alto's womanhood.  She smiled at Felicia, as did the two teens as once they had gotten their breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi giggled, and sat down next to Alto, the two girls cuddling together slightly as Grace went over to sit with the twins, who were watching this display with wide-eyed innocent amusement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia smiled warmly at them, briefly shuddering at the memory of the horrible life she had rescued them from, feeling a brief bit of satisfaction at the brutal death of the man who had been keeping them in his harem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook herself, and smiled at Mimi and Alto, both rescues from government laboratories.  Alto purred at Felicia and said, \"We've decided we want to go together.  Do want to eat us both at once, or one at a time, one right after the other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia mewled thoughtfully for a moment, before making her descision...</span></div></div>",

With a lick to each of their sweet faces, she smiled.  \"Mmm...one after another might be best, as I had planned on eating the twins together...\"  She stroked each cute catgirl on the cheek.  \"But imagining you as a...well, as a sandwich is just too appealing!\"<br>\r\nShe smacked her lips and drew them up to her cheeks, nuzzling them.  \"So you'll go down together!\"<br>\r\nThe two younger females purred deeply and kissed their elder companion, slowly entwining their bodies as they lay before her, smiling widely.  \"We though you might choose that...\"<br>\r\nFelicia smirked and lapped over the tops of their heads, slowly opening her jaws wide, hearing her ligaments creaking as with a slow tug, she pulled each head into her mouth, feeling her cheeks bulging out widely.<br>\r\nShe stroked down their sweet, soft bodies, teasing their twitching tails as she took a massive swallow and began to work their smaller, wriggling bodies together down her throat, her neck and chest starting to expand hugely to contain the two.  Her throat and cheeks hurt a bit from having to stretch so much, but then again, she'd gotten Arturo's huge stomach down, and with all her companions still wriggling about in her bloated gut, she couldn't help but still feel aroused at feeding.<br>\r\nShe worked quickly over their shoulders and petite chests, giggling as she delved her tongue into the clefts of their cleavage, hearing their pleasant purrs within her muscular gullet.  With a caress to each of their soft, furred rumps, she pushed upon them and swallowed harder, her lips and jaws stretching even farther as she worked down past their stomachs and over their hips, her eyes closing at this widest portion...but with a soft swallow, those slid into her elastic gullet and she sighed happily, taking her time in slurping up their firm, fine legs.<br>\r\nWhen their furred paws and tails had vanished into her lips, she tilted her head back and gulped a last time, the huge bulge of the two girls adding to her vast bulk, her stomach now wriggling and teetering hugely over her.<br>\r\nWith a crass belch and a heavy, ecstatic groan, she began to rub over herself as she looked towards her remaining friends...</span></div></div>",

With Piko held up against her side and soft, warm breast, Felicia slowly swallowed, drawing Nana's head down into her elastic gullet and fitting the small catgirl's shoulders well within her cheeks.<br>\r\nA sudden caress over her massive stomach made her shudder and groan, and one of her eyes looked up to the enormous dome to see Grace fondly stroking it, smiling kindly to her and urging her on, the blue-haired beauty nodding and swallowing slowly several more times to work Nana's torso down into her throat, the delicate skin and fur washed with her saliva.<br>\r\n\"Teehee!  This is a fun ride, Miss 'lecia!\"<br>\r\n\"You look so big, too!  It'll be fun to go into you...\"<br>\r\nThe young, innocent comments made her blush, her soft pawhand stroking over Piko's ears while she tilted her head back and slowly worked Nana's small hips down through her lips, not taking the time to lick over the small thighs or delicate tail.  Instead, Felicia simply rolled her head back a couple of times, her tongue helping to push Nana's delicious form down into her, the soft, small paws finally vanishing into her with a last, strong swallow.  The bulge her meal made slid down past her swollen chest and made another bulge within her bloated stomach, Grace taking a moment to rub over the new occupant, much to Felicia's delight.</span></div></div>",

When just Piko's head remained, Grace came over and gave the little girl a kiss.

The glare was affectionate.  \"Well, if YOU had just eaten eight catgirls, how would YOU feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace chuckled softly, swishing her tail.  \"True, true.  But I think I can help you a little.  You know what I was before we met, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia nodded, blushing slightly.  Grace had been trapped in a whorehouse, kept alone in a dark, unlit room, her only company being men who payed to rape her, use her in whatever way they wanted.  Lucy, Arturo and Felicia had taken great pleasure in killing, quite slowly, her abusers and making Grace part of their pride<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrace smiled.  \"I think that if I use some of the pleasure techniques I was forced to learn on you, that would help settle your stomach, and make me easier to swallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia blushed even deeper, her face turning as red as Lucy's hair.  Grace chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've given me a life, Felicia, one I never dreamed of having.  If I can use the skills they forced on me to make you happy, then I would consider it an honor.  But if you are too uncomfortable with the concept, then that's fine too.  Just the thought of being with you as part of your beautiful body, your beautiful SOUL, gives me great joy.

His family was an aristocratic one, and although his being a werewolf had scared away the local populace, he still retained ownership of his ancestral castle, and it was there Felicia headed, having often been a guest in Jon's bed.<br>\r\nIt took her almost two days to reach the out-of-the-way lodgings, but when she arrived, she knocked heavily on the huge door-knocker, fidgeting with her heavier breasts and softer belly as she waited for her friend and lover to answer.<br>\r\nIt took several minutes, but soon enough her sharp hearing picked up Jon's low snarling, and when the werewolf opened up the door, she could see he was holding his head in his deadly paw, nearly leaning against the huge wooden door.  \"Who...\" he blinked a couple of times as his eyes focused on the woman before him.  \"Felicia...?  What...what happened to you?\"<br>\r\nThe catgirl chuckled and smiled, patting a soft paw underneath Jon's open-hanging muzzle.  \"I...put on a bit of weight, recently.  But come now, you've seen me in worse shape than this.  Your own appetite is as large as mine, after all...\"<br>\r\nJon let out a low growl at the feel of her paw, and then chuckled, slowly standing up more fully, his bare chest puffing out some as he nodded.  \"Indeed.  Especially my sexual appetite.\"<br>\r\nNodding, Felicia was about to tell him of her reason for being here when another voice interrupted, one familiar to her...<br>\r\n\"Jon, honey...who's there?  Why don't you come back to bed?\"<br>\r\nFelicia's eyes went wide, and she shot a quick, nasty look to Jon.  \"B.B.?  What's that tramp doing here?\"<br>\r\nJon cringed and shrugged a bit, his long jaws parting in a grin.  \"You know how I am.  We can't really help but like the whole 'Little Red Riding Hood' thing...\"  He gave the plump catgirl a wink.</span></div></div>",

The werewolf's grin faded a little under her gaze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she grinned wickedly, and kissed Jon passionately.  Jon looked a little surprised at first, but eventually relaxed, slipping his tongue into Felicia's mouth as she did the same for him, Jon's paw squeezing her plump butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long moment, in which both became aroused by each other, they broke the kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that was nice,\" Jon said, \"So I guess you're not too mad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia giggled, smiling cutely.  \"Hell, if you don't mind me banging Rikuo now and then, I can put up with you banging BB Hood.  Besides, this helps my idea out a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon blinked.  \"What idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia explained everything, including why she was so chubby.  She explained her intentions in total, including her desire to eat Jon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Jon seemed to like the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?  I wouldn't mind becoming lard on that sexy ass of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia blinked, but grinned, not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth.  (She'd rather it look her in the mouth right before she swallowed it.)  \"You're taking this better than I thought you would.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon shook his head.  \"Felicia, I have nothing right now.  The townspeople got a new preacher that turned them against me.  They hired BB to kill me, I'm just lucky I was able to seduce her into bed.  And look around, I have nothing left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia did look around, and saw that many of the priceless treasures she had seen last time were missing.  \"Oh my. They raided you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded.  \"And nearly beat me to death.  I had to unlock my Dark Force to drive them away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia winced.  The Dark Force unleashed the most savage aspects in a Darkstalker, and his beastial nature was something Jon had been fighting for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon shook his head sadly.  \"I'm losin' the fight, Felicia.  I can sense that I'm going to go totally beast, and soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia frowned.  \"You were going to let BB Hood kill you after you were done, weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon nodded.  As if on cue, BB called down, \"Jonny, hon, if we're done, could you tell me where my weapons are?  Remember, you said I'd get to off you after we were done having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a sec, BB.  It's a salesperson.  I'll get rid of him soon, and then I'm gonna show you some new moves that'll rock your world,\" Jon said.  Felicia snorted laughter and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBB giggled happily.  \"Okay honey.  Come back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gawd,\" Felicia muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJon grinned.  \"Hey, don't knock it.  She's a VERY nice lover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia blinked, and then grinned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a plan,\" she said.</span></div></div>",

Rikuo!\"<br>\r\nShe waved to get his attention, her cheeks and chin bouncing as she smiled energetically, and the fishman, muscular and green-scaled and...good-looking as ever in her eyes, perked up, wavering his fins before waving a webbed hand back.<br>\r\n\"Felicia?  What are you doing here?\"  He slowly approached her, though the two made sure others weren't around.  After all, their kind were not well-liked.

Felicia smiled, waiting patiently for his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Rikuo asked, \"Did you really eat your entire pride, Felicia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia giggled, and patted the soft bulge of her belly.  \"Yep.  They're all a part of me now, mind, body, and soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikuo shook his head.  \"This is insane, Felicia.  I can't believe you're even considering this.  Isn't this what Jedah wanted all along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shook her head.  \"Jedah wanted all our souls to be a power source for a baby so ugly and evil that even *I* hated it, and also wanted to wipe out the world in some misguided genocidal plot to start things over.  All I want is to make my friends happy and peaceful inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikuo frowned at her.  \"And those that aren't your friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their threat will be eliminated by being a part of my souls because I am, in the words of Lord Raptor, the ultimate goody-goody weirdo,\" she said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikuo shook his head again, frowning.   \"I'm sorry, Felicia.  But I can't agree to this.\"  He turned and started to leave.  Felicia mewled, and grabbed Rikuo's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go, Felicia,\" Rikuo said, not turning around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia shook her head.  \"Rikuo, come on!  It won't be that bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A cat eating me won't be that bad?  Forget it.  Now let GO!\" Rikuo said, extending his claws and slashing at her.  Felicia barely managed to dodge, his claws catching her robe and ripping it off.  She stepped back, extending her own claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want it to come to this, Rikuo.  I really didn't,\" she said, \"But trust me when I say that this will be better for all of us in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikuo snarled.  His eyes began to glow as he tapped into the dark force energies that all Darkstalkers commanded, the waters behind him starting to churn and swell.  \"You're delusional, cat.  Jedah altering your body has made you just as insane as he is.  I'm not gonna let you eat me, Felicia.  And with any luck, I'll be able to beat some sense into you.  SEA RAGE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRikuo thrust his hands forward, and the waters behind him surged forward in a massive wave.  Felicia, agile as ever despite her new bulk, leaped up to a nearby tree and backflipped off of it, diving down towards Rikuo in a kick.

That's JEDAH talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped herself a few more times until the urge passed.  She sighed, and kissed the chubby young Nonno on the cheek.  When she didn't start salivating again, she relaxed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that those urges have passed, I'll go get some breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, she picked a pen and paper out of a nearby trashcan and wrote her fellow catgirls a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gone hunting.  Be back soon.  If not, my belly is just too big to move and I'll be back later.  Hope you slept well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicia left it on her chair and sighed.  She popped her neck and changed to her housecat form, trotting calmly out of the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, on the rooftop nearby, a muscular, grey-furred form appeared.  He looked down and spied Felicia's note, his excellent eyes allowing him to read it from his vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?  So much for getting a morning quicky,\" he grumbled.  He leaped off the rooftop and leaped from wall to wall, quickly descending to the ground.  He was a werewolf, and a handsome specimen at that.  A muscular creature with thick greyish fur and a long muzzle, clad in blue sweatpants and a yellow belt-sash.  His name was Jon Talbain, and he was a longtime friend of Felicia's.  He, like others who were called Darkstalkers, been through the same process Felicia had been through.  But once Jedah was defeated, he and Felicia had maintained a bit of a friendship, occasionally meeting up for sex or hunting for prey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference being that Jon was more willing to eat other monsters than Felicia, who preferred humans.  He had kept this secret from Felicia, but since Jedah captured all the Darkstalkers and put them through the alterations a few years ago, he had consumed five catgirls, six vampires, nine succubi, three merpeople, and his fellow Darkstalker, Lord Raptor.  He would have tried for more, but his metabolism was slower than Felicia's and he tended to pile on weight quickly.  But when the meals were good, he didn't care.  Especially if he got sex first.  Today, he was in the mood for humans, and wanted to invite Felicia on a hunt and a date.  But now it seemed that she had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed, about to change to his human form and head for his home in the city, when his stomach rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put a paw to his belly and frowned.  \"Now I'm REALLY hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again, and was about to leave, when he grinned, getting an idea.  He turned slowly, licking his chops as he admired the sleeping catgirls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like they'll be gone,\" he said, \"Since they aren't human, I'll absorb their souls into mine after they're digested.  If I'm lucky, I can get some action out of the older kitties before I eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled.  \"And if I don't that's fine.  Felicia's probably considered eating them herself.  And if not, I can just eat her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his hands together eagerly.  \"And now that I've finished making justifications to cover the fact that I'm a horny, gluttonous little bastard and proud of it, it's breakfast time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\nMajigen...<br>\r\nJedah's Chamber...<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect...\" Jedah said, watching on an enchanted viewscreen, \"I'm still not sure what my changes did to them to make them this gluttonous, but it plays into my plans perfectly.  Going the subtle route was the right idea, especially since that foolish hunter Dante nearly killed me.  If this works, I'll consume whomever consumes the others.  If it doesn't, I'll probably be consumed myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJedah laughed his shrill laugh.  \"Then again, that might not be so bad.  Because either way, my plan gets accomplished.\"</span></div></div>",

It had been an hour since she started searching for food, and hadn't found anything or anyone worth eating.  She had even considered looking into dumpsters and trash cans for something, but she hadn't done that in years and the concept of doing it now just made her ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEventually, though, her efforts were rewarded, as she spotted something interesting across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Manny &amp; Jack's Pet Boutique.  Mmm!\" Felicia said, licking her lips, her flat, sexy stomach grumbling in anticipation.  She patted it and shifted into her housecat form.  She looked around to make sure no one was coming, and scampered across the street, heading around to the back of the building.  She shifted to her humanoid form again and tested the door, finding it locked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No problem,\" she said, using her claws to slash the door open.  She wasn't concerned about time, because the store's hours said that they were closed for the weekend and the metal shutters were down over the door and windows of the front, hiding her completely from the outside world.  She did think, as she went inside, to brace the back door shut with a trash can.  But once she was done, she was focused completely on the buffet before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ooooh, oh so yummy.  Little furry wigglys, all gonna go down into my tummy,\" she said, looking around in the pitch dark room at the sleeping animals, cats and dogs, birds, rabbits, gerbils, hamsters, guinea pigs, mice, and fish.  The animals all looked up when they caught Felicia's scent, the sexy, wide-hipped catwoman sauntering in and looking over what she considered to be the menu.  The rodents all cowered in fear, the cats gave her an interested look before relaxing again, and the dogs all started barking.  Felicia ignored them, wandering about the store, her tail idly caressing the cages and pen, taking inventory of the store's stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe rubbed her paws together, chuckling wickedly.  \"Hmm, let's see, twenty gerbils, five rabbits, ten hamsters, ten guinea pigs, thirty mice, seven birds, nine cats, four dogs, and lots of fish.  Where to start, where to start,\" she said, \"Everything looks so gooood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe paused at the gerbil pen, the furry little creatures scampering about in fear from the large, busty catwoman looming over them and licking her lips.  Grinning, she reached one of her large, unweildy paws into the pen and gently picked up one by the scruff of its neck.  She purred, slowly raising the struggling, terrified creature up to her mouth and grinned viciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Aww, poor little thing,\" she said, letting her hot, moist breath wash over the gerbil, \"Are you scared?\"  She purred, and let the gerbil drop into her other paw, where it just stared at her fearfully, shivering.  She grinned toothily, and said \"Don't worry little one.  You'll be a nice, safe, warm place soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled wickedly and gripped it again with her claws, lifting the wriggling little creature up over her mouth.  She licked her lips, savoring the creature's fright, and said, \"VERY warm indeed.\"  She opened her mouth wide, and dropped the gerbil inside.  Her jaws snapped shut, and the gerbil became trapped inside Felicia's maw.  She purred delightedly, letting the creature struggle about, its fear so rich that she could taste it on her rough tongue, which slurped all over the helpless little creature as it squeaked in panic, trying to escape.  Her cheeks bulged out as it pressed around, trying to look for an opening.  Finally, Felicia felt it feel up to her lips.  She chuckled, and let it poke it's head out of her lips, looking directly down into the gerbil pen as she did.  She let the gerbil in her mouth look around for a moment, before slurping it back into her mouth and swallowing, a tiny bulge going down her gullet and disappearing into her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe licked her lips, letting out an exaggerated 'mmmm' of delight as she rubbed her stomach in a slow, sensual manner.  She leaned over the cage again and picked up another gerbil, not bothering with the taunting this time and simply placing the creature in her mouth.  She swallowed, another bulge going down her throat and disappearing into her sexy body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe continued to eat the gerbils, gulping them down one after another, her tummy starting to gain a slight bulge to it as she simply slid the small creatures down her gullet.  Finally, the gerbil pen was empty, leaving only a catgirl with a bulging stomach nearby.  She licked her lips and patted her tummy, purring happily from the feeling of all the wriggling inside of her.  She grinned at the other animals, who cowered in fear at the aura Felicia's prescence held.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What you have just witnessed is gluttony in action.  Every living thing in this shop is going inside my belly for keeps.  Those little 'sliders' were just the first, as I am still RAVENOUS, and since I'm the top of the food chain in this room, that means some of you are next.

Unbeknownst to either you or Takato, this has been here all the time, and now it is yours to use!  Deep within the workings of your mind the notion that food, lots of food, could be through there...and so with a lick of your lips, you tromp through the portal and into your home, though where or when you might end up is unknown!  (Yes, this could lead to season one or season two or...gasp! the fourth season!  Huzzah for plot devices!)</span></div></div>",

Deciding against his usual taunting speeches to his meals, he decided to just simply eat the damn thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe caught the rodent expertly between his paws and flung it upwards, catching it in his mouth with expert ease and swallowing it, savoring the whimpering struggles of the tiny creature as it fell down into his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled softly.  <i>Oh, if only I could dispose of Simba that easily...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as the thought occured to him, an idea started to form.  <i>...Maybe I COULD dispose of him that easily!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, spotting no one, and stared at Simba, still innocently playing with that butterfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Certainly, he's small enough,</i> Scar thought, getting hungrier every second he held onto this idea, <i>And it'd be easily to claim that he ran off while I was sleeping off a meal.  Mufasa is a gullible fool...  But do I dare?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar knew full well what Mufasa's wrath was like.  A cheetah that had tried to eat Simba a couple weeks ago was shredded by Mufasa in retaliation, the remains served to his lionesses as a gift for their efforts in feeding the pride.  It was sheer luck and cowardice-enduced spped the hyenas escaped with their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the chance to be rid of Simba was too great to pass up...</span></div></div>",

She and Kovu were very happy together, and were well respected amongst the pridelands, although the respect from animals they usually ate was tense at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara was out hunting one day.  Kovu had been very good to her, and had recently saved her from an attack by the hyenas, and she wanted to get him his favorite prey as a special treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed as she thought about the hyenas.  Her father had told her that the hyenas were once noble hunters, a matriarchy of warriors whom they shared the pridelands with.  But they had degenerated into scavengers and poachers shortly after Kiara's grandfather, Mufasa, had come to power.  Kovu had suggested that Scar may have been responsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiara shook her head.  She wished she could have helped them, help restore them to the way they once were, so they wouldn't have to wage war with them.  But as she grew up, she had become a bit of a realist, and knew that all the world's problems couldn't be solved.  So she concentrated on those she could solve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike finding the source of that interesting noise she was hearing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, carefully, she stalked through the tall grass, the clumsiness of her youth gone, thanks both to Simba's training and the warrior-like refinement she had gained from Kovu.

Ever since she had commited suicide rather than accept Kiara's help and gain possible redemption, she had been trapped in this horrid place, running from this demon and never getting away, never having time to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she didn't, Scar would catch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn and on she ran, until a pool of darkness opened up beneath her.  Before she could stop, she fell directly into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell for seemingly forever, and landed roughly on the ground in a black void.  Groaning, she got to her feet and looked around, seeing nothing in every direction.  So dark was it, that she couldn't see herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after a short moment, light did come, in the form of two glowing, yellow-green eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira stared at them, smelled smoke and brimstone, and cowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... Who are you?  What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name I shall tell you later,\" said the voice belonging to those frightening eyes, \"What I want is to give you a second chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira blinked, confused.  \"A... second chance?\" she said, doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice chuckled.  \"Yes... A second chance at revenge.  A chance to let your hatred quite literally consume your enemies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira shook her head.  \"This is just a trick... A trick of hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed.  \"Hell holds no power over me.  I am become darkness itself, and now I fear neither God nor Satan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira frowned.  \"What... What do I have to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply say yes.  And I will send you back to Earth and give you the power to quite literally let your hatred devour your enemies completely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Zira realized what the voice meant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wish me to consume them?\" Zira asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whole and alive,\" the voice said, the eyes narrowing with amusement, \"A bit of serpent magic I picked up in the pit.  Say yes and I shall make you a demon of gluttony.  Your whole world shall be yours for the eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe offer was too good.  And ANYTHING was better than being chased forever by a nightmarishly distorted version of Scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Zira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed as flames flared up around the darkness, revealing for the first time that the eyes were connected to a massive, hulking black dragon with a dark purple underbelly and massive wings.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it, then!  Let darkness fill you completely!  Consume your world and all things within it!\" the dragon said, flapping her wings, \"Gain vengeance on your foes, and serve my purpose!  So sayeth MALEFICENT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentacles of darkness shot up around Zira and pulled her further into the ground, which had suddenly become soft and murky.  Before she could scream, she was engulphed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n================================<br>\r\nA different pridelands...<br>\r\n50 miles away from Pride Rock...<br>\r\n================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness and her mate cooed over their cubs, the four playful little creatures gamboling and wrestling around the savannah.  The lion nuzzled her mate and said, \"Let me go get food for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness shook her head, and started to get up.  \"No, my love, it's my job to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion nudged her back down.  \"You've just given birth yesterday.  Exiles like us have to take care of each other, y'know, so let me take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness tried to protest again, but the lion insisted and eventually convinced her to stay.  He trotted off, and the lioness turned back to her cubs after watching her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when she did, she gasped.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her cubs was now sporting a tremendous belly, sucking down a tiny tail.  The forms of the other three cubs could be seen in her stomach as she took one final swallow, the tailtip disappearing into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub let out a loud belch and licked her chops happily, grinning viciously at the frightened mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an adult, mocking voice, the cub said, \"I'm still hungry, <i>mommy</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing the lioness saw was her cub lunging for her, mouth opened wide...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=================================================<br>\r\nA little ways away from where the lioness was...<br>\r\n=================================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion was on his way to hunt, when he heard his mate's frightened roar.  He turned back, running to the cave and field where his family was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got there, he could only stare in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of his cubs was swallowing his mate, the lioness's rump, madly thrashing tail and flailing legs hanging out of the cub's grossly stretched mouth, the wriggling inside of her belly showing that she had already devoured her siblings.  The lion watched in stunned horror as his mate's hind end slowly vanished into the cub's maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith slow, deliberate swallows, the lioness slid into the cub's gullet, her throat visibly moving with each swallow.  Soon, all that was left of the lioness was her tail, and that disappeared in a single, slurping gulp.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub let out a tremendous belch, laying on her side as her vastly belly wriggled, the forms inside writhing in agony.  She licked her lips and turned, spotting the still horrified into paralysis lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look.  Dessert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n=========================<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later...<br>\r\n=========================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub that Zira now was belched, her tremendously overful belly groaning and gurgling as it digested the lion, lioness, and other three cubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knew that lions could be so delicious?\" Zira said, laughing and belching again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You have done well,</i> Maleficent's voice said inside of Zira's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Zira said, groaning and belching again, loving the feeling of how full she was, \"But I do have a question: It was ingenius of you to place me in that lioness's womb, but what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are a demon now.  You digest souls as well as bodies.  Once your meals fully become a part of you, you will be able to assume their form and use that against Simba and his family.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira grinned.  \"Marvelous.  But while I'm not complaining about the chance for revenge or the fact that I'm now your servant, why are you doing this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaleficent snarled.  <i>Because they helped a young boy halt my plans far too many times.  I want all of the boy's friends to suffer, and on this world I have chosen you to do it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This world...\" Zira said, \"Then I assume you have made similar offers to people of similar mindsets as mine on other worlds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaleficent chuckled. <i>Indeed.  Perhaps you'll meet them someday.  Now relax and enjoy your meal.  You'll need all your strength to infiltrate Pride Rock...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaleficent's intimidating prescence faded from Zira's mind.  She chuckled and relaxed, eventually drifting off to sleep and dreaming sweet dreams...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, humans adapted a defense against that - the ability to swallow things much larger than themselves whole and alive, and digest them without incident.  This helped humans tame the wild, eventually working out the happy medium of the trainer system.  But this isn't to say that Pokemon are helpless.  Even with this adaption, without Pokeballs and other Pokemon catching tools, humans would still be at a disadvantage due to the powers of Pokemon.  And humans know to avoid Legendary nests like the plague, as they are too powerful to fight even with a well-trained team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRight now, even with this, it's still about even.

Which is important, as most Pokemon, even the tiny ones, would normally just swallow you whole.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHonestly, Pokeballs, Pokemon training, and the fact that humanity numbered in the billions were the only reason humanity wasn\u2019t extinct yet.

Despite the Flareon's strength, it was evident that she was at least a little spoiled, being plumper than normal.  He also had a Primarina, another female, one that he rescued from a water-type trainer who was abusing her as a Popplio for not being as badass as other so-called water-type 'starters.'  He had fed the man to a wild Gyarados, taking her into his harem.  He had a male Tropius, which served as his primary method of travel, and a male Absol, which he had obtained a Mega Stone for, that served as his primary 'enforcer' and one he used to send a message whenever dirty work was required.  A female Mawile, one he found in the wild and had brought under control, was also on his team, as was a notably frisky male Goodra.  It wasn't the strongest team, he knew, but he was proud of all of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne thing he was also known for?  His low tolerance for abuse.

His tallow-skinned, skeletal frame shuffled from shelf to shelf, picking up powders and elixers and throwing them into the bubbling cauldron in the center of the small, cramped room.  The sorcerer held in one hand a spellbook, muttering to himself as he threw the spell together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he was running out of time.  He had been away from all his sources of power for too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich wasn't surprising, since his enemies had destroyed them all years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For too long, the plans of I, the great Ixis Naugus have been thrwarted.  By Sonic and his friends, by the fools of the Knothole Kingdom that has reclaimed more than nine-tenths of this world, and by that imbecile Robotnik's, who's empire has been steadily chipped away at by furs less intelligent than he is.  But that all changes today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw the final ingredient in, and the cauldron roiled, turning a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIxis coughed up some blood, and put the spellbook aside, reciting the incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clever fox and cunning bat, make your bellies grow round and fat,<br>\r\n\"Eat all you see, eat all you meet,<br>\r\n\"For all that exists, is your tasty treat,<br>\r\n\"Fulfill my will, as I go to final rest,<br>\r\n\"Fulfill thy stomachs, and pass my test,<br>\r\n\"Eat all Mobius, so sayeth I!<br>\r\n\"Make the enemies of Naugus DIE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning lanced out of the cauldron, vaporizing Naugus into ash.  But as he died, a smile came over his face as the spell went out in two directions, fading into invisiblility and striking its intended targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd somewhere on Mobius, Miles 'Tails' Prower and Rouge the Bat suddenly became very hungry...</span></div></div>",

And as he looked at Cream, for some reason his mouth began to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Or maybe I'll eat something else...- he thought, smirking wickedly as he came up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream giggled, bouncing the ball back to her Chao, Cheese, and beckoned for him to bounce it back to her.  When he didn't, instead staring behind her with a look of growing fear, she frowned and started to turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked as Tails suddenly grabbed her ears and  stuffed them into his mouth.  He slurped them over eagerly, but despite their delicious taste, his hunger was still rising, and his belly needed filling, so he couldn't waste time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream yeeped as Tails suddenly opened his jaws wide, engulphing her head totally.  She tried to stand up, and thumped her hands against the side of Tails' head, but he didn't seem to feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he swallowed, drawing her further into his maw, her shoulders and chest slipping into his mouth even as his neck bulged out tremendously with her head.  He gagged slightly, not used to this feeling, and swallowed HARD, feeling Cream's head pass through his neck and chest and start into his belly.  The little bunny's feet wriggled desperately outside of the two-tailed fox's maw, muffled screaming coming from inside his body.  Tails grinned around his meal and quickly pulled off her shoes, tossing them aside and slurping over her feet.  With a final gulp, Cream slid fully into his belly, which bulged out heavily and caused him to need to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheese shrieked in terror and flew off, intent on warning everyone of what had just occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunetly for him, the first person he ran into was Rouge, who by this time was fully under the effects of Naugus's spell as well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little fox licked his lips and belched, rubbing his huge, heavy belly happily as Cream kicked and squirmed inside of his gut, trying to get out.  Tails groaned happily and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was GREAT!!  I've never felt this way before!  ...I wonder if I can eat bigger people?\"</span></div></div>",

They all looked ill, weakened. And the news they just heard made it worse for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... So there's nothing we can do?\" Sonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shook her head slowly. \"I'm afraid not,\" she softly. \"Eggman's unleashed his plague. Within a month, all organic life on Mobius will be dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gathered world leaders all started yelling at once, demanding to know how this happened. Sally waited until they were all done yelling to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell, Eggman unleashed the plague secretly before he actually announced his intention to use it, using the Egg Fleet attacks as a distraction. By the time we got to the chamber that held the plague, it had already been emptied. We're all starting to feel the effects... You've all already seen what happened to Mammoth Mogul, Doctor Finitevus, and Ixis Naugus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't happen... There has to be something we can do to prevent this! Some cure!\" said one leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCommander Tower, of G.U.N., acting as the Human/Overlander represnetative, shook his head. \"Our scientists have been studying it. It adapts far faster than we can cure it, even with Shadow's Chaos powers acting as a booster,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's no way to stop this?\" asked Dylan Porcupine. \"There's nothing we can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to stop it, no...\" Sally said softly. \"But there is a way we can live through this... in a sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Rosemary Prower asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally took a deep breath. \"...Because Nicole is NOT organic life, she will live through this. She'll live... well, forever, basically. And thanks to the upgrades she's been going through, she can preserve a limitless amount of data inside of her, create an entire world inside her mind. She can even convert living things to data, turning the biomass into more nanomachines.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very interesting, sister, but what...\" Elias paused as the implications sank in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded. \"If Nicole is allowed to consume the entire world and everyone on it, we'll all live on inside of her, in a world she can create for us that literally has no limits. Preserved forever in her memory banks, still ourselves, just... in a different form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was too stunned to say anything at first. \"A rather... drastic measure,\" said Sir Charles. \"Will she go along with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded. \"She's reluctant. That's why she's not present at this meeting, she's still trying to convince herself that I'm right. But she agrees that it's best to preserve life, even if just as nanotechs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will this even work?!\" Queen Hathor demanded. \"You're asking us to feed ourselves to a nanotech creature that we barely understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I am loathe... EXTREMELY loathe,\" Lupe added, glaring at the Felidae queen, who glared back, \"to admit, Hathor is right. How are you so certain that this will be an effective way of preserving ourselves against Eggman's virus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally stood up from the computer monitor. \"I am prepared to offer myself as an example,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole appeared in an instant, manifesting a nanotech body and grabbing her arm. \"Sally, you can't!\" she said. \"If this fails, you'll essentially be deleted! If I must test it, let it be on one of the criminals we have locked up, Bean or Bark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic came up to her, nodding. \"Sally, she's right! You can't risk yourself like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally smiled and kissed Sonic. \"I have to,\" she said. \"This is the only way to show that it's safe.\" She turned to Nicole, the lynx's ears drooping nervously. \"I'm ready,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole bit her lip, and nodded. \"Well... If you're sure...\" she said. Sally nodded, and Nicole took a deep breath to calm herself. She opened her jaws widely, and gently pushed Sally's muzzle inside. She closed it gently around the half-squirrel, gently tasting her with her tongue as she swallowed, her mouth expanding to fully take in Sally's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world leaders and Freedom Fighters watched in fascination as Nicole slowly swallowed Sally Acorn whole, her jaws distending easily around the princess's slender, muscular body. The AI lynx couldn't resist, snaking her tongue out to taste Sally's fur as she swallowed her breasts. She was almost ashamed to admit to herself that she found Sally to be incredibly delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally, for her part, was finding the experience surprisingly enjoyable. Nicole had made her avatar mostly realistic, so her insides were warm and wet, but not cloyingly so. And the feel of Nicole's gullet wrapped around her was surprisingly comforting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole forced herself not to moan as she slurped up Sally's hips. She was enjoying this way too much, she knew. She closed her eyes, her chest and stomach bulging as she devoured the princess. Finally, only her legs were left out, Nicole lifting up her head to make swallowing them easier. Nicole slurped over Sally's booted feet, gulping her feet down, pushing her completely into her belly, which bulged out heavily through her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stifled a belch as best she could. She didn't notice that Hathor, Lupe, and several others were trying to hide the fact that the sight they just witnessed was arousing to them despite how weak they felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Sally said, laughing, \"Okay, that was more enjoyable than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole just blushed, rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded. \"Okay. Nicole, digest me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole bit her lip. \"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded. \"This is the only way we can survive, Nicole,\" she said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sighed. \"Very well...\" she said softly. \"Engaging processing.\" She closed her eyes and concentrated on the biomass in her avatar's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gasped softly as nanotechs swarmed over her, her clothes dissolving quickly. She gasped, nanotechs invading her throat. A tingling numbness spread through her as her body was consumed by the nanotechs, dissolving and becoming more nanotechs. Darkness overtook what little vision she had inside her friend's stomach as she was subsumed completely by the nanotechs, her body losing shape as she was consumed by the nanos. Nicole's belly shrank as her body became visibly fatter, her breasts bulging in her dress as Sally became a part of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biomass absorption and conversion complete,\" Nicole said. \"Searching for filename: Sally Acorn.exe.\" She closed her eyes, scanning her database for her friend. </span></div></div>",

She knew she had absorbed her completely, she had to be in there somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise and delight, however, Sally had become active on her own. \"Wow!\" Sally said, laughing. \"That was... Wow, that felt incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked around. Her voice seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. Nicole didn't open her eyes, smiling. \"Filename: Sally Acorn.exe detected. Full memory files and all relevant data stored in my memory banks,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is neat,\" she said. \"The sensory input's a little overwhelming, though, I'm getting all of the city at once... Let me try to make a body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hologram would be best to start with, until you get used to manipulating the nanotechs,\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a flickering, and a hologram of Sally Acorn appeared, looking much healthier and in high spirits. \"It worked,\" she said, looking at herself. \"I've been fully integrated into Nicole, however I still retain full autonomy and all of my memories. In fact, I'm actually remembering things I've forgo... Oooh...\" Sally blushed, looking at Bunnie apologetically. \"THAT'S why you were so mad at me that week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie smirked. \"Ah was fond of that brush, Sally...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally giggled. \"Anyway. As I just proved, the procedure works. We can be fully integrated into Nicole's program without any loss of self, and be fully restored to health,\" she said. \"Plus, the process of being eaten and digested into the nanotechs that comprise Nicole's body was actually quite painless, and rather pleasant to tell the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leaders and Council of Acorn conversed quietly amongst each other as Sonic and the rest of the Freedom Fighters came up to the hologram of Sally. She smiled at them. \"I'm fine, really...\" she said. \"It's still me, just... hologramy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic bit his lip. \"Are you sure you're okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded, cupping his cheek with her hand. \"The plague's been purged from me completely. We can do this, Sonic. We can win,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just have to let Nicole eat us and turn us into bellyfat,\" Antoine muttered, \"Mon dieu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Nicole said, \"From what I have noted about your physical health Antoine, you would most likely go primarily to my butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at her, Nicole blushing and rubbing her pudge. Sally gaped, grinning. \"Is that... Is that me?\" she said, leaning down to stare at Nicole's expanded frame. \"Wow... I look cute as Nicole-pudge,\" she said, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah can't believe you're taking the fact that you're lynx fat and living data so well,\" Bunnie said, shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally chuckled weakly. \"It's either I make light of this and focus on the fact that I'm ALIVE and HEALTHY, or I think about it too much and go mad,\" she said. \"I'd much rather enjoy my new state. Speaking of...\" She smirked at Nicole. \"How about it, Nicole? Where would most of Bunnie add to on that cute avatar of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blushed. \"Sally, I really don't think it's appropriate to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon,\" Sally said. \"Indulge me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked hesitant for a moment, and said, \"Judging by her body mass and current physicality, there's a 72% probability that the majority of her biomass will be added to my breasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention,\" Elias said. \"We've discussed this, and have decided to go along with the plan. We will gather up all our various populations and bring them to Nicole for eating in short order. In the meantime, I suggest you start eating others. Save the Council for last, as we will be needed to help convince the population to go along with the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded, and turned to the others. Sally smiled. \"So who's next?\" she said. \"C'mon in, the lynx is fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Freedom Fighters all looked at each other nervously. They were more at ease with the idea now that they knew it was safe and not painful. And honestly, with Mammoth Mogul, Doctor Finitevus, and Ixis Naugus further along in the plague than everyone else in the world, they knew that the pain from Eggman's plague would be unbearable. But still, they were essentially going to be eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, someone stepped forward to volunteer. </span></div></div>",

And I really don't want to end up like Mogul, Naugus, and Finitevus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the room shuddered at what happened to the three villains. Sonic stepped forward, standing before Nicole. She smiled, bowing to Sonic, and then grabbed him by the shoulders, opening her jaws wide and pushing his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\ninside. Nicole restrained her avatar from drooling, but she couldn't help but enjoy how Sonic tasted. A slight taste of chilidogs on his face, along with a weathered, strong taste of his skin, quills, and fur. The taste wasn't as sweet as Sally's, but still<br>\r\n<br>\r\nvery delicious to Nicole's pallet. She swallowed, drawing his head into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, for his part, was pleasantly surprised. It was a tight fit, but nowhere near as unpleasant as he was worried it would be. He let Nicole grab his arms, flinching a little as she felt her swallow again, pulling him further down her warm, wet maw, pushing him into her expanding belly. He shuddered a little, knowing that he would soon be a part of Nicole's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole gulped over and over, Sonic's quills bending down as she swallowed more and more of him. As she slurped over his chest, she closed her eyes, unable to hide how much she was starting to enjoy this. Oddly, the feeling of being so stretched out with meat inside her belly was appealing to her. Had she become so real now that instincts of her species were starting to awaken? She would consider it later, after she had finished eating everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic squirmed reflexively as Nicole lifted him into the air. He was surprised at how pleasant being swallowed alive was. He was cramped, but the passage was slick and Nicole wasn't biting down. He trusted her not to hurt him. Although he was fighting off the urge to giggle, as Nicole's questing tongue was slurping all over his body. She lifted her head up completely, gulping down his legs and feet, sending him fully into her belly, which bulged out again as it filled with prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole belched, rubbing her swollen stomach. Sonic smirked and poked her moist, soft bellywalls from the inside. \"Someone's enjoying this,\" he teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blushed. \"Well, you've eaten so many chilidogs over the years, you've got a little flavor of that on you,\" she said, grinning weakly. The other Freedom Fighters just stared in amazement, Amy reaching forward to rub Nicole's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay in there, Sonic?\" she asked, brushing a lock of her quills out of her face, some of them falling out from how ill she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little cramped,\" he said, \"but fine. How are you even hearing me? Nicole's rather padded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole blushed, and said, \"I'm broadcasting your voice through my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, makes sense,\" Sonic said. \"Digest me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded. \"Brace yourself,\" she said. \"This will be an 'interesting' sensation. Activating biomass processing procedure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic gulped, feeling Nicole's nanotechs swarming over him. He felt his body breaking down, starting to go numb as he was absorbed by the nanites, his organics being converted into more nanotechs. Nicole's belly shrank as she became fatter, her legs and ass growing thicker as Sonic was absorbed into her. Nicole belched again, licking her lips. \"Sonic the Hedgehog.exe completely saved to disk,\" she said, looking over her shoulder at her enlarged ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally smiled, feeling Sonic 'awaken' inside of Nicole. \"Welcome,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is SO COOL!\" Sonic said, his voice echoing around the room, clearly feeling better. \"Lemme see if I can make a hologram body.\" </span></div></div>",

Plus, everyone will have limitless abilities once inside of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic blinked. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally gave Nicole an amused look. \"I'm curious m'self...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grinned. \"These bodies you have right now? Since your current form is technically data, these are basically avatars. You can reshape your bodies any way you like. Make yourself taller, stronger, faster, smaller, skinnier, fatter, male, female, whatever you like. You can even get pregnant and give birth to a new life if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Freedom Fighters, outside of Nicole's body but still listening in, looked surprised. \"...We can still have kids inside you?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled. \"Yes. Once I resolved to do this, I wanted to make your existence inside my database as pleasant as possible,\" she said. \"Plus, you'll never get sick or have to go the bathroom ever again once you're data inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally grinned. \"Well now. This is turning out to be a better and better deal all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Freedom Fighters agreed. \"Better zan dying in agony from ze Eggman's plague...\" Antoine muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic grinned. \"SWEET! This is great! Hey, I'm gonna try and make a hologram body so I can talk to everyone,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally nodded, and explained to him how to do it. Sonic nodded, and tried to concentrate, reaching out with his mind... and found nothing. He tried again, feeling something stir, but otherwise couldn't make the nanites do what he wanted. He blushed sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally shook her head. Nicole smiled. \"You'll figure it out,\" she said. \"You have plenty of time now.\" She created a monitor so Sonic could see out and the others could see him, perfectly fine. Amy stared at Sonic on the monitor, and at Nicole's fattened thighs. She frowned, trying to work out what to think in her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in reality, she turned to the others and said, \"Well, Sonic is safely stored in me now. Who's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Freedom Fighters all looked at each other, considering.</span></div></div>",

Bunnie gave Sonic an incredulous look as Nicole blushed.

Sonic facepalmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie shook her head. \"All right,\" she said, \"Let's get this over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded, and grabbed Bunnie's ears, gently stroking them, causing her to gasp. \"S-Sorry,\" she said. \"They're kinda sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled gently, and nodded. She placed the tips of Bunnie's ears in her mouth and gently sucked them in. Bunnie blushing a little. Antoine just smiled knowingly, as he had playfully nibbled on Bunnie's ears during lovemaking sessions, knowing that his love enjoyed that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, unable to help herself, slurped a little at Bunnie's ears before swallowing them, stretching her jaws easily over Bunnie's head. The cyborg gasped softly as she felt Nicole's tongue slurp over her, the lynx clearly enjoying how she tasted. The warm, went confines of Nicole's maw were oddly comforting, sending tingles of pleasure through her as her head was completely engulfed by the lynx, who found herself growing more and more ravenous the more she ate. Nicole swallowed, Bunnie feeling her head pushed into a tight, constricting tunnel. She gasped again, feeling her breasts get pushed into Nicole's maw. Part of her prayed that Nicole didn't notice her starting to get aroused. But a part of her did, a part of her greatly enjoying the feel of being consumed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole, for her part, did notice, feeling Bunnie's nipples become hard beneath her shirt and fur. She didn't comment, focusing on consuming her. She pushed the soft globes of her breasts into her jaws, sliding her mouth easily over Bunnie's stomach, moving over her metal hips. Bunnie wriggled her legs, shivering from the feel of Nicole's lips moving over her body, from the warm wetness of her stomach. She knew that she should probably be hurting right now (she was, after all, in something's stomach), but quickly realized that Nicole was making this as pleasant as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole murred, glad that Bunnie was enjoying this a little. She slurped up the cyborg's metal legs, gulping her down into her belly, which bloated out tremendously. Nicole licked her lips and stifled a belch, caressing her heavy belly, filled with cyborg robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie sighed. \"All right, Nicole-honey... Get it over with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole caressed her belly. \"You'll feel worlds better after this...\" she said. \"Beginning biomass processing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie, curled up in the tight, wet confines of Nicole's stomach, shivered softly. Her body tingled as the nanotechs began to swarm over her, her body starting to go numb as she was absorbed, converted into more nanomass for Nicole's body. She gasped, nanotechs swarming down her throat, covering her eyes and blinding her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when she woke up, she was in a bright, peaceful landscape, fully organic again. And she felt perfectly fine. She looked her normal limbs over with delight, not noticing Sally and Sonic standing over her. \"Wow...\" Bunnie said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally smiled. \"Feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much,\" Bunnie said, standing up inside the data world. \"This is... wow...\" She blushed. Sally chuckled. \"C'mon, let's make a hologram body for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic nodded. \"I think I've figured it out, too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally explained how, and Bunnie concentrated. She felt her perception expand outward, and gasped. She was still in the data world, but she was also in the real world as well. She giggled as she looked at Nicole, who was caressing her newly huge breasts. Apparently, ALL of her body had gone to Nicole's boob fat when she was digested. Antoine looked from Bunnie, to Nicole's enlarged breasts, to Bunnie again, a thoughtful expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah definitely feel better,\" she said, blushing. \"Can... Can ah ask a question?\" she said to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled. \"You may,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can... Can ah get eaten and digested like that in here?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone stared at her, wide-eyed. Bunnie blushed. \"Ah... Without going into detail, there's this game that Antoine and ah like to play. He nibbles at me like he's gonna eat me, and that turns me on a lot... Ah was wondering if we could go all the way in here?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone just stared at Antoine, who just smirked. \"What can I say? I know what my precious wife enjoys,\" he said. Still, knowing that his wife now WANTED to be eaten was interesting to him. He knew that she tasted good in passing from his playful nibbling during intimacy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole chuckled. \"Well... You can, yes. The bodies you have are just avatars based on your memory of yourself. You can do whatever you want to them, even destroy them completely and make new ones. You exist as programs inside me. The bodies are just toys to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie blushed. Sonic looked at Sally, grinning pervertedly. \"REALLY now. Toys, eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally rolled her eyes. \"Let's get everyone safe inside Nicole's stomach, first,\" she said. \"Then we can talk about experiments in perversity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntoine, Amy, Tails, and Rotor traded looks, feeling better about being eaten by Nicole. Nicole, for her part, was enjoying this more and more. Something about eating her friends and turning them into her fat, make herself curvier and curvier.... She rubbed her rounded belly, inflated ass, and bulging breasts, blushing, knowing that this fat was her friends now added to her primary avatar. She turned to the remaining four Freedom Fighters, and said, \"Well, shall we continue?\" </span></div></div>",

It was a rare, red-colored diamond the size of her fist, worth a fortune.  She had taken a great risk to get it, and on top of that, she had done a good deed in the process as well.  The gemstone had been slated for use in a weapon Robotnik wanted to use to destroy Station Square.  She stole it before he did, and when he showed up, he took the blame for stealing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, she hadn't INTENDED to do a good deed, she just wanted the gem and didn't know what Robotnik had planned to begin with.

Once finished Rouge moved slowly in front of Amy's head and lied down. Rouge's mouth suddenly opened up real wide, like a snakes. She brought Amy's head into her mouth, waking her up. The last thing Amy saw was the inside of Rouge's mouth as her face was pressed into Rouge's tongue. Rouge clamped her mouth shut, licking Amy's tasty meat anxiously. With one big gulp, Amy's head vanished down Rouge's throat, causing it to bulge. Another quick gulp brought her breasts into Rouge's mouth, and she slurped them up hungrily, slightly chewing on them. *gulp* Now Amy's stomach rested on her tounge, the smooth skin becoming drenched in saliva. Now Rouge pulled Amy's butt inward and another gulp brought her to Amy's thigh's in. Delicious. *gulp* Now the calfs were inside of Rouge's mouth and her stomach was becoming huge! Another gulp brought Amy's feet into her mouth and Rouge sucked on the delicious meat. She licked Amy's wiggling toes slowly, savoring the taste. With one last gulp, Rouge brought Amy's feet down her throat and into her gut. Rouge let out a quick burp and patted her stomach, watching Amy struggle.</span></div></div>",

He took his time, looking through what he had come to view as the 'menu.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails chuckled to himself and patted his belly.  He didn't know why he had come to start eating people, he just knew that he enjoyed it.  Cream and Vanilla had been VERY filling meals, and the feel of his fat belly jiggling was wonderful.  He wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Maybe he could eat Rouge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of the slender, sexy bat's body digesting away in his stomach made Tails salivated even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, he made his way to Rouge's office and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on in,\" Rouge said in a friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails frowned.

Tails reacted instinctively, moving with all the skills gained from years as a Freedom Fighter, and disarmed Rouge with a single move.  But before he could attack her, she knocked him down with a swift kick to his expanded stomach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted, landing on his butt and looking up at Rouge.

Come on, kiddo.  I'm hungry and you're my next meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails blinked in surprise.  Rouge was eating people too?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had little time to think, however, as Rouge came at him in a knife-fighter's crouch, the blade slashing at him.

Red stained his white fur as he desperately dodged the ravenous bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge, for her part, was getting frustrated.  The hunger inside her was maddening.

Only individuals of a certain\u2026 well, \u2018prominence in the universe\u2019 for lack of a better term, will be affected.

Her apartment was beautiful, an opulet room with the best furniture and silk sheets on her bed.  And the best thing, in her view, was that she owned the apartment entirely.  No paying rent to a landlord.  The bat was curvacious, and unlike most Mobians was not completely furred.  She had white fur on her tail and most of her head, covering her charming ears and around her eyes, but other than that, she was bare, with tawny, well-tanned skin, an athletic frame, a shapely rump and hips, and immense breasts.  Her bat wings were folded comfortably against her back as she lay on her side, drifting off to sleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was then that Dr. Eggman's virus affected her.  <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tHer stomach rumbled, starting her out of the nap she was about to take.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Huh,\" she said, rubbing her stomach.  \"I guess that sandwich I had before my shower wasn't enough.\"  She shrugged, and got up, sauntering over to the kitchen, not bothering to get dressed.

Thick homemade bread (people would be surprised to know that she knew how to cook), sliced roast beef, lettuce, tomato, onions, pepper jack cheese, and mustard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at it.  \"A rare indulgence,\" she said.  She ate the sandwich, savoring each bite.  For some reason, though, the food tasted incredible.  Even more than usual, and she loved it.  All the flavors, the scents, they were more intense.  She moaned in bliss as she ate, and before Rouge knew it, she had eaten the entire sandwich.  \"Huh... Guess I was really enjoying it.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe patted her stomach, feeling how stuffed she was.  Surely that would have satisfied her cravings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t*gurgle* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"...The heck?  I'm still hungry?\" Rouge said, confused.  She shrugged, and decided to top it off with some fruit.  She started with eating an apple from a bowl on the table, casually resting at her kitchen table while eating it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn't.  It just made her hungrier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe ate all of the apples in the bowl, cores and all.  She then ate all of her cereal, drank all of her milk, ate all of her bread, stuffing the food in her mouth frantically.  Her face was covered in food stains, crumbs building up in her cleavage as her belly swelled with the amount of food she was stuffing into it.  She just got hungrier and hungrier.  It was good, but it wasn't what her body wanted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sat down on the floor, surrounded by food wrappers and boxes, groaning.  She felt so stuffed, but she was so damn hungry.  Her stomach was gurgling, rapidly processing the food in her bloated stomach, her breasts and butt swelling ever so slightly.  And she wanted more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What the hell is wrong with me!?\" Rouge said, clutching at her belly.  A hunger pang hit her, so powerful now that it hurt.  \"Gotta eat...\" </span></div></div>",

It exploded harmlessly against the cobra's thick, fat coils.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Feel better?\" the cobra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Are you alive?\" Eggman asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe cobra chuckled, amused.  \"For a given immortal equivalent of alive, yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then no, I don't,\" Eggman said grumpily, his mustache bristling in fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe cobra sneered.  \"It doesn't matter anyway.  You all are here at my whim.  Each of you who remember multiple lives are an amalgam of each version of that person.\"  A spotlight shined on Sally Acorn.  \"For example, Princess Sally Acorn here is an amalgam of two different Sally Acorns, from two different realities.  She has the memories of both worlds, for she has lived both worlds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSally, remembering her experiences as Metal Sally in one timeline, clenched her fists angrily. \"Yes.  And thank you for reminding me of the horror I was suffering in that one reality...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe cobra ignored her.  \"Sonic and Eggman are the biggest amalgams.  As they are the 'focal point' characters for you worlds.  Yes they're more important than all of you GET OVER IT.  If you notice allies or enemies missing, its because I didn't want to bring them over.  So there.  As for me, I am simply Predator, the embodiment of hunger and desire.  I have brought you all here against your will because I want to play a game.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And if we refuse?\" Eggman demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then you and everything and everyone you love ceases to exist.  Painfully,\" the cobra said.  And for a brief moment, he let everyone feel the pain they would suffer as they were erased.  Once they had recovered, they all looked up at the cobra, frightened, furious, but willing to cooperate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe cobra smirked.  \"As the embodiment of hunger and desire, I enjoy eating and fucking.  I want to see all of you do it because... well, I'm bored, have too much power, and can make you.  You will all be sent to a Mobius where NONE of you exist.  I order you to seduce and eat as many people as possible.  I will give you my ability to swallow and digest anything whole, and be healthy and move at extremes of weight.  To make it interesting, I'll make it a competition.  Each member of the winning team shall be granted a wish, including each VERSION of a teammate.  Everyone else will simply be sent home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You want us to EAT PEOPLE!?\" someone cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yes,\" the cobra said.  \"And I'd really suggest doing so.  You don't want the villains getting a wish, do you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone suddenly glanced over at Eggman's faction and the other villain faction, who were all looking contemplative.  Reluctantly, the more heroic among them realized that they'd have to become predators to earn that wish.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe cobra, sensing everyone's willingness to participate, grinned.  \"Then go.  Feast on the world.  A few things to know - You will have the years of each person you devour added to your lifespan while on this world, so you will potentially live forever.  No betraying your team.  You can eat each other, but you'll respawn and it won't count towards your predation count.  Otherwise, eat and fuck to your heart's content.  The game ends when I grow bored!  And you'll have my attention for ages, I think...  I may have to move you to another Mobius.  And don't think you can let your teammates do the eating for you.  I can force you to become a bestial predator, a werebeast similar to what Sonic turned into that one time.\"  The cobra grinned.  \"The Predalympics begin!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone vanished, reappearing in a base with their team name on it.  And reluctantly, they began to spread out and plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs for the robots who didn't have bodies like Nicole and Phage, they appeared elsewhere, not sure what was going on, but deciding to go help their friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Teams: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Freedom Fighters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles 'Tails' Prower, Amy Rose, Sally Acorn, Antoine D'Coolette, Rotor Walrus, Bunnie D'Coolette, Nicole the Lynx, Big the Cat, Cream the Rabbit, Knuckles the Echidna, Vector the Crocodile, Charmy the Bee, Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon, Ray the Flying Squirrel, Silver the Hedgehog, Blaze the Cat, Marine the Raccoon, Sticks the Badger, Tangle the Lemur, Whisper the Wolf, Julie-Su the Echidna, Mina the Mongoose, Saffron the Bee<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Egg Baddies: Dr. Eggman, Thunderbolt the Chinchilla, Clove the Pronghorn, Conquering Storm, Lord Mordred Hood, Nephthys the Vulture, Maw the Thylacine, Ahkhlut the Orca, Tundra the Walrus, Abyss the Squid, Battle Lord Kukku XV, Axel the Water Buffalo, Wendy Naugus, Phage the Viral Lynx, Cassia the Pronghorn, Speedy the Kukku, Carrotia the Rabbit, Bearenger the Grizzly, Falkewulf, Lien-Da the Echidna, Regina Ferrum, Infinite, Rough, Tumble, Drago the Wolf, Doctor Starline<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam Sidestory Saviors: Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, Madonna Garnet, Tikal the Echidna, Shade the Echidna, Lupe the Wolf, Dulcy the Dragon, Jian the Tiger, Bunker the Tortoise, Cinder the Pheasant, Spike the Porcupine, Sonar the Fennec, Trevor Burrow, Bow the Sparrow, Thorn the Lop, Gold the Tenrec, Captain Striker, Lt.

It had been almost a year since the defeat of the Brain's Brotherhood of Evil.  Supervillains were scarce now, usually only going after Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, or someone else of that level, and stopping regular crimes just didn't have as much pizzazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had matured a lot since then, especially physically.  She had gotten taller, and had expanded in the chest and rump areas (although as buxom as she was now, Starfire had blossomed even further).  She sometimes flaunted her appearance, using the new 'bounce' in her step to distract Beast Boy from making a tasteless joke.  It was undignified, and it caused him to flirt with her more, but it saved her from making more of an effort than needed to stop his gross jokes.  Besides, she was starting to like Beast Boy's lavacious remarks about her looks.  She had also let her hair grow out a little longer, and went without her hood more often.  This got her a bit more attention, but still, it was just frivolous on her part.  Normally it would be out of character for her, but she was happy now, and getting tired of being a standoffish goth.  She wanted to do more with her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she couldn't tonight.  Beast Boy was out at the arcade, breaking in (or just plain breaking) the new games that had come in, Cyborg was wrapped up in his work, and Robin and Starfire were out on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snickered softly, and wondered if they would be caught making out in midair on the news again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, and flipped through some of her spellbooks.  Maybe there was something interesting in there to cast.  Nothing involving summoning, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she paused, noticing a small spellbook she hadn't seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe levitated it over to her hands and opened it.  Hastily scribbled notes were inside its pages, written in an ancient language, one she didn't recognize.  She frowned, and was about to put it aside, when the text flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Raven was fascinated with the text.  She had to try out at least one of the spells.  She quickly scanned the text, spotting text she did recognize, instructions on how to set up the ritual and what words to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took just a few moments of telekinetic levitation of various items, but a pentagram protective circle was quickly drawn on the floor, artifacts representing earth, wind, fire, and water set at the appropriate four points and candles surrounding the circle and lit.  She sat cross-legged in the circle and began chanting the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the book exploded in a cloud of energy.</span></div></div>",

She checked around that she had all of her limbs, and she tried to do new things, but she was still the same Raven. However, unlike how Raven instructed multiple times, Beast Boy got off his arcade games and peeked into Raven's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raveeennnn? Whatcha eating?\" he asked looking around and smelling something delicious. Raven gave Beast Boy a bad stare as she decided not to reply. She merely just closed the door. She had no clue what Beast Boy was talking about so she would ignore it for the moment. Beast Boy, however, could never ignore his instincts to fetch good food! He morphed into a fly and went into Raven's room. He changed back to a human, out of Raven's sight, and smelt the room looking around quietly. He then smirked. He knew what the smell was now! Beast Boy approached Raven who was practicing spells. She became easily frightened and angry. \"Give me one good reason I shouldn't shoot you out of the tower right now!\" she shouted. Beast Boy smiled. \"You shouldn't\" he stated, \"because you smell like delicious pizza.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then suddenly changed his form into a lion pouncing on Raven. \"And pizza is good for everyone!\" he said as he started to lick Raven. She was powerless to him for some reason. It seemed a side effect of the already awful spell. Beast Boy continued on licking the tasty Raven before starting to gulp her up into his belly. She erked as she didn't enjoy this at all and shouted in retaliation loudly. When he was done eating, Beast Boy went back to his human form with a huge stomach. He patted it as Raven had finally quieted down. \"Dunno if I should leave you in there or let you out! Can't say you tasted bad though!\" he said with a large burp before going back to his video games.</span></div></div>",

He was coy about it, building up to the challenge, and amazingly enough finding himself having fun and getting along with Yugi and his friends, Anzu, Otogi, Shizuka, Jonouchi, and Honda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few turns later, Seto made his last play of the game.  \"Lemme see, draw and play fusion substitute Vasago - God Of Destruction, Fusion Gate with Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon to make Master Of Dragon Knight.  Activate facedown Harpy's Feather Sweep to wipe out your facedown cards... Heheh.  And leaving your attack mode Retrained Elven Swordsman comepletely helpless to defense itself. I attack, and after damage calculation... I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto grinned smugly as Yugi scowled at his cards.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonouchi laughed, he couldn't help it.  \"I guess it was the other you that was the good Duelist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi grumbled, picking up his cards and putting them back into his deck.  \"Well, he was the one with all the nerve at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto chuckled, kissing his Blue Eyes White Dragons and shuffling them back into his deck.  \"Most satisfying.  Thank you Yugi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi grinned.  \"Hey, I'll get better.  And then I'll beat you just as much as the other me did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtogi smirked from where he lay on Yugi's bed, sifting through his own deck.  \"You really think so?  After all, Kaiba's had ample time to strategize against every monster you have ever played.  Especially since you've decided not to add any new monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJonouchi threw a pillow at him.  \"Who's side are you on?!\" he snapped, although he grinned as he said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls giggled, trading jokes about the boys in whispers.  Kaiba was close enough to listen in, and grinned as he heard Anzu tell a doozy about Jonouchi that made Shizuka blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, Jonouchi.  Stay neutral or I'll tell you what Anzu just said about you,\" Seto said, causing Anzu to blush in embarassment now.  Shizuka and Yugi giggled as Otogi looked interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm interested,\" he said.  Jonouchi threw the other pillow that was on the loveseat in Yugi's room at him and glared at Anzu.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you tell her, Anzu?\" he demanded.  Anzu just smiled innocently and shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonda, who was staying out of the line of fire, watched from near a window as Jonouchi tried to get Anzu to tell what she said about him.  Failing that, he turned to Seto to try him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto just glared at him for a few moments and he gave up without asking anything.  Everyone other than Jonouchi, Seto included, cracked up with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonda, recovering himself, looked out the window again... and sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Yugi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Honda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We defeated all the Doma guys, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi nodded.  \"Yeah.  Remember, we faced Rafael, Varon, and Amelda at that last tournament Pegasus held?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonda nodded.  \"Dartz and his magic was completely destroyed, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone traded worried looks.  \"Yeah...\" Yugi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Kaiba, is your hologram tech malfunctioning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" Seto snapped, \"I'd have been informed immediately if it was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonda nodded slowly.  Everyone was VERY nervous now.  \"I think we're in trouble, then,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Jonouchi asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonda turned back to them, grinning weakly.  \"There's a Duel Monster outside the window.\"</span></div></div>",

His gut, bloating out through his shirt, hung down over his belt, gurgling and churning heavily to digest his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-There is such a thing as karmic justice in this universe,- Gene said, licking his lips and patting his stomach, which contained two women he had eaten earlier this evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced up at the glowing clock and saw that it was 10:00 PM.  No one else was up at this hour, so he decided he would grab a drink and sleep on the couch, so as not to disturb anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when he came into the business' main lobby, he found that someone WAS up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelfina, sporting a large, but not as large as Gene's, belly, sat contentedly on the couch, rubbing her stomach and watching television.  This didn't surprise Gene, because as a Bio-Android, one powered by the infinite magic of the Galactic Leyline, she had complete control over her body and needed little sleep.  In addition, she could also control her stomach's functions, giving her the option of NOT digesting her prey if she wished, for future disgorging.  And if she did digest her prey, she could restore him or her if she so chose with the Leyline's magic.  (A fact which he could attest to, having gone through the process himself early on.  He wondered briefly whom she had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a moment, he decided to ask her outright.  He caalled out a greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelfina looked up and smiled. \"Oh, hi Gene.  I didn't hear you come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene shrugged.  \"I didn't want to wake anyone up.  Who's in your belly?\" he asked, pointing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim,\" Melfina said, chuckling, \"he and Aisha got into a fight, he got her mad enough for her to turn into that cat/wolf/whatever it is form of hers, and quite literally jumped into my mouth to avoid getting munched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wimp,\" Gene teased, tapping Jim through Melfina's belly, causing the young boy to snarl angrily.  \"Where's Aisha now?\" he asked Melfina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelfina giggled. \"Probably on a rampage or arrested.  She'll be back by tomorrow,\" she said.  After a moment a thought came to her.  \"Hey Gene?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Mel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to join Jim inside me?  I know you like it in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene looked thoughtful for a moment, considering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n((Edited 1/7/2005 by FFtheSnake))</span></div></div>",

She smiled, and began to caress Gene's tremendous belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who have you eaten this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene smirked.  \"Remember that voodoo priestess from 1st Earth that cursed me, Jim, Suzuka, and Aisha a while back, made us all hungry and stretchy enough to eat people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelfina blinked, then grinned widely.  \"You got her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene grinned, and burped.  \"And one of her servants, too.

For one thing, he enjoyed Melfina caressing his belly.  For another thing, he was just tired.  It had been a long day.  Tracking down that priestess wasn't an easy job.  Gene had gone to Fred Luo for help and Fred had pointed Gene in the right direction.  The priestess was at a bar, supposely waiting for someone named Jim O'Haver.  Gene had tricked the priestess (and her assistant) into the alley beside the bar. That's when he ate them both.   Gene had eaten the priestess first.  He licked his lips as he remembered eating her not an hour ago.  The priestess had made an excellent meal and the assistant made an even better dessert.  Gene burped as the door slowly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       It was Suzuka, which sported a huge belly, and had a kid in tow.  The kid was probably no older than Jim Hawking was, but he was probably taller than Jim by a good foot.  The boy had blond hair and a small tattoo on his left arm.  The tattoo was a red rose, probaly not 12 inches long.   Suzuka brought the kid over to the couch in front of Gene.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n      \"Bringing home strays?\" asked Gene as he looked at the kid.  The kid said nothing, but looked wide-eyed at Gene's belly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Not exactly\" said Suzuka.  \"I saw him snooping around outside\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Let me go!\" said the kid.  \"Rose won't be happy with you now that you have me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"Who's Rose?\" asked Melfina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n       \"My employer you might say\" said the kid dryly.

Like any food, people tended to take hours to digest.  He remembered the first time that Melfina had eaten him.  It took her almost 6 hours to be digested.

Starwind and Hawking Enterprises only had room for six people and it had six rooms.  There seemed to be no room for Kevin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"I can sleep anywhere\" said Kevin.  \"I've been doing that alot since I met Rose\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"You can sleep in my room\" said Melfina.  \"I hardly ever sleep.

Suzuka went to her room as well, leaving Gene and Melfina alone on the couch.

Sure, it was theoretically wrong to eat the ships favorite pet and it would probably get her major complaints from Ed, but it would definitely be worth it. Jet and Spike would reprimand her for eating Ein, although they would probably just do it because they did not think of getting to the last piece of meat on board. The easiest to sate was going to be Ed, after they, land she could pick up some piece of shiny scrap for the eccentric genius and that would keep Ed out of her hair for about a few months. Of coarse she could just claim that the dog accidentally got sucked out of the ship by way of the garbage disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a plan and a contingency plotted out, Faye looked towards Ein with a big friendly smile and slowly crept to the morsel of food. The dog turned to her, Faye freezed up in mid step and continued to hold onto her warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Ein, come here boy,\u201d She said sweetly. Maybe it was because Ein was a data dog and had a vastly more advanced brain then a normal dog, or maybe it was the fact that Saliva was dripping from Faye\u2019s big smile. Whatever the reason Ein took one look at Faye and hastily ran the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Faye gripes as she hurries to catch up to her meal. Ein scurries across the cold metal floor looking to and for an escape from his pursuer. He runs under a pile of discarded boxes that had once contained spare parts for the Bebops engine. This little obstacle is nothing to the starving women; she uses her years of experience tracking fugitives and leaps over the boxes without losing her pace. Within moments, Faye is running a few feet behind the fleeing dog, seeing her target in range she strikes. Throwing herself towards Ein, she grasps him by the hind legs and hold tight. Faye pulls Ein towards her chest and securely holds the yapping mutt with all her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor making me chase you around, I think I\u2019ll boil you alive like a lobster.\u201d Faye chuckles with glee as hold onto the dog like a newly won prize at the carnival. Her smile disappears when Ein starts to loudly bark and scratch at her with his tiny yet sharp claw. Faye pulls the dog away from her body, his tiny legs kicking futilely in the air, but this does nothing to stop the noise. Afraid of being found out by the crew, Faye reaches to cover the muzzle of the yapping mongrel, but as her hand touches his snout Ein pulls back and bites Faye.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cArrrggg,\u201d Faye grunts wrenching her hand away. She glares at the dog hatefully and screams at him, \u201cYou want to bite me pal, well I can bite back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, Faye opens her mouth as wide as possible and pulls Ein to her gapping maw. When Ein\u2019s little head entered Faye\u2019s mouth, her jaws started to be pushed open further and the dog continued into her mouth. Faye gagged at the rough taste of the fur, but ignored it as she felt the wet nose of the pup push into her throat. The feeling of something entering her windpipe woke Faye up from her rage-induced daze and she scarcely believed what she was seeing. Her lips were around the canines belly and half of him was lying inside her stretched out jaws. She had wanted to eat Ein, but not raw. Faye shrugged her shoulders, might as well finish off the dog now while he is half way inside. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both females blinked at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEIN!\u201d Ed shrieked then dashed up to Faye as fast as possible and grasped her pet by the hind legs. A few inches of Ein escaped Faye\u2019s mouth, seeing that her uncooked meal was getting away Faye clamped her lips down tightly and closed her jaws firmly on the pooch. With each girl, holding the dog, it came down to a tug a war over who would claim the dog. To try and get the dog down pronto, Faye started to take slow swallows. The slow repetition of convulsing muscles in Faye\u2019s throat dragged the dog back into her mouth and left only his tiny back legs and limp tail free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEppp!\u201d Ed shrieked recognizing that Ein was only a gulp away from being lost forever in the belly of the curvy bounty hunter. Ed refused to give up, so she jumped up and put her feet against Faye\u2019s stomach and used it as advantage to pull Ein out. The extra weight of Ed caused Faye to lose her balance and she started to dance around with Ein hanging out of her mouth and Ed hanging onto Ein. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye sucks in air sharply from her nose as she gave it another try to swallow up her hard earned meal. Her throat widened and Ein continued down her esophagus until Faye could feel his tail brush against the top of her mouth.

In the back of Faye's mind there was a small thought that maybe she could finish her meal with Ed included, she hadn't thought she could literary eat Ein, but here she was with the tiny fur ball hanging down her throat. If Ed didn't want to lose her precious pet then maybe she could journey with him into her body. Still slightly inebriated from hunger pains, the idea of eating a small child didn't worry Faye in the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any doubts, Faye closed her lips around Ed's elbows and began to suck the girl into her expanding maw. Ed blinked several times, as she was pulled closer into Faye. To her immature mind, this was all some kind of game and the improbability and ludicrousness of being eaten by another human being didn't factor into her view. Now seeing this as a game and not a dangerous situation, Ed gave a toothy grin and drove her head forward into Faye's unsuspecting mouth. Faye's eyes shot up with shock, having the head of her victim willingly thrusted into her mouth was not something she had expected. With Ed's head firmly lodged in her mouth Faye's checks and jaw was being pushed out to an unfeasible size. Instead of the anticipated pain Faye had expected from having her mouth pried open, there was only a numbing sensation along her mouth. As Faye continued down to Ed's shoulders a giggle vibrated inside her slobbering mouth from the girl head deep in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd really was enjoying seeing the inside of Faye's mouth; it was so neat and wet. She now wished that she had felt it up when her hands had first been inserted, but now that they were half way down the throat holding Ein, all she could do was nuzzle the dripping teeth with her cheek. The saliva in the mouth was all over her face coating it so she could be swallowed more easily. Ed's wet hair was obstructing her full view of the mouth, but even with the red soggy locks in the way, she could still see enough detail with the little bit of light coming behind her from the cracks in the mouth. Ed watched intently without a shred of trepidation as her head was pulled towards the already stretched throat. With her head only dangling inches from the throat Ed giggles once more and turns her head slightly to catch a glimpse of the outside moments before she's draw into the esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye swallowed greatly and Ed's entire head was pushed down the throat, her flat chest was pushed into Faye's mouth where it rested on the wet slab of flesh that was Faye's tongue. A large round blob had formed on Faye's long elegant neck and it was bobbed from side to side, when Faye breathed in from her nose her skin would tighten around the blob and it would take on the vague appearance of a child's head. What was most odd aside from the fact that Faye had a face like blob in her throat was that the face had an almost insane smile, but Faye couldn't see that so it didn't occur to her as odd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud, wet gulp, Faye tilted her head back some, rolling Ed's stomach all the way into her expanded jaws followed by her waist. Ed felt her hands push into a less restricting area, in surprise she let go of Ein who she had been holding the whole time. Bellow her she heard a small splash and the sound of something moving around. To Ed's childish mind she thought that she had reached the bathtub inside Faye, what she was really at was the stomach and instead of bath water what lied beneath was a mixture of saliva, stomach mucus and a little of the deadly digestive acid that was dripping down along the stomach. Ed had no idea what she was heading into. Ed tried to scream out 'bath time!' but her head was still wrapped in the tight walls of the throat so it came out as, 'Waat piaaam!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaye had secured Ed's waist into her hungry maw and was going to work down towards the red heads feet. By lowering her hand to Ed's Knees Faye is able to push the girl upwards towards her mouth more easily. Every time Faye would push on Ed, she'd force her mouth and throat to relax so the girl could slide in more effortlessly. With every inch that was force feed into Faye, her stomach would expand a little bit more, already it looked that she was half way through pregnancy. Faye clamed her jaws down around Ed's shorts and started to tilt her head back, she was fairly certain that she had a good grip of the girl and the extra help from gravity would help her get the well earned meal into her faster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inward down cline made Ed slide down twice as fast then when Faye had been forcing her in, ever few seconds Faye would take small swallows and let her throat ripple over Ed. Faye watched with interest as Ed's legs leisurely moved down her throat and into her stomach. She caught one last glimpse of Ed before she was close into the hot, wet darkness of her own body. One final gulp Sent Ed traveling down her neck and disappear into her chest, only to reappear as a growing bulge in your stomach. Ed dropped suddenly into the soup inside Faye's stomach, in the complete darkness she fumbled for Ein. When she had the pup, she brought him to her chest and hugged him to her body. With her companion found she curled up into a tight compact ball and wiggling around until she was comfortable and started to fall asleep. Faye slumped next to a pile of boxes and stroking her oversized bulging belly. She had no idea what was going to happen next but she had a gut feeling that mushrooms weren't going to be apart of her new diet.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Human-gargoyle relations were at an all time low since their revelation, but Xanatos, making good on his promise to repay the gargoyles for saving his son and then some, was doing a lot of spin control.  Brooklyn even got a thank you from someone he saved from a mugger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat still didn't stop problems from arising.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemona was still around, her insanity even worse since she had accidentally alienated her own daughter, Brooklyn's clanmate, Angela, from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new group of bigots, the vicious Quarrymen, had arisen.  They were led by Jon Castaway, formerly John Canmore, who was ironically the more gentle of the three Canmore siblings before losing his mind after a series of accidents and misunderstandings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were sightings of Goliath's evil clone, the megalomaniacal Thailog, creating the possibility that he may be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mutate Wolf, along with the cyborgs Hyena and Jackal, the last still-evil members of Pack, had been sighted in the city recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of that, it was getting harder and harder for Brooklyn not to be hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know why his appetite had become so intense.  Hudson told him is was a common thing among beaked gargoyles to get a bigger appetite than most as they got older, giving some vague religious reason involving a connection to the gargoyle's supreme deity, known simply as the Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn scowled, and wondered if the Dragon had an appetite like his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been eating more and more lately, eating so much at meals that BROADWAY of all people was suggesting he cut back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would love to.  He was starting to get a visible pot belly in his once slender frame from all his eating.  But no matter how much he ate, it was never enough.  He never felt satisfied.  He wish he could figure out what it was he needed to eat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the concussion grenade hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrooklyn let out a surprised cry of pain, falling from the sky like a rock and landing in an alley, mercifully falling into a dumpster full enough to cushion his fall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned, slowly pulling himself out of the dumpster, which thankfully was filled with papers and not food stuffs.  After quickly checking to see if his wings were badly damaged, he looked up to see who had fired the grenade at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scowled.  \"Oh great.  Not you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>=====================<br>\r\nA rooftop in NYC...<br>\r\n=====================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo young lovers were enjoying a night off, sharing in each other's bodies and simply savoring the night.  This wouldn't be unusual, but these two were not your usual couple.  For you see, they were both gargoyles.  Noble creatures, vaguely demonic in appearance, that turned to stone during the day, emerging each night to protect their home from criminals.  This urge to protect was a part of their very souls, making them the greatest protectors of this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranted, aside from a few exceptions, humanity was scared to death of them, but that is a story for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the two young lovers was named Angela.  Her skin was a light, greyish blue  and forehead sported two small horns with curved slightly to the side.  Her ears were elfish and her breasts were melon-sized and very soft and perky.  The other was a greenish male with a prominent lower jaw, wide ears, and  a bald-head sporting a trio of small horns in a vertical line up his head.  He was very fat, and his vast, round gut hung down over his waist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them couldn't have been happier together.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had been courting for a while, Broadway struck by both her beauty and the fact that she had her father's nobility and her mother's strong, firey spirit.  (Fortunetly for everyone, that was ALL Angela had got of her mother's personality, since her mother was a human-hating genocidal rogue gargoyle named Demona.)  Angela had fallen for Broadway's sensitivity and charming, innocent nature.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just a couple weeks ago, they had consumated their relationship physically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey now took every chance they had to enjoy each other's body, both lovers finding ways to get each other incredibly aroused, making sex incredibly satisfying each time.  Finally, after night after night of sneaking off during patrol runs, Angela's father, the massive mountain of a gargoyle known as Goliath, had given them an official night off to do whatever they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter bringing each other to climax five times, they had stopped to catch their breath and relax, staring up at the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs said earlier, each one had discovered a particular technique for getting their lover hot and bothered.  Broadway had discovered that Angela loved having her breasts licked and tease.  So good was he that at one point he got her to orgasm just by stimulating her breasts.  Angela figured out how to turn on Broadway almost immediately: feeding him.  She would stuff Broadway until his belly aches, the feeling of fullness and eating so much turning him on incredibly.  Angela herself had grown to love the feeling of her lover's fat belly resting on top of her as they made love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two loved each other deeply, savoring each other's bodies.  Sometimes, they even combined each other's fantasies, Angela pretending that Broadway was eating her alive as he licked her over and over, or that she was feeding him to prevent him from gobbling her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough more and more, the two young gargoyles started to harbor the fantasy that they could actually go through with it, both of them having the fantasy of Broadway scarfing Angela up and digesting her into bellyfat.  So intense was this sexual fantasy that it would turn them on even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted throughout the night, discussing the future, planning the possibility of having children, setting up a rookery for their eggs.  The mating season was coming up, the time when gargoyles across the world would be at their most fertile.  They talked with amusement about Goliath possibly siring an egg on Elisa, his human companion whom he'd become very close to in passing weeks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the sun started to come up.  They gathered up their clothes, not bothering to get dressed again, and leaped off of the building, spreading their wings and catching an air current which carried them back to the castle that was their home.  They greeted their clanmates as they returned, teasing Brooklyn lightly by flirting with each other, getting an annoyed grunt from the beaked, maroon-skinned gargoyle.  He had gotten over losing Angela to his best friend, but he was still annoyed when they got on his case, the annoyance compounded by the fact that they came back nude.  Goliath gave Angela a moderately scolding look, but said nothing more.  Judging by his scent, he and Elisa had been sharing a similar evening together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rose, and each gargoyle took a frightening position as the sun washed over them, turning them to stone for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next night, the gargoyles broke free from their stone shells, roaring, their eyes glowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoliath greeted the others, leaping down from his high perch to talk with the others.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broadway, you're staying here tonight.  Angela, get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" they both said, although they knew that there would be no arguing with Goliath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have plenty of time to make out.  Tonight is Broadway's turn to guard the castle,\" Goliath said, staring sternly at Angela.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela put her talons on her hips and snorted.  \"This coming from someone who visits his girlfriend every night after giving a lecture on responsibility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoliath smirked.  \"That is completely beside the point, and besides, I'm the leader and I'm allowed some minor hypocrasy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that apply to seconds-in-command?\" Brooklyn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only when they're in command,\" Goliath said, making a rare joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone laughed, and Angela and Broadway put their clothes on.  The others took off, Angela a little behind the others as she stayed behind to give Broadway a goodbye kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBroadway sighed, watching his lover as she left.  He started to look for Bronx, the wingless gargoyle beast always good for some fun, when he realized that Hudson had taken Bronx with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phooey,\" Broadway said, \"Well... I could go play with Alex, but the Xanatoses are taking him out to a show.  And I always raid the kitchen.... Maybe I could check out Lexington's lab.\"  He continued to mutter to himself as he went inside, trying to figure out what to do all evening.  \"Yeah... That sounds good, he's been working on some of Sevarius's stuff.  Or maybe I could go to the library... Catch up on my reading...  Hmmm...\"</span></div></div>",

If I am to continue working with my creations, most of whom want to turn my intestines into decorative bunting, I will need some protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only illumination in this room was a spotlight coming from the ceiling.  It focused on a muscular figure wearing chains that bound it around the wrists and nothing else, laying conconsious on a raised metal platform.  The figure was vaguely humanoid in appearance, albiet possessing massive batwings, black fur all over his body, and a head like a black panther.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Talon, a mutate created by a mad scientist named Doctor Anton Sevarius.  He used to be a human, a police pilot named Derek Maza.  He and his fellow mutates, including his mate, a lioness named Maggie, are allies to the clan of gargoyles protecting Manhattan, his sister the mate of the clan leader.  He and his mutates protected the underground, the homeless.  He and the other mutates have given up wanting a cure, growing to like their powerful mutate bodies (even Maggie, who was near suicidal the first few weeks of her change), wanting nothing more than revenge on Sevarius for changing them against their will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Talon's horror, he would soon find that he was in the clutches of Sevarius yet again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalon groaned weakly, slowly coming awake.  He looked around him, hearing only a soft voice in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where... Where am I?\" he asked in a gruff voice, \"Who's out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're awake.  Excellent,\" said the voice, a familiar red-haired figure coming into the beam of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar anger suffused Talon.  He roared, baring his razor-sharp fangs, and tried to lunge forward, summoning electricity to fire at the mad scientist.  But something in the clamps around his wrists kicked in and turned his electricity inward.  Talon screamed in agony, his body briefly crackling with his own electrical ability turned against him, and collapsed on the platform, barely able to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSevarius chuckled and went over to pat Talon on the head like a pet cat, ignoring the angry growls of the helpless mutate.  \"There's a good lad.  You behave now.  We have much to do.  Yes indeed...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It had taken a while, but with the help of  her lover, who had also been victimized by Sevarius and become a panther mutate, and the mysterious gargoyles, including Brooklyn, whom had just flown over her, and who had never really gotten over his crush on her, she had managed to accept her lot in life and use her newfound strength and powers to help others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe, her lover (now called Talon) and a tiger mutate named Claw had set up shop in an abandoned underground facility, using it to give a warm place to stay for the homeless of the city.

He was one of the greatest warriors of the village, his skill surpassed only by his general, who lacked the ambition to try and overthrow his longtime friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Chouji Akimachi, and he was a ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not just any ninja.  The Akimachi clan had special abilities, the ability to become giants if they so chose, or even simply expand part of their body to use as a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this that Chouji made frequent use of.  For he used this ability to enlarge his jaws and throat, devouring all of his enemies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji loved to eat, and devouring an enemy of Konoha gave him tremendous satisfaction.  Because of his gluttony in this, he had become tremendously fat, almost 700 pounds.  But still he was able to move with speed and grace despite his size, making him nearly invincible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut honestly, he didn't like fighting.  He didn't like the fact that Konoha had enemies.  (Tasty though they were.)  He preferred to let his people live in peace, and live the good life in between meetings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust he and his harem of beauties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji, musing over Konoha's history and how peaceful things had become since he had started consuming the foes of Konoha, waddled down the hall to the room where his harem was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe through open the silk-lined doors and smiled, his arms outstretched in an inviting gesture.  \"Ladies!  Hokage Chouji is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis harem, Sakura, Ino, Tenten, Hinata, Kurenai, Temari, Tsunade, Shizune, Anko, and Kin, all lay snuggled together on silken pillows.  Each one was clad in nothing more than a transparent silk top and silk loincloth, jeweled adorning their wrists and ankles, each one sporting a massively pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was the first to notice him.  \"MASTER!\" she cried, getting up and running over to him, the other girls following and nuzzling his bulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, don't crowd!  There's more than enough Chouji to go around!\" he said, laughing heartily as his harem swarmed him, hugging him and kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you come to make love to us again, master?\" shy, quiet Hinata said, blushing despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, lovey.  I always want my girls to be happy,\" Chouji said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all tittered happily.  But before anything else could happen, the door slammed open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Asuma, Chouji's mentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt your fun, Chouji,\" Asuma said, causing the girls to cringe.  Chouji didn't mind, however.  He had publically given Asuma permission to use his real name, something normally forbidden in Konoha.  Asuma smiled, and continued, \"But Shikamaru has finally captured Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji nodded.  \"Good.  Then with his digestion, Konoha will finally be free of the threat of the Nine-tailed Fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno shuddered.  \"Master, please stay with us.  Naruto is too dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko nodded.  \"Please, Great Hokage.  Let us bring you other kinds of physical delights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji sighed, and patted Anko on the head.  \"I know you all desire me.  I desire you as well.  But Naruto is too great a threat to be ignored,\" he said, gently seperating himself from the girls and waddling towards the opposite door, following Asuma down to the main hall, where Shikamaru was waiting, his shadow holding the orange-clad ninja in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time, Hokage Butterball,\" Shikamaru said, his black armor shimmering as he stared through a skylight at the clouds, \"I was getting bored keeping this idiot from accessing his demon chakra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji, clad in nothing but a robe, just smirked.  \"Hold a few seconds longer.  I just need to get him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, his orange uniform in tatters, his long, blonde hair flairing wildly in every direction, just glared at Chouji, his eyes demonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji waddled up to him and smirked, grabbing Naruto's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your threat to the people of Konoha is over, Naruto.  Super-Multi Size no Jutsu: Consumption Readiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChouji's jaws and throat expanded.  He smirked, and opened his jaws wide, pulling Naruto's head into them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then he woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT!\" he swore, \"And it was such a nice dream, too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed and went back to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>=====================================<br>\r\nAn ancient palace in Afghanistan...<br>\r\n=====================================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a remote, isolated location.  A ruined temple from times long ago, when wicked sultans ruled, fulfilling their hedonistic desires.  In this particular palace, a great treasure still lurked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadowy figures stalked through the ruins, moving easily through the rotted structures, each one moving gracefully, despite their gangly appearance.  Most were small, barely the size of a child.  But one was man-sized, the obvious leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he stepped out into a chamber lit only by the light shining through the holes in the roof.  On it, a jade serpent lay wrapped around a large, fist-sized emerald.  The shadowy man grinned, and stepped out into the light, revealing his dusky skin and black hair and ninja-clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Monty Fiske, better known as the martial arts supervillain Monkey Fist, famous for his monkey-themed crimes, the fact that he made his hands and feet monkeylike via genetic engineering, and his mastery of Monkey Kung Fu, had come to this place out of desperation, breaking his usual patterns.  A psychologist would consider this progress, that Monkey Fist would break his obsession with monkeys to go after a snake-themed object.  The rest of the super-villain community would just consider this desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to walk towards the artifact, when two figures dropped down from above, landing right in front of him and leaning casually against the pillar the artifact was resting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was an athletic, red-headed young girl in dark green pants and a black shirt that exposed her midriff.  The other was a lanky, blonde-haired boy in dark khaki and a black t-shirt.  Both wore black, form-fitting gloves, and Monkey Fist knew them both VERY well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd hated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIM POSSIBLE!  And you, Ron Stoppable, my most hated nemesis!!  How did you get here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon grinned impishly.  He never got tired of Monkey Fist treating him like a nemesis.  But business before pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We called in a favor from the US army,\" Kim said, shrugging, \"We would have been here sooner, but on the way they spotted someone they had been looking for and wanted to catch him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're here now, ready to whoop freaky monkey-man butt!!\" Ron said, both he and Kim taking a fighting stance.  Ron HATED monkeys, but he knew he had to put aside his fear.  He and Monkey Fist shared a link due to the magical energies that both had been infused with, enhancing their strength, speed, and martial arts ability.  Ron's power only worked part-time, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey Fist laughed.  \"Do you really intend to fight me, Stoppable?  Or perhaps Kim's courage is finally rubbing off on you.  I've heard that you two are officially a couple now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon blushed, but didn't stop smiling.  Kim just grinned.  \"That's right, we are.  And more than that, Monkey Fist.  He WILL be the one fighting you.  He specifically asked to fight you this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey Fist laughed.  \"What can that coward do to me?  What makes you think he can even access the blessing of the powers that were never meant to be his and use them well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim traded grins with Ron and said, \"I've been training him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Monkey Fist could react, Ron flipped forward, striking him with a blitz of five kicks to the face.  Monkey Fist fell back, stunned.  He stared at Ron and Kim for a long moment, then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.  Perhaps this will be interesting after all.  MONKEY NINJAS ATTACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dozen monkeys, all clad in ninja garb, lunged forward, chittering.  Kim leaped forward and sent half of them flying with a roundhouse kick, dueling with the monkeys as Ron fought their leader.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey Fist snarled, leaping up to an overhanging steel bar.  He gripped it with his hands while using his monkey-like feet to duel with Ron, thrusting punches and chops at the younger warrior, who was barely managing to fight back.  He had to give the boy credit, he WAS better than the last time he faced him, but still not nearly enough of a match for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" Ron said, trying to distract Monkey Fist from the intense battle by making idle chatter, maybe hoping he'd make Classic Villain Mistake #30 and blab his plans for prideful reasons. \"Why are you after this snake statue anyway?  Isn't (yick) monkey-themed stuff more your deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey Fist flipped, striking Ron with a double-palmed blow that sent him flying over the pedastal the snake statue was on and crashing into a wall.  \"I have made an exception to my usual theme, as this emerald and statue have a very close connection to the power that infuses us both, my rival.  And now that I have defeated you, I will collect that power for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was easily whooping the monkey ninjas, and was idly listening in to Monkey Fist and Ron.   _Hmmm..._ Kim thought, _If it's that powerful, better not let him get it._<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dazed Ron tried to recover and Monkey Fist casually strode towards the statue, Kim whipped out her grappling gun and fired it.  The hook shot forward rapidly, striking the statue and knocking it off of the pedastal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight into Ron's arms.  He blinked, surprised, and grinned, holding it up triumphantly.  \"BOOYAH!  Got the statue before you, monkey man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey Fist screamed angrily.   \"AAAGH!! It's useless to us now!  Monkey ninjas retreat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonkey Fist ran off, his ninjas following.  Kim and Ron just stared.  \"Huh...\" Ron managed after a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... rather anti-climactic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon frowned at the statue.  \"What I wanna know is, why it's useless just by me touching it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake statue wrapped around the emerald turned to Ron and grinned.  \"You're about to find out, warrior of the mystic power,\" it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim and Ron stared at the statue.  \"Umm... KP... This thing just talked to me...\" Ron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it down now, Ron, before... RON!!\" Kim said.  The statue's eyes started glowing and fired twin beams of green light into Ron's own.  Ron screamed as he felt a powerful energy forced into him.  After what seemed like forever to Kim and Ron, but was really only a few seconds, the beam stopped, and Ron collapsed.  Kim immediately whipped out the Kimmunicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WADE!  I need a ride now, and a forcefield to contain a mystic artifact that zapped Ron!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby, hyper-intelligent black young man nodded, quickly contacting one of their past clients and calling in a favor, at the same time reconfiguring the Kimmunicator to generate a forcefield to carry the snake statue.  He knew better than to ask when Kim was panicking and just do as she asked, knowing that he'd get answers later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\nLater...<br>\r\nKim Possible's room...<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a day later, Ron groaned, clutching his head as he slowly came awake.  He blinked, his eyes adjusting to the light as he looked around, trying to get his bearings.  After a moment, he recognized where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kim's room?  And I'm in KP's bed?\" he blushed briefly, naughty fantasies running through his head, but then memories of what happened started to come back.  He groaned, sitting up, finding himself in a pair of his pajamas.  \"Geez, how long was I out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About a day and a half,\" Kim said, smiling warmly and looking VERY relieved, \"After that damn artifact zapped you, I brought you to Mom.  She couldn't find anything physically wrong with you, so we just kept you here.  I had your Mom send over some of your clothes.\"  She was carrying a bag of Bueno Nacho, looking like she just came in from outside, clad in blue sneakers, loose-fitting jeans, and a green tanktop, and Ron's nose, ever sensitive to the smell of his favorite food, picked up the scent of something delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Nacos?\" he said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded, tears coming to her eyes.  \"Yep.  Grande-sized.  It was gonna be my lunch, but I'd be happy to... to...\" she broke down, hugging Ron tightly and crying.  Ron blinked, and hugged her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God, Ron, I'm so sorry... I just... When that thing zapped you, I was so worried that I'd lose you...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon chuckled.  \"Hey, KP, c'mon.  Bein' over-emotional is my thing, not yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim grinned weakly, but still wouldn't let go.  \"I'm sorry... It's just that, in all our missions, I never thought I actually may...!\" she choked, unable to finish the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon blinked, and blushed.  \"Hey, KP, c'mon.  I'm fine, see? I wouldn't cut out on you like that.  We're buds.  Little more than buds, actually,\" he said, blushing deeply at the implication.  Kim blushed as well, and kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon almost melted.  He'd been kissed before by Kim, but it never failed to make him feel warm and tingly all over.  \"Anyway,\" he said, trying to ease the obvious tension, \"Why don't we eat, and you can tell what's been goin' on since I took my nap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim nodded, more than a little embarassed by her behavior, but not really caring since Ron was all right.  She handed two of the Nacos in the bag to Ron, who eagerly began to eat them, feeling strangely hungry.  Kim gathered her thoughts and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after Mom had you checked out from some of her doctor friends, we updated your parents on what happened.  They weren't happy with it, but they're just glad you're fine.  Wade has the statue at his place and is analyzing it, checking records on it, he said he'd be a while.  I got a call from the vet.  Rufus is fine, he just needs to stay there a couple days more until he gets over his flu.  Right now, Mom, Dad, and the Tweebs are out,\" she said, smirking, \"They're at a parent/teacher conference.  Apparently, while we were stopping Monkey Fist, they created a portal to another dimension and summoned some kind of demon over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon rolled his eyes.  Kim's younger brothers, twins Jim and Tim, were super-geniuses.  He also suspected that they had ADHD from the way they acted sometimes.  He polished off his Nacos in record time, and was about to look in the bag for more when he felt a sudden wave of nausea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groaned, getting Kim's attention.  \"Ron, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon shook his head.  \"I dunno KP...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tim Scam frowned at his two chosen allies for this new anti-WOOHP mission, Dr. Inga Bittersweet and Helga von Guggen.  The two older women, like many of the villains Scam's enemies, the spies Sam Simpson, Clover Ewing, and Alex Vazquez, had a rather... 'thematic' modis operandi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelga von Guggen was vicious enough to earn Scam's respect.  Her first scam involved mutating a cruise ship full of people into what the internet people would call 'furries' and then skin them alive for their coats.  Her second scam involved murdering people by making clothes that would constrict them to death, tricking people into wearing them by going under another name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga Bittersweet was... somewhat lower on the villain scale.  Scam still had trouble figuring out what she wanted to accomplish.  She made a super-addictive and super-FATTENING formula and put it in cookies, selling them and making a fortune while making everyone that ate them, including Clover and the boss of the spies, Jerry, extremely fat.  But she was stopped when she became addicted to her own formula, giving WOOHP a chance to make a counter-agent to the fattening formula in the cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Scam just wanted Helga so he could kill everyone, Sam, Alex, and Clover included, and call it a day, but she wouldn't come without Inga (whom WOOHP had left fat out of spite), whom she made friends with while in prison.  And now, they were combining ideas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArrange things so that the Spies and a few of their friends and fellow WOOHP agents would win a prize, a lifetime supply of cookies from a cookie company executive (played by Tim Scam himself, master of disguise and deception).  But these cookies would be treated with a special formula, an even more addictive and fattening, and one that would turn them into feline creatures the fatter they got.  The logic was that they'd be so humiliated and heavy that they'd be unwilling and unable to do anything to stop Tim Scam from his genocidal plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Of course, he left out any mention of genocide to them.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim Scam checked his watch irritatedly.  The two older women, one skinny and anorexic looking, one fat and huge, both dressed in labcoats, had been working at their formula for hours.  They said that it could be easily mass-produced once they had perfected the formula.  As soon as he did, he yipped, startled, as the two women traded high fives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA!  We did it!\" Helga cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ready?\" Scam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga nodded.  \"Yes.  All we have to do is take it to the factory and reproduce it, then put it in the cookies, and then the plan can begin for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScam grinned wickedly.  \"EXCELLENT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three villains all shared a moment of evil laughter.  After they stopped, Helga said, \"Inga and I were going to go out for a bite to eat.  Want to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScam shook his head, and said, \"No.  I have some thinking to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women nodded and left.  Scam sighed, and shook his head, looking over the various chemicals mounted on the wall of the lab, which for some reason was painted black on the walls, floors, and ceiling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such a stupid plan,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to leave to get some coffee, when his eyes settled on two particular vials.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snake DNA and appetite enhancer...\" Scam said.  He had a brief vision of a snake swallowing a gazelle, and grinned mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All warriors once thought dead are alive once more.  Armageddon is approaching, and only the strongest will survive.  Kombat rages all around, battles to the death now a common site.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the outer wastes of the realm, where the sky is a dark, burning purple and ruins are everywhere, two figures are battling near a massive gate and stairway, a catapult with flaming debris nearby.  Two figures fight in this arena, one a man with scaly skin and reptillian features, the other a beautiful, buxom woman in a very revealing outfit and a veil that hit the lower half of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizardman was called, appropriately enough, Reptile.  He was one of the last two survivors of his species, and for the first time was on his own.  He was tired of being used by evildoers and was intent on finding his own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was Mileena, a partial clone of the princess Kitana.  She was Shao Kahn's daughter, and one of his top assassins alongside Reptile, but she now wanted a kingdom of her own.  She intended to replace her sister and rule Edenia, conquering all who have harmed her over her centuries of life.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, before either fighter could achieve their goal, they had to get past each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReptile snarled, the lizardlike man spitting a globule of acid at the slinky female form attacking him.  The beautiful, scantily clad female chuckled softly and vanished into a hole in the ground and appearing above him, her boot's spiked heel dropping into Reptile's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard-man snarled, bearing his jaws and his long, sticky tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMileena laughed, her veil briefly blowing aside in the wind to reveal her one physical flaw, her razor-sharp Tartakan teeth and her wide mouth.  She twirled her sais and laughed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over, lizard!\" Mileena laughed, \"I've been wanting to kill you for centuries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReptile hissed angrily.  \"Killing me will be more difficult that you think, you cheap imitation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMileena howled in rage and rushed Reptile.  She HATED being called an imitation!  Reptile rolled out of the way of her leaping sai thrust and drew his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in for a long battle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\nChaosrealm...<br>\r\n==============<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single, solitary figure slunk quietly through the twisting streets and canals of the chaotic realm.  Her athletic, but still very feminine form was hidden beneath a cloak, her body clad underneath in a gray ninja leotard with boots and gauntlets.  Her skin was green and reptillian, but her face was mostly human in appearance.  Long black hair tied in a ponytail hung over her should as she tried to make her way out of the realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Khameleon.  She was the last female of her species, the same species as Reptile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA species, she was now certain, would become extinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been on the run for several milennia, trying to avoid being killed by assassins sent by Shao Kahn.  She wanted nothing more than to unite with Reptile, to free him from Shao Kahn's control and start their species over again.  But Shao Kahn, not wanting to lose an assassin as skilled as Reptile, had kept her away from him, constantly hounding her with a powerful assassin cloned from her DNA, which he had acquired when he had Shang Tsung fight her, and Reptile's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo mock her, Kahn named this assassin Chameleon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been forced to run from Chameleon for years, Chameleon seemingly gaining new powers every time they fought.  Khameleon taught herself how to fight back by secretly observing three of Kahn's greatest assassins, Kitana, Mileena, and Jade, and learning their fighting styles, her natural ability to turn invisible hiding her from their sight, her natural stealth keeping the skilled killers from finding her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Chameleon could see through her illusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, during Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm, she was able to catch up with Chameleon.  Using magic she had stolen from Shang Tsung, she gave Chameleon a will of his own and an urge to prove himself to be stronger than anyone.  He quickly abandoned her and began searching out powerful Outworld warriors to test his strength against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhameleon caught up with Raiden's forces first, and learned, to her horror, what Reptile had done over the years. All the atrocities, the genocide, that Reptile had happily commited in Shao Kahn's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she still felt she could redeem him, a hope suffusing her every action as she aided Raiden's forces in driving back Shao Kahn in her own discreet way.  Finally, she cornered Reptile and told him everything, how Shao Kahn had destroyed their people, and made her offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReptile laughed in her face.  He refused to believe that Shao Kahn was the exterminator of his people.  Worse yet, he refused to believe that she was of Zaterra, a Raptor like he was.  He threatened to kill her, and probably would have, if Jade hadn't intervened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost, hopeless, and in despair, she wandered away aimlessly, disappearing from the battlefield.  Jade tried to offer her words of comfort before she left, but it did no good.  The other warriors, upon hearing what happened to her, were sad, but not particularly surprised.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhameleon wandered the realms aimlessly for years, doing little more than walking, drinking, eating, and sleeping.  Despair was all she had left.  She barely noticed the dramatic events unfolding, Shinnok's attempted return, the rise and fall of the Deadly Alliance, all was ignored by her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when she heard that Reptile had been possessed by the ancient Dragon King, Onaga, who was purported to be the true ruler of Outworld, she began to go insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to hate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to travel once more, intent on nothing more than destruction.  She was now seeking tomes of magic, intent on using them to bring about the death of EVERY species.  Every member of every species in every realm... save two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her increasingly deranged mind, it was the perfect revenge.  Fate had denied her a chance to restore her race.  If her people were doomed to extinction, then she believed that every OTHER race should be as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she travelled, she heard stories of Armageddon approaching, that every fighter from the past was coming alive again for one last battle.  Reptile had apparently freed himself from Onaga as well, and was looking to start his life anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe no longer cared.  If the realms were destroyed, then that would be fine.  It would save her the trouble.  But she refused to take part in the war.  When the pillar of flame appeared in the sky, she ignored it.  She had work to do, research to find.  If, somehow, Armageddon was evaded, she would find a way to cause it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral people had tried to stop her, some Tarkata and some filthy Oni.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose that didn't die from having various parts of their bodies eaten by her were killed when she split them in half with her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaven help any who tried to stop her.  For Khameleon had quite literally gone mad with rage and despair, and would devour anyone who got in her way...</span></div></div>",

One of their greatest creations was a crossbreed human/reptile named Riptor.  A vicious, vile creature that ate several opponents, sometimes swallowing them whole in his ravenous hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiptor was defeated and killed by the cybernetically enhanced boxer known as TJ Combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unbeknownst to anyone, there was another Riptor, one stronger and more powerful than the first.  This one remained in the dungeons of the Ultratech building, kept locked up because he was more intelligent than his predecessor.  He could not speak, but he could reason, and understand human language, and even solve simple puzzles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltratech kept him alive because he was a curiosity.  They fed him dead fighters as well as other meats, and promised him that once they could arrange it, they would give him a mate, one that would bear children for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was fine with this Riptor, although he was a little jealous of the first one, who got to fight and eat living opponents whole.  As he watched his predecessor on the television they provided for him, he wondered what it was like to feel living prey inside his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, his predecessor was killed by TJ Combo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe became concerned then.  No one had come yet to feed him today, and he wondered if Ultratech was going back on their word.  He decided to wait and see, and continued watching the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Orchid defeated and killed the monstrous Eyedol, knocking him into a pit of lava, everything changed.  To the surviving Riptor, it felt as if the universe itself shifted, but in reality it was time itself.  The Ultratech building was being dragged bodily into the past, along with all the Killer Instinct fighters and Ultratech staff inside of it.  The echoing of a powerful demon's laughter thundered through the building as Riptor struggled to stay standing through the violent shaking of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the building stopped shaking.  It was cracked in several places, letting light into Riptor's underground lair.  The building walls creaked ominously, and Riptor guessed that the place was on the verge of collapsing.  He debated briefly what to do, when something caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHIS GATE WAS OPEN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran out just as the roof of his lair collapsed.  Not stopping to look back, he quickly made his way out, killing whoever got in his way with blasts of fire and slashes with his tail or claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he found a doorway leading out.  The rich scents of plant and animal life in this area reached his nostrils, and he realized that something had happened, since he couldn't smell anything urban save for the building.  Unknowingly, he had gone back in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Riptor didn't care.  He was free.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree to hunt for the first time in his life.  </span></div></div>",
