            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright, for starters, let's establish our four current potential heroines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName - Clara McComber<br>\r\nAge - 17<br>\r\nHeight - 5'4\"<br>\r\nWeight - 123 lbs<br>\r\nAppearance - A slender girl who tends to dress in baggy sweatshirts and jeans. She has long scarlet hair pulled into a ponytail, most of the time, her freckles peppering her cheeks like the stars in the night sky. She's not large chested, but she does have a respectable bust. She wears a pair of glasses that she often pushes up with her index finger when nervous, hiding her baby-blue eyes behind their reflective sheen.<br>\r\nPersonality - She's often times timid about her body, a wallflower who rarely talks to people. She has a couple friends, but she rarely hangs out with people outside of her group. She'd much rather stay home and watch Dr. Who.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName - Misato Takanowa<br>\r\nAge - 18<br>\r\nHeight - 5'6\"<br>\r\nWeight - 111 lbs<br>\r\nAppearance - A slender girl who hides her geekiness on the inside. She's well-kept, often wears make-up to hide the slight blemishes on her cheeks, always wearing her long, shinning dark hair lose over her shoulders. Needless to say, she's of Japanese decent, and has all the inherited features of her people. Having been born and raised in America, she has little trace of an accent, except for one that rubbed off on her from speaking all the time to her parents, natives to Japan.<br>\r\nPersonality - On the outside bubbly, this girl hides the truth from everyone. She's actually a complete geek, having an online personality that reviews new anime. No one at the school knows this, and, if they did, she'd have to beat them to a pulp to make sure they keep the secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName - Rose Petunia<br>\r\nAge - 17<br>\r\nHeight - 5'3\"<br>\r\nWeight - 137 lbs<br>\r\nAppearance - Thick around the middle, this bespectacled, green-eyed girl has dirty blonde hair that she wears cut short at the base of her neck. She is pimpled, often sporting a few red marks from some rogue blackheads on her cheeks. However, she is a cute girl, nonetheless. She often dresses up in boyish clothing to express her individuality.<br>\r\nPersonality - A completely unashamed individual. She has no qualms walking up to your face and shouting in her deep voice out what she is to any passer by.  She's a self-proclaimed \"geeky bitchy dyke,\" and remains proud of that title. She wants a girlfriend, too, and has found another lesbian a lot like her...only problem is she's into BBWs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName - Elizabeth \"Lizzy\" Coyle<br>\r\nAge - 16<br>\r\nHeight - 5'9\"<br>\r\nWeight - 130 lbs<br>\r\nAppearance - Soft flesh with a cherubic, yet not chubby, face, this glasses wearing cutie is a beautiful girl, with brown hair that tumbles to her chest, her button nose placed between a pair of green, emerald eyes.  She has smooth skin, mostly due to lucky genetics.<br>\r\nPersonality - Off-handed, nonchalant, and all around calm. She's friendly, all around nice, and pretty level headed...except when it comes to guys she likes. For whatever reason, she always gives her crushes the hardest time, criticizing them for even the smallest mistake. Thankfully for the public at large, she has very specific tastes, specifically men who can hold a conversation about the final scene in the End of Evangelion, or about why Han shot first. In other words...she's into geeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there you go. Choose one, or make your own, and go crazy! Remember, it's all for fun, but please try to add substantial additions to our story about substantial gains, will you?</span></div></div>",

Sure, she had enjoyed its creamy, nutty flavor, but the sandwich still tasted tired, warn out, dare she even say it boring. It wasn't entirely the sandwich's fault. Indeed, it had tried its hardest to appeal to her, it was just that nothing really gave her the warmth that a good episode of Dr. Who or Star Trek would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd naturally, if she declared her undying love for the 10th Doctor in this lunch hall, she's probably be laughed out of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Clara!\" The bespectacled girl propped her glasses higher up her nose as the voice rang through her ear. It took a second for her to glance over. She sighed in relief as her friend, perhaps her only friend, Lizzy approached. This brown haired, glasses wearing girl sat down, her soft belly hidden underneath her blazer, but her soft thighs were visible with that skirt on. She crossed her legs, sighing to herself as she leaned her face on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Lizzy?\" Clara asked, her voice surprisingly deep for a girl of her stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, not too bad, I guess,\" Lizzy replied, \"Just parents again, ya know?  Always telling me to do this, do that. Oh geez, if I hear another chorus of 'men don't like girls who watch cartoons' one more time--ah well, no point babbling on about it.\" Clara sighed, shaking her head, as she withdrew a brownie from her bag. She was about to bite into it, when she took a closer look at the desert. The gears behind those eyes began to slide into motion as she regarded it, frowning slightly. Finally, Lizzy said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Huh? Okay,\" Clara replied, with an off-handed shrug. She accepted the sweet, biting into its chocolate body. It wasted nice, a tad dry, but regardless it was still as tasty as any brownie had ever been. She cooed softly to herself in pleasure as she finished the sweet, munching it within her gentle jaws. \"That was tasty,\" Clara replied, smiling shyly as she pushed up her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no prob,\" Lizzy replied with a shrug of equal off-handedness, \"I had the brownie, but the rest of the food filled me up. Look, I even have a food baby here.\" Her friend pulled her shirt tightly over her stomach. There was a slight bump pushing against the interior of the shirt, but, alas, it wasn't enough to qualify as a food baby, unless said food baby had yet to pass by the first trimester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're fine, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but could you eat the rest of my lunch? I'm kinda too full to eat the rest,\" Lizzy replied, resting her fingers on her stomach, which she drummed nervously. Clara had no problem devouring the rest of the food, which mostly consisted of sweets. What was she doing with so much sweets, anyway? Clara sighed in relief, resting her hands on her belly once she was done. The combination of her lunch with Lizzy's left her with a food baby. It wasn't substantial, but even Lizzy noticed it, judging by the way she glanced down through her glasses at Clara's middle. She shyly hid it behind her hands.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day at lunch came, and Lizzy, as expected, approached the table, holding her lunch in her hands. Clara still recalled the fullness in her belly from the day  before. She rested a hand gently against her middle as she finished her lunch. They chatted about the usual, anime, geeky stuff, teachers they hated, until Clara finished. When Clara finished eating, so did Lizzy, but unlike Clara, who had eaten every scrap of food on her plate, Lizzy only finished half. She sighed, stretched back so far her shirt was drawn up on her soft, yet not really pudgy, stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm sorry, but could you finish the rest of this?\" Lizzy asked, a sheepish grin on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? C'mon, yesterday was hard enough as it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, I promise I won't ask  you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did ask again. The next day, the next day, and the next. Every time, Clara reluctantly agreed, shoveling food into her mouth. She started getting smaller lunches, seeing as how she knew she was going to eat more than her full when Lizzy relinquished her meal. Every class after lunch would be spent massaging her poor, bloated belly. She even missed a few major points in class due to her belly cramps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't say no. Clara really only had one other friend in the school, and that was Lizzy. They had known each other since they were little, growing up together. They were as close as sisters, maybe closer. If to keep that bond, Clara had to stuff herself like a pig, okay, big deal. She'd take that risk without a second of hesitation. She just hoped that Lizzy would start to eat her own food, for once...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two weeks passed before Clara felt the effects of her favors come to bite her on the butt. Or, perhaps it was better to state that her butt had to suffer as a result of Clara's favors.  In any case, after watching an episode of Dr. Who early in the morning, Clara, prepared to dress into more appropriate attire.  Ordinarily, she slept in her white undershirt and pink pajama pants, which were digging into her hips at the present time, an odd occurrence ordinarily. However, it was when she stripped down to nothing, and attempted pulling up her jeans, that she heard the sickening sound she had been dreading since this entire ordeal began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pants ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara's face filled with blush as she finished dressing herself in a sweat suit, before glancing at her mirror.  She sighed in relief as she realized her sweatsuit, for the most part, hid whatever changes had occurred to her body. Still, she could see her face.  Her cheeks were slightly thicker, pudgy almost. She felt her heart beat faster in terror as she ran into her bathroom, placing her soft digits on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n131<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day at school, she ran down the hallways toward Lizzy while she put her bags and books away into her locker, and thumped her on the back of her head.  Her friend turned toward her, frustrated and hurt. \"Hey!  What the hell was that for!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was at a loss for words at first, struggling to find the appropriate morphemes to articulate her statement. \"You--you--you made me fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  No I didn't,\" Lizzy replied, \"You're not even pudgy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, well, look at this!\" Clara lifted up the hem of her sweatshirt with her soft, slightly thicker fingers.  Lizzy's eyes darted toward her pudgy belly, widening for an instant.  Clara lowered her shirt hastily, her cheeks rosy and betraying her inner humiliation, \"And it's all your fault for making me eat those lunches of yours!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't HAVE to eat them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did, so now I don't wanna do it anymore, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Lizzy stuck her nose up in smug superiority for a moment or two, before her face relaxed, eyes glancing at her toes.  The anger in Clara's chest also melted away as she felt her eyes grow watery, perhaps even a little teary.  She didn't want to lose her best friend.  Not now, and not like this.  \"I'm sorry, Clara.  I won't ask you to do it again.  I promise.\"</span></div></div>",

She enjoyed the occasional brownie or bag of  chips to really have the willpower to outright diet.  She figured by, returning to her ordinary eating habits, the extra weight would just melt away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day at lunch, she purchased her ordinary lunch size, and, surprisingly enough, so did Lizzy. This bothered Clara, and her initial gut reaction was that Lizzy was gonna give her the remainder of her lunch.  With a comforting smile, Lizzy said, \"I'm sticking to my promise, Clara. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the first lunch period began.  Clara ended feeling somewhat full, but Lizzy was downright bloated, her hands resting on her stomach. She moaned softly as she rolled her head backward. Her skin was turning a slight shade of green. \"Ugh, so full. How did you eat all that stuff last time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get used to it after awhile,\" Clara replied, shrugging, \"Look, if you can't eat all that, don't get so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll keep that in mind, Lizzy replied, adjusting her glasses on her button nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, however, they purchased the same quantity of food. Clara stared as Lizzy gorged herself again, once again moaning in pain upon finishing, her food baby pressing against the underside of her shirt. Clara, this time, said nothing.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clara sighed as she finished her lunch and began to watch the spectacle of Lizzy stuffing her face. The last two weeks this had been a normal occurrence. Clara thought back to the day when she got to eat Lizzy's food as Lizzy stuffed a whole chocolate brownie down her mouth. She missed tasting but as crazy at it seemed she missed that bloated feeling she got after eating way to much. She was by no means hungry after her lunch, if anything she was full. However she wasn't stuffed, she wasn't forced to unbutton her jeans or rub her stomach to try and relieve its pressure. The first few days of her not eating Lizzy's food had her seeing that as a relief, however now she was almost envious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lizzy swallowed she was reminded of another thing, all that food goes down into the stomach and then spread all around the body. Just as the stuffing had caused a weight gain on Clara, so too had it shown on Lizzy. Her stomach, once hid by her baggy clothes now would often peek out from under her shirts and after today's stuffing would surely spend a few more seconds peeking than normal. Clara at least no longer had to deal with that. However, she didn't mind too much before, and she still had not lost or tried to lose any of her own weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy turned to look out the window and after she had turned back her belly was slightly exposed  from the movement. Lizzy didn't notice and continued eating, leaving the white little strip exposed. Clara could not tear her eyes away from it contemplating...</span></div></div>",

Like how you are with your lunches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy laughed, \"Yeah, I know it's a strange feeling. Painful, yet oddly satisfying. Well, in any case, it has had a few side-effects...\" Lizzy rested a hand on her belly, pinching her flesh between her fingers. The girl regarded it for a second, her eyes looking mournfully at her pudgy belly, her thicker limbs, and wider derriere. Her eyes were a tad watery, as though tears were unsure whether to come out or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not fat,\" Clara said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said I was fat?\" Lizzy asked, smirking slightly, unable to change her eyes, those eyes that looked so sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,  you were implying it. Ya can't deny that much. Anyway, look, I don't wanna gain any weight, but if you could help me stuff myself from time to time--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can help you with that. Assuming I'm mobile within the month and not a ball of flab,\" Lizzy replied with an off-handed laugh, her voice at complete conflict with those big eyes of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not THAT big. You're what? 135?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"140 actually,\" Lizzy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're 5'9\"!

She would begin nightly stuffing sessions while watching an episode of Dr. Who, or pop in a Sci-Fi or fantasy movie. Along with this she would place several food choices around her seating position, so during the movie or program she would subconsciously reach out for the food and hopefully eat it all! And with the weight gain she unfortunately expects to get, she can make Lizzy feel better about herself and strengthen their friendship!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's foolproof.\" said Clara to herself as she picked out several fattening foods from the rows of Bonny's Bakery. A locally owned and operated store that had all kinds of sweets, candies, pastries, and cakes. Clara eyed all the delicious looking treats as she passed through one row of the rather small store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Triple Chocolate Cake...Honey Glazed Donuts...eh-whats this?\" Clara bent down to take out a rather colorfully wrapped case of four round tennis ball sized chocolate balls. Clara read the description of these curious treats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Omega-cocoa Ball. Five unique layers consisting of a rare Guatemalan chocolate outer layer, a Golden butterscotch coating, with a powdered sugar glaze over a crunchy nougat cover, and a creamy white chocolate center. Whoaaa.....theres gotta be, what, 500,000 calories in these things?\" She turned the package over to read all the health facts and such, but there was no such thing there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see how this works. Make it so that chocolate craving women can't know how much fat is in these balls.\" Even so, Clara placed them in her groceries basket, and while she was at it bought that triple chocolate cake she saw earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara made her way back home, but not before picking up some pizzas at the Supermarket. She didn't want to run out of food after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Pizzas in the oven and Avatar in the PS3, Clara was ready for a filling night. She had never seen Avatar when it came out in theaters, as she was always \"busy\" with lazing around fantasizing about Dr. Who. But now she has the chance, and she won't readily waste it. At the moment the movie started, the oven buzzer, well, buzzed. Clara got up and raced to the oven quickly pulling the two pizzas. She had chosen Sausage and Pepperoni as her champions, and smiled as they were going to soon be inducted into the hall of Clara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her bottom on her squishy couch and immediately was enthralled in the movie. Two pizza slices at a time would find themselves being brought to Clara's mouth simultaneously. With a chew and a munch the slices were gone, leaving grease covered fingers in their midst. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first hour of the movie was finished, Clara had cleared out both pizzas, and had started on the chocolate cake. By this time Clara was feeling a pinching feeling in her stomach, but she tried to ignore it. Clara was so \"in to\" the movie she was just grabbing chunks from the cake, not bothering to cut it. Clara decided that leaning back on the couch would rid herself of the pinch, and did just that. However, the sudden movement caused the straining button of her jeans to pop, giving some breathing room to Clara's mildly swollen belly. She didn't take notice though, still enraptured by the epic sci-fi that is called Avatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour had past, leaving the movie almost finished. Crumbs were what remained of the sinful cake, the rest adding to Clara's already round stomach. She was puffing out ragged breaths now, the fullness making her uncomfortable. But still she stared at the TV screen. Still absorbed every moment of the film. But something in Clara's head was nagging, keeping from fully concentrating on the movie. She looked around on the couch for a quick second and found the pack of the Omega-cocoa Balls unopened. She grabbed them and tore open the wrapping, clutching the first ball like a mother eagle holding onto her dear egg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her attention back to the movie, discovering it to likely be the final scene. She brought the cocoa-ball to her mouth and bit half of it off, revealing the white chocolate center. As Clara chewed more, her eyes widened. The taste...was unimaginable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara took her eyes off the movie just as the credits started going. She needed the other cocoa-balls, and she needed them now. She grasped two more of the godly orbs, and chewed them both one at a time. As the remnants of them slipped down Clara's throat, she sighed with deep content, licking her lips sleepily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara looked down at the package, and spotted the last ball looking lonely in the tray. \"So, its just you and me now. How...delightful.\" She leaned forward to get the ball, and pushed the whole orb into her mouth. Clara chewed it up a bit to soften the ball, and then swallowed it whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara could feel the treat make its way down to her crowded stomach.

I don't think I could do this every night...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight. Clara twisted her head around to the clock on her wall. It read 1:30 am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeebus! I should get some...*hic* ...sleep.\" Clara rubbed her eyes as she brought her feet up onto the couch, belly groaning at the movement. Clara glared at her stuffed tummy, and blankly said, \"...Quiet.\", and crashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stared up at the ceiling, her eyes fading in and out of focus as sleep began to pull her pudgy form into an embrace, her stomach strained from the sheer quantity stuffed inside of it. All she could think about was Lizzy. Would any of this really help her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what if she did gain weight? Would that really help Lizzy out in any way, shape, or form? What would it accomplish? Maybe make her feel better about herself, but Clara would suffer. She'd be the fat one, and then where would they be? Besides, it cost a lot of money for food like that. What if she couldn't afford Dr. Who after she ate her body weight in food on a regular basis? Where would she be then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, rubbing her belly. Still, this felt amazing. It was spectacular, two of her great loves, sci-fi and stuffing, combined, together. She wondered, for a moment, whether or not anyone else in the school was into stuffing. Maybe they could help her out, develop techniques about how to do it, what sort of things to eat, that whole chest nut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, her lips curled into a triumphant grin.</span></div></div>",

Even worse, this girl was her best and possibly only friend!  Quite frankly, the thought terrified her to her core. What was wrong with her? How could this happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, actually, it was fairly obvious. Ever since Lizzy had started chunking up, Clara had been having 'sqiggly feelings' when hanging out with her. Staring at Lizzy's pale belly peering out from the gap between shirt and pants, the funny feelings started again and Clara quickly turned her head, her cheeks flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what should she do? Should she tell her about these strange new feelings? But what if Lizzy didn't want to be friends anymore? How on earth could she risk something so dear to her based on some strange, nebulous feelings?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, no. The best course would be to turn back to the TV and pretend like she'd never come to this conclusion. Besides, the Doctor was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, toss me the remote, will ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lizzy threw the device to her friend, a ripping noise filled the air. The culprit: Lizzy's shirt. A great tear extended from the armpit to the hem of the strained garment. The motions had strained the poor garment too much and the seams had given way, allowing Clara to get an eyeful of brassiere'd sideboob (and a noseful of flying remote).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm just gonna, uh, gonna, uh, go see if I left a spare shirt in your room. Um. I'll be, uh, right back.\" Said Lizzy, her face the same color as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that's, er, fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Lizzy jiggle up the stairs, rubbing her nose where the remote had struck her, Clara came to a realization: she wanted Lizzy fatter. Something about her increased girth, despite Clara's ambivalence to her own portliness, caused these feelings. The thought of Lizzy becoming even wider... outgrowing clothes... being unable to even touch her toes... made her squirm with anticipation and lust. Even if she couldn't work up the courage to actually express her feelings to the object of her affection, she could still ogle her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how could she fatten up her best friend? How could that possibly be the right thing to do? Furthermore, HOW could she fatten up her best friend? What tools would you need and how would you procure them?</span></div></div>",

The belt extended as far as it could go, and still strained against her stomach. her scarlet cheeks grew brighter still as she lowered herself next to Clara, unable to meet her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I'm such a pig,\" Lizzy said, her voice lowering to a whispery whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about it. You're not a pig,\" Clara said, taking the opportunity to rest a hand on Lizzy's plushy, soft shoulders. She allowed her fingers to sink into her flesh, feeling that same squiggly feeling consume her yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try to make me feel better. I'm a total cow,\" Lizzy laughed, pushing her glasses higher up her face, \"I know I should probably diet about now, but I like eating too much, and, well, I don't have the will power. I honestly don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lizzy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy turned to Clara, forcing a smile on her plush face. \"Sorry, you don't want to hear me whine about my problems. I know. Besides, it looks like I'm just gonna have to deal with this. I'm not losing weight any time soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed, slowly. No, Lizzy wasn't going to lose weight anytime soon, and yet Clara, despite her desire to fatten her friend up, found her hands and limbs too heavy to lift up to pin the girl down, or to shove food into her maw. All she did was lower her head, nearly in tears, before hugging her friend, squeezing her around the middle. \"Wait, Clara? What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. If I didn't complain about the lunches, this wouldn't have happened, and you'd still be super skinny. It's all my fault,\" she cried, lowering her head in shame against her friend's breast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, don't worry. Did you make me eat all that food? No. It's my fault entirely, and I accept that. Now, why don't you just get yourself something to drink, maybe a snack, and put on your British sci-fi show now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dr. Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara couldn't fatten up her best friend.  But, as she sipped down a can of soda, she noticed Lizzy still grazing on potato chips. If she was so worried about her weight, why was she still fattening herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it hit Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo fatten Lizzy up, she'd just keep doing what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the stuffing herself process.  If Lizzy felt skinnier, she'd have no qualms getting bigger.</span></div></div>",

While Clara was munching on a slice of pizza, she noticed someone staring at her out of the corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Clara turned her full attention there, she saw that it was Julie Yukimura, one of the most jovial students in the school. Julie was able to fit in with any of the cliques around, from nerds, where she could talk about Star Trek with the best of them, to the preps, everyone liked Julie. But the way Julie was looking at both Clara and Lizzy made Clara a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reminded her of the same way Clara had looked at Lizzy as she grew larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing the thought almost as soon as it entered, Clara returned her attention to her meal and ignored Julie's stares throughout lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on that day, as the final bell rang, Clara was making her way towards the exit when someone called out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, Clara noticed it was Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, um, you're Clara right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara nodded, watching as Julie played with her long black hair, her dark eyes looking anywhere but at her. Something was clearly bugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to...well that is...I want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie Yukimura nervous? Was the world coming to an end?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just say it already,\" Clara said, starting to get a bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get fat!\" Julie said, quite quickly. Clara blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to get fat. I want a big gut, thighs that touch no matter how far apart my legs are, and a butt that needs two chairs to sit on. I was always so afraid to try but watching you and your friend blimp out over the past few weeks has given me courage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why tell me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you obviously know how to get fat. Take me on as a student. I'm a fast learner, promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm not an expert. I just eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I join you and your friend and get fat with you two? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara looked at Julie, wondering if the seventeen year old Asian was being serious. But after a few silent moments and no one coming out with a hidden camera or anything, Clara finally nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you!\" Julie said, hugging Clara tightly and giving her belly a slow rub, causing Clara to break apart rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie blushed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also kind of like fat girls,\" she said softly. \"I mean not you in particular. I have someone I want to be with already but they're far too shy and reclusive for me to get anything started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't want to get fat on a whim? You're trying to woo some other fat girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of both,\" Julie said, a confident grin on her face now that she had got all of her secrets out in the open. She really was very outgoing. \"So are you and your friend stuffing yourselves today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed. \"Lizzy isn't trying to gain weight. I started all of this because I made a stupid comment about the school lunches but it's kind of grown beyond my control. We both eat a lot, that's it. I'll let you come along but you cannot let Lizzy know that you're hanging out with us just to get fat, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll be the best of friends as time goes by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie then went on ahead, holding the door open for Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she gotten herself into?

Why did this Amazon wish to ruin her appearance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps for the same reason Clara wanted Lizzy to ruin hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Clara didn't want to get fat. She didn't think fat looked good on her. If anything, she wished she had the willpower to diet all this flab away. Regardless, she knew there was a story behind this, and she would dig it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, uh, Julie, who is this girl you like, if ya don't mind me asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...\" Julie twirled a lock of black hair around her slender index fingers, tucking her head into her shoulders.  Blush filled her face as a goofy grin curled up her lips. \"Kinda embarrassing, really. Do ya know who Miranda Pistashi is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clara was about to ask who she was, a group of girls emerged from the lunch hall. Judging by the way Julie tucked her head away, blush filling her cheeks, she assumed Miranda was amongst them.  As the girls, who were, interestingly enough, geeky like Clara, laughed amongst themselves, one of them stood out from the crowd. None of those girls were in shape, and some were pudgier than others. One stood out, though, as being almost rotund. She was a hefty girl, pushing 250, with a large, jell-o belly that bounced with every step of her tree trunk legs. Her arms were pushed apart by the rolls of flesh poking out over the bands of her bra. Her round face, accompanied by a smaller double chin, was angelic, beautiful. Clara felt her body tingle in pleasure just looking at her, but then snapped herself out of it once she remembered Lizzy, albeit slightly reluctantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Miranda?\" Clara asked after the group walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Clara.\" At the sound of her name, she turned to see Lizzy bounding over, her pudgy arms at her side, a smile on her lips. Clara wanted to just hug that rolly-polly Goddess. Still, she restrained herself as she introduced Julie to Lizzy, using the excuse that she was curious about Dr. Who.

Julie took a few more bites and as she chewed admired Lizzy's growing body. She could see why Clara would be in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you deal with your clothes getting tighter?\" Julie asked.

Besides I actually want to gain some weight myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to join the sumo club!\" That caused a few giggles to escape Lizzy's lips and Julie smiled, pleased that she had succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened fully then and Lizzy came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'm done in the bathroom.

As they began to dig into the containers, the bloated Asian girl, who, despite her full tummy started eating with enthusiasm anyway, said, \"Well, there's this g--person I like, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he likes fat girls?\" Lizzy asked, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sh--uh--he does, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"People like that exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you'd be surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy glanced at her own belly, resting a tender hand on it. Clara felt her body tingle as she stared at her friend, but suppressed it, concentrating on the ice cream, eating it before it melted over her lap.  She ignored her organs freezing from the inside out, and kept eating regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy turned toward Julie, and asked, \"So who's the lucky lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda P--wait, who said anything about a girl?\" Julie stammered, waving her hands as she struggled to take the focus off her lesbianism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, look, I'm not stupid,\" Lizzy replied, smirking, \"Well, nothing wrong with lesbianism. It's just I find the whole fat-liking thing a bit odd. Do you know anyone else who, you know, thinks fat girls are cute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, there are a couple,\" Julie said, \"I guess. I really haven't met another one, but I'm sure they exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy nodded, frowning slightly, as she ate her ice cream, thoughtfully.</span></div></div>",

What this meant for her body was a little bit of a pot belly, a thicker butt, and slightly larger thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Julie it was a nice start but her goal was to weigh two hundred pounds by the end of the year ten months away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Lizzy it was amusing watching another girl, especially an Amazon like Julie, pork up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Clara Julie's expanding body stupefied her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night the three girls were having a slumber party at Julie's house, Julie's parents both out of town that weekend, and pigging out on Chinese, Italian, and Mexican cuisine. Julie took her latest bite of her fifth plate of food, her belly really rounded out from the amount she had already eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...urp...'scuse me...oh boy look at my belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was indeed looking at her belly. The pert little pot belly was much rounder now thanks to the stuffing. Julie noticed Clara's stare and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to...rub my belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara nodded and reached out a hand, marveling at how warm that belly was as she rubbed some circles in Julie's taut flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRP! That...relieved some pressure, thanks Clara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara nodded, glad she could help but only slowly removing her hand and watching as Julie finished her fifth plate and grabbed two heaping helpings of greasy cannoli, taking a large bite as she stuffed her face yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was attracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure she still felt strongly for Lizzy but spending so much time with Julie and Julie's softening form made her appreciate the jovial young woman even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy had only managed to eat four plates and observed the interaction between Julie and Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was she getting upset at the sight? she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara...I'm kind of stuffed too, would you give me a belly rub also?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat caused Clara to turn around and gaze in wonder at her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's own growth had given her a much larger belly, an increased cup size, and a rounder face and Clara was pleased as punch to rub Lizzy's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in the back of her mind Clara was having doubts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she tell Julie about her attraction?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Three weeks passed.  Every day, Clara felt her own body filled with squiggly desire, overwhelming and consuming her.  She didn't know how to deal with this feeling, this desire. She was overwhelmed, and found herself eating more and more often to escape from the stress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne morning, she woke up, and found herself to weigh over 180 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran each of her pudgy fingers up her large, billowing belly. Her breasts rested gently atop her bulge as she felt, for the first time in a long time, a sort of allure to her reflection.  She barely resembled the slender girl before all this, but, with her round face and chubby cheeks, somehow she was in love with her own reflection. She saw Lizzy and Julie as beautiful Goddesses, and now she resembled them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Julie had no problem expanding, and Lizzy did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt such strong feelings toward both of them, but what to do? She had to talk to someone about all this, or else she'd explode! She'd be unable to contain herself any longer. She held her arms firmly, her flesh rolling around her fingers as she struggled to contain herself. She needed to feel their bodies against hers, wanted them to hug her and smother her in their flesh. These unholy, foul feelings felt so damn good. They were her friends, girls, and, above all, good people. They didn't deserve to be the butt end of all of Clara's sick, perverse fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help imagining them, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Clara!\" Julie called out, her now 150 lb body bounding toward her, her belly bouncing with each heavy stride. Her round face had grown chubby enough where her already slender eyes were squinted ever so slightly more. Clara had to hold herself back to hug the girl then and there, but simply smiled. Julie cocked her head to the side staring at Clara, asking, in a softer voice, \"Is something botherin' ya? Ya seem a bit off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, nothing's goin' on. Don't worry about it,\" Clara said. She turned to go, but felt Julie's pudgy fingers wrap around her wrist. She squirmed slightly, but held her emotions back as she turned toward her companion. \"Hey, lemme go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna talk in private or in the hallway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's bothering you. I could tell. I've been worried for the past few weeks, and I wanna know what's wrong.\" Julie dragged Clara off to a private corner of the school, where her heart beat louder. If she wanted to, they could do something here, something wicked, and no one would be the wiser. Still, Clara's personality and morals far outweighed her desire, so she remained still as Julie asked, her voice breaking, \"Did i do something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, not at all--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every time you look at me or Lizzy, you keep turning away or holding yourself back. I'm worried, Clara. I'm your friend, just tell me what's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was still for a moment before whispering, softly, \"I think I'm in love with both of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna touch you, and hold you, and have you. But it's the same with Lizzy, and you, and I don't know what to do. I feel so dirty all the time, like I'm some sort of--of--\" Clara felt tears run down her chubby cheeks. She hid her face behind her pudgy hands, but soon felt a pair of comforting arms wrap around her. She felt her body pulled close to Julie's chest. At once, the squiggly feeling consumed her, but soon dissolved into her system, along with her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara, listen...\"</span></div></div>",

Her jelly-belly folded upon itself as she sat down, her large breasts resting atop of that. She tapped the table gently with her thick digits, smiling slightly, her dimples in her cheeks enhancing her cuteness, as she said, slowly, \"Did Julie say when she'd arrive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, I don't think so.

As the two of them stuffed themselves in silence, Lizzy said, softly, \"You can stop hiding it now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara nearly gagged on her food, managing to swallow after a little struggle, before saying, \"Wh--what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that Julie isn't going to be here any time soon.

It would be so awkward, and everything--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After what you did to get us together, it'll take a lot to weird us out,\" Clara said, smirking slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if she says no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then she says no. They're plenty of other fish in the sea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie opened and closed her mouth in silence, struggling to come up with a firm statement to silence her friends. Finally, she lowered her head in resignation, and said, softly, \"Fine. I'll be right back.\" Julie darted after Miranda. For a few moments, Lizzy and Clara waited in silence, before Julie darted back, her expression unreadable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?

Both possessed large butts, big bellies, and double chins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie had passed her own important goal: she now weighed two hundred and five pounds. The former track star's body had become truly fat now. With a gut that blocked her feet, thighs that were almost touching, and a butt that almost overflowed a single chair, she figured a hundred and fifty more pounds would fill herself out nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie's mother had also gained fifteen pounds ever since that night at the buffet, Julie's father enamored at his growing wife. So Julie's mother made sure to stuff both herself and Julie when she cooked dinner, wanting to encourage her daughter.

They either didn't want to be with another woman, found the sight of Julie's fat disgusting, or had a shallow personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat day at school, Julie had almost given up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was at lunch, eating her sixth tray and almost completely full, when she felt a tap on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, she saw a skinny young woman, blushing a bit as Julie looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hello...\" the young woman replied, her accent obviously British.

I understand completely,\" Rachel said, smiling softly as she sat gently down at her seat.  They were in a buffet, about the only place Julie could eat to her full and not rack up a gigantic check.  She felt mildly embarrassed at the prospect of stuffing herself in front of such a pretty girl, but, upon seeing the food, had no issue stacking an overflowing plate filled with delicious calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it?\" Julie asked, as Rachel returned with a plate of food.  It wasn't much; the organized meal barely covered the bottom of her dish.  If anything, it looked meager next to Julie's overflowing plate. Still, some people ate a logical, dare say healthy amount, so Julie shouldn't embarrass her new date like this. Unsurprisingly, Rachel blushed at this. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel awkward.\" Julie stammered, her cheeks full of red, but Rachel brushed her concerns aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry. It's me, really. I'm just a paranoid sort, really. You see, I'm just recovering from a bit of an eating disorder, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eating disorder?\" Julie asked, eyes widening as she slowed the pace of her eating, \"What kind of disorder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bulimia. But it's not like I'm trying to lose weight. Like I said, I think heavier girls are cute. That's precisely the problem for me, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you need to elaborate here,\" Julie said, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, there was this girl I liked, and--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought it would  be a good idea to fatten yourself up for her?\" Julie asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how did you figure that one out?\" Rachel asked, genuinely shocked that Julie predicted her answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went through something like that, but go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the first time I tried stuffing myself, I vomited. I couldn't help it; I just couldn't put down that much food.  But I tried again and again, and each time, well, I just kept on vomiting.  Couldn't help it. It got to the point where I started vomiting even when I wasn't stuffing myself. So--I hope you don't think I'm a freak or anything,\" frowned Rachel, \"I mean, I feel a little awkward saying this right now, but I feel so lose here. Maybe I just needed to tell someone, ya know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear ya. Still, it's pretty horrible,\" Julie said, sighing, finding it hard to even finish her plate as she felt a sickening feeling surge up inside of her. As much as she loved food coming down her pipes, she felt crappy when it went in reverse. Still, Rachel had a cute face. She wondered what it would look like with a few extra pounds on it.</span></div></div>",

She lived in a freaking mansion!

There were columns holding up balconies, hedges transfigured into hippos, and other decorations that gently informed Julie that her girlfriend was loaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, did you find the house okay?\" Rachel asked as Julie was welcomed in by both her and a butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, wasn't too hard.

Judging by her attire, she was the maid, and what a cute maid she was, with her cherubic face, gentle features, and soft eyes. She was an angel, an angel without wings and a braid of amber hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lily, this is my friend Julie. We're--er--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your 'friend,' huh?\" Lily chuckled, smiling in a sly fashion that let both of them know that this maid knew the extends of their relationship full well, \"Do you want me to prepare a meal for you and your 'friend'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, just make sure it's large.\" Julie stroked her belly at this. \"I tend to eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure, whatever you say,\" Lily chuckled, walking off, swaying her hips side-to-side.

It was just after midterms and the relief of finishing all the tough tests they had to take manifested itself in the massive bowls of popcorn both Clara and Lizzy were eating. It had been several weeks since they had last spent time with Julie or Rachel and though they had seen glimpses of them at school, neither girl had seen them in any great detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy was rubbing Clara's wider belly, cooing a bit as she shoved a handful of popcorn into Clara's mouth, when the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to her feet, Lizzy waddled over to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy was at two hundred and twenty pounds now, still gaining in her belly and breasts. Clara was at 253, thanks to Lizzy's stuffing sessions. And though Clara hadn't brought it up yet, the red-head did not like Lizzy's manner of stuffing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed mean to Clara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie and Rachel were on the other side of the door, both toting large bags full of various fast food from around the area. Lizzy's eyes widened as she took in Julie. The Asian teen was at 239 and every pound showed. Julie's belly was larger, her butt was straining her jeans, and her thighs touched for more than a few seconds. Julie also possessed a fully formed double chin now and larger cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving inside, Julie quickly set the bags down and helped Rachel with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel Madison had gained weight faster than Lizzy could believe. Before Rachel had been 110 but thanks to Julie's enthusiasm, Rachel's wish to be fat, and the newfound love between the two of them, Rachel was now 128, her cheeks rounder, her flat stomach now something of a pot belly, and her butt the tiniest bit larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making some small talk, Clara asked Rachel if she liked any geeky things and the British teen blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not since Julie here showed me some stuff. Anime is okay but what I really love is comics. I love Batman, Superman, Spiderman, all of it, from the movies to the cartoons to the comics themselves. I can't get enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara giggled at her enthusiasm and Julie wrapped an arm around Rachel's side, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to eat?\" Julie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree cheers met her question and the four geeky girls started their feast.</span></div></div>",

We'll eat what we want, when we want, and how much we want.\" One of Julie's hands made their way down to Rachel's little pot belly and started rubbing, Rachel giggling at the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could use some more food.

The face behind such a thud wasn't much of a familiar face to Clara, but the opposite seemed true for the lass on the other end, a coy \"I've heard how much you can eat; figured I'd help out...\" coming from their visage, before Clara and her slow to move eyes focused on their long, black hair, and womanly stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of the more preppy people around, to put things lightly; other less absurdly filled foodstuff vessels populating the two's table, before Lizz showed Clara's now spoon-holding hand towards the buttermound, and eventually, her mouth...

Clara thought to herself as she rumaged through her closet.<br>\r\n\"What CAN I wear?\" She asked herself as she pulled out the few clothes that fit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been the better half a year since Clara had started eating Lizzy's lunch leftovers. Actually considering the size of the portion it was more like eating a 2nd lunch. Everyday when Clara finished her lunch she would eat Lizzy's barely nibbled food. At first Lizzy didn't eat because of some arguement she got into with her parents. They thought that their little Lizzy wasn't so 'little', so they encouraged her to got on a diet. To Lizzy that meant giving Clara her high fat, high calorie lunch. After a while Lizzy and her parents started to settle down, but Lizzy was still on her 'diet.' Even though Lizzy pawned off her lunch to Clara she still maintained her weight. In the last few months it seemed like Lizzy was packing on the pounds as well, not nearly as much as Clara, but noticeable weight at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara's weight gain was a much different story. At first it was just another stomachache after another, but Clara got used to those. About the time Clara started to outgrow her clothes was about the time the arguement between Lizzy and her parents died down. By then Clara eating two lunches became a constant and natural occurance. As the months changed so did Clara's wardrobe. Her clothes became more baggy or stretchy and it seemed that each month Clara went up another size or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clara looked down at her last and few fitting clothes on her bed Clara decided to weigh herself. Because of her constant gaining Clara kept her scale under her bed. As she pulled out and stepped on the scale she expected to see a high number, but what she saw was surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n343<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was shocked, sort of. A about two weeks ago Clara weighed herself after she split another pair of pants. Back then she weighed 320 lbs. Now, too see that she gained 20 lbs. in two weeks made her jump off the scale as if it were on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this how I've gotten so fat?\" Clara asked herself. She was now looking at herself in her full-length mirror. She was wearing a white t-shirt and shorts that she slept in. The clothes weren't a recent buy as evidenced by her shorts only able to cover less than half her thundering thighs. Her shirt riding up as well and was revealing her bulbous belly that flowed over her shorts and kept Clara from seeing her feet. Clara felt her breasts and took note of how they used to be one third their size. She moved on to her belly as she picked it up, dropped it, and watched it jiggle for a few seconds. After looking over the rest of her plump body Clara settled on what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara struggled as she pulled a pair of sweatpants over her legs. She could feel a slight strain on the sweats as she pulled them over her apple rear and because of that Clara decided not to stuff her belly in either. Instead she grabbed one of her bigger shirts and pulled it down as far as it could to hide her belly. It worked, but only if she didn't raise her arms or jump, if she could. Then Clara took a hoodie from her closet and put it on. The sleeves felt snug around her thick arms. She struggled with the zipper more than anything else. The majority of the slack was used stretch over her belly, as a result, Clara couldn't pull the zipper over her bust. After putting on her shoes, which she learned to do by touch because her fat kept getting in the way, Clara wondered what should she do today.</span></div></div>",

She was glad that she was still small enough to fit through the classroom doors. The desks, however, were another story. About 80 lbs. ago there was an incident where Clara found herself wedged in her desk because of her belly. Since then Clara had started putting her belly on the desk so that she'd have more room. The act was so embarrassing that she also started to sit alone in the corner during her classes. Unfortunately, if she kept gaining at the rate she was Clara would need to get a seperate desk and chair. Another thing Clara had to worry about was the strain her clothes were under. If she moved too fast then the seams would more than likely burst. The only thing Clara was looking forward to, and dreading, was lunch. It was the only time in school where Clara could talk to Lizzy and it was the reason why she was 350 lb. giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Clara.\" Lizzy said as she sat next to Clara at lunch.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Clara mumbled though a mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen sitting together the weight difference between the two friends was glaringly obvious. Sure Lizzy was starting to push 200lbs, but the weight was fairly distributed throughout her body with a slight emphasis on her belly. If she raised her arms only her belly button would start to peek out from under her shirt. Somedays Clara found herself jealous whenever she was near Lizzy. The difference in their weights made Clara feel like the fat friend everyone sorta likes, but never find attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lizzy.\" clara said after she finished her lunch.<br>\r\n\"Yeah Clara?\" Lizzy responded. When she looked up from her lunch she noticed Clara finished hers. \"You want my lunch?\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanted to talk to you about,\" Clara started, \"I don't want your lunch.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lizzy said almost sounding surprised, \"are you not hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"No I am,\" Clara answered, \"but ever since I've started eating your lunch, I've been putting on some weight.\"<br>\r\n\"I know, so have I. In the last few months I've put on about 70lbs. I can can only guess you've put on a little weight too.\"<br>\r\n\"A little weight?\" Clara asked. She pulled up her shirt and jacket to reveal her big belly. Clara then lifted it onto the table. \"Does this look like a 'little' weight too you?\" She asked as she jiggled the mound of flesh.<br>\r\n\"Ok, so you've really let yourself go.\" Lizzy admitted.  \"Maybe you should stop eating my lunch.\"<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanted to talk about.\" clara said as she put her belly back under its covers. \"Why did you keep giving me your lunch? I mean I know I ate it when your parents said you should go on a diet, but after a few weeks you said they got off your case.\"<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Lizzy began, \"at first it was to show that I could lose a few pounds, no food no fat right? After my parents left me alone, giving you my lunch just became second nature.\"<br>\r\n\"Then how did you gain weight now?\" Clara asked.<br>\r\n\"When you started eating my lunch, I ended up starving, so I would indulge myself in my secret goodie stash. A lot.\" She said as she patted her rotund belly.<br>\r\n\"So just because you have a good food stash to live off of means I have to become a whale?\"<br>\r\n\"You didn't have to eat it.\"Lizzy pointed out.<br>\r\n\"But I did,\" Clara said, \"because you're my friend.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lizzy realised, \"I didn't know. How about I make it up to you?\"<br>\r\n\"How?\" Clara asked.</span></div></div>",

No excuses.\" Lizzy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Clara was interested. If she won then Lizzy would be eating her lunch longer than Clara had been eating Lizzy's. Clara could see it now, Lizzy ballooning up to three times her weight and being the way fatter friend. It would be even better if Clara could lose some weight from not eating lunch for awhile. All these thoughts made Clara the happiest she'd been since she gained weight, but only on the inside. She couldn't let Lizzy see how excited she was at this chance to get back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen another thought popped into her head, what if she lost? If Clara lost then she'd be eating two lunches for a year. If she gained this much weight in a matter of months then a full year would probably pin her down under a mountain of blubber. What's worse would be that Lizzy would make the second lunch extra fattening. Clara would most likely double her weight in the first few months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What should I do?' Clara thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With her new food baby, Clara found herself getting through the day better than usual. In history class she would normally lay her head down for some rest, but the teacher was cracking down on such behavior. Instead she rested her hands on her stuffed stomach. By doing so Clara was able to stay awake. She found it enjoyable to poke, rub, drum with her hands or fingers, and squeeze her belly. Sure, she only heard every third word from the history teacher, but at least she stayed awake. The process was repeated with her remaining classes and Clara was relieved to leave for home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home Clara spent the rest of the day munching on snacks as she did her homework. For dinner Clara had her usual serving of chicken and rice her Mom had cooked for her. Afterwards Clara finished her homework and then treated herself to watching a few episodes of Doctor Who. As the Doctor got cleverly got himself out of another predictament Clara just couldn't pay attention. It was as if something was gnawing her in the back of her mind. Clara couldn't put her finger on it, but she knew it was something. When it got late and the Doctor saved the universe, again, Clara decided it was time to turn in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at school, around lunch time, Clara met up with Lizzy.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Clara.\" Lizzy greeted.<br>\r\n\"Hey Lizzy.\" Clara said as she sat next to Lizzy.<br>\r\nLizzy started talking, but Clara couldn't focus on her either. What was wrong with her lately? She hadn't been able to focus since yesterday. What was it that threw her off? Lizzy stopped talking when she noticed Clara wasn't paying attention. <br>\r\n\"Anything wrong?\" She asked.<br>\r\nClara finally snapped out of her disfocus and added to the conversation.<br>\r\n\"Nothing, except I haven't been able to think straight. I don't know what it is.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Lizzy said, \"sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\nAs the two friends sat in silence Lizzy spoke again before it became awkward.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not hungry again. You want this?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah ok.\" Clara accepted, thinking it couldn't hurt.<br>\r\nClara piled Lizzy's food on her own and noticed Lizzy barely touched her food. As Clara stuffed herself with two lunches again she was able to focus again. Clara could keep up with Lizzy talking. When she finished Clara finally realized what was happening. It was being stuffed full that kept her focused. And in being honest with herself, Clara liked the dull throbbing of her stomach and having to massage it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home Clara decided to really test this idea of hers. She begain by constantly snacking as she did her homework. When it was time for dinner Clara helped herself to a double helping of lasagne and spaghetti. Her mother felt like asking about her daughter's appetite, but instead chalked it up to a 'growing girl' problem. The snacking and large dinner had the desired effect on Clara. She went to her room with a twin sized food baby. Clara plopped herslf on her bed with a solid thump. As she laid there she took pleasure in massaging her sore belly. Since she had finished her homework before dinner, Clara spent the rest of the night playing with her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaking up the next day Clara planned out her meals. For breakfast she convinced her Mom to make a small stack of pancakes and waffles. When her Mom left for work Clara had finished both stacks and she decided to chase them down with a bowl of cereal. The meal resulted noticeably distended Clara's belly, but not so much that it would peek out from under her red anime shirt. Her full stomache kept Clara wide awake through her morning classes. During her lunch period Clara bought double her usual meal and found her spot next to Lizzy.<br>\r\n\"Hey Clar...\" was all she could say before she noticed Clara's food baby and her two lunches. \"You ok?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n\"cause you look like you're eating for two.\" Lizzy explained as she patted Clara's belly bulge.<br>\r\n\"Oh this?\" Clara said as she patted it proudly. \"It's the weirdest thing. I can only focus on an overstuffed stomach.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"That seems a bit strange.\" Lizzy comented.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but it works.\" Clara argued.<br>\r\nLizzy couldn't respond. Instead she watched as Clara chowed down on her two lunches. When Clara finished she noticed Lizzy hadn't finished her lunch.<br>\r\n\"You gonna finish that?\" Clara asked.<br>\r\n\"No.\" Lizzy answered as she gave away the last half of her lunch.<br>\r\nAs Clara finished Lizzy's lunch she asked, \"How long are you going to keep stuffing yourself like that?\"<br>\r\nClara leaned back and rubbed her belly, which now had started to peek out from under her shirt, as she pondered her answer.</span></div></div>",

The dark haired girl glanced off to the side, unable to meet Clara's eyes. Was that out of shame?

From now on, Lizzy Coyle eats whatever Lizzy Coyle wants!\"   She punctuated the remark by tapping an especially stale French fry on the table as though she were pronouncing judgement, then popped it into her mouth defiantly.  And that was the last time for quite a while she brought up the subject of diets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara didn't even think about it until several weeks later, when their special last-Friday-of-the-month bad horror movie classics marathon came around again.  She showed up at Lizzy's house at the usual time, toting a bag full of chips, soda, sweets, and assorted junk food in one hand and a DVD of \"The Tingler\" in the other.   Lizzy met her at the door.  She'd already changed into her PJs -- faded blue drawstring bottoms and a rather ratty T-shirt with the last few cracked plastic flecks of what had once been an image of Tom Baker.  Or possibly Tom Servo; there wasn't enough of it left to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Clara, you brought snacks?\"  Lizzy asked, glancing at the bag.   \"I thought it was my turn this week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I -- I thought it was mine,\" Clara said, embarrassed.  \"I got mixed up, I guess.  We can save them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not on your life, McComber,\" Lizzy grinned.  \"You bought 'em, it's up to us to give them a good home.\"   She slapped her belly for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we even eat that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Pfft, go ahead and chicken out if you want.   I'll pick up the slack.  Remember, Lizzy Coyle eats--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--what Lizzy Coyle wants,\" Clara finished.   She couldn't help but think privately, though she knew it wasn't very nice, that it looked like Lizzy Coyle had wanted an awful lot lately.   The girl was showing definite signs of muffin toppage in those pajama pants, and that old shirt fit her like a sausage casing.   Okay, so it was a couple of years old, but Clara was sure it hadn't hugged her that tightly even just a month ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy's mom had a point, Clara realized.  She WAS getting chunky... at least a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was too late to say anything about it NOW.  Not after she'd reassured her in the cafeteria.  Not after she'd told her to go ahead and eat whatever she wanted.  To turn around and say, \"hey, never mind, guess you're a total tub after all\"?  It would be a betrayal!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, Lizzy was kind of ... cute this way.  She wasn't even fat yet.  She was just kind of soft and bouncy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOblivious to her friend's dilemma, Lizzy pulled her through the door and grabbed her in a bear hug.   This was nothing new.   She'd always been a friendly, hands-on kind of girl.  But that bouncy softness -- suddenly Clara felt it squished against her.  It felt soft, and warm, and wonderful -- and Clara had no idea what to do or where to put her hands.   What was wrong with her?  Friendly hugs weren't supposed to make you feel this way.  You weren't suppose to think about the gentle give of the flesh under your fingers or the way the taut fabric stretched over smooth skin, or the way her little pooch of a belly felt pressed against yours---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Lizzy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" Clara squeaked.  \"Wh-why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel so tense.\"  Lizzy gave Clara's hand one last squeeze and released her from the hug.   \"You know what you need?  Classic horror and junk food, and plenty of both.  Come on, I see a box of Pocky in that bag with our name on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, Clara thought.  She couldn't help but wonder what it would feel like to have that little layer of pudge.  Would it make her as cute and appealing as it made Lizzy?  On the other hand ... she was strangely curious about what Lizzy would look like with a little more weight too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were definitely enough calories to have an effect on SOMEone.  All she had to decide was whether she should...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Empty and half empty bottles, bags and containers dotted the floor as the girls hugged themselves to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy was fulfilling her new motto by adding her snack stash to the bounty Clara brought. She sat there in her pajamas, legs curled in front of her, one hand running through her long, dark hair. Despite the age of the movie and the countless times they'd watched it together they still obeyed a time honored tradition of silence. Each of them enjoying the classic cinema in their own mind, almost unaware of each other's presence. Until Lizzy reached between them for a hand full of chips only to find crumb dust on the bottom. This alone was enough to snap her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She thought to herself. \"I just opened that bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly scanning the littered room she lifted her eyes and found the culprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara perched there, wedged firmly into the corner of the couch. Cheese powder and salt coated her hands and the front of her shirt where she tried to dust them off. A couple empty soda bottles were crammed into the couch cushion and a half full one nestled between her legs.Lizzy realized that with her eyes glazed over by the movie and all the available snack food Clara had slowly turned into an unconscious eating machine. Her mouth rhythmically chewing while her hands blindly navigated the scraps looking for something else to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy struggled to hold down a laugh as an idea slowly grew into her mind. By now the movie was almost over with the final closing lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If after all of this, you still do not believe in the tingler, then the next time you feel fear-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy coiled her legs under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't scream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy launched herself across the couch and shouted \"TINGLER!\" Grabbing Clara by the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara launched off the couch screaming for her life, but Lizzy was latched on, tickling her side's and back. Halfway through hitting the floor her scream evolved into a low, vibrating belch. She held her belly and rolled over moaning, having just realized how much she'd ate. And discovering how uncomfortable it was to make sudden movements with roughly a litre of fizz in your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy stopped her tickling torment and just sat there on top of Clara, her hands on her middle. There was no doubt, she thought, Clara was bigger. Nothing astounding, and her clothes were plenty baggy, but it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara laid there under Lizzy, not noticing her hands inspecting her bloated stomach. She was too focused on Lizzy' s weight, her warmth, her softness on her. Her freckled face quickly grew bright red as she clawed the floor desperate to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes darted around the room as she pulled herself to her feet. \"Sorry. Um, I'm gonna use the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy pulled herself off the floor, pulling her too tight shirt back down with a noticeable jiggle and a beaming smile.<br>\r\n\"No problem, I'll clean this up.\" Then with a mischievous glint in her eye. \"By the way, do you have to go home tonight or would you like to do a double feature tonight?

David Tennant. The 10th doctor. Greatest man to ever live. Her phone was in her hand and ringing before she even realized it was out of her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mom? Yeah, I'm gonna stay at Lizzy' s tonight. Alright, love you too, good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw a quick thumbs up to Lizzy and took off down the hall. Lizzy hummed happily as she finished with the trash before moving on to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed in relief as she locked the door behind her. Catching her breath, she slipped off her sweat shirt and inspected herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet hair pulled back into a simple pony tail, her bangs framed her flustered face. It was hard to make out her freckles from the red of her face after the embarrassment of the living room and the exertion of running down the hall. Sweat causing her glasses to slide down her nose. She pushed them back into place and looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest was average, the definition of moderation. Nothing excessive or flamboyant, or in her opinion troublesome, but still enough to make itself known beyond a doubt. Even so she couldn't help but wiggle as her breasts filled her cups and the straps dug uncomfortably into her side's a little. Continuing down Clara reached the main goal of her inspection, her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara lived a fairly relaxed life. Wake up, go to class, come home, watch tv, go to bed. Not to mention she never really had the drive to exercise. Being self conscious about her body though, she made up for this she watched what she ate and always tried to follow simple diets. For her efforts she was rewarded with a slim body. Like the rest of her it seemed to be the balance of moderation. Never skinny, but still soft from her sedentary life style with a little squish around her middle, but this was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill quite modest but bigger than it had ever been before, she was in awe as she traversed the new world of her gut with her fingers. Barely able to be called a pot belly, her stomach was rumbling and sore, firm with all the food in it, but with a thin layer of softness stretched over the top. The blush returned to her face as she got a feel for her new mass, unbuttoning her pants for more breathing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you still alive in there?\" Lizzy shouted through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara almost screamed in shock again. \"Y-y-y-yeah, sorry. Almost done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara wedged herself back into the couch corner taking in the spread in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Um, Lizzy, what's all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't watch a movie without snacks!\" Lizzy responds like it should be obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them sat a table buried in crackers, chips, sliced cheese and a cheese cake. Clara took in the sight with a mixture of intimidated fear and a strange curiosity. She was already full from the last session but could she eat more? Lizzy hit play on the movie and Clara was gone. By the time the opening credits were over she was immersed into her trance. Eyes glazed, her hands moving unconsciously. One steadily rubbing her taunt stomach under her shirt, the other continuing its quest, assaulting the spread one cracker at a time. It wasn't about stuffing herself or eating everything in sight, it was just a constant, mindless desire to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy could barely contain herself, settling for watching Clara with a grin. Her friend was curled on the couch, her sweater was baggy enough it would have concealed everything but her rubbing pulled up her shirt and exposed the bottom of her growing pale paunch. She had finished off most of the table and was now steadily nibbling the cheesecake one slice at a time. Lizzy looked back down and realized that Clara' s pants were undone, allowing her belly to expand out, slowly creeping over the waistband of her pants. Her eyes still locked firmly on the movie but her face was lit up with a euphoric smile. Wether it was from the food or the movie Lizzy couldn't be sure, but she was happy to see her friend enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing through Clara' s mind when she woke up was how cozy she was. So soft and warm, but something felt off she thought as she tried to roll over and found herself pinned down. She arched her back in an effort to wake up and rolled her shoulders. Her shirt had ridden up, showing off her belly. She was used to a little softness but this was completely new. It bulged a couple inches over her pants, still round and firm from everything she ate but softer than she ever remembered it being with an extra layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Lizzy also approved of Clara' s growth because her inspection was stopped by Lizzy using Clara' s softer stomach as a pillow. Still out cold despite Clara shifting around she couldn't help but notice the satisfied smile on her face and she could feel the warmth of her face through her belly. Then she realized that her had had been groping Lizzy' s softer pudge the whole time. Embarrassment made her face glow but she had a sudden spur of curiosity and determination. Taking a breath to steady herself, she continued to gently rub Lizzy' s gut and used her other hand to explore her own. Judging them up, comparing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy' s was ahead of hers beyond a doubt. She had been at this for weeks and had always been just a little bigger than Clara, but she also had a major height advantage over Clara meaning the slightest bit of weight was easily noticeable. The old, worn out t-shirt Lizzy wore was stretched thin, rising halfway over her round middle and stretched tight across her chest. Her bra straps standing out against the thin top. The bottoms were fighting a losing fight trying to hold back the rising muffin top flooding over them. She took her glasses off to sleep but her soft face relaxed as she slept comfortably was so adorable she almost looked like a chibi, Clara thought with a small tinge of jealousy. She was always self conscious about herself, and had never considered herself cute, though many people would say otherwise, but comparing herself to Lizzy right now, she couldn't help but wonder if it was the new weight that brought out this chuberic cuteness in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud rumble and a yawn Lizzy stirred from her sleep. Clara quickly pulled back her hands, blushing from almost getting caught rubbing Lizzy' s belly. Her friend rolled over and gave her a big, soft hug.<br>\r\n\"Hi! Good morning.\" She mumbled, pulling herself up and stretching her hand over her head, sliding her shirt up a little higher.<br>\r\n\"So, how about breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the mention of more food made Clara' s tummy rumble in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizzy giggled \"I'll take that as a yes.\"</span></div></div>",

She pulled off the wig from her head, allowing her full mane of hair to tumble over her shoulders, as she sighed, allowing her body to sink through the fabric of her seat, and dissolve into the expanse of the world around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chuckled to herself as she imagined coming to school in this get-up. The other girls would have a field day. \"Popular track star goes delusional\" sounded like a decent article headline. Still, there was a reason for the cosplay. On the off-chance anyone from school actually did see her on the site, they'd never recognize her. Now, naturally, she wore minimal make-up for this particular cosplay, but regardless, the disguise was good enough to fool any passerby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, as the girls had said when she was younger, all the Asian girls looked alike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misato!

She was so often with friends speaking English her native tongue sounded quite foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, she just wanted to check out the comments to her last video, which had earned her, at that point, a good five hundred bucks! Sure, it was pocket money next to some reviewers, but hey, it was more than enough for the fun she had putting the vid together. She skimmed the comments, smirking with each compliment, taking into account the critiques, until she reached one odd comment that left her, at first, confused. It was only after realizing several other comments agreed with the aforementioned statement that Misato began wondering. The comment read...</span></div></div>",

She couldn't always watch those because she was with friends and wanted her 'secret geekiness' to remain secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFriday afternoon and evenings were now spent by Misato watching TV while most her friend had replaced Gym by some sport done outside of school. The rest of her friend were seemingly doing the same as Misato. Misato was faithful to her TV shows; unfortunately she quickly develloped a bad habit. Munching in front of the TV. She knew her parents would disapprove, luckily she was able to hide it. But almost anything sugary or salty could find its way into Misato's belly; it seemed she was constantly snacking on those fridays; she was worried for a second during the commercial break that she might get fat or extand this habit to other aspect of her life. But then Dr.Who started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter six weeks; that weekly habit, which had quickly led to snacking on other occasions like being on her computer or doing her homework, had results on Misato. Her breasts had gone a cup up, to Misato's delight. However, her thighs and butt had also increased as well. Misato could see that she no longer fitted her jeans or skirts. She tried a tank top on, but saw that her breasts plus an increased belly were making it much tighter. And while she liked tight cloths, she saw that the 10-15 pounds she had gained were going to impact her social life. It also made her feel powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, Misato was now faced with a choice. She could either keep watching TV on Fridays, exercise a little on her own and stop snacking; in other words, diet. Or she could take the problem at its roots by stopping to watch TV, or less on Fridays afternoon.</span></div></div>",

So she threw away all the snacks in the house; decided to try and exercise in front of the TV. But she maintained her three course meals, with an emphasis on a heavy desert just before bed, which was impeding the expected weight loss. After a few days like these, Misato had made little progress. Diet was failure in Misato's eyes. She ahd lost only 4 pounds after 2 weeks of diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisato wasn't one to give up easily. She decided that eating altogether was a problem and decided to solve the problem in the most efficient way she could think of: go anorexic for awhile. At first, it was difficult to keep up with little meals and resist the temptation, as well as keeping herself in check against all the reflexes she had develloped because of her poor eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, she had lost all the weight; after eating only dinner, and then she was eating as much as a third world girl would; which wasn't much. She mustered her willpower to resist the temptation to go and have a snack; she only authorized a light sald for lunch somedays. Her parents were deeply worried, but Misato lied and claimed that she had checked with a doctor online to make sure it was healthy. After 3 weeks of torture, Misato had all the extra pounds gone; to her regret that included those in her chest. But she was glad to be fitting again. And so life went back to normal; and that proved to be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a month, she was worse off than when she started her diet. Indeed, she had snacked as she did before. Worse than that, she had feasted on cakes and pizzas for a week to celebrate the end of her diet. But her diet was mostly starving herself; this meant that once she found a regular stream of food, her metabolism was in a much lower gear. And that had an effect on her body. She had gained 25 pounds and was giving no signs of stoping; those pounds were in her thighs and butts mostly; which meant that she had to buy skirts and jeans all over again. Although, her boobs, hips and belly were starting to catch up; which would mean buying a whole new wardrobe soon.</span></div></div>",

A look in a full-sized mirror would have revealed that she now had a big belly that rested on her lap; she had love handles; her breast had finally started to grow a little.

However, what was odd about the whole thing wasn't so much that Misato was changing more and more, but that she really was starting to think she looked sorta cute now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was stupid. There was no way this was supposed to be, but Misato honestly preferred her chubby frame over her slender one.  Her boobs had grown since she first started gaining weight, along with her hips. Her cute round face wasn't ugly at all, but rather gave her admittedly adorable dimples. Not only that, but even her online show was giving her good feedback, even if it was just because her cleavage had increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at herself naked in a mirror for awhile, and wondered if she should just see if her new body worked out for her....</span></div></div>",

Sandy was tough and self-confident, but she was a total jock; making out with her had been a blast, but they'd had nothing else to do after their lips got tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jane -- Jane was something different.   She was a senior, but new to the school--she'd just transferred--and didn't waste any time letting the guys she was initially swarmed with know she wasn't interested.   She dressed like a goth hipster, but someone on her it felt--real.  Authentic.  Like she was dressing like herself, and it was the goths and hipsters imitating her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had dark hair and cat's eye glasses, a body like a tennis champion and a knowledge of movie trivia to rival Roger Ebert's.  She recognized quotes from <i>Krull</i>, for God's sake!   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose had never crushed so hard on someone in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was, Jane seemed completely immune to her attempts at flirting.  Rose had been dropping hints the way stoners drop classes, but Jane just didn't seem interested.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Screw </i>subtlety.  Today Rose was finding out once and for all if she had a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was too busy digging through her locker to have noticed her yet.   She was wearing a black hoodie and dark plaid skirt over hiking boots.   Hot <i>damn</i>, her legs were fantastic.  And her figure; Rose could see her natural athleticism in every movement, even under the baggy sweater.   She tugged at the hem of her long-sleeved T-shirt, suddenly very conscious of the way her own stomach formed a sloppy little pooch.  Blugh.  She sucked it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, hey, Jane,\" she said as casually as she could, leaning against the next-door locker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Rose.\"  Jane smiled at her.  \"What's shaking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much.

More like... 'fat'.  You're not fat.  Honestly, Rose, you're adorable, it really is just me and my weird tastes.  Have you tried asking Sandy out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose punched her locker in frustration.  \"Dammit, why couldn't you have been here last year?   First holiday season since my parents split, I was doing the joint-custody thing and I swear it was like a competition between them who could get the most food into me.  I bounced from Mom's house to Dad's house to both sets of grandparents, getting fatter every time.  I swear I must have gained thirty pounds that winter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's eyebrows shot up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously!  I was freaking <i>huge</i>.

But I'm free to make my own choices, and if I choose to bulk up a little, that's up to me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you decide you want to be a part of it,\" she continued snippily,  \"you know where to find me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy lunch, Rose was already regretting her words.    Jane was her friend.  What kind of jerk put a friend in that position?  And Rose had always hated the losers who couldn't take no for an answer.   Still... she just knew she and Jane were a good match.  Jane just needed a little push to see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if she didn't follow up on what she'd said, Jane would think she was a total wimp.  And Rose would rather look like an asshole than a flake any day of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she followed up her sack lunch with a hot lunch from the cafeteria, and tossed down a bag of M+Ms from the vending machines on top of it.   It was a lot more food than she was used to.   She could barely keep her eyes open in her next class, her stomach was so full.<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nFive pounds</i>, she decided.  <i> If five pounds doesn't win her over, I'll drop it.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The truth was, it's wasn't that great a dish, but she'd be damned if she was going to let those sticky, starchy calories pass her by.   She'd already polished off three servings, not to mention all the garlic mashed potatoes and corn.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to have room for dessert after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Noooo</i>, Rose thought.  <i>No dessert.

She collapsed on the bed and flipped open her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane was on!  \"hi,\" Rose texted her, trying to get comfortable.  \"whats goin on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not much,\" Jane texted back.  She always used capital letters and punctuation.  It was kind of cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose shifted uncomfortably.

God, why can't I get through to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross town, Jane's head swam with visions.   The past -- this last week, Rose glutting herself with abandon.  The future -- Rose getting bigger, fuller, softer, her thighs rubbing together, her belly growing soft and pillowy.  She imagined what it would feel like to have that flesh between her fingers, to feel that silly skin over a cushion of plushness.   <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nDammit, I can't let myself get sucked in his this.  Not again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay on to the bed, imagining, and slipped one hand into her pajama bottoms.</span></div></div>",

After the awkward IM debacle, Rose had kicked her eating into overdrive, determined to catch Jane's attention one way or another.  Glutting herself at every meal was one part of this plan, but the other had been keeping Jane delightfully in the dark on the subject- loose fitting, billowy skirts and sweatshirts had been the rather odd fashion pairings adorning Rose's slowly growing figure.  And although the change wasn't astounding (after all, she only had a week under her belt), Rose was confident that today's outfit would surely catch Jane's attention.  And judging by the look on Jane's face as she approached her from the end of the hall, it worked all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane couldn't believe her eyes, or the fact that her friend had the audacity to show up to school, dressed as she was.  Jane had managed to cram herself into a pair of shorts that probably hadn't been considered decent a week ago, and were much less so decent now, with the additional pounds she had clearly gained, judging by the bulging effect on her thighs from the overly tight shorts- and while Jane couldn't see Rose's backside from this angle, she was more than certain that everyone behind Rose was getting a bit too much of a view of her butt to be considered OK in public.  Further accentuating the ineffectiveness of Rose's clothes was the very prominent muffin top, which oozed over the top of the painful looking shorts, Rose's creamy, slightly chubby flesh open for all the world to see.  Rose was also wearing a button up shirt that was probably three years old, hence none of the buttons being done up, exposing her very ill-fitting t-shirt, which looked as though it was originally sporting the school mascot, but was so tight and stretched out on Rose's chest that it was almost unrecognizable.  Jane walked as quickly as possible up to Rose, her face burning red with mixed feelings of anger and arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth do you think you're doing?\" Jane hissed at Rose, who was grinning like a mad-woman.  \"You're getting stared at by everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose's face, complete with shit eating grin, didn't even falter as she responded...</span></div></div>",

The idea that Rose, fat as she was with still room to be bigger was a massive turn on for the dark haired beauty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly reading her mind, Rose pushed forward, thrusting herself into Jane's personal space and at the same time jutting out her fattened belly a bit more. The muffin top flowed outwards. Jane's mouth went dry and involuntarily, she licked her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up on the cues, Rose did a little 360, just a little something to give Jane a full view. Fat, plump muffin top, wide juicy love handles and oh that backside. in the shorts that would have fit a week ago, the two globes of Rose's butt protruded indecently. \"you like one of those girls from a rap video,\" Jane blurted, making herself feel like a fool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a fool is not what Rose thought of the sexy, fat fetishist Jane. She laughed, an honest, sincere and just a little seductive laugh. Pushing out her fat bum at Jane, she commented, \"Like one of those so called ghetto booties? Nah, my butt is way bigger than that. Indeed it was, at least the rap video girls wore pants that fit. Rose's shorts looked like they were about to burst. As she rotated around to face Jane again, her two butt cheeks moves up and down; grinding against one another like soft pearls of sensual, Rubenesque pleasure.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose leaned forwards, soft cleavage ready to explode from the window the shirt provided. She wasn't too fat yet, but what fat she had she had in the most wonderful of places. It was calling to all the secret fetishes that Jane had always nurtured but never really admitted. Maybe it was time for Rose to prick Jane away from her slumber; wake up the sleeping fat admirer in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked down and left and right, seeing if there was anybody else watching. It was Rose's turn to be shocked when Jane reached out and grabbed her soft tummy in both hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose struggled to stifle the gasp of pleasure that came from her lips as her belly flesh was groped and kneaded by the girl of her dreams. The fire inside her core was burning at overtime; both girls were on fire with repressed sexuality. Such round saphic beauty could hardly be found anywhere; its a rare thing indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane spoke with confidence that turned on Rose like no tomorrow, \"How big are you when you're totally full?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose whimpered like a horny waif, \"Uh . . . um, not sure.\" She was totally Jane's now. The ginger girl gasped when Jane dared to grope her left boob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane leaned and grinned at the girl under her power, \"Meet me at my house tonight, I'll have food. Show me what you got.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, in another surprise, she went and kissed Rose full on the mouth. Soulful and sensual, her kiss was all tongue and lips and full of passion. Rose literally felt herself melt; she was going to need some relief after this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss lasted only ten seconds, but it was the finest kiss that either girl had ever had. It was literally perfect and the connection was solidified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose gasped, for breath, pulling away before she said. </span></div></div>",

Five chocolate milk cartons, ten cookies, seven burgers, and more fries than she bothered to measure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first bite was a bit painful, her stomach crying to not be feed any more. The second was better, the grease in the burgers and the chocolate in the milk helping her ignore the fact her tummy wanted to burst.

You look fabulous!\" Emily smiled, running up to her blubbery friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look fat!\" she almost screamed back, trying to hide her belly growls. \"When's this diet gonna work, if ever?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, soon...\" Emily said, all but ignoring her. \"Here, a morning snack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily opened her backpack, revealing a dish with what <i>looked</i> like some sort of deep-fried cake-concoction, swimming in sugar, butter, fat... Jane felt herself bloat up just being in the same room as it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what\", jane said, making as disgusted motion towards the cake, \"is this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snack. Open wide~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! I'm tired of being fa-\" Jane managed before a handful of the cake was shoved in her mouth. She paused, chewed, and moaned in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\" Emily smirked, rubbing Jane's ravenous belly.</span></div></div>",

Jane got stuck in her desk both first and second periods, belched loudly during third, and unzipped her pants during fourth just to breath.

Jane had become a fat-digesting,   quickly-growing, very-bloated <i>monster</i> to everyone but Emily, who had all but convinced Jane that she was better the fatter she got. Not that it mattered if Jane <i>liked</i> it, she'd fallen so far into being fed every waking moment that by now, a true diet would kill her. Emily had spent the great majority of her time concocting ways to enforce calorie-climbing habits into Jane, and she was in grasp of succeeding. And amidst all this, Emily had begun inadvertently gaining as well, a near-perfectly round potbelly filling her white blouse. Not that she minded; She often daydreamed of the both of them, fat and happy together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw Jane from across the hall, she was not easy to miss. Jane's belly was overflowing from her shirt and pants, jutting three feet out in front of her, gurgling and sloshing, unable to even button her extra-extra-sized jeans. Her breasts were somewhere betwean beachballs and basketballs, and her rear was between the size of two beachballs and yoga balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she still somehow looked cherubic, sweet. Rumor was that more than a few guys harbored secret crushes towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Jane! I love your new shirt!\" Emily said, hugging Jane, her potbelly literally sinking into Jane's. Jane hugged back as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Emily... What's today's snack?\" Jane blushed, ashamed of her gluttony, yet still very hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How about we just try to ... meet in the middle?   I'll diet, and for every pound I lose, you have to gain a pound.   How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"  Emily considered it, then stuck out one corpse-pale hand for shaking.  \"All right.  You've got my solemn oath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, just like that?  Okay, um, first weigh-in right now, second in two weeks, shall we say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say,\" Emily said airily.   \"I hope you realize that there's a very important reason why I agreed so quickly; you're never actually going to lose any weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might be surprised what I can do when I really, really try,\" Jane said grimly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily tossed her ivory hair.  \"I'll believe THAT when I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's just what she did in two weeks' time, when both girls hopped back on the scales and Emily discovered to her utter shock Jane had lost a solid eight pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but-but--\" Emily stammered, \"but how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The right diet and exercise,\" Jane said.

In the mornings and during lunch she usually didn't have anybody to sit with. So much of her lunches were spent inside the library.

Taylor did the usual reply to comments, ban people, etc. After 10 minutes on the site everything felt back to last year. She logged onto the websites chat and started to talk to other members around the world. \"Is this seat taken?\" asked a girl. Taylor turned her head and saw a large girl about her size. She had light brown skin, c cup breasts, a flabby belly, but Taylor couldn't help but look at her fat butt. Which was covered by her too small shorts. \"No it's not. Go ahead and sit.\" Taylor said. \"So what's your name?\" Asked Taylor. \"My names Mariah\" said the girl in shorts. For the next 5 Minutes they talked about anime and all of the geeky things they liked. The bell rung. \"Crap well looks like i gotta go\" said Mariah getting out of her seat which her large butt covered. \"See ya\" said Taylor. Taylor turned her head just to see Mariah walked away.

She pulled up the Domino's Pizza app and quickly selected the XXL meat feast pizza with stuffed crust and cheesy garlic bread. \"This is gonna be delicious,\" she smiled laying back down and grabbing a random comic book from the side of her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes later, she was smiling as she sat down on her bed, crossing her legs as best she could and opening up the pizza box and digging in.</span></div></div>",

Now, I don't wish to bore you, but a few ground rules are in order!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. When you add onto this story, please write chapters longer than a measly few sentences. You don't have to write Shakespeare, but at least put some effort into progressing the story.<br>\r\n2. Try to keep it realistic. If they're going to gain massive amounts of weight, have a time skip. There are other stories on this site for obnoxious, instant gains of a thousand pounds. Let's try to keep this somewhat rooted in reality. On that note, if magic is involved, and there's no way you can avoid using it, try to keep it at a minimum. <br>\r\n3. Guys can gain if you really want, I don't really care, but let's keep the focus on the women.<br>\r\n4. No one younger than fourteen...that's just wrong...unless you are under fourteen, in which case, I apologize.<br>\r\n5. Lesbians and gay people are perfectly fine, but try to keep the fetishy focus on the gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI believe that should be all the issues. Thank you very much, and enjoy!</td>",
