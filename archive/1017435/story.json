After succesfully passing all the traps, she reached the last room: Ielenia's room. After an even battle, Alhandra cornered Ielenia. But just as Alhandra prepared to perform the last blow with her sword, Ielenia spoke a spell:<br>\r\n\"For trying to kill me in my own house,<br>\r\nyou will now shrink to the size of a mouse\".<br>\r\nJust as the last word was spoken, Alhandra started to glow in a light blue light. \"What's happening?\", said Alhandra, as Ielenia started to grow before her eyes. After some seconds, the glow faded and Ielenia stopped growing. Alhandra looked at everything else: \"All the room was huge\". She realized that Ielenia hadn't grown, she shrunk! She was now 2 inches tall.<br>\r\nShe stared up and saw that the giant sorceress was benting down. Ielenia's hand was now approaching to Alhandra. She took her sword and with a fast movement, she made a cut on Ielenia's palm.<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\", said Ielenia, standing up and holding her hand with the other. Alhandra ran towards the door, but just before she reached it, a giant sandal stomped in front of her. The tremor made her fall on her ass. <br>\r\n\"You are going nowhere\", said Ielenia. Alhandra raised her sword once more, but Ielenia, with a swift movement of her foot, kicked it off her hand. <br>\r\n\"What are you going to do now without your sword?\", asked Ielenia as she slowly raised her foot over Alhandra.<br>\r\nSuddenly, a strong earthquake made them both fall down. Then, the roof of the castle was teared of, and a huge red dragon's head appeared from above. It breathed a long line of fire, but the sorceress made a magic shield to protecct her. Alhandra wasn't reached by the fire, but the intense heat made her faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up, she was...</span></div></div>",
