His eyes adjusted to the dim light of the room finding that he was laid flat on his back, staring up at a ceiling made of smooth metal. He struggled to move, but found that his limbs were tied up tight with leather straps. Drowsiness led to fear. Fear led to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Where am I?!\" he yelled, squirming around on the cold, hard steel beneath his body. He seemed to be on an elevated platform of very crude, but efficient design. His eyes swerved around to see what he could find. His head wasn't bound up, so he was able to see much of his surroundings. It was a rather large, spacious room with very little detail - just smooth metal, the platform, a door, and what seemed to be a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon didn't feel safe at all, but he didn't seem to be in any immediate danger. He tried to remember what happened, or how he came to be here, but nothing came to mind. His thoughts were interrupted at a hissing, crackling sound, apparently coming from a hole in the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, number two. If you'll remain calm, we'll begin the procedures immediately.\" Ord blinked a bit. \"Wha... What are you talking about? Where am I? What do you mean, 'number two'!?\" He continued to struggle 'n strain against his restraints, but to no avail. \"Calm down,\" came the voice, \"just relax and enjoy yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice was replaced with a strange, eery chanting sound. Even stranger was that Ord was in no way alarmed - instead, the noise acted like a symphony of lullabies, calming him to a near-stupid state. His eyes rolled back jovially, opening his maw 'n letting his tongue loll out freely. The perfect captive. Another whirring noise emanated from the room, but it was indiscernible where it came from.</span></div></div>",

She was curled up in a comfortable ball, lightly dozing against a tree stump where sunbeams liked to gather. She would have slept quite peacefully if not for the bellowing blue figure that approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie! Hey, Cassie, wake up! You're not gonna believe what I found!\" bellowed Ord, several odd plants clutched to his torso, held protectively by his arms. Cassie merely ignored him, causing Ord to frown. \"Come on!\" he said, promptly nudging her with his foot. \"Wake up already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie groaned in protest, waking up with a rather loud yawn. \"Huh...? What is it?\" she said, stretching her arms out wide. Ord was all too eager to show off, restraining himself from bouncing up 'n down. He shoved one of the plants into her hands, smiling wide as he spoke. \"I was off exploring near Quetzal's house, right? I got a little bored, so I went off beyond the hills... and I found this <i>huge</i> field full of food that I've never seen before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink dragon tried to look excited for him, but she was still a little tired and knew it was typical of Ord to get so worked up over food, especially something he'd never tried before. Still, she let him continue, keeping the strange plant in her hands. \"I didn't see anyone, so I thought I'd bring some of it back for us!\" Ord held out his fruit, similar to the one Cassie held. It looked like an unripe orange, a fist-sized sphere that was green in color with a mottled, splotchy spots. Coincidentally, Ord's fruit had blue spots while Cassie's had pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think we should eat these? They might do something bad!\" said Cassie, her voice stressing caution. She knew better than to eat strange food, but she did feel pretty hungry at the moment. \"What's the worst that could happen?\" came Ord's reply,   already eating his own fruit. The innards of the fruit seemed to match the splotches, as Ord's fruit seemed to be blue and pulpy. \"Hey, these're pretty good!\" said Ord, his mouth full of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie decided to eat the odd little ball in her hands, but at a much more savory pace. Raising the fruit to her lips, she took a small bite out of the flesh, tasting the pink innards of the fruit in the process. It was... sweet. <i>Very</i> sweet. It was as though she were eating a badly made cotton candy product, but it wasn't all that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young dragon ate the rest of her fruit quickly after that, finding the taste very satisfactory. \"You're right, those <i>are</i> good! Do you have any more?\" Ord looked sort of sad once she asked, shaking his head. \"Um, well, no... I only took those two.\" Cassie merely smiled 'n nodded. \"Well, that's alright. Do you think we should get some more?\" Ord scratched his head as he spoke. \"Uh... I don't know. Those might've belonged to someone. Maybe we should wait a little, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded in agreement, sitting down comfortably on the nearby tree stump. The sun felt especially warm on their bellies, not a cloud in the sky. Cassie felt a light stirring in her stomach, but she dismissed it as simple digestion. The rumbling persisted a little, patting her belly in an attempt to settle her gut...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sadness is a terrible thing to feel, and that's all the more true when it strikes in a place as pleasant and cheerful as Dragon Land. Yet that was just the case for a particular resident, Cassie, a pink young dragoness with something of a mood problem; she was more than level-headed, and quite kind--the problem here was sadness, and how little it made her feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, feel and <i>look</i>. Usually about three feet in height, the little dragon was roughly, at the moment, about 6 inches tall; from the look on her face, she seemed ready to shrink even smaller, still. She sat, tiny legs dangling off the stone edge of a well--Wyatt's wishing well, to be precise. She had been sitting there for half an hour, not ready to give into crying, yet not quite ready to be cheered up, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cassie?\" came a low, albeit childish voice from the distance. She glanced up in time to see Ord, a much larger, heavier-set blue dragon, looking around as he came up the hill, towards the well. He was always very large for his age, and whenever she was sad enough to dwindle down to such tiny sizes, he just seemed all the larger. Maybe a tiny part of her tiny self felt an equally tiny twinge of envy, though never enough to dislike him--quite the opposite, he was one of her best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought she'd be here, that's funny,\" Ord mused aloud, as he often did, looking this way and, eventually, that. He began to turn away, when an idea must have struck him from afar, making him spin back around and lean over the edge of the well.  \"Wyatt!\" he yelled, before realizing he'd been too loud, and lowering his voice some.  \"Wyatt, are you down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darker waters near the bottom of the well stirred, and a purple walrus peered up through them, coking his head up at Ord.  \"Where else would I be?\" he asked, sincerely.  \"What can I do for you, up there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see a pink girl dragon come by earlier? We were getting a picnic ready for our human friends a little while ago, and she tried to carry a big basket; she couldn't lift it for long, though, and it fell over, and food got everywhere!\" he explained, unbidden, waving his arms for emphasis. \"She got so embarrassed, she flew away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a shame!\" Wyatt said sympathetically. \"Is there anything I can do, wish-wise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I don't think--YES!\" Ord exclaimed, flapping his small wings as he did so.  He leaned further in. \"She has this habit of getting teeny-tiny whenever she gets sad, and since that means she's probably still small now, if you could help fix that shrinking ability of hers, I could find her really quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a wish, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!  Please, every time she gets sad, I don't want her to shrink down. I want her to feel...up!! Way up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that's a wish!\" Wyatt spoke, nodding authoritatively.  Cassie, who hadn't quite felt un-embarrassed enough to face Ord, had been hiding on the other side of the well, blushing furiously; now she was only 2 inches tall, and burning at the thought of having made the other dragons unhappier by going off.  Oh, she couldn't face them now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrd thundered off thoughtlessly, wagging his tail some at his own cleverness.  Moments passed, and Cassie felt herself growing slowly back to about her normal size; the more she thought about it, the more kind she felt it was of Ord to have asked for that wish at all.  Her frown did some overdue upside-downing, and with her grin, she felt herself lurch up to her normal size at last...or so she thought, as she turned to face the well, and found it only went up to her waist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-wha...\" Cassie began, blushing anew, and deeper than before; with the rush of shock, her emotions flared up momentarily, and she found her toes curling tight as another ripple raced through her belly, her scales creaking out rapidly as she swelled up another foot, then another, gasping aloud.  The noise must have been noisy enough, as she heard:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, another visitor? That's rare!\"  Wyatt spoke more to himself, before his voice echoed up to Cassie.  \"Oh! A pink dragoness!  You must be that blue fellow's friend, Cassie!  I see you're no longer small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I'm not,\" she replied, having to bend in a bit to fit her head over the well.  \"In fact, I'm big now!  Very big!  I heard Ord's wish, and while I'm grateful, well...could you undo it?  I think there's a side effect, I've doubled my size in a few minutes!\" She blushed more, and felt herself surge bigger again, her bulk filling up the top of the well, the little well's roof cracking open as her pink backside blew up through it; over 8 feet high and still shuddering, Cassie tried to wriggle free, only to feel the well's topside crumble and cave in as her 10-foot body landed on it, cutting Wyatt off completely.  She blinked some, then realized she was huge enough to lay over the well itself, her feminine eyes widening in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnfth mmpt!\" cam Wyatt's voice.  He seemed unharmed--but what had he said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hold on!  I'll dig you out!\" Cassie began, starting to lift up the bricks one by one with her bigger hands.  This was actually pretty easy!  The teeniest little flash of pride was felt, as for once she found herself bigger than any of the other dragons--she might even be Quetzal's size!  The thought did something strange to her--she shot up another 3 feet, fed by the sudden feeling of pride in herself.  She felt big, inside and out!  But oh, Wyatt was still down there!  For minutes on end she dug, until only water was revealed at the undamaged portion of the bottom of the well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...okay, calm down,\" Cassie began, taking some surprisingly deep breaths.  Amazingly, as she quieted her heartbeat, she felt herself dwindling back down steadily, foot by foot.  Yet at around 5 feet she stopped, and found she couldn't get any smaller, leaving her near Ord's impressive size.  \"That's it?\" she thought aloud, starting to feel flush.  She couldn't get any smaller!  Her breathing became more rapid, and she felt herself tingling all over again; panicking momentarily, Cassie looked both ways, then thumped off down the hillside, towards the school. With every thudding footfall she got bigger and bigger, until she had to stop to catch her breath, leaning against a tree.  She must have run into the dandelion forest!  That meant the tree she was leaning on was a giant Dandelion, one that was already growling in annoyance at her bending it over so--gads, she was bigger than it!  She must have been about 20 feet, bigger than she was before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry!\" she sputtered, before it bounced back into her, brushing its fluff against her scales; she wrinkled her nose and held in a laugh, as it and the others began to wobble around, tickling her something awful; unable to hold it in any longer, she burst out laughing, feeling her body tense up all over; her hide began to pull tighter over her growing mass, the laughing dragoness starting to inflate bigger and bigger, still, 23 feet rumbling up to 25 feet, then 29 feet, then 34 feet!  Soon she was bigger than that, unable to stop laughing hysterically, as the more she swelled up, the more the increasingly small dandelions there were to brush against her; soon she was so big that they came up to her feet, as though they were regular flowers!  She wheezed and wiped a tear from her eye...then really took in her surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my! L-look at me!\" Cassie roared, not meaning to; she was towering now, gigantic, well-over 90 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom far enough away, Ord stood in shock, watching the titanic Cassie swell up into the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he HAD found her, technically.  A <i>lot</i> of her!</span></div></div>",

At the end of this cave system sat the old creature, hunched over his desk in deep, concentrated thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs benevolent and instructive as he was, the dragon frequently found himself the recipient of intense disrespect. Time and time again he overheard conversations about his indirect methods; the rumors of his incompetence; the tall tales that his age was catching up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passive taunting burned at his soul, a festering hatred welling up within his aged being.

He knew exactly what he wanted - a set period of time to prove that he could be bigger than anything they could throw at him. <i>\"Maybe then those little brats will give me some respect!\"</i> he thought to himself, busily collecting his materials and surveying the product of his work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his left was a frothing, bubbling potion that glowed a sickly pale blue, surely the fastest and most efficient method... at least, that's what his calculations told him. To his right, an aged parchment with a single incantation on it. If the spell was still intact, it could easily devastate his students, provided it didn't backfire in anyway. Finally, in front of him was a rare form of fruit, similar to an unripe orange. It's exterior was rough with mottled yellow splotches and held a yellow inner fruit. He wasn't really sure how the fruit would work out, he merely knew it would make him larger...which is exactly what he wanted. Those disrespectful punks would pay - oh yes, they would pay.</span></div></div>",

Cassie wasn't sure what was going on but she wasn't really worried at all about it. Ord was her friend so she didn't suspect anything bad was going to happen and they were just going to play. As Cassie approached the field she looked down to see it was oddly empty but she still landed anyway and just figured Ord was late. As Cassie landed on the soft grass she spotted a patch of white among the green which upon closer inspection turned out to be a note with a pack of red gum next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry Cassie but I had to go do something, I'll be back in 5 minutes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. try the gum, it's great<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie looked at the pack of gum in her hand and... </span></div></div>",

She knew Ord absolutly LOVED dragonberries and wasn't all that surprised that he prefered dragonberry flavored gum. \"Well I better just wait for him to come\" said Cassie as she took out a piece of gum and popped it in her mouth. As Cassie began to chew she was almost overwhelmed by how much the gum taseted like dragonberries \"WOW this is good!\" exclaimed Cassie continueing to chew \"I better thank Ord when he gets here\" she added as she put the rest of the gum in her pouch for later. The dragonberry taste continued to flood her mouth as Cassie continued to to chew unsually vigorusly, she almost felt the like gum was making her chew. Out of bordem Cassie got ready to blow a bubble which Emmy had just recently showed her how to do. Cassie began to blow a red colored bubble that started small at first but as she continued the bubble grew unusually fast. Before Cassie knew it the bubble was the size of her head and continued to grow 'Wow! I've never done that before! I wonder how big I can get it!' thought Cassie as she tried to blow even harder. The bubble grew and grew until it was it was at least 3ftx3ft and almost touched the ground at which point Cassie popped it in order to keep her gum from getting ruined on the ground. Cassie used her claws to pop the bubble which burst with a loud BANG and a shower of some weird red colored liquid which Cassie thought was odd. \"What was that?\" asked Cassie after she brought the remaining gum back into her mouth and began chewing again \"I've never seen a bubble pop like that before, what am I covered in?\"  continued Cassie seeing she had some of the liquid on her scales. Cassie took out a napkin from her pouch and began to wipe off the red liquid from her scales \"At least it's not gum, this stuff is easy to get off\" said Cassie glad she wouldn't be scraping gum off her scales for hours. After Cassie was done with her body she took out a mirror and checked her face to see if she had any there as well. Thankfully all she found was a little spot on the tip of her nose which she went to wipe off with the napkin. Cassie gave it a quick wipe but when she removed the napikn that the spot was still there, she tried again but it only seemed to get bigger the second time, on the third try she wipped harder but it only grew again. \"What is this?\" asked Cassie confused as she looked in the mirror and saw that the red spot was spreading to the rest of her nose \"Wait! It's not a stain! I'm turning red!\" shouted Cassie as she watched as her nose turned completly red as the rest of her face was begining to as well. \"Why is this happening?\" asked Cassie rather calmly considering her situation. She had been turned completly green before put that had to do with magic fingerpaints, this time she had no idea what was going on. Cassie just stood in place and watched herself turn red as she tried to think of what was going on and how she could stop it, all the while chewing her gum. The red spread from her head to neck and upperbody changing her pink scales red and her white belly a pink color that was a bit lighter than her normal shade of pink. The color change spread down to her waist and lower back where it continued onto her tail and legs. Cassie looked down to see the last of her normal pink scales on her feet turn red and her color change complete. When it was done Cassie looked herself over curiously and wondered how she would her her normal color back. She liked the color red but prefered her natural pink color, she also didn't want her mommy thinking she had dyed her scales like some of the older dragons. Suddenly, as Cassie was examing her body, something caught her attention...  </span></div></div>",

His teeth gnashed crudely over each morsel of food, juices running down his chin while keeping his mouth open, sloppy crunching noises echoing from within the 'fridge. His butt was sticking straight up in the air, spewing out fart after hot, retched fart, fueled by the food sliding into his growing belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce nearly empty, Ord scooped up the remnants of the food in his arms and made his way toward the living room, lifting his leg and uttering out \"Unh!\" once a massive burst of gas belched out of his tailhole, causing each of his buttocks to flap together. He waddled his way toward the couch, slumping down in a heap 'n kicking his legs up onto the table, reaching for the remote to turn on the T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the food piled up on his lap. It was a pretty ample collection, easily taking up some of most of his gut. His eyes were glued to the television, but his nasty urges forced him to continue, grabbing two enormous pieces of fried chicken with both hands. He stuffed them into his maw, each juicy crunch sending grease spluttering out of his lips and down his chin. Though his constant farting was slightly muffled by the couch cushions, a gulp of that chicken proved his mouth was nowhere near as silenced. His cheeks bulged out before a massive belch erupted from his maw, droplets of spittle and chunks of food splattering about messily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrd ignored the outburst as if it never happened, continuing to gorge with mixed concentration. As time passed on, every little aspect of him intensified. His farts grew louder, longer, and smellier. His body became fatter, his mind more twisted and nasty, and his belches were especially raunchy. So raunchy, in fact, that he could taste that awful pizza he had recently eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe loved every minute of it. The sights, the sounds, the smells... it was all too delicious.

While walking toward the door, a sudden surge of gassiness rumbled in his belly, pooling up just at the base of his belching pucker. The dragon farted each time he stepped forward 'til he approached the door, releasing the rest of the gas in a massive flatulent burst. With a satisfied sigh, he left his decidedly boring home in favor of Quetzal's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey there was not without its frustrations. Ord's sudden freedom mixed with his new found desire bred a deep-seated greed within his being, craving the raw filth of his own body. He wondered how long it would be before he truly took it too far... he liked the thought. He licked his lips, tasting the salty oils of his arm pit he had so recently sampled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short time, he came across Quetzal's house. It was a strangely sturdy construct; a simple looking house with two towers spiraling up from the sides of the roof. The entire dwelling was connected to a mountain, more than likely leading to a cave-like interior. Ord wasn't fond of trespassing, even if he was on good terms with the old dragon, but he was not here to learn Spanish - he was here to steal, if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure if Quetzal was home or not, deciding to take the sneaky approach 'n climb into an open window. The lights were off, and there seemed to be little to no activity, so he quickly tossed himself into what seemed to be some form of gathering or living room. So far, so good. He crept back toward where the elder dragon liked to work, keeping an eye out for any interesting items or containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrd's plush feet helped to work his way across the creaking floorboards, eventually stepping on a cold layer of stone. He had entered the cave network, noticing a flickering blue light beyond the distance. His fear was beginning to manifest, as the cave was exceptionally dark, and who knows where Quetzal was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached that blue light, it soon became apparent where the old dragon was. The silhouette of Quetzal was hunched over a rather plain wooden desk, a nearby candle with an odd blue flame glowing nearby. As he approached, hoping to duck off to the side, Ord felt a familiar pressure in his bowels that he could not contain. He tried to hold it off with both hands, a barely audible gasp of panic escaping his terrified face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Phbbbrrr-rrrppppppt!</i> His anus exploded in a gargantuan fart, the behemoth burst of flatulence easily heard well beyond the caves. What happened next would easily surprise Ord, watching Quetzal rise from his desk in a slow, steady manner. The blue dragon felt his knees tremble, knowing that despite his age, Quetzal was a force to be reckoned with. The yellow, aged hide of the elder spun in place, turning his head to glare out at the intruder, eyes glowing with a piercing gaze. He approached in a few mere steps, arms crossed neatly over his torso...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...That was pretty impressive.\" said Quetzal, his face beaming with pride. Ord blinked 'n couldn't believe what he had heard. \"E-Excuse me, sir?\" Quetzal kept his arms crossed, but he would lift his leg to the side and release a fart not unlike Ord's recent outburst. The elder dragon smiled. \"I said, good job. You're a natural at this sort of thing.\" Quetzal smiled as he spoke, the details of his body much more describable now that Ord could see him without being so utterly terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was definitely the same dragon as ever, but Ord noticed a few things he had not seen before on the elder. A steady trickle of fluid oozed out of his moist armpits, his once barren and scaled underarms now replaced with a thick bush of ebon hair. What's more, his feet were positively <i>enormous</i>, far bigger than his own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then,\" continued Quetzal, \"it seems you're developing tastes similar to mine. You could have just asked, amigo. I'm afraid I'm going to have to punish you.\" Quetzal's grin intensified as he spoke, leaving Ord to cower slightly. \"Wh-What are you gonna do to me...?\" asked Ord. Quetzal simply did a quick pirouette in place and snatched two bubbling potions - one brown, one blue. \"I'm going to give you your choice of potion, friend. If you don't choose, I'm going to smother you with my feet.\" He flexed his big, thick toes at the younger male. Ord thought they looked heavenly, but there was a difference between \"worship\" and \"smother.\" He reached his arm out toward the potions, thinking it over.</span></div></div>",

Moments later, the older dragon farted loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad idea Nino,\" he growled. \"That was for you, and since you wasted it I will have to punish you.
