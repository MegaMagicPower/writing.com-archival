I will delete additions that do this.<br>\r\n-The OC must be named and keep his name in any follow up chapters, no first person story telling with words like \"you\".<br>\r\n-No Average Joe's off the street, they have to have a reason for being shrunk near the female characters of the MCU. Example: A Hydra/Shield agent, Stark employee, or so on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual there are previously existing expectations on any submission placed in the story.<br>\r\n-They must be well written and thought out, use on proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling is a must. I recommend \"Grammarly\" as a writing tool.<br>\r\n-Every addition outside of choice chapters must be over 3,000-3,500 characters long, you'll notice most chapters I've written are twice if not three times that long, I'm not trying to be unreasonable here.<br>\r\n-Most of the time I realize when someone is interested in writing a specific chapter, please notify of your interest to write an addition so I can stop anyone from wasting their time on something someone else is working on. It's happened several times and I've felt bad for both parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now that we've covered that, welcome to the story.<br>\r\nListed below are the 3 Phases the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gone through so far and spots for Phase 4 and Phase 5.</span></div></div>",

The ever optimistic avenger decided he would give a proper apology to the agent before she left for the day. Clearing his throat once more, he meekly called out her name so as not to rudely barge in. It was as he said this however he began to feel light headed and struggled to keep his footing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Falling to his knees, he quickly noticed the ground getting closer and his sense of space quickly disorienting. He looked up to notice the tent growing larger only to look around and notice the world around him was quickly becoming massive. Unable to believe what he was seeing, his hands went to his face rubbing his eyes only to then be greeted by giant trees in front of him-- No, blades of grass! He would not have much time to comprehend his situation as the ground began to shake beneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Rapid and consistent tremors that would almost make Steve think there was an earthquake continued until the titanic tent opened to reveal the imposing goliath that was Peggy Carter. Wearing a white dress shirt tucked into a tight black pencil skirt she was still as beautiful as ever, thought Steve. Still, her presence was staggering as she took a small step outside the tent only to utterly shake Steve's world as her enormous high heels nearly crushed him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Hello? Did someone call for me?\" She questioned rather softly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     To Cap however, the question nearly deafened him as he instinctively went to cover his ears. He quickly realized that he needed her help quickly before she went back inside and screamed at the top of his lungs to get her attention. Much to Cap's dismay, not so much as a twitch of her ears seemed to indicate she heard him. Slightly annoyed, she began to turn away and head back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"No!\" Cap yelled in frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He reached for his back in hope. Thankfully, his trusty shield was still there, he reached his arm back and made a desperate throw to his giant crush as he smiled in anticipation as he hoped she would notice. This she did as her mountainous arm and hand moved to instinctively touch the spot on her upper leg the shield struck. Cap skillfully caught the shield as it ricocheted back into his hand but his smile quickly faded as the massive woman turned around with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Ow, what the hell hit my leg?\" She spat in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Her anger was clearly visible as she turned back around to look around again with her brows lowered. Once again, her heel moved frightening close to him but he made one last yell to get her attention, punctuated by blows to the front of her heels. As if by a miracle, she turned to his direction and knelt down slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Cap, initially relieved, stumbled backwards as what felt like a living mountain moved so fast. As his eyes travelled up, he paused as quite the heavenly view between her titanic legs and thighs presented itself. He quickly snapped out of this as he looked higher to notice her large eyes aimed at him. Cap chuckled a nervous sigh as he saw ___ in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Disbelief: Peggy, in utter shock, notices the inch tall Captain America beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Disgust: Peggy sees a tiny bug and raises her heel to quickly deal with the gross pest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Indifference: Peggy couldn't find anything and turned back around to her tent again. </span></div></div>",

What would normally be soft, delicate hands were now incomprehensibly large platforms, capable of utterly obliterating his small body without so much as a second thought. With this in mind, Cap carefully and cautiously climbed onto her finger and moved onto her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick sense of vertigo followed as he was thrown onto his back with Peggy raising him high above the ground in a feeling not too dissimilar to that of a roller coaster. Passing her long legs that could seemingly go on for miles to her torso that up above, housed breasts that were both equal parts beautiful and utterly terrifying in their size to Cap. He finally arrived at her gorgeous face. Cherry red lips the size of school busses consumed his field of vision as he was brought a little too close to them for his comfort. He opened his mouth to speak though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peggy! Can you hear me?\" He yelled with his hands at the sides of his mouth trying to amplify his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to open her mouth to respond which Cap was not prepared for. The beautiful red lips parted to reveal perfectly white teeth that looked sharp enough to cut into near anything. Those naturally also made way for a staggering maw with a tongue that looked not too dissimilar to a serpent guarding a long and horrifying path to somewhere Cap did not want to even think of entering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Steve. Not very well but just enough. What on earth happened to you?\" She replied once again, nearly deafening the poor avenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteve opened his mouth and began to explain but a distant sound of a car horn was heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot, Steve. My ride home is here, I need to carry you someplace safe. I don't particularly feel too comfortable with you in my hand as I may accidentally drop you.\" She punctuated with a nervous chuckle that nearly made Cap fall over again. \"Ah\" She bit her lip and blushed \"I have an idea, but don't get any funny ideas! I'll need to put you ___\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he walked into the kitchen area, he noticed the alien food Rocket had stolen from the people they'd just saved. A memory of Mantis saying some stuff about the food being unsafe or some weird side effects came to mind but Peter couldn't really be fussed to pay it much mind. He opened a soda from his stash of earth belongings and tried to do a cool spin while tossing it in the air, only to have it fall out his hand, bounce off his head and onto the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a defeated sigh, Peter just grabs the weird food and takes a bite, walking off without bothering to clean up his spilled drink. Suddenly, he starts to feel weird all of a sudden but, in typical manner, he just shrugs it off and keeps walking and listening to his music. Feeling a bit tired, he yawns and closes his eyes for a second. In that brief, short moment, he opens his eyes again and immediately his surroundings had changed. For a second, Peter thought he had been teleported somehow but taking a more cursory glance, he recognized the scenery as his ship, only much <b>MUCH</b> bigger. Walls as high as skyscrapers and tables big enough to hold an entire city, Peter was completely dumbfounded. Immediately, he started panicking and thinking up what he'd do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrax, Rocket and Groot were off doing some exploring and bartering on the nearby colony they were docked at leaving just Mantis, Gamora, and Nebula onboard for him to seek out. Thankfully, he was wearing his jetpack that miraculously still worked. He turned it on and started flying around looking for help. Yet again, Peter still couldn't comprehend just how small and diminutive he had become as halls he'd be able to traverse relatively quickly were taking him minutes upon minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started thinking about how dangerous his ship and even worse, his crewmates were at this size. Gamora would probably not even recognize him, he thought. The gigantic green alien could likely snuff him out with a single, unceremonious step of her boots. Nebula would likely be far worse, especially if she thought he was a bug. She tends to be... sadistic and considering her more repressed rage, Peter shuddered at how she would treat what she thought was a bug. He took solace in hoping he'd stumble upon Nebula first although with her affectionate and sweet yet na\u00efve nature, she may end up more trouble than expected. Eventually, he heard voices muffled in the distance to which he made a beeline to the common area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rounded a corner and there he spotted from a distance, Gamora and Nebula sitting on the couch having a heart to heart. They'd been trying to grow closer lately (to varying degrees of success) and typically Peter would be able to avoid it by dipping into another room but now it seemed he had to endure it this time. As he got closer, he was once again reminded of his size once he realized just how massive these two women were. They were already incredibly lethal at normal size but seeing their absolutely titanic figures just made Peter utterly intimidated on another level. His prior thoughts lingering in his head, he fearfully and cautiously decided to press forward only to find some difficulty with his jetpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fiddled with the controls and smacked it a few times until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The jetpack goes haywire, he gets quickly launched forward as he lands somewhere on Nebula's body and has to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

Given the two girl's competitive nature with one another they both attempt to kill the \"fly\" each progressively trying to one-up the other in each more extravagant attempts</span></div></div>",
