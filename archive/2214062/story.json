I will delete additions that do this.<br>\r\n-The OC must be named and keep his name in any follow up chapters, no first person story telling with words like \"you\".<br>\r\n-No Average Joe's off the street, they have to have a reason for being shrunk near the female characters of the MCU. Example: A Hydra/Shield agent, Stark employee, or so on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual there are previously existing expectations on any submission placed in the story.<br>\r\n-They must be well written and thought out, use on proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling is a must. I recommend \"Grammarly\" as a writing tool.<br>\r\n-Every addition outside of choice chapters must be over 3,000-3,500 characters long, you'll notice most chapters I've written are twice if not three times that long, I'm not trying to be unreasonable here.<br>\r\n-Most of the time I realize when someone is interested in writing a specific chapter, please notify of your interest to write an addition so I can stop anyone from wasting their time on something someone else is working on. It's happened several times and I've felt bad for both parties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now that we've covered that, welcome to the story.<br>\r\nListed below are the 3 Phases the Marvel Cinematic Universe has gone through so far and spots for Phase 4 and Phase 5.</span></div></div>",
