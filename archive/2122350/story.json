            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Some time in the past, slavery made a comeback. However, the laws concerning slavery differ from state to state. The United States has grown to sixty one states with the additions of the states of Bahamas, Puerto Rico, North California, Baja, Sonora, Chihuahua, Panama, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Pacifica but the United States has become less united returning to more of a confederacy and less of a republic. It is now called the Confederate States of America and each state has its own president, congress, supreme court, and military. There have even been a few border wars among the states but the original fifty survive. Rhode Island and Delaware, being the smallest, are the most vulnerable to being wiped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slavery laws common throughout the confederacy are that no one under 18 can be enslaved. Along with that, descendants of slaves are not enslaved. There is no slave breeding program. The most common sources of slaves are debt slavery, criminal penalties, prisoners of war and voluntary enslavement but there are other less common sources. Some states practice racial slavery and other states require all young men to spend a year or more as slaves. Although no state allows slaves under eighteen, some states allow parents to sell their eighteen year old children. Other laws also vary from state to state such as what punishments are allowed, what rights slaves have, what slaves are allowed to do or own, and how slaves can be used sexually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost states return runaway slaves but not all states. Still, the easiest way for slaves to escape to freedom is to either go to communist Canada, the United States of Russia or one of the Latin American oligarchies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe year is sometime in the future. The reason slavery came back is because technological advances made it economic to enslave people. (You the writer have some freedom to determine what the technology is as long as you don't get ridiculous). However, in rebellion against the technological advances, wealthy people have chosen to lead more natural lifestyles, preferring to have slaves instead of machines like cars and preferring to live on large plantations or ranches instead of living in the cities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what kind of slavery does the main character become?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was spring break. I planned to go to Florida. We couldn\u2019t travel last year because of the border wars but this year, there was peace. My parents recommended I go by plane or not at all but airplane tickets were expensive. I was still in High School and didn\u2019t have that kind of money. My pride wouldn\u2019t let me ask my parents to pay for the ticket. I was going to get there on my own. Road Trip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a few friends that were planning on going with me but one by one, each of them got talked into letting their parents buy them a ticket. Whatever. I didn't need them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dad warned me about slavers but I planned to stay on the main roads. There weren't many slavers anyway. A big reason why there was peace between the states is because the states were too focused on catching slavers and other criminals to do any land grabbing. Slavers didn't dare show their face except in backwater places that I had no interest in visiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took off from Rhode Island. After entering Maryland, I stopped for the night at a motel. I sat in the hot tub and got into a conversation with an older man with salt and pepper hair. We just talked about our travel plans. Then I went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I woke up, I was handcuffed in a cage and naked. I was in a barn and the cage was so small I couldn't stretch out. It was very quiet. There were a couple of horses in the barn but there was no activity. I lay there trying to figure out how to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo big farmers walked into the barn. One said, \"You're awake. Your worst fear has come true. We are slavers. We have a nice operation going here. The ones who captured you sold you to us so that there is nothing linking them to us. We run the second phase. We transform you into a proper slave with all the false documentation. Then we sell you to the final phase, an auction house that will sell you to your new master. All this selling you makes you untraceable. Your free life is gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dragged me out of the cage and tied me in a spread eagle. They threw me in a scalding shower and removed all my hair from my nose down. I tried to keep quiet and not give them the satisfaction but I couldn't help but grunt as they poked me and yanked me around. They also cut my hair really short and bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey put a collar around my neck and cuffs on my wrists and ankles. These cuffs were not chained together but had the connections to chain them together. Slaves aren't allowed to wear shoes but they superglued soles on my feet. The only clothes they gave me was a simple shirt. It didn't have sleeves. The neckline revealed my chest and the shirt had slits half way up the sides so that even though it was long enough to cover me, any sudden movement I made caused it to practically reveal everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tattooed my slave ID on the top of my left butt cheek. They read it to me, \"Glans #803-169-972 According to the laws of Maryland captured in the war with Pennsylvania in the year 2046 and recognized as a slave by the Oxford Peace Accord of 2047.\" My slave name was Glans which means cockhead. My real name of Jason Copperton would have to wait until I could escape. They also tattooed my right shoulder and my forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the men said, \"Now don't get any bright ideas about telling people you were illegally enslaved and what your real name is. Your slave ID is in the database that the entire confederacy uses. Everyone will assume you are lying. They will punish you for telling them your real name. And even in the unlikely event that you do get free, you won't be able to find us. The only ones who would lose would be you and your owner but your owner doesn't want to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dragged me to a mirror to see myself. I was appalled. I looked like a slave, collared, exposed, and hairless. I did not look like Jason Copperton. No one would recognize me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen they gagged me and to make sure no one could recognize me, they put a bag over my head which meant I couldn't see either. They left the bag on my head for three days. I could hear and I could feel them push me around. I heard other voices too but never got any names. Then I was put in a van and rode for over an hour. Someone thoroughly examined me feeling every part of me. Then the farmers left. My bag was removed and I saw that I was at a slave auction.</span></div></div>",

That made me feel at least a little good about myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only removed my gag to feed me and then they forced me to eat so they could get the gag on me again as soon as possible. They did bathe me often and shave me and wash my shirt. Keeping me clean and good looking was a high priority even if I had to wait naked while they washed my one shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one day, someone bid $4,500.00 and I was bought.

You're a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, what door do I use?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went around to the slave entrance and was only allowed in a small portion of the store. The only clothes there were about as revealing as the shirt I wore. I was told, \"Slaves aren't allowed in the main store. Slaves aren't allowed to wear free people clothes. Slaves aren't allowed to buy their own clothes. You have to have a signed note from your owner telling what clothes he wants you to buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave up and went back to the police station.

He has twenty four hours and then if he's caught wearing free clothes, he will be punished. There are also other behaviors that will be expected of him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This branch is inspired by Human Collateral, a story by Richard Davies and one of my favorite slave stories. This is inspired by but it is not a cut and paste job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a wake up call. I had gotten into partying in college, free from my father\u2019s authority. I thought nothing could happen to me. Then I heard that my brother was going to become a slave and I realized I wasn\u2019t as invincible as I thought I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was partly my fault. Money had gotten tight for my dad and my partying and wasting the money he sent me didn\u2019t help. My brother who was almost eighteen was going to become collateral for a loan from the bank. I began to realize that I could be enslaved too if I didn\u2019t grow up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo complicate matters, Doyle Preston would be involved. I knew Doyle to be a very sleazy con man who cheated to get what he wanted. I knew eventually his cheating would catch up with him but so far, he\u2019d gotten away with everything. He\u2019d gotten his enemies enslaved. Doyle was appointed to supervise my brother to make sure we didn\u2019t cheat the bank. If Doyle was involved, we had to be extra careful to make sure he didn\u2019t enslave us through one of his schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t know anything more until the court date. I\u2019d never been inside a courtroom and didn\u2019t know what to expect. It wasn\u2019t anything like what they show on television. It had all the features, the judges desk, the lawyers tables, the witness stand, but it was much more laid back, less intimidating than anything I\u2019d seen on television. The lawyers had nice, padded, office chairs, the kind that executives sit in. The lawyers, judge and other staff casually talked between cases about everything from football to food. Most of the courtroom was comfortable and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was an area off to the side that was more spartan. It didn\u2019t even have chairs or carpet. It was concrete and there was a hose and a drain in the corner. I began to learn how to be a dominant. The more powerful someone was, the more comfortable and relaxed they were but the less powerful were expected to be more rigid and spartan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy brother was led in wearing his best clothes. I admit, I felt a little resentment toward my brother. He was my daddy\u2019s favorite so it surprised me that he was being enslaved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judged looked over the paperwork and said, \u201cEverything is in order. I understand the defendant is complying with this order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lawyer said, \u201cYes, your honor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge said, \u201cI\u2019d like the defendant, Evan Andrews to tell me in his own words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said, \u201cI\u2019m nervous but my father explained that he won\u2019t sell me. He\u2019s going to do everything in his power to let me live a normal life and he\u2019s going to make the necessary payments to keep the bank from foreclosing on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge said, \u201cWithin restrictions. You do realize that the bank requires you to maintain your value as a slave and has appointed Doyle Preston to make sure you maintain or increase your value. If your slave value drops below $40,000, the bank will demand that your father provide someone else as collateral, himself or his other son, to make up the difference.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat scared me. I had to make sure Evan\u2019s slave value stayed above $40,000 to keep myself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge continued, \u201cI understand the bank has already inspected you and assessed your current value at only $29,000. This is expected since you have not had any training and you are not fit enough yet. The bank has assessed your potential value at $45,000 and therefore has granted you six months to get into shape and/or enroll in a training program to achieve a value of $40,000. So Evan Andrews, you do realize that your life will not be easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said, \u201cYes, your honor. That is why I am nervous but I think I\u2019m up to the challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge said, \u201cThen you may strip off your free clothes and step over to the slave area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan slowly removed his shirt. The judge said, \u201cIf you are complying you better hurry up or the bailiff will rip your clothes off of you.\u201d Evan stripped faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my dad and he was crying. I realized that I needed to take over. My dad would go too easy on Evan letting his slave value stay low. Doyle would seize upon the opportunity to con my dad. The bank would demand someone else as collateral and Doyle would offer a way for my dad to force me to be that collateral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan stood naked on the concrete. They placed a collar on his neck and hosed him down. They made sure to wash his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the judge asked my dad about some arrangements like whether Evan was to be castrated or whether Evan was to have any piercings. Such things improved a slave\u2019s value. I jumped in and pleaded with dad to go all the way but the judge reminded me that it was my dad\u2019s decision. My dad said that he needed time to think before he made such decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we left the courtroom, I convinced my dad to go out to eat to talk about what our plan would be. I told him, \u201cEvan can wait. I know you want to go easy on him but you can\u2019t be too easy on him. He needs to increase his slave value.\u201d<br>\r\nMy dad said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Ethan but I only want to raise  Evan\u2019s value to the minimum necessary. So absolutely no castration or any thing else that is extreme.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I convinced my dad to let me take Evan to my dorm as my slave. I would be in charge of training and improving his slave value so dad wouldn\u2019t have to be hard on Evan. Dad agreed as long as I respected some limits such as not making any permanent changes to Evan and Evan could still continue his education since he only had a month until graduation. Evan would have to ride the city bus between his school and my college but it would work out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I went to pick up Evan. I gathered his clothes first. Other than the collar, naked Evan looked fine. It didn\u2019t look like they had done anything with him so I asked a guard about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard explained, \u201cThe minimum we are required to do is implant some devices inside his body so that we can always track him, we can deliver punishment if necessary, and we can make sure he\u2019s obedient. He also has a tattoo on the top of his left butt cheek describing his slave status. The only reason for the collar is so he can\u2019t pretend to be free. He is also not allowed to wear free clothes but he is allowed to wear various slave uniforms that you may choose for him. Everything else is up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued talking to the guard about my options. Then I went to talk to Evan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said, \u201cFinally, you brought me my clothes so I can get out of here and get back to my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \u201cNot yet. Listen brother, you have to get your slave value up. If dad has to be put on collateral, no one will be paying the bank and you\u2019ll both be sold. So it is in your own best interest that you not be allowed to get back to your life. Dad has put me in charge of increasing your slave value. It\u2019s a good thing. You\u2019ve gotten a little paunch. It\u2019s not bad for a free person but for a slave, it\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said, \u201cI\u2019ll diet and exercise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \u201cYou\u2019ll do more than that. You need to increase your value by at least $11,000. Simply getting in shape won\u2019t be enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan yelled, \u201cI get it but I can do this on my own. I don\u2019t need you to boss me around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA guard came up and asked, \u201cDo you need help with your slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \u201cMaybe a little. This is the first day for both of us. What do you have that inflicts the most pain but doesn\u2019t leave any marks on his body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard said, \u201cThe paddle is best. Since you are new, do you have someone to teach you how to manage a slave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \u201cSomeone was assigned to supervise but I don\u2019t trust him. I\u2019d appreciate having someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard recommended Tom Phillips and I took down his number. \u201cDon\u2019t try administering punishments yourself until he has taught you how. Meantime, I will make sure Evan gets a good enough lesson that you won\u2019t have any trouble with him for a long time. I assume that the reason you don\u2019t want marks is because you don\u2019t want to decrease his slave value, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard said, \u201cThat\u2019s typical of the collateral cases we get. I will redden his ass severely but it will heal completely. I would also recommend some bondage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI explained the limits set by my dad and we also discussed prices. Then the guard grabbed Evan. Evan had been protesting the whole time but we ignored him. Then the paddling began and Evan screamed. As the paddling continued, his screaming turned into sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collar Evan wore was already designed to be worn for months without causing injury. The guard added matching cuffs and anklets with rings so that chains or cables could be easily attached. The guard put an anal hook in Evan\u2019s ass and cabled it to his collar so Evan could not lower his head without choking. The guard put a ball stretcher on Evan and pulled that down with a cable attached to Evan\u2019s right ankle. Evan could walk and his hands were free but he couldn\u2019t remove the bondage and the bondage slowed his walking speed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard encouraged Evan to stop crying. \u201cBehave yourself and there won\u2019t be any more punishment. Now smile and make your brother happy you\u2019ll be paddled again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan pulled himself together and stopped crying. He managed to smile though it was obvious he was in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told Evan, \u201cYou may speak but remember you are my slave. Don\u2019t challenge me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said, \u201cMay I have my clothes, sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \u201cNo, you aren\u2019t allowed to wear free clothes and I don\u2019t have any slave clothes. You\u2019ll just have to come with me as you are until I get some slave clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan covered himself and said, \u201cYes sir.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The shirts were half shirts that exposed the belly button or long shirts with slits up the sides. The pants had button flaps to expose the genitals. The swimsuits were rubber.

I had to remove his anal hook, anklets and ball stretcher temporarily but there was two holes in the tights. One hole was in between his legs so that when Evan stood up straight, the hole was hidden but it opened directly to his anus. I put his anal hook back in and connected it to his collar. As I tightened it, I told Evan, \"This will teach you not to slouch. No one likes a slouching slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other hole was at the end of a blue pouch which held Evan's genitals. I asked what it was for and the sales person said, \"If you want to give your slave a Prince Albert, it will give you one more attachment point for controlling him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"That sounds good. Can you give him a Prince Albert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sales clerk said, \"Yes we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan asked, \"Are you going to spend all the loan money making me look silly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"I'm not spending that much but I'm improving your value.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reattached his ball stretcher on the outside of his tights and connected to his anklet on the outside as well. Then I helped him put his top on. He still covered himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hand on his sensitive red ass. He said, \"Please don't. Still too tender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"Stop covering yourself. You are dressed well enough to go in places that don't allow nudity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan said, \"But people can see the shape of my genitals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed his cock and stroked it until it stood up. \"Yes, people can see. They can see that you're a healthy young slave. They can see how valuable you are. Now go get your dick pierced and break that habit of covering yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swatted him hard on his tender ass. He said, \"When I agreed to this, I thought Dad wouldn't allow anyone to use me for sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"That was stupid of you. You'll have to be trained to take cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sales clerk said, \"We offer a set of dildos to help with that training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said, \"I'll take them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvan had tears on his face as the sales clerk led him to get his dick pierced.</span></div></div>",
