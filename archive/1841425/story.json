Propping yourself up on your elbows you see that you appear to be on a lounge chair by a pool. Looking around you realize that this must be the pool for the hotel you were staying at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck!?\" you hear someone say beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over you see a 20 something asian woman sitting up in a lounge chair staring down at their body in confusion. Then, rather shockingly they proceed to grope their breasts, their eyes going wide. Next they snap a hand down to their groin and let out a whining moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that that was pretty weird you sit up the rest of the way. Looking around you decide to get up and try to find Jim and Ken. Looking down, you put your hands on the chair and are about to stand up when you notice that your body doesn't look quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God!\" the asian women groans beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking right down at your body you realize that it is in fact not your body. From what you can tell it looks like the body of a woman, complete with breasts held within a bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell?\" you murmur in a strange female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then grab at the breasts and are shocked by the fact that you can feel them. Whether or not it made sense you did seem to now have breasts. Then it dawns on you that something else might have changed. You drop a hand and confirm, you no longer have a dick between your legs. Suddenly realizing what you just did (and how it was almost exactly what you had witnessed seconds ago) you snap your neck around and look at the Asian woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken? Jim?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill?\" she asks you pleadingly, \"What the fuck happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the woman the next chair down snaps upright and says, \"Who said my name? And why does my voice sound weird?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jim. Look at your body,\" says the asian woman you are now coming to realize is Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second woman who you guess is Jim looks down at their body before exclaiming, \"Holy shit I'm a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup,\" you say.</span></div></div>",

Bill chipped in only once, to say, \"Dude, I think those are high school girls,\" when Jim started waxing erotic about a group of chipper, giggly girls standing by the lounge area, most of them in swimsuits, others dressed in more layers but still light enough to tan. Not that he said this with conviction. They might be jailbait, Bill knew, but he had to admit, even with a girlfriend and sense of chivalry, some of them carried nice bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If I was still in high school,</i> Bill thought absentmindedly, <i>I might date one of those girls.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an uncontroversial thought, unloaded and not begging any severe consequences, yet at that moment Bill got a head rush and felt sick. He opened his mouth to tell Jim and Ken he would sit down for a minute, but then there were no Jim and Ken to talk to and he <i>was</i> sitting down though. Suddenly the check-in line was thirty feet away, the ceiling seemed a whole lot taller, and female laughter rang in his ears from all around. A hand patted his shoulder and he whirled in time to see a redhead, pixie-haired girl with a tiny, red face grinning, before tufts of brown hair - Bill's hair - fell across his face and blocked his vision of her. \"Jeez, Naomi,\" the girl was saying, \"You're John's sister but you act like his mother! What do you think he and Victoria will do? Coach Thompson's always around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Bill brushed the hair away and became aware of all the new things attached to his body, such as the large, tightly-held breasts underneath the red blouse he wore, which also covered a cheetah-patterned bikini top peeking out over the collar. This did not appear abnormal, although the first-person perspective made everything more surreal than it really was, since Bill's body was soft, more curvy, and otherwise reformatted to accomodate the feminine clothing and appendages. Even without a mirror, the mix of emptiness and sudden weights, of poise and sudden grace, told Bill quite readily that he was one of the high school cheerleaders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://babescene.com/babe/oaw5uk/\" target=\"_blank\">http://babescene.com/babe/oaw5uk/</a></span></div></div>",

It wasn't very easy to keep his eyes on her, when down below he had some excess baggage to contend with, but something in her concerned glance made Bill feel more comforted. She appeared to be a very good friend of the girl he now was. She looked closer at him, touched his shoulder, and Bill sensed how close their breasts were touching. This aroused him as much as it would have in his old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naomi, are you okay?\" she asked again. \"If I offended you, I'm sorry. I don't want you to think I'm taking advantage...\" The girl was both buxom and sweet-looking. Her tiny face with high cheekbones and Egyptian blue eyes served to accentuate the much more mature torso and legs she had beneath it. The head looked like a high schooler's, but her body could have belonged to a shorter girl around Bill's age. Her firm thighs indicated she clearly worked out, and the bikini she wore with nothing else indicated, well - it wasn't hard to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine,\" Bill said, mustering the courage to talk. \"I'm not offended. You can do whatever you want and it's fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have startled the girl with her response, because after a second of surprised silence, she exploded into a smile too big for her face and pulled Bill in for a tight, warm hug. Bill trembled, trying his best not to fall. His body was tingling from the touch, more and more as the redhead squeezed. \"Why am I getting so aroused?\" Bill thought. \"Why is this even hotter to me than if I was a guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he appreciated the gesture, and returned it just as strongly. When she pulled away, he expected to see that warm smile plastered on her features, to hear a \"Thank you\" or something just as effusive...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly her countenance had changed. The lovely surprise had turned into something more manic and scared. The girl's eyes darted back and forth, settled on you, settled on herself, took in the half-dressed spectacle of it all, and screamed, \"What the hell?\" Everybody turned. \"Oh no,\" you thought, knowing you weren't alone now in your change. Who was it?</span></div></div>",

She can easily do his job, collect his paycheck, and live a happy life. Of course, she'll have much more of it to live now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAda is downright scared to be in your body.

The sun\u2019s rays rolled over, immersing your skin in warmth. The calm ocean breeze lapped against and around your body, sending shivers down your spine. Perhaps Jackie\u2019s body was more in tune with the senses constantly enveloping it, you thought. Or maybe you were just paying special attention to them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you had to drive around the parking lots and beachside streets for the better part of an hour. It being mid-afternoon and most of the tourists and locals enjoying a summer\u2019s day at the public beach, all of the spots had been taken hours beforehand. Ken finally stopped at a parking meter next to a house with a yard overgrown in weeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK ladies, everyone out! Let\u2019s see if Phillippa has any coins lying around here.\u201d He said, reaching and fumbling in the compartments and pockets of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think it was a good idea to leave Phillippa\u2019s Bentley parked out on the street like that?\u201d You asked, as the three of you set out the towels and umbrellas you had purchased in the mall earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax, Bill.

Jim nodded, whistling to himself at some of the girls who walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around the beach and at all the people who went about their day. A couple of guys your old body\u2019s age were tossing a Frisbee. A young mother and father watched their toddler children dig sandcastles against the tide. Another group of people looked to be having fun bodysurfing and riding the small waves that curled at the top right before crushing to the shoreline. Someone else was flying a kite. But mostly, the beachgoers lied about lazily on towels and under umbrellas, napping or sipping on a drink. The lifeguard patrolled the beach slowly, being relieved by a new person every so often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you observed the surrounding life, someone tapped you on the shoulder.

Laying down the one-piece suit you bought with Phillippa\u2019s money at the mall, you changed out of your current ensemble of pantyhose, pencil skirt cut at the knees, hotel blazer, and white blouse. You quickly removed the undergarments without looking and then donned the bikini, incredulous and somewhat disgusted at the same time. The synthetic fibers seemed to hug every inch of your torso, fitting almost too well proportioned to your body. You had switched out Jackie\u2019s ballet flats for a more sensible pair of flip flops back in the car. Looking in the smudged mirror at the entrance to the changing room, you saw a nervous Asian girl with long hair and a trace of makeup on her face. That was Jackie Wu up until a short time ago. Now, that\u2019s you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Jim and Ken tried out their new bodies by going out into the ocean. You decided to fly under the radar and stay at camp, shading yourself underneath an umbrella. From a distance, you could see your best friends splashing each other and trying to dunk each other in the water. You felt surprised how cavalier they acted with what were ostensibly other peoples\u2019 bodies and lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of your mind, you wondered what the women were doing right now. Getting Jackie\u2019s cell phone out of her purse, you scanned through her contacts. When the two groups exchanged information, cell phone numbers were entered from the perspective of the person whose body owned the phone. In other words, your contact list had the numbers of \u201cBill\u201d, \u201cKen\u201d, and \u201cJim\u201d. You sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moment you placed the phone back in the purse, the ringtone went off. Someone was trying to call Jackie! You would have panicked had the number not shown \u201cBill\u201d in the caller ID! You don\u2019t think you could do a good job impersonating Jackie, and frankly you hope you won\u2019t have to either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d You answered the phone. The high-pitched voice coming out of your mouth made you feel strange, as did hearing your old voice coming out of the sender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, this is Bill right?\u201d Ada\u2019s words came out of your body over the line in partially broken English. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, hello Ada.\u201d You said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I want to ask you. Is Jim taking care of my body?\u201d She asked gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked for Ken and Jim before replying in the affirmative. The conversation felt stultified to say the least. While you felt calm talking to Ada, she was the opposite. Perhaps this was too much for a twenty-six year old mother to go through at one time. You tried to reassure her that things would turn out okay, even though you had trouble believing it yourself. You didn\u2019t even know Ada and she doesn\u2019t know you; somehow you both had been cast together in some hiccup of the universe beyond comprehension. It\u2019s probably not that dramatic, but damned if you know why this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation started and stopped with dead air in between. You found out that the women checked themselves in to the hotel in the room facing the parking lot. Phillippa (as Jim) and Jackie (as Ken) went out for some groceries to stock up. Ada was researching possible solutions on how to get everyone back to normal. But the Internet was like a foreign land to her. It was then that she called you. You filled her in on your half of the details and suggested that you meet up again to make a plan. It was only a suggestion, of course, but Ada sounded much more relieved afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you put the phone away for the second time, you saw Ken and Jim get out of the water. It was later in the afternoon now, and some of the beachgoers had begun to leave. A part of you felt surprised that nobody approached you \u2013 not even any of the boys, the thought blinked into your head. Where did that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Jim and Ken padded up to the camp, they had mostly dried off. You could see goosebumps rippling across Ken\u2019s arms and back. Jim\u2019s hair had been soaked, so it dried into that windblown, stringy look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy god that was an experience.\u201d Jim said, adjusting his bikini before grabbing a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but enough of that for today.\u201d Ken cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, did you enjoy sitting around this afternoon Bill?\u201d asked Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, it was interesting to say the least.\u201d You shrugged in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know where the restrooms are, Bill? This body really has to pee.\u201d Ken stated, visibly trying to hold it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just go in the ocean?\u201d Jim laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s what I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDude, that\u2019s so gross! You told me that warm spot was from the kids next to us!\u201d Ken fumed, his Russian outburst an oddity coming from the body of the black woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you gotta go\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Do that when you\u2019re five years old, not twenty-two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, this body is twenty-six years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. Where is the bathroom Bill?\u201d You pointed Ken to the restrooms, and he hurried off in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned on Jim. \u201cYou asshole, Ada called me while you were out pissing yourself. She asked me if you were taking good care of her body. She\u2019s terrified of this whole ordeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim paused for a moment, his manner becoming more sobered. \u201cYeah. I guess I uh, just let myself get out of control.\u201d He added, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have felt her body up while she was there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal. When we get swapped back we\u2019ll all have a nice laugh afterwards.\u201d You concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen returned to your group, and you changed back out of your swimsuit and into Jackie's original clothes minus the blazer and hose. You all packed the things back into bags and put them back into the Bentley. The sun was beginning its descent now, the sky turning a picturesque orange-blue. This was the stuff of vacations, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tells you that she and Jackie put together some clothes for you and Jim, each sneaking into their houses while no one was around. You thank her politely and go with her to drop the suitcase off in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asks if you might want to change into something from the suitcase, since she notices you've been wearing the blouse and pencil skirt all day.

You haven\u2019t eaten anything in Jackie\u2019s body in the several hours since switching with her. No doubt Ken and Jim were hungry as well; they probably burned more energy at the beach today than you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was the one who broke the silence, however. \u201cHey guys, I\u2019m feeling pretty hungry. You want to stop somewhere to eat?\u201d He turned the car toward what appeared to be the business district of this resort town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to a bar. After a day like this, I could really have a drink.\u201d Jim suggested, scanning the available stores and restaurants packed alongside the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackie can\u2019t go to a bar, dude.\u201d Ken said. \u201cShe\u2019s eighteen and the legal drinking age is older than that. Bill wouldn\u2019t make it past the entrance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably a non-drinking section or something. It\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d Jim persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s really not.\u201d Ken said, his eyes remaining focused on the road. \u201cEven so, your body should go without alcohol if you\u2019re planning to breastfeed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go to a restaurant?\u201d You interjected, perceiving that another retort by Jim was going to send Ken over the edge again. The three of you agreed upon a seafood restaurant; the parking lot was full which was a good sign. It also had a deck overlooking the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen pulled up to the main curb, giving the keys to the valet parking staff. The three of you placed your names on the wait list and sat down on a bench outside, having to cross your legs because of the skirt. Thankfully, this restaurant accepted all kinds of customers, from the elegantly dressed honeymooners to the surfing bums. You three fit right in. It only took a few minutes for an attendant to guide your group to a table out on the deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining sunlight danced off the water and flirted with the horizon. The lit candles at the table flickered at the breeze, and you observed some of the other restaurant patrons as well. Observation had always been something of a corollary to your naturally inquisitive demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in the corner was a man with a white beard and a fishing hat who read the newspaper. At another table were an older-looking mother and father with their rambunctious kids. Some other girls sat at a table near you, but they looked too old to be in high school. If you were still in your old body, you might have stopped to try a pickup line or two. You thought about these things silently to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waiter appeared and took your orders. For drinks, Ken decided to go big and have a shot of hard liqueur. Jim conscientiously chose a non-alcoholic beverage, and you did the same but for a different reason of course. As entrees, you three ordered those buckets of seafood which are steamed and cooked in the pot. It was most definitely more than your body could hope to eat, but as long as Ken was charging it to Phillippa\u2019s credit card you couldn\u2019t complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner progressed without much conversation, only the clattering and chiming of silverware was heard. Jim retold some of his bawdier jokes which helped to lighten the mood. The food tasted satisfactory and the music had a sticky Reggae feel to it. Before long, the waiter returned again to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting the check, Ken started fishing for Phillippa\u2019s card within her purse. However, the waiter informed you that the check had already been paid for \u2013 complements of the gentleman over there, the waiter gestured toward a corner of the deck. It was the bearded fisherman, who now was smoking a cigar and leaning against the railing of the deck, looking out to sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that was nice of him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 do you think we should go thank him?\u201d You asked, seeing your friends start to get up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, he looks preoccupied with something at the moment. Don\u2019t want to bother him.\u201d Ken answered, brushing some crumbs off Phillippa\u2019s dress. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are torn between what to do. Gratitude would dictate that you approach the man and acknowledge his generosity for paying for your moderately expensive dinner. But being a young woman fitting the gender role and trying to blend in as well as possible, you thought such an action might appear too forward. Plus, you have no idea who the guy is and what his intentions might be. What do you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You felt bad about not approaching the man. Such acts of generosity rarely occur anymore, and they should be recognized and appreciated for what they are. In an ordinary circumstance you would have done it, but you and your friends had more pressing concerns. As you catch up to your friends, you look out to the deck again. You couldn\u2019t see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you leave, you have to use the bathroom. Ken and Jim agree to wait outside with the valet staff as you walk down the hallway leading to the bathrooms. Of course, it would be inappropriate to do anything but enter the door with the Ladies insignia posted on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart beat in your chest in a Jackie-like fluttery rhythm. Fortunately, there were no other women to be seen, so you chose a stall and locked the door. Not surprisingly, the toilets appeared in better condition than the ones you remember in the Men\u2019s rooms. Nevertheless, to avoid catching any diseases you spread some toilet paper over the seat. Letting Jackie\u2019s skirt and panties fall down to her ankles, you sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like an eternity; in Jackie\u2019s body you found it harder to go when you focused on what you were doing. The bathrooms were quiet. You cleared your mind, allowing it to take you away from this situation to some other comfortable place\u2026 an emotional numbing of sorts. Before you knew it, you heard the sound of urine splashing against the inside of the toilet. Identifying the muscles involved, you learned to control them better. Thinking about this no more, you made sure to wipe and flush before redressing, washing your hands, and exiting the bathroom and restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe valet service pulled Phillipa\u2019s Bentley up to the curb. Ken left a handsome tip and climbed into the car. Then you were off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 where do we go from here?\u201d You asked, taking in the scenery of nightfall in this exotic landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAda told me that she normally gets off of work about this time.\u201d Jim replied. \u201cIf I have to fill her life role for the night, that means I have to go to her house.\u201d He bit his lip before adding, \u201cTo her husband and children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you thought about skipping?\u201d asked Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSkipping as in: Not going to her house and instead crashing with me in my hotel suite tonight?\u201d Ken suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thanks for the offer though.\u201d Jim shook his head, Ada\u2019s hair trembling slightly back and forth. An odd smile formed on his face. \u201cI need to spend some quality time with Jorge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant me to drop you off at the hotel?\u201d Ken asked, finding a great pleasure in being able to drive a nice car wherever he wanted. \u201cHow does Ada commute?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBus.\u201d Jim muttered. \u201cSwing by this neighborhood over here and drop me off. This is where Ada lives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked out the window at a modest-looking series of houses. They all looked built by hand but not in any way to indicate shabby construction. The houses were small; one-story, external garage, short brick and adobe walls separating neighbors. The front yard was also small but you could tell it was well loved. A red tricycle lied on its side next to a metal swing set. The grasses were tall and green and sparkled with dew in the moonlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim said good night, and you took his place sitting in the front passenger seat. You were again reminded of Jackie\u2019s short stature, as the dashboard and seat felt much bigger now. On the positive side, you now had more leg room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to Jackie\u2019s home too, or are you staying with me tonight?\u201d Ken asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered this for a moment, and something about this confused you. Why have Jackie\u2019s parents not called her, asking where she is? Granted, this is about the time when her shift ends (or so she told you). If Jackie doesn\u2019t own her own car \u2013 which you believe is rather unlikely \u2013 then she has to get home from work somehow. Could she take the bus like Ada does? You have her address scrawled on a piece of paper in her purse. It might take a while to pinpoint exactly where she lives, but unless you\u2019ve got a better idea you will have to face her family at some point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you weigh your options, a slow, creeping sense of dread washes over you. You ignore it as best you can; it\u2019s the elephant in the room, the question everyone was thinking. \u201cWhat if I never switch back?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing to do is process the onslaught of new and unfamiliar perceptions and insights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore doing anything, it is best to think of a goal for the night. You wonder just how you can escape interacting with Jackie\u2019s parents, and hopefully her sister as well, before morning. From what her sister told you, you inferred that Jackie\u2019s parents had strict expectations of when their daughters should arrive home each day. They didn\u2019t seem to berate you upon entering the house, allowing you to flee upstairs into Jackie\u2019s bedroom unbothered. Will there be a parental lecture later tonight? Or is there a sufficient level of guilt that the Wu\u2019s expect Jackie to realize her wrongdoing and apologize to them first? Either scenario will involve facing her parents, a task that you aren\u2019t sure you can handle yet. <i>Is cutting work and being late home even a big deal?</i> Your blood stirred with a strange vibe of rebelliousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there is the wild card, Jackie\u2019s sister. It was difficult to decipher exactly how the two girls got along together. Having grown up with both a brother and a sister, you knew your siblings like the back of your hand. But that was when you were Bill, of course, and interactions from brother to brother, or even brother to sister, may have entirely different contexts than interactions between two sisters. Jackie\u2019s sister also mentioned that her friends noticed you at the beach today. Since the two girls differed a few years in age, it was unlikely that they might hang out at school together. This means that Jackie\u2019s sister must bring her friends home occasionally; it would allow them enough time to be able to recognize Jackie on a crowded beach during the summer. This might compound your problems a bit, but if you can somehow win over Jackie\u2019s sister \u2013 maybe even tell her everything about who you really are and what is happening \u2013 your situation might improve. She might be able to help you. You make sure to store this away for future consideration. It all depends on how well they get along together and how good and trustworthy Jackie\u2019s sister is at keeping secrets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you decide to familiarize yourself with your surroundings. Jackie\u2019s room is small but compact; whatever nook or cranny seemed to have extra space she found something to place there. Jackie\u2019s bed was just the right size for her, although it would have been way too short for your old body. The comforters, bed sheet, and pillowcase all had a flowery, spring motif to them. Articles of Jackie\u2019s clothing hung carelessly from the wooden bedposts, as if she intended to wear them around the house later. On her carpet lay her backpack, a lavender colored towel, some glamour magazines, and a string of beads. Posters had been tacked onto her walls... mostly Asian boy bands with foreign lettering on them, but there was one WWF poster that you recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flip through the notebooks in her backpack. Apparently, despite being in a position to earn that scholarship, Jackie was struggling in a few of her classes. No doubt that her coursework and job schedule (as well as any other extracurricular activities she was doing right now) left her with little free time. Examining further the cause of her academic troubles, you were delighted to find that she was studying basic Physics and Calculus! Easy courses for an Engineering major, you thought to yourself, but not so easy for a high school student. The other classes interested you less, as they rounded out the schedule for a typical high school student and were subjects you had slept through once already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around the room, you notice a small bookcase that also acted as Jackie\u2019s nightstand. The furniture in her room was mahogany brown in color and looked old. The nightstand had a lamp on top of it in addition to a laptop computer, books and papers, and some other junk. The bookcase was lined with all kinds of hard covers and paperbacks, and you could identify romance genres, drama, even the occasional science fiction. While most of the titles disinterested you, you recognized a few popular series like the one with that wizard boy, the girl with the vampire, and another series whose author had died before its ending. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you turn to the clothes dresser, upon which lay a vanity mirror and an array of cosmetics and tubes of makeup. Deciding not to invade Jackie\u2019s personal life any more than absolutely necessary, you skimmed over most of these things, only desiring to know where you needed to find each type of clothing. Staring into her mirror, you got another glimpse of her face staring back at you, mimicking your every move. Her closet was stuffed with more clothing, ranging from jeans to dresses to large hats to suits and a few pairs of shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsorbed in trying to learn more about Jackie\u2019s life, you nearly jumped out of your skin when you heard a sound coming from the door! What is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The cat had streaked patterns that reminded you of something like a grey zebra with large whiskers. You had never owned a cat before because you were severely allergic to them. Now, you realized, it wasn\u2019t such a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat leaped onto Jackie\u2019s bed, circling it a couple of times before resting on its haunches. You weren\u2019t sure whether to approach the creature or give it space. Cats are just like humans, you remember your girlfriend from high school saying. They each have their own peculiar personality, and they don\u2019t live by any rules except their own. Needless to say, you had been a dog person for most of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could do anything, however, the cat shot straight upward, frozen in its place. It was staring at you. No, that\u2019s not quite right. It was staring <i>through</i> you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn invisible wave of some sort washed over the cat. It hissed, arching its feline incisors in what you assumed was its \u2018angry face\u2019. The cat bolted down from the bed, galloping out of the room and down the stairs. Moments later, Jackie\u2019s sister returned up the stairs, cradling the cat in her arms like a baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJackie? What happened to Tama? He looks downright scared!\u201d She exclaimed, petting the cat on its head and behind the ears. The damned thing was purring again, but you could tell its yellow-marble eyes glinted with something unsettling whenever it looked your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, I don\u2019t know. He must have seen a ghost or something.\u201d You muttered lamely, standing awkwardly in the doorway in front of Jackie\u2019s sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard Tama poking at your door a few minutes ago. Are you sure you didn\u2019t do something to scare him?\u201d Jackie\u2019s sister persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at all, sis. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTama rarely gets spooked at home\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did this time, I have no idea why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie\u2019s sister slowly let Tama, the grey tabby cat, down. He scampered down the hallway and out of sight. She appeared to be deep in thought.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She started to go back downstairs and then stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you be joining us tonight?\u201d She asked sharply. You found yourself making some excuse about schoolwork, and surprisingly the teenage girl bought it. She left, but not before giving you a peculiar look. You closed the door once again, breathing a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat could have gotten out of hand.\u201d You think aloud. \u201cI should play things close to the vest until I can get out of here. I cannot rouse any more suspicion or act out of character. If only I knew how Jackie regularly acts around her friends and family!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the night turned out to be less stressful than you anticipated. Jackie had been procrastinating much of her schoolwork, evidently the result of burning out at the end of the school year. You checked her planner; all that remained were a few weeks of school until summer break that June. That means prom, final exams, and maybe a group project thrown somewhere in between. Manageable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on Jackie\u2019s bed and let her legs extend down the side (her feet didn\u2019t quite touch the floor). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you are living in Jackie\u2019s life, the kind thing would be to help her in any way you can. Since she is probably having difficulties adjusting to Ken\u2019s life, you feel obligated not to wreck hers. As for the others (including Ada occupying your life), you could only hope for the best. Heck, what if Jackie swaps back into her life to find it improved? Better than before? This experience might end up leaving some people better off. You could do that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Jackie did not have a TV set in her room, you found another way to drown out all other sensory reminders of your current predicament. Plugging her iPod earbuds into your ears, you attempted to find some good music to listen to while you focus on Jackie\u2019s work. Her taste in music is a lot different, of course, but some of the bands and artists in her playlist were acceptable. Her textbooks and course material were also things that, while undemanding to a person of your level of education, required you to reach back into the rusty corner of your brain to remember. Some pieces of information are worthless after high school, yet teachers will tell you that it\u2019s important!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing the work, you flipped through Jackie\u2019s notebook. You tried to emulate her style of handwriting, in case her teachers care about things like \u201cacademic integrity\u201d and assume someone else did her work. Copying her letters was a tedious process, as Jackie apparently loved to draw hearts over the I\u2019s and curve her letters in a showy fashion. Also distracting were her fingernails; they shined with the gloss of a recent manicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackie also enjoyed doodling in the margins of her notebook. Flowers, spirals, and embellished names of some boys in her classes adorned the pages. Most frequent was one boy\u2019s name: Scott Bowman. That might be a name to remember, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStretching your arms, you throw the books and papers back into Jackie\u2019s backpack. That\u2019s enough for one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up, you walk along the upstairs hallway to the bathroom. After using the toilet again, you then wash your hands and brush your teeth. It felt weird to use Jackie\u2019s toothbrush, but how could you know you weren\u2019t using her sister\u2019s by mistake? You rinse your mouth and wash your face, deciding to leave Jackie\u2019s hair alone. In the cabinets below the sinks were other toiletries: tissues, sunscreen, lip balm, hair curlers, razors, tampons, Maxi pads, hand lotion, toilet paper\u2026 the essential products for two normal teenage girls. You notice a hint of stubble on Jackie\u2019s legs, meaning that she will need to shave there in a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back to her room, you adjust the bra straps which had been digging into your shoulders. Of course, you hadn\u2019t forgotten about that sensation! Admittedly though, it did provide a good support for Jackie\u2019s back in not having to deal with the unrestricted bouncing of flesh. You push these thoughts to the back of your mind. No need to get <i>too</i> comfortable with this body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next, if anything?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You sigh, knowing that today is a Monday, and Jackie had to go off to school. There wasn't much left to the semester, but you didn't want to risk Jackie's college scholarship and your way out of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush through a shower, still not quite ready to explore Jackie's body too intimately, then start looking through Jackie's closet for something to wear. You had just thrown on the jeans and t-shirt last night, but you feel like throwing on something a bit more fashionable for school. You are not sure why; it just feels like the right thing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick out another t-shirt, a knee-length skirt, and some tights. You pause before leaving Jackie's room, and place some jewelry on. It's cheap stuff that an 18-year-old girl would wear, but, heck, that's what you are now. You finish off the look with some ankle boots with a slight heel. You admire yourself in the mirror, and realize that despite being a little stuffy looking in work clothes, Jackie's actually pretty hip looking most of the time. At least, you look so today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bop downstairs actually sort of happy, grab an apple, and head off to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at school, you notice a few girls snickering at you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you made your decision, Jackie\u2019s cell phone started ringing again. You picked it up, dismayed to find that her mother was calling. You placed it against your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello? M-Mom?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the sound of a woman speaking on the other line, but absolutely none of it made sense to you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah!\u201d You yelped, flinging the phone into the back seat. \u201cJackie\u2019s mom speaks Asian!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen cracked a smile at your outburst, still keeping his eyes on the road. \u201cAsian is not a language.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever, OK? I think it sounded Japanese or something like that. Oh nooooooo, this is bad. This is worse than I hoped! How am I going to pretend to be Jackie when I can\u2019t even converse with her parents?\u201d You shrieked, making Jackie\u2019s voice sound a bit shriller than you expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019ll be staying with me tonight.\u201d Ken said resolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed!\u201d You said. As you calmed down again, you immediately thought of Jim. Given the conversation you had earlier with Ada, it is also likely that she does not speak English at home either. As far as you knew Jim never learned Spanish; he was in for a rough night. This gives you some reassurance because it was a stroke of luck that Jackie\u2019s mom decided to call when she did. Otherwise, you might have stumbled into a difficult situation, cultural discrepancies notwithstanding. Staying with Ken tonight will provide you with a temporary respite from Jackie\u2019s life, overwhelming as it may turn out to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ken arrived back at the hotel. Since Phillipa was virtually \u201cmarried to the job\u201d, she lived in a hotel suite at the same place in which she worked. Philippa would later claim this was for things like increasing productivity or reducing transportation costs (whatever that actually meant). But as soon as you entered her suite, you realized why Philippa had it so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, this is extravagant!\u201d You mumbled, in open-mouthed wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suite was located on the top floor, so naturally it was the best one in the entire hotel. Think of it as the kind movie stars and famous people rent out. A plasma-screen TV hung on the wall, overlooking a small living area, a kitchen, boudoir, bed, and bathroom. The bed was the largest you\u2019ve seen in years, or maybe this was because everything now seemed bigger from Jackie\u2019s perspective. The bed contained soft throw pillows and pillows with real feathers in them, embroidered blankets and bedding, and a sturdy mattress. The boudoir had racks upon racks of women\u2019s clothing and more kinds than you could fit in a catalog. Phillipa had shoes for everything, in every color. The living area had a couple of couch chairs and a dining table. The bathroom shined pearl white and had a shower, hot tub, toilet, and two sinks. The walls were dotted with oil paintings. An entire side wall was nothing but curtains covering a sliding glass door that led to an overhanging balcony. The view of the ocean rivaled none other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit, she\u2019s loaded.\u201d Ken stood dumbfounded. \u201cThis is all my stuff now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it\u2026\u201d you added quietly. He seemed not to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBill, come check out this hot tub! Incredible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKen, you\u2019ve got to see the ocean from here.\u201d You motioned for him to come to you. He stood out on the balcony with you, watching the moon cast a gleam of light along the still waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJim is an idiot! He should have stayed here with us!\u201d Ken chuckled, flipping on the TV and turning to the sports channel. He leaped into the couch chair, reclining it until he was almost parallel with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur old bodies could still be here at the hotel.\u201d You mentioned, walking over next to him. \u201cWant to go see how their day was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe tomorrow.\u201d He yawned, stretching out his arms wide. \u201cLook at that play! Kobe from downtown! Swish!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snickered, claiming the bed for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you awoke to the sound of Ken running full sprint into the bathroom. You swung your slender legs out of bed, half groggy but nevertheless conscious of whose body you currently possess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen closed the door behind him and turned on the light. Moments later, you heard a dry heave and the sound of a woman completely tossing her cookies. You allowed Ken some time to recover before knocking on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen opened the door, and you recoiled with alarm! His face and upper body were swollen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d You asked breathlessly, staring at him in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThellthith.\u201d His swollen lips and tongue produced a garbled mess of sound. \u201cTheth ullugic tuh thellthith.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillipa is allergic to shellfish. The delayed reaction only took a few hours after dinner, but it took its toll on Ken\u2019s body. He declined going to the nearby clinic, as he asserted that the worst of it was over. You kept a steady eye on him through most of the early morning in case his condition worsened. As a result, you and Ken lost a few hours of sleep last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken next morning to the sun shining through the room. What do you do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seriously, Ken, I'm not even joking. If I'm gonna deal with peoples' baggage, I'd do it on a tarmac. For a salary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen led the three of you through the double doors, down the long hallway adorned with potted plants and paintings, and up to the guest registrants table. Your shoes echoed over the granite flooring, but it got drowned out by the steadily increasing noise of people talking. \"Shut up, Jim. Last night you said it was a good idea, that with such a large audience there must be at least some chicks worth bagging here to scope out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I was drunk last night too. Dude, I don't even remember saying that.\" He grumbled. The night before, like many Friday nights, you three went out for some socializing, nightclubbing, and finally crashing at your house. Memories beyond that were a bit foggy for Jim, who didn't pace himself and ended up blacking out on the cab ride back home. Honestly you couldn't remember if Jim had said that, or if Ken was just making it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, we're here... so let's make the best of it.\" You interrupted, as the volunteer sitting behind the table looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Mayor's Collaborative Public Forum and Town Hall! Sign here with your name, e-mail address, and phone number for your candidate's latest updates!\" Chirped the volunteer. Ken signed first, then yourself, and finally Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a fucking idiot, Bill.\" Jim laughed, as the three of you walked inside. \"Everyone knows you're not supposed to give your own name on those sheets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, right...\" You scratched the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, my go-to name of choice is Vladimir Putin.\" Ken replied. \"I'm part Russian anyway, and the people sitting at the tables don't even notice it. Do you think I fit the role well?\" He added, striking an authoritative pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. At least it's more original than McLovin...\" Jim said. \"If you could choose a new name, what would it be, Bill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" You shrugged your shoulders, having felt perfectly fine going by Bill for the past 21 years of your life. Not William, not Billy, just Bill Conway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know? Ah, that's okay. We'll help you find an alias for future events. That is, of course, assuming Ken ropes us into coming to these stupid events again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I heard that!\" Ken turned around, balling his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thanks to hangovers and a slow morning, you three were one of the last to show up for the town hall. Most people had finished their refreshments and found a seat at one of the two dozen round tables in the center of a ballroom-esque auditorium. The tables were covered with lacy white cloth, small dishes, glasses and pitchers of iced tea, water, and lemonade. The stage at the center of the auditorium had a hardwood podium with microphone, and behind it lay a long table for political candidates and their family members to sit. By your estimate there were about 100 people at this event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou picked up a brochure from the registration table, flipping through it as Ken led everyone to an empty table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says the first introductions will take place in 10 minutes.\" You observed, showing the page to Ken. \"Followed by the speeches, a break, and then the question and answer portion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talent show? Not even a swimsuit portion?\" Jim snorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, plenty of time to get some names and numbers.\" Ken ignored Jim's wisecrack, glancing around at the other people in attendance. Sadly, most of these people were far older than desired, and predominantly men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me miss, is that a 'Save Child Soldiers' bracelet you're wearing?\" Jim piped up, looking in the direction of a girl sitting at the table adjacent to yours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn't appear any older than you three. She was cute, in a petite sort of way, with a meek demeanor and sleek brown hair. She wore designer glasses and had a bit of makeup around the eyes and cheeks. She was wearing a pink, sleeveless silk top, black denim trousers, ballet flats, and the SCS bracelet on her wrist. Her fingernails were painted red. She had with her a pen and notebook, as well as a brown leather purse placed below her chair on the ballroom carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at the bracelet, then at Jim, and smiled shyly. \"Are you familiar with the group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Jim replied, as if he had practiced in front of a mirror, \"Of course. Saving Child Soldiers is not the only humanitarian organization I work with, but I think it's admirable how they help the community and brighten the lives of such needy families in third-world countries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I totally agree!\" Replied the girl, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ryan Ishikawa,\" Said Jim, confidently reaching out for a handshake. \"I used to work for a charity that built homes for schoolchildren in Rwanda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it's certainly a pleasure to meet you Ryan.\" Answered the girl. \"My name is Kirsten Bo. I wish my life was as interesting as yours, but I'm just a university student. I'm also the daughter and campaign manager for my father, Franklin Bo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so your father is running for mayor too?\" Jim feigned enthusiasm in an award-winning display, as you watched on with interest. \"Is he on stage right now? When can we listen to him speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKirsten sighed. \"Unfortunately, we're running a pretty tight campaign, and we couldn't get enough money for my father to be invited. He's the centrist candidate, almost like a protest vote, you know? His day job is as an inventor, but on the weekends he goes around the town networking and getting contacts. It's a time-consuming effort. He couldn't be here today, so I'm here instead to gather notes about the other candidates. I'm really glad I came.\" She said, smiling at Jim before clearing her throat. She tapped her notebook with the pen. \"Um... perhaps you could send us your information, so he can talk with you? I bet you have a lot of great stories to tell of homebuilding in Africa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd give you my business card, but I really wasn't expecting anyone to care about what I do!\" Jim said. \"It's not every day I get to meet such a cute girl who shares an interest in helping the underprivileged.\" Meanwhile, you facepalmed. More cheese than a cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, you're so sweet!\" Kirsten blushed. She scribbled something on her notepad, tore off the piece, and handed it to Jim. \"Here's my number. You can call at anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To schedule a meeting with your father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that!\" Kirsten said coyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks very much, Kirsten Bo.\" Jim, said, tapping the buttons on the screen of his smartphone to add her as a contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Ryan!\" She beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim turned around to receive your and Ken's full attention. You were desperately trying to stifle laughter, while Ken's jaw practically dropped through the table. Jim flicked the piece of paper containing the phone number between his fingers triumphantly.  Jim grinned from ear to ear. \"Gentlemen, the game is on!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just wait until this is over, and I'll get twice as many as you, Ryan.\" Ken murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep on dreaming, Vladdy.\" Jim snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights in the audience dimmed before refocusing on the stage. A balding man, dressed in a business-casual shirt and slacks, strode over to the microphone. In his hand were some sheets of paper, which he placed on the lectern and looked at occasionally while he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for coming to the first annual Mayor's Collaborative Forum and Town Hall. The two candidates attending the debate today have been campaigning for the past few months, tirelessly gathering the needed signatures, donations, supporters, and contacts needed to win the distinguished office of mayor. In just a moment, they'll have the opportunity to introduce themselves. I'd also like to thank our sponsors for providing complementary snacks and drinks, local channel TVRN for broadcasting this live event, as well as the Hotel Claremont, for reserving this ballroom during the middle of the day. This is shaping up to be a fine event. Thank you for coming here, showing your support, and making your voice count. So, without further ado, I give you the speakers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience gave a round of applause. Jim rolled his eyes, clapping extra loudly, thankful for the formalities to be over. Ken was looking around at the other people in the audience, eager to lay eyes (and something else, eventually) on the next attractive woman and catch up to Jim's early lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finders keepers on the chick with the sunhat. Third table up, sitting next to her mom.\" You heard Ken whisper to Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean Tits McGee over there?\" Jim whispered back, drawing a reproachful stare from someone who overheard. \"I noticed her 5 minutes ago. She's mine at the next break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh. I called her first.\" Ken said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't work like that, dumbass!\" Jim retorted icily. \"What is this, fifth grade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up, both of you!\" You whispered, as a few members in the audience began hushing Jim and Ken's brewing argument. \"If you get us kicked out of here we all lose. Be quiet and don't do anything stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, <i>mom</i>...\" Jim mumbled sardonically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm 43 years old, and am, since last July, married to a gorgeous wife and wonderful partner, whom I love with all my heart, Cassandra.\" He said, looking behind him at the woman who was sitting next to him at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Cassandra Snow, may have been 37 years old, but excellent cosmetology and a few aesthetic procedures made her appearance competitive with that of someone ten years younger. Her face showed none of the wrinkles associated with aging, and her hair extended beyond her shoulders in a platinum-blonde sheen. The light revealed bright red lipstick, a gold necklace, and a white blouse with a plunging neckline. She was also wearing a light jacket to cover her arms, and her fingers were slender and topped off with an expensive diamond wedding ring. She wore a grey pencil skirt. It cut just above her knees, where tan pantyhose trailed downward to meet a matching pair of beige, wedge-heeled sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude...\" Jim said, mesmerized with a deer- in-the-headlights facial expression. \"Look at her jugs, Bill. Those things can't be real.\" You noted how much her breasts strained against the shirt she was wearing, creating greater cleavage than was probably needed for this occasion. \"How much you want to bet they're fake, Bill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we find out?\" You replied. \"They're suspect, to say the least. She looks like a trophy wife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trophy wife? How about MILF?\" He whispered. Ken glared at both of you in a reminder to keep voices down during the speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it says in the brochure that the Snows don't have any children.\" You answered, pointing at a page with candidate biographies. \"Hell, they've only been married for a few months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few months and not even a baby bump.\" Jim remarked, shaking his head. \"If I were Mr. Snow I wouldn't be wasting any time, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you're not him. You're Jim. Or Ryan?\" Grinning, you turned your attention back to the speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And then Pete said, 'that's not a courtroom, that's my house!\" Joked Adam Snow, eliciting scattered laughter from the audience. \"To make a long story short, folks, I've had a lot of great successes serving the community, and if you re-elect me for mayor, you won't regret it. Thank you.\" Mr. Snow stepped down from the podium, wiped his brow, and strode back over to rejoin his wife at the table. He kissed her on the cheek as she clasped her hand over his on the tabletop. For just a split second, you and Cassandra made eye contact. She then glanced over other members of the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ms. Angelica Cortez was born in Argentina, moved to our country as a little girl, and became well educated at our very own Everton University. She holds a doctorate in political science and has written three books on the subject of minority representation in public schools. Without further ado, Ms. Cortez.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience gave another round of applause. Jim clapped with ironic enthusiasm, while Ken maintained a determined facial expression, evidently trying to even the score with Jim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Brooks.\" Spoke Angelica into the microphone. Unlike her opponent, Angelica's voice was hard and authoritative, with a distinctive Latina accent. She commanded an aura of gravitas that flirted between professionalism and elitism. \"I believe that our society has languished in complacency for too long. For too long, I say, the poor are being neglected and left on the streets. We have turned a collective blind eye to the disadvantaged, and we must do more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim poured another glass of lemonade, the sound of ice cubes clinking against each other breaking your and Ken's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, can you be quiet for like three seconds?\" Ken asked. \"I'm trying to listen to the speech!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who suddenly cares about politics, Bill.\" Jim laughed, causing Ken's face to flush with anger. \"This glass of lemonade could be a better candidate than that windbag on stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares, just be quiet.\" You reminded the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica Cortez stood slightly taller than her opponent, Adam Snow, but only because of her heeled boots and above-average height. She wore a satin tunic underneath a navy blue, buttoned jacket. Her legs were covered by a matching blue straight-leg pants. Her fingernails were not painted, but she did have the slightest hint of makeup and lip gloss. Her skin color was darker than the others on stage, and her curly hair reached shoulder length and no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Which is why 46 percent of the public believes rehabilitation, not retribution, is the proper way to address crime in this city!\" Angelica finished, resulting in more scattered applause from the audience. She gathered her own cards from the lectern before sitting back down at the table. Oddly enough, there was nobody sitting with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gives? Isn't this supposed to be a family event? The political candidates were supposed to bring their family members here, but Cortez didn't bring anyone.\" Jim said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because she doesn't have any.\" You answered, indicating again the biographies section of the political pamphlet. \"35 years old, unmarried, no siblings, parents deceased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a Manchurian candidate to me...\" Jim mumbled, part conspiratorially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not,\" Ken joined the conversation. \"Why she has no family, I mean. She has the potential to look really attractive. It's just hidden beneath the restricting clothing and brisk personality.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and she's a fucking politician.\" Jim added. \"Boss people around, sit in a nice cushy office all day. No need for sweating like a pig, loading and unloading pallets of suitcases at an airport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mad bro?\" Ken grinned, finding some amusement in Jim's desire to do anything except listen to another speech or be cooped up inside a cold room on a warm weekend day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get on with it...\" Jim said, rubbing his eyebrows. You merely smirked and waited for the next events to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adam Snow and Angelica Cortez exchanged arguments, fielded questions from the audience, and built their case on why they should be elected mayor. It was all rather boring and predictable, and it was all you could do to stay awake and scout out the room for potential chicks. There were a couple breaks in between, where you three split up to mingle with the other guests in the crowd. By the end of the event, which ended up being the middle of the afternoon, you three gathered numbers to tally the winner.<br>\r\n\"So, who won today?\" You asked, holding scraps of paper in your hands like poker cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't Snow, and it wasn't Cortez,\" Jim smiled triumphantly. \"It was Wong by a landslide!\" He lined up four phone numbers on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn.\" Was all Ken could say. \"You beat us. You and your damn charisma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of those were as Ryan?\" You eyed the papers skeptically. \"Or Douglas? Or Francois LeGrande the Third?\" Recalling the now-infamous memory of Jim's failed attempt at wooing a French exchange student at school last month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only that first one was Ryan.\" Jim said defensively. \"You might not believe it, Bill, but the chicks dig a confident man. It's only natural that I won. Don't feel bad!\" His grin was permanently plastered to his face. \"So what do I win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen punched him in the shoulder. \"Nothing, you idiot. Two of those numbers aren't even real. See, they only have six digits. I don't even need to be an apprenticing electrician to know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim did a double-take at the numbers. \"Well, shit.\" You and Ken burst out laughing at Jim's premature gloating. \"I demand a recount!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" You said, again counting the legitimate numbers. \"The results are in: Jim got two, Ken got one, and I got two. So it looks like Jim and I tied.\" You had struck up a conversation with a couple girls who attended your university; they were attending this debate for a course assignment. Actually, they were close acquaintances from a journalism course you had taken a few semesters back, as part of a group project, and you already had their numbers in your cell phone. Not that Jim or Ken needed to know, of course. It still counted as far as you were concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Ken got a number too?\" Jim feigned mock surprise. \"What was his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very funny, Jim.\" Ken shook his head and smiled. \"She was the sunhat girl. So I win by quality, not quantity unlike you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wins by quality, huh? We'll see about that once we put these numbers to the test.\" Jim retorted. \"The best is yet to come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then placed the pizza boxes on the counter and got out some paper plates and napkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, fellas, eat and be merry. If you're gonna take one of my beers, have the decency to leave my Scotch alone this time... <i>Ken</i>. And take a napkin okay? If you get grease on the couch I will kill you. Then I will kill your character in this video game. In that order. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you three spent the rest of the night hanging out at Jim's place, eating pizza, drinking beer, and playing videogames. What better way to spend a Saturday? As it got much later, you and decided to leave and get ready to go home. Since Ken and Jim were roommates (Jim's flat had limited space), you decided to get ready to go back to your own apartment. You took a shower, threw on the same clothes you were wearing before, and grabbed your car keys. You limited yourself on the beer this evening, of course, unlike your two friends, who didn't have to drive anywhere that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh,\" Jim said, sprawled out on the couch. \"I feel so weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird?\" Ken said, now dressed in sweatpants and a Red Hot Chili Peppers t-shirt. \"You're drunk. You've been drinking too much in the last 24 hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but this feels... weird.\" Jim said, still laying on the couch. \"I feel... <i>different</i> for some reason.\" Changing the subject, in an attempt to get his mind off the sudden and inexplicable sense of 'oddness' overwhelming him, he said, \"Look guys, this is loads of fun and all. I wouldn't have spent this Saturday with anyone else. But, why is beer so expensive? I'm gonna go broke at this rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beer is expensive because, otherwise, people like you would drink it all.\" Ken stated matter-of-factly. \"What you need is sleep. We're all just... sleepy. Been having too much fun this weekend. That's all.\" You inferred that there was more to it than Ken said. Did Ken perceive what Jim was feeling on some level? An indescribable sensation of 'oddness', almost like 'otherness', if that could be applied to a personal feeling?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged your shoulders and yawned. \"Thankfully I knew I'd be driving home tonight. Don't wait up for me.\" Since you three had crashed at your place last night, it was your car that you transported everyone around in today. The same car you'll be driving back in tonight, a full circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJim was already asleep, and Ken was walking back into his room. All the lights out, you bid them good night and trudged in the darkness over to your car. It was an old, brown sedan but it got you from point A to B.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived back at your place safely, it now being quite late and the streets less congested than earlier in the evening. After giving a halfhearted attempt at homework, you leaped into bed and fell asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Linda stares at you from the mirror petrified, a knockout queen in that black tube dress even though it mercilessly squeezes her torso, hurting your chest and ribs, and its short length makes it difficult to move your legs without pulling it up and drawing attention to the rose-patterned, cotton panties underneath. You don't know how to respond to this situation: your brain, seeing your girlfriend, registers the normal response of elation, pride, and intense arousal, but then the physical sensation of owning her body, being Linda Henderson, moderates your happiness. It's not something you imagine many people feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://babescene.com/babe/xp6hg8/\" target=\"_blank\">http://babescene.com/babe/xp6hg8/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a long pause from the other stall where you heard Li shout. \"H-Hello?\" she says. \"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's, uh... Linda.\" You open the stall door, nudging aside the clothes Linda put on that morning (you'll change after, you figure) and knocking on Li's stall. She opens the door in a disheveled, panicked state. A dress like yours hangs by the mirror, but Li has yet to put it on, dressed currently in her undergarments - a black, tight camisole camisole and matching panties, each fitted to her svelte physique. You always admired Li's spartan charm, suitable to a policeman-in-training, but now with her ponytail on her shoulder and her lips trembling, you figure the beauty will have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://babescene.com/babe/35k65g/\" target=\"_blank\">http://babescene.com/babe/35k65g/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Linda,\" Li sputters, \"Sorry... I didn't mean to scream, I just... realized, uh, the price on this thing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say, \"I'm going to say something possibly crazy, but if it's true, please say so right away. You're actually Ken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Li says, her expression lifting. \"Oh my God! How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm actually Bill, and I think we've all switched with our girflriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving home your point, another stall door opens and Jim's girlfriend Marcy inches out, wrapped in the pinkest, silkiest, most luxurious bathrobe you could think of owning. Its extravagance clashes with the look of pixie shyness plastered squarely on Marcy's face. She pushes her long, waist-length ponytail back over her shoulder and bites her lips. \"And I'm Jim,\" she whispers. \"I think we're all our girlfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://babescene.com/babe/8eucoe/\" target=\"_blank\">http://babescene.com/babe/8eucoe/</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So does this mean our girlfriends are us?\" Ken says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug. \"Maybe. I hope so, anyway, it would be more awkward if it was just us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should go back to where we were sitting,\" Jim suggests. \"We were just outside the store, I think. Hopefully our old bodies will still be there or coming here.\"</span></div></div>",

Ken starts the engine and leaves the parking lot and away from the mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look out of the window as you are thinking about where your girlfriends are right now. You hope you'll find them at the dorms, or at least to find a clue where you can find them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see your reflection in the window, it still feels odd to see Linda's thoughtful face staring back at you. You are also looking at the outfit you are wearing. Linda's bra can be faintly shown from this up close. Your hands grab Linda's breasts lightly, you know Linda's not as stacked as Marcy but she doesn't disappoint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider taking a peek into your top, just you know to make sure it's really Linda for sure. But before you can do that the car swirls a little before Ken drives straight ahead again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ken what are you thinking?\" Jim asks angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should ask you Jim, playing with your girlfriend's boobs in front of everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they are my breasts for now Jim, I can play with them whenever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you shouldn't be surprised that men stare at them, including me.\" Ken ends the conversation with that.

You just hope Ken did not see you checking your girlfriend out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the trip there is an eerie silence between the three of you. You are happy to see the dorms. Thanks to the pass you have in your possession the three of you can park at the student's parking space. The three of you step outside the car and decide where to go next. You can see if the girls are in Linda's room in the girl's dorm, or your room in the boys dorm.</span></div></div>",

Let's just go to Linda's room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step inside the elevator, which takes you to the first floor. The girl's dormitory is vastly different than the boys. There is a smell of fresh flowers in the corridors. Some doors are open and you can just peek inside.

You walk past the science building toward the central dorm block where your room is situated. The wind has started to pick up, and you can see storm clouds approaching from the north. The few students outside walk quickly past you. Most of them have umbrellas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We might have to stay in my room,\" you say through clattering teeth, clinging to your arms in a vain effort to resist the cold. \"If it starts raining, we can't be walking around like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's assuming we can get into your room,\" Jim mumbles. \"Unless Linda has a copy of your keys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit. You hadn't thought about that. With the transformation and the disappearance of your old bodies, you don't have your dorm key or your student ID. You could maybe call campus police, but if nobody was in the room they wouldn't do a thing, no matter how loudly you insisted you were Bill's girlfriend. You consider rerouting toward Linda's dorm room but it's already too late. She's on the other side of campus where it's probably started raining. Lightning flashes over the University's film school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope,\" you say, which prompts an eye roll from Jim. \"I hope you know what you're doing,\" says Ken, although he doesn't sound too hopeful. But despite your friends' lack of trust, somehow you feel confident that you'll make it through somehow. It might be Linda's athletic build. You can't help walking with her breezy stride, feeling her muscles tighten and her spine standing taut, resisting your inclination to slouch. You know if you wanted you could break into a mad dash and maintain speed for miles. You smile to yourself, remembering how Linda always badgered you about getting off your ass and working out with her. You always resisted, but now that your girlfriend's health is your own, you realize what a difference it makes in mood, determination, and a willingness to lead. \"You had a point,\" you think, like Linda can hear you. \"Sorry I doubted you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that changes once you enter the men's dorms. Walking through the lobby, you're jostled by a trio of bulky football types. You recoil at their touch, reminded of how much smaller you are, and also aware of their shooting glances as they walk past. Ken's comment about staring comes to mind. Linda is a popular student. A lot of guys would love to sleep with her. You imagine men undressing you with their eyes and impulsively clutch your chest like they can see everything. Even Jim, as unashamed as he's been exploring Macy's body, looks uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush up the main staircase, praying Linda and the girls will be in your room so you can get inside and escape your classmates' licentious stares. You reach the third floor. You walk slowly towards your room, experiencing the same dread from the mall parking lot. First door... Second door... Third door... There it is. Fourth door on the left. You give a tentative knock and hold your breath. Was all this worth it?</span></div></div>",

She was upset she was now pregnant with twins after being a 22 year old man. Ken was now Carrie Johnson and pregnant with her first child. She was 30 years old and the farthest along in her pregnancy, though smallest in terms of belly size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of us struggled to get out of the booth, especially myself, now being pregnant with triplets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",
