            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the late 21st century, flying cars and android servants were being made available to the public. There were also two companies performing genetic experiments, one working on a way to stop the rapid growth of a form of the Flesh-Eating Virus. The other was working on a way to make communication between humans and other animals easier- mainly so that search dogs, and other such animals, could tell their handlers/owners what the situation was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, the human trials portion of the tests had some very drastic outcomes- Those who had volunteered to try out the cure for the flesh-eating virus lost all sense of humanity, becoming very violent and dangerous, needing to be locked up. They also developed a craving for raw meat- any raw meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the Handlers who were testing out the human-animal communication injection- they ended up turning into humanoid versions of their partners, or any other vertebrate-type of animal they\u2019d last been in contact with- even if it was part of their meal, or clothes- one who\u2019d worn a set of wool socks turned into a sheep-like creature, and another who\u2019d eaten a hamburger before the experiment turned into a cow-like creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experiments were halted as a result, the vials put on ice, and the test subjects isolated from the rest of the public, with those who had tested the Flesh-Eating cure in solitary confinement, though those who had tested the animal-bonding formula were allowed to roam their complexes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a group of terrorists found out about the Flesh-Eating virus experiment, and stole a vial of the \u201cCure\u201d. They made some alterations, making it waterborne, and communicable, especially through saliva. They released it in several cities around the world, Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Australia, and even in the underground cities of Antarctica. The world\u2019s militaries and health organizations could do nothing to halt the infection from being spread, until the case of John Fillard and company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn Fillard had been a K-9 handler for the San Diego police department. In an attempt to get a closer connection to his K-9 partner, he had volunteered for the Humanimal-communication injection. Because of the injection, he ended up turning into a humanoid German shepherd. During the initial stages of the Flesh-Eaters\u2019 Outbreak, he and the other humanimal hybrids were still at their facility when one of the scientists came in with a bite from an infected. Despite the best of efforts, others became infected. Seeing what was going on, John and other hybrids with police and military backgrounds, or with training in hand-to-hand fighting, took on the creatures, saving the remaining scientists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time rescue finally came, John and most of the other hybrids who\u2019d engaged in the fighting had been wounded by the creatures, and placed into isolation as a result. However, unlike with regular humans, they hadn\u2019t become rabid. Subsequent testing revealed that the hybrids were immune to the Flesh Eaters\u2019 virus, due to their own transformation. Armed with this information, the scientists went to their fellow scientists in the field of biogenetics, especially those in virology, and offered a shocking proposal- turn the humanimal injection into a contagious virus in order to save what was left of humanity. Problem was, most of the world leaders had, by this time, been either killed, infected, or had fled to some hiding place. However, most of the surviving high-ranking military officials agreed with the scientists, and gave the go-ahead. Less than a month later, the humanimal virus was released into the world. Humanity had been saved, at the cost of the human race itself- or so it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before people realized that there were humans who were immune to the humanimal virus. When doctors examined their blood, they found it was due to a rare genetic mutation- of which, less than one percent of one percent of the total population had. Coincidently, these people were immune to the Flesh Eaters\u2019 virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is now the 23rd century, and the undead outnumber the living by at least two to one. The surviving human population is largely immune to the viruses. The war against the undead is at a standstill- the armed forces are having trouble retaking the land for the living, especially in the Arctic regions. The military forces, and scientists, are currently searching for a way to finally win the war- like better weapons and tactics, or something that speeds the decomposition of zombies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost cities are built like fortresses- stone walls around the urban areas, at least twenty feet in thickness, and at least twenty feet high. One of the requirements most cities have is that each person over the age of 18 is to spend at least week on wall duty- watching for others, and to maintain the wall itself.  As for armament, the Weekly Guards are armed with crossbow-type weapons, while the Professionals are armed with bolt and lever style firearms.  For close-up work, a special shovel-ax is used mainly, though there are other items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there are the Nomads. They wander the area, acting mostly as a mixture of Scout and Traders between the cities. They are armed with a mix of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there is also bandits, which are highly dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, who is the person the future follows?</span></div></div>",

The vehicle wasn't powered by horses or gas, it was by a crank system that led to a string of gears that moved the wheels while someone at the front steered. So it was basically 1 person driving, 2 people using the cranks (With shifts of course), 6 on top to watch for bandits or trouble and the rest inside staying guard inside or relaxing for whatever reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as said Lewis was in the far back atop of the 2nd box. With him is Obi (Short for Obrieski), pretty much the only person that can have a decent conversation with him, Obi was a fellow that wore a gasmask and grey poncho (That is reinforced) and under that was a flak jacket that had grenades on it. The reason for that is because he is the only person onboard that is not-immune and he is the one who designed the armored vehicle and gunblades so his knowledge of jerry-rigging is essential which the grenades are self explanatory for zombies and the reason he isn't an anthro is because of his principles that he enforces greatly. He has no worry about being shot and blown up prematurely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Obi\" Lewis stated \"That last town we were in...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that scavenging job was a bust\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad that nobody got hurt and I'm also glad you they didn't get close to you\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In terms of my importance or in terms of friendship\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you're the only person I could talk to, I would rather take friendship than your role\" Lewis and Obi were friends since they were children, the town they lived in was breached by a large group of bandits and so it was promptly burned to the ground. Over a long stretch of time from their teenage years to what they are now, they have met up with other nomads and traversed the wasteland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" One of their allies yelled \"It's...\" </span></div></div>",

Enclosed in twenty foot tall, and again twenty foot thick, walls, it reminded him of those Medieval towns he'd seen pictures of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be good to rest up,\" he said. \"Take a hot shower, bed a good woman, have a few drinks, maybe watch a movie or a play, and buy you some soap; you're getting a little ripe Obi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't trust that stream back there, and would have taken you guys too long to boil fifty gallons to take a good bath in,\" Obi muttered. \"Make sure that soap doesn't contain animal tallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis chuckled. \"I'll make sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, the caravan stopped before the gates of the city. Lewis watched as old Hank got out of the wagon, who walked up to a uniformed human, one with black gloves on, as well as Section Commander emblems. At one side was a katana, and on the other was one of those 1911 type pistols. He then noticed the Wall Guards; five had rifles, and the uniforms of the Professional Core. An additional twenty had crossbows, and uniforms of the Weekly Guard. All of the guards had their weapons pointed at them, and not even the Week Guards seemed to be nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never liked this part of entering a town,\" Obi said. \"I hate it when they aim weapons at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd do the same if some stranger came up to us; it's a show of force, letting us know who's in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem to be well trained, especially compared to those at Home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention that,\" Lewis muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The commanding officer though, keep an eye on him; he's got the black gloves of an Unimmune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then watched as the Section Commander and Hank came around to them. The S.C. looked them over. \"Make sure that he sees the Doc first; got to make sure that he's Free and Clear of any infection before we let him in past Quarantine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Hank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And tell him to take off that gas mask; the viruses aren't airborne, that much we do know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've told him before sir, but he's quite fond of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him to take it off, or I'll do it; I don't want the Unimmune to panic because of one man's paranoia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sir, but it has come in handy, like when we have to get up close to an enemy. Besides, from what he's told me, it's a family heirloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if <i>I</i> gave it to him; while he's in the city, that mask comes off,\" the S.C. said. \"He can keep it in a case, but he's not to wear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe S.C. started walking towards the gates, and stood with some other Officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a point,\" said Hank. \"Obi, unless you fancy staying out with the wagon, you'd best take the mask off while we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObi...</span></div></div>",

He then came out with the money, and gave some to the men, always asking, \"Whole or Part?\" If a man said \"Whole\", they'd get all the money they'd earned, but they had to be careful with it; more than one man had spent all their money on drink and women, not saving any for more important things, like food and supplies. If a man said \"Part\", they'd get half their pay, which they could do with as they wished, and the rest would be placed in a strongbox for later, or to be used for supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whole or Part?\" Hank asked, as he came before the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Part will be alright,\" Obi said.

The two of them walked in, and their ears were bombarded with noise from piano music, the hooting and hollering of men and women, all of which were having a good time, enjoying a drink, playing cards, watching the show, and more than a few dancing, or trying to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My kind of place,\" Lewis said as the two of them walked to a rabbit clerk by a set of stairs. \"My friend and I would each like a shave, a hot shower, and a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk nodded. \"One gold coin apiece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's generous,\" Lewis said as he and Obi got out the coins. \"Of course, you'd best make sure that one of them is a human, preferably one that's clean, if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clerk took a look at them, and noticed Obi's black gloves. \"I see; the showers are marked separate, one for Unimmune, and one for all others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know,\" Obi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, they are Unisex,\" the clerk said. \"So don't get an ideas about catching a freebie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis chuckled. \"We won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the clerk said. \"We'll see to it that your clothes are washed and cleaned for you when you're done. Room 23 for you, and 24 for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear,\" Lewis chuckled as he took his key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Lewis was sighing in pleasure has the warm water fell on him; few things could beat out a good shower, except bedding down a good woman. Once he was good and wet, he came over to a chair, where a tiger man was waiting with a straight razor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a clean shave, or do you want to keep some of it?\" the barber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A clean shave is fine,\" Lewis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger applied the cream to Lewis's face, scrapped the blade against a strip of leather. He then began shaving, occasionally stopping to scrap the blade against the leather, to make sure that the blade was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Lewis was enjoying the warm water again, and scrubbing himself with a flower-scented soap. It just felt good to be truly clean. When he was done, he wrapped a towel around his waist, and looked into a mirror. \"I look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you do,\" the barber said, as he prepared for his next customer, a lion with a mane that needed a trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLewis then stepped out into the hallway, and saw Obi, who likewise had a towel around his waist. Obi unlocked the door before him, and Lewis saw a redheaded woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun.\" Lewis chuckled. He then opened his own door, and saw that his woman was a </span></div></div>",

Come on Uncle Vergil, back to the lab.\" Thornton says as he takes his undead uncle down to his underground laboratory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThornton has been inventing a since he could walk, literally. His large lab beneath his house is a testament to that. It includes a training ground, a work area, an archive, a storage unit, armor display racks, and a corner filled with works-in-progresses. Thornton puts Uncle Vergil in his test cage, measures his progress, and records it on a notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Seems like you're getting significantly better now. In a few months time we may be able to move on to phase two. But for now you just sit tight. Veesha! Where are you?\" Thornton calls out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately a floating sphere speeds out of a docking compartment. Two red eyes appear on the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Thornton. The bracers have been finalized.\" Veesha informs Thornton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Come, let's get to it!\" Thornton exclaims in joy as he puts his lab oat on and his indestructible glasses on. Vision is important these days if you don't want to be changed. Thornton rushes to the test area where two bracers, gauntlet like equipment with a metal skeleton making them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThornton puts them on, one for each hand. The core in the palm of each one glows a brilliant white. Two slide dials lie one the top of the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, exactly what do these do? Our instructions were pretty cryptic.\" Veesha asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These bracers, Veesha, can control four things each. The right braver controls the elements while the left one controls some miscellaneous ones, which I'll show in just a minute. Now, see that piece of wood over there. When I command the dial to move with the brain interface I created to be set to fire, I can do... THIS!\" Thornton yells as a fireball rockets from the right core, now glowing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wood burns to a crisp, at fifteen meters away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These bracers fit on my hands with the finger gun bracers perfectly. Now, anyway, these bracers can make what these dials show from pocket dimensions like the finger guns do or use the surrounding are. Now, for the others.\" Thornton explains as he moves on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the next hour, Thornton fires streams of water, ice, earthen materials, gales of air, and has them orbit him as he can control them or fire them, providing incredible control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other bracer manipulates other things, specifically electricity, sound, a sword he has in a scabbard to his left, calling the sword and controlling it without touching it in midair, and magnetism.

Grinning under his mask at the captive restrained at the other side of the room, he glanced at his selection of tools. Cyan eyes drifted over scalpels, hammers, shovels and more; all tools that, without context, seemed out of case. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Name: Braewerth Kirkland<br>\r\nBorn human.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly two assistants remained in the sterile room with him. One was a horse, solidly built, powerful muscles tensed under his chocolate fur. His black tail swished uneasily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was a dog. A husky, to be exact. Underneath her grey fur, her muscles tensed and untensed, similarly to the horse beside her. Toeclaws clicked lightly on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the anthros towered over the human. Despite the pale man being just above average height, the two figures behind him made him look downright puny. He stood as tall as the husky's chin, but barely as tall as the stallion's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaring at the restrained undead opposite him, Braewerth turned to his two assistants, who were wearing surgical scrubs, just like him. \"You two are dismissed.\" Ignoring their protests, Braewerth took a claw hammer into his hands. \"The undead is restrained. Its teeth we're removed even before its lower jaw was, and I was born to anthro parents. I am in no danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two anthros exited the room, Braewerth found himself alone with the chained zombie. Pallid, decaying flesh was stretched across a thin skeletal frame. Numerous small scars covered its half-naked body. Milky-white orbs gazed hungrily in Braewerth's direction. Braewerth raised a dictaphone to his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Subject Zero-Zero-One appears to have been female before infection, as is indicated by both the lack of male genitalia and the resultant wounds that would occur with the removal of said genitalia. Visual sexing was at first difficult due to the heavy volume of scars sustained by Zero-Zero-One. It is reasonable to assume that the subject has either been in numerous fights - with either wildlife or human/anthro forces; or that damage sustained through natural wear and tear has not healed due to widespread necrosis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBraewerth began to walk towards the zombie. The room he was in was long and wide, not to mention tall. At one point it may well have been a sports hall, but currently it had been converted into a makeshift laboratory of sorts. Emphasis on makeshift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Signs of gangrene present of subject's right arm. Left arm and hand are severely decayed, and their lack of use by the subject suggests that they are completely nonfunctional. In addition, there is extremely heavy damage to both legs, in particular the feet. Bone is exposed in several locations, along with muscles and nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This test, hereby designated Test Zero-Zero-One, will attempt to study the effects of pain on individuals who have succumbed to the so-called 'Zombie Virus'. Test Zero-Zero-One will be conducted with a blunt instrument - a claw hammer. Blows will be made to the limbs, and will increase in strength as they move up the limbs to the torso, until either a significant response is attained, or all four limbs are destroyed. Subsequent tests - designated Tests Zero-Zero-Two and Zero-Zero-Three, will most likely be conducted with different necrotic individuals, and will be undertaken with stabbing and slashing weaponry. Test Zero-Zero-Four will attempt to elicit a survival reflex to light and medium blows to the upper torso, neck, and head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End log.\"</span></div></div>",

He'd been hoping that the letter had come from some woman that admired him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to his room and got out his battle shovel-ax and crossbow. The shovel-ax was in two parts- the shovel-ax section, which had two ax blades, sharpened pointed shovel head, and a two foot long handle, and was made to split skulls. The other section was the Handle Extention, and it had a two foot length, with a steel D-Handle grip, which could double as a mace in a pinch, and was more than capable of smashing bones. When the two were put together, it could dig through the toughest earth, sand, gravel, and other sediments, the ax blades giving enough purchase for a foot to just force the shovel head through roots, and more. He got out a whetstone and cloth, and began to sharpen the edges on the ax blades and shovel head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done, he looked at the crossbow. He adjusted the tension on the trigger, so that it wouldn't loose the bolt as easy on him. He then checked on the bow and the string, and made sure they were in working order. He took a look at his battle bolts- they were the basic ones, triangular head, with a wooden shaft, and bird feathers for flights. He also had some wooden training bolts. He sharpened the heads on ten of the battle bolts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took the battle shovel-ax and the crossbow outside, along with a few training bolts. He set up a skull-sized target, drew a triangle representing the area between the eyes and nose, and stepped back thirty pieces. He placed a bolt on the crossbow, and loosed it at the target.  It pierced the target through to the flights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad,\" he said as retrieved the bolt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then set up a block of wood, and picked up the shovel-ax section.

Simple, fairly quick when properly executed, and always effective.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could teach me how to do that?\" Lucas asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing when you report for duty tomorrow,\" said Stevens. \"I just like to check on my new recruits before they show up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to know sir,\" Lucas said as he picked up the weapons. \"By the way sir, will I need to worry about you if you get bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know if I'm susceptible to turning right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" said Lucas. \"I mean, I can't be turned if I get bit, but with you humans there is that chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, there is a chance that humans can turn,\" said Stevens. \"Well, my blood was tested and the results showed...\"</span></div></div>",

Be at the East Wall at Zero Five Hundred hours, on the Dot! If you're late, you'll be scrubbing out the latrines with a toothbrush for your duration of Wall Duty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir!\" Lucas said as he gave a quick salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Stevens. \"See you at the wall.\" With that, the man walked back out on the road, and went down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas gave a sigh as he lowered his hand. He then picked up his weapons, and went back inside to get something to eat. As he went to the kitchen, he looked into his father's Shrine Room. Making a slight detour, he went inside, and noticed that his mother was already in there. The mare was setting up some incense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that the Section Commander came by,\" she said as she lit the incense. \"Is it your tour of Duty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is mother,\" Lucas said as he sat on a special pad. He looked at the Shrine- there was three rows; a picture of his father, a magnificent looking stallion, was in the center, at the top was an urn containing his ashes, and at the bottom was his sword- one based on a Scottish claymore. Only a Professional Soldier, former or current, was allowed to own a sword, or their family if they died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his mother and noticed that she had a slight smile on her face. \"He'd be proud to know that you were going to serve on the wall,\" she said as she sat down. \"He and that Stephanie were good friends- that man would even visit me when I was sick and your father was unable to visit in person. As it is, I had wanted to marry him when I was doing two years in the Service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me that he was unimmune,\" Lucas said. \"So how would that work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Willow chuckled. \"A way would have been found, such as artificial insemination,\" she said. \"As it is, he is married to a wolf, and they have two daughters around your age- one's a wolf, and the other's a born human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adopted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biological- they used a doctor to help get his wife pregnant with his children,\" Ms. Willow said. \"The born human one is immune just to let you know- and she's looking for a boyfriend from what I hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll find my own girlfriend, mother,\" Lucas said with a chuckle. \"By the way, why didn't you marry him instead of Father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth is, your father won me in a fight,\" Ms. Willow said with a chuckle. \"Both of them had wanted to marry me, and I told your father that the only way I'd marry him, was if he could take Stephanie in a fight- that human is very good at CQC. The two of them had a boxing match, under the guise of training of course. Took your father seven rounds to exhaust Stephanie enough to forfeit the match. Funny thing is, after Stephanie left the ring, your father collapsed. Still, the two of them remained good friends afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never saw him around here when Father was alive,\" said Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wasn't a Section Commander until a couple of years back,\" said Ms. Willow. \"Your father saved his life you should know- countless times. Saved him on the day he was killed too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to remind me,\" Lucas said with a sigh. A swarm of the undead had came to the area, and all had been needed on the Wall- including those who'd been Off Duty. The fighting had lasted three days, and even he'd taken part- in that he was helping to cook meals, and care for those who'd been wounded, though there was always an armed guard by the bitten humans- just in case. It was the first time he'd seen the creatures- they were scarier than the stories described them. He also saw his father get killed- got his throat torn out. Didn't matter what you were- an injury there was highly fatal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine,\" said Ms. Willow. \"Stephanie wouldn't put a new guard in a really dangerous position unless he was short on people. The Brass wouldn't allow it anyway- they'd have him hung if he did something that foolish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's good to know,\" Lucas said as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Willow smiled. \"He's a good man to know, and one you can trust with your life. Now go get yourself something to eat, and I'll see about packing your clothes. I'll make sure that you've got plenty of clean underwear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother,\" Lucas groaned as he left the room.</span></div></div>",

I mean, father came home every now and then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that's because he was an Officer,\" said Ms. Willow. \"You're just a Wall Guard- you have to stay with your unit, unless there's an emergency. Should something happen at the Wall, they'll want every guard on Duty at his post at the Soonest! And as you know full well, if something happened during the day, your father didn't come home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you mother?\" Lucas asked. \"You've been home during the evenings, especially when Richie has his bouts.\" Richie was his younger brother by five years. When he was five years old, Richie was taken to the doctors with a severe coughing fit- he was diagnosed with Double Pneumonia, and his lungs had never fully recovered as a result, even when the sickness itself had passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one of those Emergencies,\" Ms. Willow said with a sigh- she'd never forgiven herself for letting Richie play in the rain that day- it had been very cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to bring it up mom,\" sighed Lucas. He cared for his little brother- if there was anything he could do to help him, he'd do it in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Ms. Willow said. \"And this is why we must do this- as long as one of us serves on the Wall, we can afford to pay for the medicines he needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas looked at his mother- as long as one of them served, the Town Guard would help pay for any medical bills, and college expenses that one had, and then some. And the medicines that Richie needed were highly expensive. Then again, they couldn't afford to Skip guard duty, which was to pay Double the month's Taxes, though, thankfully, one couldn't keep on Skipping their Duty anyways- they'd have to work two weeks on the Wall the next year to make up for the week Skipped, in addition to the Double Tax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went and got ready- taking a warm shower. When he was done, he combed his mane and tail with a great fondness- They'd be trimmed within a few hours- part of the rules for Guard Duty was that short hair was a must- kept the zed heads from grabbing you and jerking you off balance. His father had always kept his mane and tail short as he was in the Professional Core, while his mother grew her's out, and would come home from Duty with a trimmed mane and tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished getting dressed, and went to eat breakfast- warm oatmeal with brown sugar and maple syrup. He went to his father's Shrine, said a quick prayer, asking for safety while he did his duty, went to the door, and put his uniform on. The uniform was resistant to tears and bullets, and even bolts, but it didn't stop them from potentially injuring or killing someone, though the odds were greatly reduced. However, if a zed had you in its grips, it could still break bones, or tear limbs off, and one's throat was one area that was tricky to protect. He then put his pack on, which had a few changes of clothes, in case he was allowed to leave the Wall for a period of time, and held a quiver of a dozen bolts, and he'd had his crossbow attached to it. He then placed the shovel-ax in its holster on his left hip, with the blades covered, and placed the Handle Extension in its holster on his right, with the D-handle ready to be used.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look just like your father when I first saw him,\" Ms. Willow said as she gave him a quick hug and kiss. \"Big, tall, strong, and ready for anything. See you home in a week son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you to,\" Lucas said as he held onto the mare. \"Give Richie my best.\" He then let go of the woman, and walked out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked down the sidewalk, he saw his lion friend come out in his wheelchair. \"Hey Sam,\" Lucas said, as he walked to the edge of the lawn. \"What are you doing up so early?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed that the S.C. came by yesterday,\" Sam said with a sigh. Ever since his tackle, he'd lost the use of his legs- along with his control of everything from the waist on down. \"He even paid me a visit, and told me that you were going to be doing Wall Duty for the next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you came out to wish me luck right?\" Lucas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled and said....</span></div></div>",

I want to show people that I can do the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, you know you can't exactly fight like the average person can,\" Lucas chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam pointed at his crossbow. \"I've been a better shot than you were since we was kids- my eyes are still good, as are my arms,\" he said. \"I figure I can be in the Lookout towers, and pick off those zeds before they come within a hundred yards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you can't get that post?\" Lucas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do whatever else they give me,\" Sam said. \"I'll make bolts for the crossbows- it would free up a two-legged person for patrolling and fighting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas chuckled. Sam was on the Exempt List due to his injury- those who were disabled, injured, sick, pregnant, or owned businesses didn't have to do Wall Duty, but more often than not, they'd find a way to help out, even if it was something as simple as cooking for the others- with many business owners actually having one of their employees manage shop while they served out a week. With Sam, it was also a matter of Family Pride- even before the undead started walking, there'd been someone in the family serving in the military in some capacity. About the only ones who didn't serve were the sick, and they were often given a Make-up week to serve when they were fully recovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Sam,\" Lucas said with a smile. \"I'll help push you to the Wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled. \"Saves my arms some work.\" He placed his arms on his lap while Lucas got behind him, held onto the handles, and begin to push his friend's chair.</span></div></div>",

To me, they'd probably say, 'I hope you like feathers, because you'll be making flights for bolts all week.' After all, I'm required to be there, you don't have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, I want to be on time,\" said Sam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I don't want to bust one of your wheels,\" Lucas said, as the chair squeaked along. \"You might want to request a new chair when we get there. It would make things easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam chuckled. \"Maybe I'll get one of those motorized models. After all, this style was obsolete two hundred years ago, a century even before the Outbreaks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas shook his head. In some ways, especially on a technological level, society had regressed centuries, with electricity being reserved for special situations, such as lighting the streets. Even the armament that Guards used was more Medieval than Modern. Even the firearms that the Professional Core used had its roots based on those made between the late 19th and early 21st centuries. Laser-using firearms had been available to the police and military in the late 21st and early 22nd centuries, but the energy coils for them required a certain amount of maintenance, far more than that required for projectile firearms, which had, thankfully, still been available and produced. However, those were now restricted to the Professional Core and Full-time Police officers, as it required a certain level of skill to make the barrels for them, along with the bullets. Thankfully, crossbows were fairly easy to make, same with the bolts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up and saw a fox wearing the uniform of a Professional Guard standing at the doorway to the barracks of the Wall. In his hand was an old-style pocketwatch. As Lucas and Sam crossed the threshold, the guard said, \"You're five minutes ....</span></div></div>",

The joke was that it made getting divorced easier if the marriage wasn't working out after the \"I do\"s. There was a crowd between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe church was a six story stone building, with a basement. The first five floors catered to the five main religions- Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. The sixth floor catered to the other religions, though the basement catered to Satanists- though there were some things that they weren't allowed to do- virgin sacrifices being one of them. It wasn't perfect, as there were more than a few sects of each religion, but it did the job for the majority of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the courthouse. Outside the doors of the building was the statue of a blindfolded human woman, with a sword in one hand and a set of balances in the other. Near the courthouse, on the side facing the church a a set of gallows- capable of hanging five offenders. When it became impractical to execute capital offenders by lethal injection, electric chair, or even firing squad, the rope had been brought back, along with the hangman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas gulped at the sight of it. The executioner stood watching the crowd, his face impassive and unreadable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" he asked in a low voice. \"Are we heading there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going there,\" Jackson said. \"As for what's going on....</span></div></div>",

The police found him covered in blood, and when they pumped his stomach, the police found the women's flesh. Couldn't get any clearer than that unless they caught him in the act.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas watched as the hangman slipped a hood over the cheetah's head, along with a noose. The hangman then walked to a set of levers, and looked at an open window, where the Judge was watching. The Judge gave a nod, and the hangman pulled a leaver, releasing the catch on the trapdoor that the cheetah was standing over, still trying to free himself as he fell through. Lucas heard the Snap! of the man's neck breaking when the rope reached it's end, and he felt sick to his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson took a look at him. \"He isn't worth you losing your breakfast over. Try and keep it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas gave a slow nod, and swallowed what little had came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson pointed toward some benches. \"Take a seat- I'll go set up his funeral arrangements- though if I had things my way, I'd toss his good-for-nothing carcass over the wall and be done with it- he always caused trouble- fighting, stealing, and more. Still, he's family, and the rest want him buried in the family plot at any rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nodded and walked over to the bench.

Maybe spend the night in their bed. I want to be able to do that, and not worry about turning, and end up changing my diet.

His father had decided to come to the infirmary, to see him and his mother. Problem was, one of the bitten humans had proven to be Unimmune, and they'd Turned, killing the guard responsible for putting him down. He'd come for them then, and would have killed Lucas if his father hadn't pushed him out of the way, and grappled with the creature. The Turned human bit him in the throat, and tore out his jugular, just as his mother smashed his skull in with an IV pole. Lucas had tried to stop the bleeding with his hands, but it had proven too much. Colonel William Willow had been buried with full Military Honors, including a 21 gun salute, in tribute not only to him, but all the others who'd lost their lives in the fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas shock his head back in the Present. \"Sorry.

The other one had a long curve, was very wide, had only one sharpened edge, and was at least four feet in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gladius and a talwar,\" the Bladesmith said. \"Perfect weapons for a small shrew and a large African elephant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The inductees chose their own, right?\" Jackson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, can't make a sword for someone if the sword won't fit them,\" said the Bladesmith. \"I'm surprised you're not wearing your kris; my father made that wavy blade special for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had it under my pillow when I went to bed last night,\" Jackson said. \"Had a bad dream, so I don't plan on carrying it for a day or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Bladesmith laughed, his trunk wobbling around in the air. \"A professional soldier not carrying his sword because of a bad dream; that's a good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina snorted at this. \"Horty, don't laugh at him; the true kris is said to have been possessed by spirits, both good ones, and bad ones. If he thinks that carrying it will give him bad luck at the moment, he's better off wielding one of those common shaxes, like one of the Weekly Guard. I'll wager he'll carry it in a few days though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the wager?\" Horty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see how good you are with that trunk,\" Tina said. \"If he's wearing the sword in two days, you have to dust the whole house with nothing but your nose and a feather duster. However, if he still has it in his quarters when he comes by, we'll see how good that thing is in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal,\" said Horty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson chuckled. \"I don't know if I should carry it or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't and I'll tell you the details,\" Horty whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do, and I'll tell you the details about his attempt to dust those blades he keeps,\" Tina said. \"Those things aren't easy to keep clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see,\" said Jackson. \"Just make sure to let us know when the blades are done; the ceremony will be tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorty nodded. \"Will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas and Jackson step outside, and removed the wet cloths. They resumed walking through town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little warm in there,\" Lucas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do good work,\" Jackson said. \"I'd trust their steel over most other bladesmiths. My kris has saved my life plenty of times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why aren't you carrying it?\" Lucas asked. \"My father carried his claymore everywhere he went, especially while in uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's unlucky at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlucky?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you chose a sword, you must know the history of it; traditionally, when one owned a kris, they'd sleep with it under their pillow. If they had a good dream, good luck would come. A bad dream though means bad luck instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's silly,\" said Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what's silly,\" Jackson grabbed Lucas by the collar. \"Not being at your post on time.

He was an anthro, just like Willow, only he was a canid\u2014a coyote. He stood with his paws behind his back, tall and firm, tail unmoving, muzzle raised up, behind which a pair of pale-green eyes pierced Lucas with razor sharp scrutiny. Holstered to the coyote's right hip was a Bren Ten semi-auto pistol while his melee weapon of choice, a crowbar of all things, was strapped across his back just above his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nearly jumped at the sudden realization of his presence, quickly snapping to attention and throwing a salute to the officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, Lucas Willow reporting for evaluation of standard-issue civilian weaponry, Sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At ease, Mr. Willow; you are not under my command yet,\" the SC informed Lucas with an amused smile, \"and I'm here off-duty as well, though I am pleased to see you so eager to become a week-long warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, my father was a professional soldier in the defensive lines against the undead. I just want to follow in his footsteps, sir!\" Lucas was so excited, he did not put himself at ease despite his officers order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can start by addressing me as Section Commander Taylor,\" the SC replied with pat on Lucas's arm, somewhat alleviated the horse's anxiety, \"but just Taylor will do just fine, for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas shifted his hooves, still nervous before SC Taylor's stature that measure inches below his own, but was no less intimidating, his visage speaking for itself, but the coyote's body was also filled out quite well, muscles strong, firm and quick with the imperfection on his coat of fur speaking volumes of his experience along with his ribbons displayed on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Section Commander Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor exhaled through his nostrils with a sigh. \"let's take a look at your weapons, Lucas isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Section Commander Taylor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed as Taylor inspected Willow's tools of self preservation, marginally impressed by their exceptional upkeep, but gave a scowl at the pristine condition of the blade and bow. Upon being asked whether he had ever practiced, Willow answered that his father would always teach him with his own weapons, hence the lack of wear on Lucas's crossbow and shovelaxe. Taylor nodded thoughtfully at his answer and finished his inspection, returning Lucas his crossbow and shovelaxe for which he excused himself from Taylor to set on the outside table before quickly returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a damn shame that you probably won't be using them,\" Taylor said with his amused smile back on his muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Section Commander Taylor?\" Lucas asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas, usually the Weekly Guards receive weapons inspections in mass upon reporting to the Town Militia HQ,\" the coyote began, \"I'll get back to those troops once the squad is assembled by oh-two-hundred. You, on the other paw, are a special case. One I need to have prepared by tomorrow, that is if you decide to accept the commission.\" Taylor paused to pull and envelope from his pocket. Lucas was about speak, but was silenced when Taylor continued. \"When you registered yourself to the Town's Militia you had made quite a effort to qualify yourself for being tasked for assignments set abroad. I have to tell ya, kid, it's not that often that they send people around the globe when towns have got enough on their plates with the undead, and those assignments usually go to bigger boys than yourself. Consider yourself the name pulled out of a hat for this one.\" With that he handed Lucas the envelope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas's fingers trembling with excitement gingerly took the paper from Taylor's extended paw. This time it did not smell like scented paper, but like the sharp and unpleasant chemicals of freshly laid inks and adhesives. This was important stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean...? I've been chosen...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor's smile just stayed plastered on his muzzle, pulling just a bit more at the corners of his lips as he nodded to the equine. Lucas did not hesitate to rip open the letter. He was not sick of home, he loved his town, but finally, he was going to see the world, finally his runs could take him somewhere beyond the four walls that separated the living from the undead. One so sheltered as Lucas would find something profoundly poetic in the feel of foreign wind blowing through his mane as he would stand on a cliff facing an open ocean, sunny canyons, the vast expanses of. . .</span></div></div>",

You'll be one of fourteen personnel at the outpost including their helicopter pilot, who is flying out early tomorrow and who you'll be joining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas could only stammer syllables as he wanted to complain, but there was nothing the section commander could do about it other than disapprove of his misplaced thanklessness. It was obvious to Taylor what Lucas's feelings were on the matter, so he stepped right into the ultimatum:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This assignment is only your choice, Mr. Willow, those papers in the envelope need to be signed and turned into the Town Militia HQ or directly to City Hall, by twenty-one-hundred tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor turned to leave making his way towards the sidewalk. Taylor looked at Willow once more and added, \"You don't have a night to sleep on the issue, so I suggest you think on it carefully before you turn your nose up at a ticket to leave the city walls in relative safety. When you turn in those papers, expect at your front door at seven-hundred tomorrow. If you don't,\" Taylor paused as if shrugging mentally due to his look of apathy, \"then report to Town Militia HQ like all other weekly recruits. Seven-hundred sharp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the coyote left with a brisk pace, disappearing around the nearest corner as he headed back to base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMan, Lucas did want to go out and see the world, but Antarctica? That was nowhere near the top of his list. The constant sub-zero temperatures would mean no feeling of the breeze in his mane unless he wanted to suffer frostbite from the windchill, the deep snow and the need to keep bundled would hinder his running, and the scenery would always have to be enjoyed while snow-blind. Just the though of being unable to step more than a few meter outside was making him feel claustrophobic. The ant-hive tunnels of the cities still had nothing compared to the open. What was worse was that the further he read the more he found that Big Magnet was not part of one of the cities, not even close. Thirty crew maximum base, eight-hundred mile from nearest civilization, two hundred to the next nearest station, and twelve-hundred miles from the coast. Middle of the forsaken nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do?</span></div></div>",

Aside from all the fine print reading, there really wasn't much to fill out, just a few general questions regarding the equipment that was to be issued  and few places that required his signature. It was so simple yet so difficult to make this decision that Lucas was giving himself a headache before he even realized just how hungry he was after his run. He could not think about a decision like this on an empty stomach, let alone with a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas stuffed the papers into the front pocket of his shorts and retrieved his equipment from the table, holding his crossbow with one had an the shovelaxe under the same arm as he headed inside his home, making his way to the kitchen. The sound of running water could be heard once he opened the door. His mother was there, her back turned towards him as she was busying herself with washing the dishes. Lucas licked his lips when he saw the sliced bread and an assortment of veggies ready on the counter, perfect for a delicious sandwich. Taking the shovelaxe into his free hand, Lucas made his way tenderly towards the kitchen table, trying to suppress the clip-clop of his hoofs on hardwood as much as possible. With arms outstretched, he had almost made it when his mother, without even looking at him, said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas, please don't put your weapons on the table. Put them back in your room if you are done playing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis arms sagged in defeat as he let out a groan. She must have known him too well to have such an intuition. Lucas quickly navigated up the stairs and just dropped his weapons on the bed before hurrying back to the kitchen, nearly slipping down the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't run in the house,\" Ms. Willow chastised once Lucas was layering greens on a wholegrain slice of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I just get so restless,\" Lucas said somewhat evasively. He did get restless while cooped up, but he'd just been outside. What was really bothering him was that trip to Antarctica, those papers stuffed down his pocket. He was almost sure that he wanted to burn them in the fireplace and take his place on the City Wall, to serve his town in a way that mattered. The only thing that held him back was. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you talking to someone outside just a moment ago,\" his mother interrupted his thoughts. \"Who was out there with you, Lucas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was only the Section Commander, mother,\" Lucas replied. \"He came by to inspect my Town Militia issued weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Ms. Willow's voice held no surprise. \"Is it time to serve your week on Wall Duty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly,\" Lucas muttered, resenting what he was about to bring up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" his mother inquired, without taking her eyes off her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas took a deep breath. \"The application that I sent in to get a chance to serve abroad has come back to me with a commission.\" He let a moment pass, letting that sink in before he continued, \"But it's not anywhere that I wanted to go. They gave me a chance to go to Antarctica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Willow shut the water off and turned to her son. \"To Antarctica?\" she balked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's only a choice,\" Lucas breathed a sigh. \"I really wanted to see the world, but this commission, it's sending me to the underside of the Earth for the entire summer, to a cold and desolate place! I. . .I don't think I'm going to accept the commission. They might not consider me again, but I really don't think this is worth it.\" Lucas watched his mother as she looked at him vacantly. Suddenly her gaze shifted up, betraying a hint of rage directed at someone or something not in the room, and then she turned back to the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Section Commander, he was not. . .\" Ms. Willow began, but paused as if holding something back. \"He must have been the officer that had just transferred in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know mother,\" Lucas answered, \"but I haven't seen him before, on the wall or leading patrols. He was a coyote and a decorated soldier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments passed between them, Lucas awaiting a reply from his mother who only stared absently ahead of her out the window. \"Of course Stephanie wouldn't bring such news;\" Ms. Willow chuckled to herself, her eyes glancing sullenly at her son, \"that Stephanie always resented anyone leaving, and since it is you, well. . .\" She trailed off, lost in her musing. Lucas could have asked who was this Stephanie of which his mother spoke, but more importantly he saw the reasons that the person would have to resent his departure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother, what would father have wanted?\" Lucas asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mare turned to back him, staring as if almost unsure of how to answer his question, but a moment later a look spread on her face that told Lucas just how she felt on the matter. She was going to be. . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Standing outside in the early morning, Lucas waited for the Section Commander to arrive like he said that he would. Lucas was dressed in blue jeans that extended all the way down to his hooves and a navy blue kangaroo-pocket sweat shirt with a longsleeve underneath to deal with the nippy summer mornings. It wasn't something that would not have been be appreciated if he were attending the Wall Guard, but for his journey to the Antarctic, his casual clothing was acceptable as long as he would wear the issued thermal wear under and over it. In his left hand he held a duffle bag filled with a supply of light casual wear, personal hygiene items, notebooks and binders filled with notes from his previous biology classes and a textbook to go along with them that would certainly come in handy. Just the bare minimum. Other than that he brought along his shovelaxe and crossbow just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs far as personal effects were concerned, Lucas clutched a switchblade in his other hand. He would often lift it up to examine it's design. Six inches of sharp steel resting within a cherry handle with a gold plated guard and pommel. On the pommel, two letters etched into the metal displayed the initials of the previous owner, W. W. His father's initials. Lucas's mother had given him his father's trusty old knife as a parting gift for good luck last night. She was not out with him this morning, seemingly for the difficulty of saying goodbye to the son she would not to see again for the next quarter of a year. He placed the knife into his pocket and continued waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was seven o'clock exactly and Lucas was beginning to think that maybe they had lost his commission papers or maybe this new Section Commander wasn't as punctual as he should have been, when he heard the sound of a running engine. Looking to his left, Lucas spotted a single vehicle moving on the empty street. It was an olive colored light utility vehicle from the US Army of the 22nd century with the Town Militia insignia painted onto the door. By the sound it made, Lucas could tell that it still utilized an internal combustion engine and rubber tires instead of the modern diffusion drives. To be fair, a diffusion drive's upkeep would have been impossible in the state of the world today, however, it was possible to  synthesize fossil fuels. The car pulled up alongside Lucas's home, in the driver's seat sat the coyote known as Section Commander Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hop in, son,\" Taylor called Lucas over from the car's open cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas walked over and set his bag and both weapons into the backseat of the military vehicle before taking his seat on the passenger side. Taylor glanced back at all that Lucas had with him and even tested the weight of the bag, and remembering the weight of the weapons, he calculated the total in his head. Personnel traveling to Antarctica were only allowed a certain weight in personal items. Lucas, however, had packed very lightly Taylor noted, probably because he didn't know what to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to make another stop in town,\" said Taylor as they took off down the street, \"pick up the pilot, he's right over by the West Wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is this pilot anyway?\" Lucas asked. \"How come he is not with the Town Militia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pilot is a friend of mine, I'll introduce you once we're there,\" Taylor answered while negotiating a turn. \"As for why he is not with the Town Militia, it's because he is a war veteran. Vets don't have to serve weeks on the wall if they don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got plenty of vets serving on the Wall Guard,\" Lucas spun, \"why is this guy freeloading?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's only been here a few weeks,\" Taylor stated, \"getting ready for the assignment in Antarctica. He only stayed longer because the mayor of this town paid him to fly you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what about you?\" Lucas raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a coincidence that I transferred in at the same time,\" Taylor replied matter-of-factly. \"Besides, I like growing communities like this,\" Taylor gestured to the buildings passing by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes passed as they traveled a distance the would have taken half an hour on foot. They stopped next to a tall building with an external structure of iron stairs leading only partway up with the access to the roof being a retracted ladder at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab your stuff and let's go up,\" said Taylor as he stepped out of the car. \"The helicopter is on the roof and McCoy's also got the penthouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas gathered up his stuff when he thought to ask, \"Who's McCoy? Is he the pilot?\" It was the only name SC Taylor had mentioned besides his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" Taylor affirmed. He was saving the rest of his introduction for once they met this McCoy. Lucas followed Taylor to the top of the stairs where he knocked on a door next to the retracted ladder. Lucas could hear some shuffling around inside, but apparently it was not fast enough for Taylor who banged  thrice on the door with his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" bawled a voice from inside, mumbling the next part which both of the anthro's sensitive ears could pick up, \". . .for fuck's sake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and a male human revealed himself, holding a mug of coffee in his free hand, his other one scratching his head under the long bronze hair and working his way down to his beard of the same color. His eyes squinted in the early morning light and his breath was still heavy as if he had just gotten up, prompting Taylor to ask if he was even prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I got my shit together,\" the man whose name was McCoy answered with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, did you sleep in those clothes?\" Taylor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I did?\" McCoy was dressed in leather work boots going halfway up his shins with the hems of his pantlegs tied down by the laced up collars. He even had a leather bombardier jacket on and a hat string around his neck with a hat that was also possibly leather behind his back. It really didn't bother Lucas much that this guy was wearing dead animal, but he sure wouldn't like to see a reaction of a cow or a bull if they saw the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucas, this is ex-Army Special Forces attack chopper pilot, S. R. McCoy,\" SC Taylor made the introduction. \"Mac, this is Lucas Willow, the soon-to-be apprentice to Brady at the research station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how're you doing?\" McCoy extended his bare hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing just fine,\" Lucas smiled in friendly manner and took the hand thinking he was an Immune. McCoy's blue eyes made contact with Lucas's in a sincere manner out of custom than anything else because his stare remained uninterested, as if Lucas was just an obligation for him to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both did tours in the conflict over the Amazon years back,\" Taylor continued, \"I was a foot soldier in the Third Battalion while this guy right here flew our air support almost exclusively. He was in there longer than I was though, and despite being susceptible in all those monsoons, he never changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, susceptible?\" Lucas recoiled his grip from the man's hand. \"You mean he's Unimmune? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" McCoy spoke coolly while taking a sip from his coffee, \"if I was worried about that I'd be in a full hazmat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that he wants to change--\" informed Taylor, \"I bet he could tell you some stories about that--but in regards to some other humans who changed if an anthro so much as breathed on them, Mac here is at least very resistant in that regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay,\" Lucas eased himself knowing that he had not forced someone into a transformation by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's get this journey underway, Mac,\" Taylor spoke to his friend, \"Got everything you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just a sec.\" McCoy entered his room and emerged again with a Remington 870 shotgun and a rucksack in which Lucas could see the shape of a very large box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Taylor asked with bewilderment. \"You're taking that big case of C&amp;K Scotch with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt anyone else is gonna bring any of the hard stuff, do you Taylor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not,\" Taylor sighed. McCoy pressed a button on the inside of his room and the retracted ladder slid down. \"Hey, Lucas,\" Taylor turned to the horse and smiled, \"make sure this lunatic does nothing stupid and comes back a human, alright?\" The coyote spoke in jest, but the human still shot him an annoyed stare as he donned his shades. \"He's all yours Mac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right.\" McCoy looked at Lucas as he put the ruck  on his shoulders. \"Grab your stuff and haul it up and into the chopper; I wanna get up before the clouds start moving in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clouds?\" asked Lucas as he followed the pilot up the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're headed for the coast and the storms have been hitting the shore pretty hard for the last few days.\" Both got onto the roof and made their way to the brown Bell 206 with the words Antarctic Research Program on the side. \"We have an opening to get this thing landed on our ship with a minimum in crosswinds. We've got two get there before winds pick up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas nodded and followed McCoy, who told him where he could put his stuff and that he could sit in the aircraft's left side, unlike Taylor's car. McCoy took a few minutes to go through a mental preflight checklist as the engine whined to life and the rotors began to chop at the air above. Pulling on the collective and easing forward on the cyclic, McCoy lifted the heli off the ground and they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkip to. . .</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well, McCoy had nailed his two hour window, landing on top of the bulk cargo carrier moored at the port and made it inside the cabins before the rain started to fall. It then became the job of the anthro deckhands to tie the Bell down by its skids and fold in the rotor blades to that the human didn't get any falling water on his Unimmune skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the pouring rain, Lucas's clothes quickly began to soak all the way through to his short fur and his mane was dripping water down his back to the base of his equally drenched tail. It was cold out with the wind stealing away any warmth he had and made him start to shiver, but he couldn't help but pause for a long while to admire the deckhands and the longshoremen, or rather longshore animalmen now, as they worked in tandem to move the last of the large crates set along the dock onto the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, Lucas could tell that this town was much rougher than his own with most of the buildings in disrepair and what had been the wall left with many breaches in its stone perimeter and the only effort to mend them were barricades of haphazardly stacked cars, perhaps enough to deter zombies, but not enough for any bandits that decided to climb over. Given the overall condition of the town, it was a fair bet that it was full of red-light houses, black market shops, and a haven for organized raiding parties, the kind that gave the Town Militia back home some trouble. The only portions that seemed to be upheld were the highrises and the warehouse and dock district. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Lucas's hometown, the most activity had come from around the Wall and its gate points, the Militia having taken over the regulation of incoming and outgoing supplies. The trade of materials in Lucas's town had essentially stagnated with its self sufficient agriculture, water purification, and low-tech capabilities. Any import was mostly limited to what was scavenged from nearby towns and cities that had been completely decimated, as their society did not condone pillaging. These supplies were then distributed to where they would be the most useful, weapons to the armories, food to the storehouses, metals to the workshops, and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, it was apparent that the warehouse and dock district was most active with the bustle of muscular fellows continuing with remarkable speed and coordination even in the inclement weather. It was a strange contrast from the disquieting stillness that seemed to permeate the rest of the town. The iron ship on which Lucas stood held the greatest hustle on the docks with the diesel engines thrumming and eager to depart while the crew and dockers worked in concert to move the largest containers. Without power, they relied on teamwork and the ancient methods of ropes and pulleys for the loading and unloading of the shipments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, there were other ships still making their way into the docks by power of sails or oars to drop off their cargo before being moored for the approaching storm. Several were fishing vessels bringing in their harvest from the nigh unlimited bounty from the unregulated ocean, while others carried what might have been trades from other ports, merely scavenged materials or even the spoils of raiding parties. There were pleasure boats as well, which looked much nicer in contrast to those with blue collar men scurrying about the decks and Lucas could occasionally see their seemingly high-class occupants appear it their large, illuminated windows. They were mostly concentrated around some of the nearby warehouses that are occupied with makeshift trading companies driven by commerce operating like an ancient bazaar than a modern port. The large buildings were full of movement and  promised a wide selection of goods complete with violence and sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas's musing was suddenly interrupted by a series of shouts that could be heard coming from another part of the the ship. Several crew members not part of the muscle-powered crane teams dropped what they were doing to see what was going down, including Lucas, whose hooves clacked across the metal deck as he ran. The shouts mixed with animal cries of rage and the escalation of a skirmish could be felt in the air even before Lucas finally caught sight of the quarrel happening right beside McCoy's helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a red fox backed by several companions now, some bare-pawed while others had grabbed any nearby blunt instruments to fend off a group of anthros armed with bladed weapons backed against the ships railings. The surrounded anthros were much rougher than the ship's crew and must have been bandits who climbed up the side of the ship in hopes of plundering its cargo. The fox, however, had stopped the plan short when he spotted the raid and now he barked his final warning to the bandits, his pistol drawn to reinforce his intent. The group of bandits, ever defiant, hissed and spat as they retreated down over the railing. Only one, a lion with a speargun as his own weapon, stood his ground, eyes burning with hate and challenging the fox's warning. The lion let out a roar before drawing his weapon, but the fox was a step ahead and whipped his pistol up, took quick aim and squeezed off three rounds. The lion's roar was drowned by gunfire and caught short in his throat as the bullets found their mark in his center mass. His body fell back and slumped against the railing. The fox, having neutralized the threat, holstered his weapon and calmly walked over to grab the dead lion's foot-paw and heave the leg up to tip the body over the railing, letting it splash into the water below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucas looked on in horror, he did not notice someone step up behind him until his nostrils crinkled in displeasure to the stinging scent of a cigarette. He spun around to find an otter standing behind him, a peaked cap atop its head shielding its eyes from view and the lit end of a a cigarette from the rain. Further down, Lucas saw that the otter was indeed a \"he\" with masculine muscles rippling underneath the fur on his uncovered chest. The only other piece of clothing he wore was a pair of black shorts, concealing his pride for the sake of decency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deck Officer Chase, report!\" the otter bellowed past Lucas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!\" came an acknowledgement. Lucas turned back to see the fox that had downed the lion was walking towards them. \"Pirates of this dock had tried to board the ship, probably to steal cargo; they showed interest in the helicopter. When approached, they showed hostility. I issued two warnings, then fired when the leader didn't stand down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to inform the Chief Mate,\" the captain spoke levelly with an easy voice, \"take three more men and make a thorough sweep of the ship. We leave in half an hour and I don't want any more attempts on my ship, nor do I want one of these scum-sucking parasites wormed in between the crates just to be deep-sixed later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, Skipper!\" with that the fox ran off, calling to some crewmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't it both a sight and a fucking embarrassment?\" Lucas spun around, realizing that the captain of the ship was speaking to him, but he did not comprehend the question. His silence was the otter's cue to elaborate. \"All these ships sailing and rowing into port,\" he gestured with the lit cig between his furry digits, a sweeping motion towards the view of the docks, \"they all serve this town, this armpit of a city, trying to piece together what's left and what'll eventually become our limping economy. And yet there,\" this time he gestured to the bloodstained railing, \"is the beating heart of human greed that keeps it alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas really didn't know what the captain meant by that, but he answered, \"Economy has always been driven by greed and some of us might not have been born as humans, but in a way we all used to be, so I suppose that is inevitable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain just snorted as if he expected that answer, while he readjusted his hat so his dark eyes could meet Lucas's. \"Yeah, we're here part of this commerce as well, trading in quite the haul of the only honest salvage to come up with the remaining fuel and supplies for those guys down there in Antarctica. Men down there hiding in igloos their thinking they're doing the world a favor, and men like me standby out here while the rest of the world goes to the dogs. Well,\" the captain exhaled a cloud of smoke, \"The more things change, the more they stay the same,\" his eyes stared intently at Lucas even as he mused before cutting to business; \"Come on and get your stuff, we need to weigh in your gear before we leave. I'm supposed to keep you under the  limits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy was just exiting the bulkhead hatch, his wide-brimmed hat secured to his head as one of his gloved hands shielded his face from the rain. He was asking about the gunshots, a question which the captain waved off to reprimand the Unimmune human for stepping into the rain, though with a much more colorful vocabulary, leading the both inside. McCoy followed with his crude banter and the captain had a laugh while the human just chuckled dryly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good that the two of you flew in earlier than expected,\" the captain said as he led them up to a large industrial scale, \"I know the men don't like it, but I wanna shove off as soon as possible. Alright McCoy, put your bags on the scale.\" McCoy complied placing both his bags, one for his issued winter gear and the other for his personal belongings, in his case several bottles of liquor. The captain must have been familiar with McCoy's tendencies because he studied the numerical readout with amusement and turned to the human, \"Y'know, with what's written in all this new ham-fisted paperwork, I'm technically supposed to count that chopper of yours as your gear, which,\" the captain turned to him with a derisive smile, \"puts you a few hundred kilos over. Tell you what though, if you throw a couple of your C&amp;K bottles my way,\" he pokes McCoy's bag, \"and I'll make sure to misplace some zeroes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill McCoy part with his <i>booze?!!</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>McCoy stood staring at the captain, his bearded face scowling with disbelief while he slouched to the side with his hands in the pockets of his jacket. He did not seem perturbed by the development, though. It was probably because he had ten other bottles of the hard stuff and also that the captain had the smile that a friend that just wanted a treat for a favor that no one else would give so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" McCoy smiled wryly and opened his bag and removed the lid to the wooden box within, revealing twelve green bottles with red and yellow labels. He pulled two out and handed them to the captain, who inspected and read aloud the label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'Coburn and Kelly's Rare Blend of Scotch Whiskey'. This is the good stuff, not like the leprechaun piss brewed in a bathtub that you get in town.\" The otter spun his newly acquired bottles in his paws. He glanced at Lucas with a smirk.  \"Mac always gets his hands on the good stuff. He's got a lot of leverage when he has a bird and the know-how to fly it. What do you do for this lot, McCoy?\" he turned to the human who had cracked a bottle for himself and took a big swig, \"Assist one of the local militias, or another stint with some zombie research program?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy grimaced as he downed the stiff drink before answering, \"S&amp;D mission,\" confirming his work with a militia. \"I was the eye in the sky while the ground pounders cleared out a small town of any walking corpses and bandits. I staked my claim to these when they found 'em,\" he shook his drink to indicate the case of whiskey in his pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also filled your helo up, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Still trying to get their paws on it. Wouldn't be surprised if the new paperwork has their prints all over it.\" McCoy took another swig as he stared off absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" the captain waved his paw, \"the militias want everyone who isn't part of the force to go everywhere with just the fur on their backs. Confiscating your bird is just the icing on the cake for the town that gets to throw someone green into the cockpit and let him fly circles around the dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas cleared his throat, grabbing the attention of captain and motioning to his bags which also needed weighing in. Not that he wanted to follow through to see if he was within the boundaries of these new regulations, but mostly so he could get settled and then get to moving about the ship. And also because he didn't like the direction of badmouthing the militias that McCoy's and the Captain's conversation was taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain merely nodded and told Lucas to place them on the scales as McCoy did with his own. He said not a word while he took a moment to jot down the number that dialed out, then finally beckoning both the human and the horse to follow him with their baggage. The three of them walked further into the ship, a few turns and down a hall with few doors on either side, until further down they reached several doors placed adjacently, each one numbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain knocked on door numbered 3. \"Both of you are berthing right here in number three,\" he said, \"Make yourselves at home and I welcome you aboard my ship and I hope you enjoy your stay for the next two weeks.\" His arms were crossed and he delivered it quite dryly and left shortly thereafter, presumably to oversee the rest of the preparations before departure. Lucas stood there with McCoy, feeling sort of awkward around the Unimmune human pilot, who was frightfully enough an alcoholic as well. The alcohol McCoy was drinking stung at Lucas' nostrils, not used to the stench because he usually steered far from such people. Thinking past the pilot's tendencies, Lucas wondered about McCoy allegedly being susceptible to the virus despite the human wearing several articles of clothing constructed of leather, yet he was not turning into a bull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy on the other hand wasn't thinking much about the horse morph in front of him. He only spared Lucas a contemplative glance before he move into berth number three, carelessly tossing his bags into the right corner, the bottles of liquor tinkling against each other. Lucas followed McCoy inside and found that it was a very small room with a double bunk setup on the left with just enough room on the right for the two of them to stack their belongings and still have enough room to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind if I take bottom bunk?\" Lucas asked mostly to break the silence between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem,\" McCoy grunted as he stripped out of his heavy clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I get kind of restless and it helps if I'm...you know, closer to the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. Don't want to go rolling off the bunk and down to the ground, do you?\" Out of his jacket and boots, McCoy was down to his sweater and cargoes when he walked over to the bunk and hoisted himself over the top one. He took his sombrero with him and once he was lying on his back he pulled the hat over his face to shield his eyes from the light. \"I'll just be up here taking a rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas placed his bags onto the bottom bunk, not exactly tired and feeling a bit too cramped to stay in the berth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I'll go check out the rest of the ship, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" McCoy affirmed gruffly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lucas was about to leave the human called out, \"Hey, I just remembered...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Lucas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you see the captain, ask him if he's got some of those electronic chess consoles down in supply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, alright?\" With that, Lucas left McCoy to sleep off his drunken mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Knock-knock</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mister McCoy?\" Lucas called into the closed door to his berth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human had locked himself inside again. It came as no surprise to Lucas who had time to realize just how reclusive a person McCoy was. Lucas was out every day on the deck running along the outer walkways, trying not to feel trapped in the cramped enclosure of the ship surrounded by the vast expanse of ocean, and in those two weeks he had rarely seen the human anywhere other than his bunk either drinking, asleep, or playing around with the chess console he got from the captain. He didn't eat very often either and always skipped breakfast, so his presence at the mess hall sparse as well. McCoy wasn't asocial though, he had to give him that. While Lucas would often try to stay clear of the groups of workers and keep only to himself, especially when that fox was around, whose name he neglected to remember, McCoy on the other hand was always conversing with the crew when he was around, often sitting stretched out in a chair with laid back expression on his face while he listened to their conversations, throwing in his quips when he deemed it appropriate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Knock-knock-knock</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mister McCoy, are you awake in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while Lucas waited and was eventually able to discern an electronic voice speaking behind the locked door. McCoy was definitely attempting to defeat that computer at yet another round of chess. \". . . M<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Y MOVE</font>: B<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">ISHOP TO KNIGHT FOUR</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, c'mon, we ain't got time for this,\" the captain appeared, padded up to Lucas and pounded impatiently at the door. McCoy, however, had other plans. He had just poured himself a drink and took a sip as he contemplated his next move and smiled as he just realized the bad move the computer had just made. McCoy ignored the knocking at his door as he tapped out in his next move, confident that in three moves he would slam his drink down in celebration for his victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">OUT MOVE</font>:  P<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">AWN TAKES QUEEN AT KNIGHT FOUR</font>,\" droned the monotone female voice. \"M<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Y MOVE</font>: K<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">NIGHT TO ROOK THREE</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor baby, you're starting to lose it, aren't you?\" McCoy snickered above the rim of his glass. Another round of impatient knocking made him throw a sneer towards the locked door. He tapped in his next move and gazed expectantly at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">OUR MOVE</font>: K<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">ING TO ROOK ONE</font>. M<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">Y MOVE</font>:K<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">NIGHT TO ROOK SIX</font>.  C<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">HECKMATE</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wiped McCoy's grin from his face. He glared at his electronic opponent, noting the primitive construction of a entire computer tower and monitor that were required to run this game that ran in the ten-kilobyte range and how this primitive opponent still managed to hold such and unfair score over him. Putting his hand on the monitor he leaned the whole thing backwards, giving him a good angle to pour his full glass of C&amp;K down the machine's cooling vents, into the game's guts. Sparks spewed forth in the ensuing electric popping followed by smoke rising from the ruined circuitry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheating bitch,\" McCoy spat, slipping down from his bunk and mumbling his way to the door. \"Yeah, what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door to see an otter and a horse looking at him expectantly. \"What are you doing in here, Mac; jerking off or are you just getting plastered?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy just groaned while rubbing at his face, not in the mood to come up with some witty comeback. \"Hey, you got any more of those electronic chess things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain ignored McCoy, moving past him into the room. \"Lucas, get your stuff packed. Mac, get your gear on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy suddenly comprehended the interruption. \"We hit the Antarctic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, we're already docked at Palmer,\" the otter affirmed. \"Your chopper is fueled up and ready for takeoff. No ice buildup. Weather will be clear, but you've only got a few hours of daylight to get to your halfway checkpoint where you should receive a load up supplies for Station 4 before you continue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn time crunch,\" McCoy suddenly complained when he realized how late it was. \"This is gonna turn out to be a night flight, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I want you up in the air in ten. You've got over a thousand miles to cross. That'll take you, what, five hours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy nodded. \"Give or take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't dick around, you might just make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took less than ten minutes for Lucas and McCoy to get into the air. Their bags were stacked in the back as well as that broken chess console that McCoy dragged along. Lucas could smell the burnt circuitry, which made him wonder why McCoy even bothered. He himself had brought along something from the ship as well, or rather received it as a gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that you got there?\" McCoy took notice if the plastic box sitting on Lucas' lap even as he worked the aircraft's controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some kind of music player,\" Lucas answered, surprised the human actually started a conversation. \"The captain told me how long and boring the flights are and gave me this.\" He held up the ancient piece of plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" McCoy smirked. \"And what kind of music do you have on it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it. . .\" Lucas slumped, having a hard time admitting, \"it only plays cassettes, and I've only got the captain's mixtapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"McCoy chuckled mockingly. \"And who knows what that crazy sunvabitch's listens to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain stood below, seeing the chopper off as it circled around, gaining altitude before  swinging back around, heading off into overcast skies over the mainland of Antarctica.</span></div></div>",

It was the final stretch to Station 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy did not talk much beyond the vocal notes to directed at himself, mostly griping about the darkness closing in sooner with the approach of the Antarctic winter and the winds that began to pick up to nineteen knots. Lucas could barely hear this as he didn't bother to wear the passenger's headset, but he could see McCoy struggling with the controls and the grimaces he made every time the helo was battered around by crosswinds. Instead, Lucas had the headphones from the cassette player on his ears though the contours of his equine head made it difficult when the pair were made for human heads. It was all he could do to keep his mind from the boredom of the flight, and then the terror as the second flight in his life was no longer over the calm eastern coastline but up in the violent air above the coldest region on the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Lucas, the tapes he had gotten from the captain were filled with nothing but ancient songs from before the turns of the last two centuries. Lucas just didn't like rock and roll and felt that it should stay as dead as the use of guitars in music, when digital sampling trumped all other forms of creativity back in 2112. At first the song he was listening to showed promise with the aged synths building an atmospheric intro, but then the guitar started to throw in it's licks. Lucas rolled his eyes in exasperation, but decided to endure this distraction rather than listen to the horrible thrumming of the rotors and howl of the wind around the cabin. It was only when the screeching vocals sang something about some Temples of Syrinx that Lucas angrily hit the fast-forward button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, forms appeared in the shady white below, a few miles out. Small clusters of lights could be seen dotting the distant structures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is chopper B-2. Come in Station 4,\" McCoy spoke into his mic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Station 4 here. It's about time you showed, Mac,\" a voice snickered through the radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human ignored the comment and continued, \"We are on the approach to Station 4, twelve miles out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are go for approach. Landing area is clear and waiting.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n As the helicopter drew near, the dark tundra gave way to reveal a grouping of small buildings covered in snow, illuminated by external lights. It was hard to see what everything was, but from the height they were at Lucas could make out what looked like a flight tower, a small hangar, several snow tread dozer vehicles parked around, and high banks of snow with a cleared section in the inside corner of the L-shaped compound, the patch that McCoy was descending on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in B-2, come in B-2. Ceiling: five-hundred feet. Visibility: Seventy yards, bring it in nice and slow,\" the radio operator pretended to guide the pilot down. \"Just a little lower. Easy there, now. Easy does it. Five yards. . .two,one, touchdown, and it's good.\" The helicopter shuddered stiffly when it made contact with hard ground. Once the cyclic was down, McCoy hit a few switches which was followed the swishing blades overhead winding down when he killed the engine. \"Meet you out there in a second, Mac.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucas stepped outside, immediately recoiling when subzero temperatures penetrated the short coat of fur on his head and stung his sensitive skin like needles. Once his hooves were on the snow covered ice, the cold spiked right up to the quick, causing him to yelp and trot in place. His bag! It had a pair of boots specifically designed for his species, courtesy of the commission. He threw open the rear door and rummaged through his pack, freezing his hooves off before he pulled out a relatively high pair of grey nylon lace-up boots, noticeably lacking in human plantigrade shape. They were heavily insulated with the circular, hoof-like sole spreading wide to accommodate walking on snow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, s'cuse me,\" someone suddenly nudged past Lucas, almost tipping him over as he hopped on one hoof, trying to yank his left boot on. It was a fox with a white pelt, an arctic fox morph. He ignored Lucas and hopped into the chopper to look over the cargo boxes. As Lucas clumsily slipped on the other boot, he couldn't help but gawk at seeing this specimen in a place where it would look most natural apart from the native region of the Arctic half the globe away. \"Mac! Great ta see ya again,\" the fox spoke to the pilot still going over his instruments. \"Say, are these all the parts for the DeHavilland?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I heard from the last checkpoint that the tunnel collapsed,\" McCoy stepped out and came around to the open door where Lucas stood, \"and figured you'd get that old crate fixed so I don't have to make any long-hauls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solid man, fucking solid,\" the fox jumped back out. \"Feel like a kit on Christmas.\" He straitened out and stuck his hand-paws into his black leather jacket. Even an arctic fox was bundled up here with his winter camo cargoes shoved down into boots similar to Lucas' except fitted for digitigrade paws, long enough to go a little past his ankles, and adorned with buckles on the sides instead of laces. Then his hazel eyes with their slitted pupils fell on Lucas.\"Hah-ay! You must be the new assistant biologist, Brady's protege. Sylvan's the name.\" The fox offered his paw to Lucas as an afterthought to his introduction. \"Assistant mechanic and junior pilot.\"<br>\r\n\"Mine's Lucas,\" he said, taking the fox's hand. \"Lucas Willow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on,\" Sylvan smiled toothily, giving a much firmer grip on his shake than Lucas expected and flinched in response. Sylvan noticed and eased up. \"Oh,  my bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy in the meantime had his bag in hand as well as the chess console hefted over his shoulder and began to walk away from his helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where ya going, Mac?\" Slyvan calls after the human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up to my shack,\" McCoy answered without turning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't you gonna show your face in the rec. room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna show up for grub in the morning then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCoy didn't answer and kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, fuck him,\" Sylvan waved in the human\"s direction. The fox turned his attention to Lucas. \"Now that you're bot here I can go to sleep,\" he said and started to leave for the nearest building and the doorway shielded under a domed entrance over which shined the two brightest floodlights. Though small, it was the main entrance of the compound. Lucas grabbed his bags from the helicopter and shut the door before running after the fox who was already at the door.</span></div></div>",

Any nomad groups wishing to pass through the area must pay 40% of their profits to \"Lord Mercutio\" for right of passage. If they do not pay, a robbery is certain and death is likely. If they pay, they must still hope that the bandits do not get bored and rob them anyway. Mercutio himself is generally fair and honest, but he is also a ruthless dictator who controls his territory with an iron fist.

He watched the young bandit hurry away and wondered if he would be one to rise through the ranks or settle at the bottom. He then thought of General Romeo, his second in command. He encouraged his officers to choose codenames based on literary characters, and he enjoyed the irony of Romeo being the servant of Mercutio. Of course, he hadn't chosen his own name, but, seeing as Mercutio loved literature and given his skilled swordsmanship, he couldn't imagine a more appropriate name for himself. Except, maybe, Hamlet, but he just didn't look like a Hamlet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trusted that General Romeo would be able to handle the zombies easily. After all, they had been doing this for twelve years. Starting as teenagers, he and Romeo left New Washington for the adventure of the outside world. They tried being traders, then mercenaries, but finally they realized they were very talented at thievery. Once they gained a reputation, others joined them and, being a true capitalist, Mercutio organized their gang into a very successful extortion organization. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to read again, but another messenger arrived. This one was another young bandit of no title, but he was a cat instead. Dogs and cats were very common, since many people who received the Humanimal Virus owned pets. Other common animals were cows, horses, sheep, pigs, and even chickens. As an otter, Mercutio was unusual, but not unheard of. He was born an anthro to a human mother and a unimmune father who had worked at a zoo with the otters when he received the virus by accident, as he'd forgotten to wear protection one day. Mercutio himself had never actually seen a feral otter, since the zoo was shut down shortly after his birth due to no funding. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Mercutio, a nomad ship has arrived in port.

Concealed in the privacy of her apartment, she didn't bother to put on clothes. She went to brew some coffee and ready her feed bag under the FooDespenciTron. When the coffee was done she couldn't find any clean mugs, so she drank from the pot and in under 4 seconds, it was half emptied. She went out onto her porch overlooking various scenes like, the wall guard patrolling for zombies and raiders, a small riot started by a man preaching nonsense which seemed to comprehend to the idiot people listening, and the sound of some soldier's radio contacting them. Then a ding came from her FooDespeniTron and her feed bag was filled to the brim with pancakes, waffles, eggs, syrup, etc. She set down the pot and strapped the feed bag around her head and began to eat away. She sat down on the couch and turned on the T.V. screen to the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female voice came on and stated, \"The Prime minister of Russia today stated that he will relocate to St Petersburg, and continue to conduct the political policies of Russia from there on out. He also stated that, '...the zombie apocalyse will not stand in the way of Russia, her way of life, and her people...' He cannot be currently reached for further questions.\" As she continued to consume her meal, she noticed that her bag was almost empty. So she unstrapped it and placed in under the FooDespeniTron to be refilled. She then grabbed her coffee pot and with both hands, drank it all down and placed it to brew some more coffee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then went over to the FooDespenciTron and waited for it to refill. A ding sound was made and the food bag was refilled to the brim with more food. She then restraped the bag to her head and proceeded to lie down on the couch and tried to wrap her hand around her round belly. As she continued to proceed to eat all the food in her bag. Just then a masculine voice came from the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Chancellor of Germany has declared that Germany has been reclaimed from the zombies and have arrested or killed any bandits, raiders, and looters. We now go live to the City-Fortress of New Berlin for further details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a knock came from her door. She unstrapped her feed bag, which was 3/4 emptied into her belly. She then proceeded to put on her bathrobe which couldn't hide her belly and privates very well. She tried in vein to wrap the robe's belt around her belly, but even her arms couldn't wrap around it. Another knock was heard from the door. \"Be right there.\" she proclaimed. She gave up on the bathrobe and went to answer the door. When she opened the door, a militaristic human came in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to turn your apartment into a base of operations and use it for our own evil gains.\" he said jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grant!\" Juina said, \"what brings you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just ask <b>him</b>.\" Grant said and pointed to another male human surrounded by more soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander,\" Juina said surprised. \"What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am temporarily revoking your maternity leave.\" the Commander stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Juina protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric called and said he couldn't assist in the fortress' defenses, said he's sick. Now I'm one man short, and you know that when I'm one man short, I am not a happy man, so I need you to get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I give birth while on the job?\" Juina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not due for another 5 and a half weeks. Now get ready. I'll be waiting for you outside by the truck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander and the other soldiers all left the room followed by Grant who said to Juina, \"Really like the new privates, but I like your privates.\" To that, Juina flipped him off. She then went to her closet and got out her military gear. She took off her bathrobe and put on some panties. She then, in vein, to put on some pants. With her belly in the way, she tried to tie them and then proceeded to put on her camo shirt, but with her belly in the way, it was hard to put her shirt on. She finally got her shirt on, but with 1/3 of her belly exposed. Juina grabbed her bandolier to put it on. Sadly, it didn't fit all the way down her torso. She grabbed her combat boots and tried to get them on, but she couldn't bend down. So she bent her legs back towards her flank to tie them. She then grabbed her pistol and assault rifle. She was ready.</span></div></div>",

But the fact that she was being pardoned just so she can help them meant nothing to her. A execution sounded better than serving the military since she wasn't exactly a good rule follower.

All night she kept candles alight along the windowsill, across the desk and the bedside table - electricity may be scarce these days but you couldn't take your chances in the dark - zombies were no longer a myth from a horror movie; they were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWide awake, Lisa slid out of bed. Wrapping her fake fur dressing gown around her slim furry shoulders she padded down the stairs. Her old bones ached due to the cold. A sliver of moonlight illuminated the kitchen and as she opened the fridge light flooded in to the room. Careful not to catch her claws on the carton, Lisa skillfully caught the handle in her paw and tipped the white liquid in to the glass she had waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard a crash. It could have been the foxes exploring the bins - or it could have been something else....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething soft and light brushed against her leg<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sammy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed a sigh of relief, crouching down to the ginger cat's - her pet cat's - level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, when Lisa had agreed to the experiment she had thought it would bring her closer to understanding the mindset of one of her previous pet cats, Samuel, - now, ironically she was more physically similar to the old Sammy than she ever could have imagined was possible and yet their communication was as basic as it ever had been: Of course - Sammy was still a cat, and had died a long time ago, though his many-times removed grandchild kept her company. She was an anthro - a part cat - an ELEMENT of cat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that moment there was a piercing scream. The candles flickered - Sammy rushed to the door as fast as her fragile body allowed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slow, determined knock........</span></div></div>",

Nice job at a nearby hospital as a nurse, a decent apartment, she even had a hobby. Cosplaying. Explains the ridiculous Black Mage outfit in the Middle of Nowhere, Wisconsin, at least. Look, there's even a bit of black makeup covering her normally near albino skin. Of course, it's looking more greenish grey as of late. At least she has that hat of hers still to bump her up from 5'9\" to 6'11. Gotta love the little things. She sure does, at least. Not much else for her to love and cling on to, save for her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has been going on a big now, hasn't it? Must be getting hungry by now. Luckily for her,  it looks like lunch just showed up. That little giraffe girl won't even know what hit her. A rustle off to her right. That's just a rabbit, but its closer. Less meat, more meat. Close, sorta far-ish. There's choices to be had and there isn't a single Zombie she's ever met that has time for those things.</span></div></div>",

Why would a little girl just be happen to be wandering around Whateverthefuck City, alone, in the middle of a Zombie apocalypse? Well, that's a rather simple answer. She's lost. And there's probably a parent around here somewhere, looking for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it's too late for that.  By the time she sees Evie and can let out a scream, her vocals are about to be torn out anyway.  Blood gushes from her wound as she passes out near instantly.

        "created":1352641260,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Between the late 21st century and the early 22nd century, two viruses had been unleashed into the world, affecting the majority of the population. One virus turned people into zombie-like creatures that craved <i>any</i> form of <i>raw meat</i>, including <i>human flesh</i>. There was no humanity in them. The other virus turned people into humanoid versions of animals- typically the last animal they had touched, eaten, or worn. They tended to retain their memories, and their humanity, for the most part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt has been over a century since their release into the world. Here is what is known: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tThe two viruses are incompatible with each other- a person infected by one can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be infected by the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tThe viruses are mainly waterborne, carried in the water, and even in precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, hail). The safest way to make sure that one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking water is safe- especially from the more dreaded zombie virus, is by boiling it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\tThere are uninfected humans out there- some are naturally immune, others have no immunity. Some are known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cborn\u00e2\u0080\u009d-humans- their parents were anthros, but due to certain genes they were born human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.\tCurrently there is no cure- especially for the Zombie virus. Those who get the Anthro virus can live out their lives. Those turned into zombies tend to be put down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.\tAnthros can have children with other types of anthros and humans. Zombies spread by biting unimmune humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.\tAnthros tend to age at the same rate as humans, and are prone to several of the same diseases, though they are susceptible to some of the same sorts as actual animals. Zombies last for several years, sometimes decades depending on location, and situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.\tNormal animals are unaffected by both virus, and are unable to carry either. However, zombies will still eat them, and many are still raised for food and other items for those who eat meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.\tWhat a non-immune human could turn into after coming into direct contact with tainted water depends on location- if near a place full of zombies, the person will probably turn into a zombie. If the person is in a place full of anthros, odds are they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn into an anthro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.\tZombies are typically found in the Old Cities where huge populations of people used to live, like London, New York City, San Francisco, Paris, Hong Kong, Constantinople, Rome, Tokyo, Moscow, and others. However, they have been known to wander from the area. Anthros and most surviving humans live in the New Cities, most of which are built with defense in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10.\tPre-virus population records amounted to 15 billion people. Current records are an estimated 8 billion zombies, 4 billion anthros, 1 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cborn\u00e2\u0080\u009d-humans, and ten thousand \u00e2\u0080\u009cpure\u00e2\u0080\u009d humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11.\tZombies seem to act on very basic instincts, mainly the need to feed. They seem to lack any real intelligence, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to learn from previous mistakes or successes. However, when they see, or hear something, such as a person moving, they will go after it, and they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop until they get it, even if it means their deaths. However, there is a chance- a very slim one- that they might become intelligent enough to use weapons and tactics, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12.\tThe only sure way to kill a zombie is to destroy the brain. Cutting the head off will stop the body, but the skull will continue to bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.\tSpelling and Grammar are important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.\tGive options when making a character- especially when making different anthro types.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.\tHave the story be told in the 3rd person view.<br>\r\n</td>",
