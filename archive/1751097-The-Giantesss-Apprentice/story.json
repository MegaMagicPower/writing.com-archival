            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Okay. First thing's first. What kind of giantess is Cindy, why does she want to take an earthling as her apprentice, and what kind of person would her apprentice need to be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) She is a gentle giantess. She came to earth after hearing how much less advanced our society was than hers and, feeling sorry for us, she decided to aid humanity's progress in any way she could. She decided to find an apprentice to support her on her mission. She wouldn't intentionally harm a human without a very good reason (ie: self defense), and she would <b>never</b> kill anyone on purpose, no matter what the circumstances. She has a kind heart, and cares deeply for all those around her. To her, size doesn't matter; if it's a sentient life-form, then it's treated with respect and equality. The human that she picks as her apprentice would have to be a gentle soul who would be willing to dedicate her life to helping society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) She is an evil giantess. She came to earth after discovering it as a planet whose lifeforms were all much smaller than her and, seeing it as a world that she could easily conquer, she decided to make it hers. She decided to find an apprentice to aid her in her conquest of the earth. After all, every ruler needs a second-in-command. She is truly sadistic, and takes great pleasure in torturing her victims to the point of tears before finally finishing them off. She sees anyone weaker than her as nothing more than dirt, and treats them accordingly. However, if someone surrenders to her willingly, she'll be a bit more generous to them; she'll only keep them as a pet/slave instead of killing them on the spot. The human that she chooses as her apprentice would have to be a merciless and destructive force who would not hesitate to extinguish the lives of anyone who opposed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) She is a playful giantess. She came to earth on a whim after passing by our planet on a vacation across the galaxy. Seeing that the planet's society was so small, and thinking that they all looked like toys to her, she decided to spend the rest of her vacation here. She decided to find an apprentice so that she would have someone to hang out with. It would be too lonely for her otherwise. She doesn't intentionally go out of her way to try to cause harm to people, but she still doesn't mind if there are a few casualties after one of her games. She is only out to have fun; nothing more, nothing less. The person that she picks as her apprentice would have to be a free spirit just like her, and have a lot of energy to spend hours playing games with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) She is an intellectual giantess. She came to earth while journeying through space to make an interstellar map and, finding the earth as a very interesting planet with many unique lifeforms, she decided to spend some time on this planet to learn more about it's inhabitants. She decided to adopt an apprentice so that she would be able to have someone to teach her about earth's society first-hand. She also felt that it would be nice to have someone to teach about her own planet's way of life. She doesn't try to needlessly cause damage to society, but sometimes she can't resist the urge to take something apart and see how it works. She is a very curious type, and greatly enjoys learning new things. The person that she chooses to be her apprentice would have to be someone who is fairly intelligent, and would be able to efficiently explain the earthlings' way of life to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Other<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When word of the a small world with a very limited technological advancement reached her planet, she immediately began to feel sorry for them. Taking pity on this small planet known as earth, Cindy decided to take it upon herself to help improve the lives of these people. She immediately flew off into space, and used her powers to warp straight to her destination. Within moments, Cindy was floating in the air directly above the planet that she intended to aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was amazed at how much smaller the planet was than her own. As she flew through the atmosphere of the tiny blue planet, she was able to see just how much bigger she was than the earthlings. They appeared to be nothing more than 4 inches tall compared to her! She quickly realized that she would have trouble interacting with this species without causing them fear. She was simply too big for them to not freak out at the sight of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to think of a course of action that could solve this issue without causing panic, but she couldn't think of anything. As depressing as it was, her ability to control the size of objects was limited to growth. Sure she could return things to there original size after growing them, but she wasn't able to shrink anything beyond that point. After several more minutes of thought, Cindy had an idea: if she couldn't shrink herself to human size, she could find a suitable human and make them grow to her size. Perhaps these people would react better if they were approached by one of their own kind. Cindy realized that she would need to be careful with her choice of who to grow. After all, not everyone would have as good intentions as her. They could easily end up taking advantage of the size that she granted them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used her powers to search through the nearby human cities in order to find a suitable apprentice. Eventually, she found three different people who seemed to be reasonable options, she had always also wanted a daughter like figure so she narrowed it down to three choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Cathy a cute blonde 6 year old who was short for six but seemingly exceedingly kind and energetic she had been seen helping an elderly woman across a busy street despite her age age and size when Cindy observed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond was Amy a cute 8 year old also blonde and equally as kind as Cathy but also woefully short for her age. Cindy observed her struggling to carry groceries to a Senior Citizens Care Home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird and lastly was Lily a cute 9 year old as kind as the last two with Auburn hair and green eyes not unlike the other two girls but again short for her age. Somehow despite being bullied more than other two combined at school, by bullies as well as by family she somehow remained kind though secretly wishing her older brother and sister would at least not pick on her. Cindy found her struggling to volunteer at the homeless shelter doing little things like giving out sandwiches and snacks<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it was a hard choice but Cindy chose....</span></div></div>",

See you later!\" She then walked off with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so gentle.\" A voice spoke in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\" Cathy looked around. \"Huh...\" She shrugged and began walking once more. Cindy exited her ship making herself and the ship invisible as she slowly descended landing on the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear child, would you be willing to help ALL human?\" Cindy's voice once more reached Cathy's mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhhhhh she looked around again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm speaking to you via telepathy.\" Cathy was confused by the word. \"It means to your mind, my thoughts reach your mind, you merely need to think to speak to me child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy thought to herself \"Like this? Can you hear me uh...Ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that is perfect! My name is Cindy my dear, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cathy it's a pleasure to meet you Ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you may call me Cindy dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...a bit odd calling an adult by their first name Ma'am. It will take time for me to get used to.\" Cathy was unsure but she did enjoy talking to this woman (Or who she assumed was another human somehow)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how about 'Teacher' that is if you accept my offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About helping humans? Oh and uh...what or where are you?\" Cathy looked around some more \"I'm sorry I didn't-\" She was cut off by Cindy's gentle laughter which oddly made Cathy smile. It was heartwarming actually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm an alien, I know it's hard to believe.\" Cathy nodded. \"Well take a look up for me then dear?\" Cathy did so then took a step back in shock, the 100ft woman was terrifying but only for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-can't anyone else see you?\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just you, my technology allows me to chose who I reveal myself to based on DNA sequences and-\" She stopped when she saw Cathy's look of confusion. \"The short version is I am here to help humanity, however...there's a problem, I cannot shrink myself any smaller than this, and if others saw me they would likely be terrified of me, I do not want that, I do not wish to harm anyone either, so, what I want to do is make you, a human grow, you'll be a VERY tall girl. Then I will tell you what to say to them along with the do's and don't with your new size. Of course you do not have to accept this. i won't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big will I be?!\" Cathy chirped excited. \"Sorry, that was rude!\" She sighed. \"I'm really sorry Ma'am\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's fine, you're excited and this is new to you, if you do not mind, I am going to teleport you outside the city, that is if you wish to grow!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES PLEASE!!!\" Cathy almost yelled aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent and thank you for accepting this. It's very helpful.\"</span></div></div>",

She had always been seen by Cindy volunteering to help the teachers out and was seen as teachers pet and \"A Goody Two Shoes\" by her peers for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond was a unique thing Cindy encountered, A Pair of twins that she might both make her apprentices. Tracy and Stacy were identical twin blonde 12 year old with green eyes    and both were well endowed for their age Tracy having B Cup breasts and Stacy nearly a C Cup despite them having average height for their ages. Tracy was more of of tomboy while Stacy was the girly girl but both were exceedingly kind. The two having just outgrown the girl scouts volunteered to be the pilots for the local troops Junior Head Scout/Troop Leader Training Program as well as donating their rare blood type blood to local blood drives on occasion with parental consent of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird and last was Lizzy a mousey type 12 year old red head with Hazel eyes  who was slightly tall and well endowed for her age with B nearly C cup breasts already however because she wore glasses and often had her nose in books she was seen as a nerd. That coupled with her slight shyness meant she had almost no friends.

Eventually, she found three different people who seemed to be reasonable choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Melissa, a beautiful 23 year old girl with a caring personality. She had long black hair that flowed straight down to her shoulders, and an impressive figure that would make many women jealous. She appeared to be a kindergarten teacher, and was taking great joy in seeing the smiles on her student's faces. The students flocked to her like baby ducks to their mother, and she made sure to pay attention to each of them. She was clearly someone who cared about others, and would make a fitting assistant for Cindy's quest to aid humanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond was Amy, a young woman at 19 years old. She was already fairly large compared to most other humans, standing at 6' 2'' tall. She was smiling while helping a young boy retrieve his kite from a tree as Cindy noticed her, which gave the impression of her being a very friendly girl. As for her appearance, she was a bit on the skinny side, as it appeared that all of her fat had been put into her huge DD breasts. Her blond hair was tied into a ponytail, and she had a single strand of hair hanging in front of her face. Over all, she was quite attractive, and her first impression left Cindy to assume she would make a good choice as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was Sandra, a gentle 20 year old woman. Her short red hair was kept out of her face with a sweatband, which she wore often. She always felt that she had to help out society, and put in a lot of time doing volunteer work. Due to the outdoor activities involved in this, she had a light tan and fairly toned muscles. She didn't look like a bodybuilder by any means, but her physique was still very well maintained. The only thing she hated about her body was her small bust size. Her boobs were on par with an elementary school student, and she got depressed easily when this topic was brought up. Over all, her appearance made her look a bit like a tomboy. Despite this, her personality was anything but. She was a caring woman who loved to help others. She might have been the best choice of the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of contemplation, Cindy decides to enlarge _______________, and take her on as her apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was nothing the goddess loved and respected more then someone who put others above themselves, Sandra was just that and it was clear she was meant to be Cindy's apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly question was how would Cindy get her attention? She could simply reach out and speak to her telepathically but Cindy was wise to know that Sandra may freak out if she started hearing voices in her head. So instead she waited watching the redhead go through her day. Volunteer work, doing her elderly neighbor a kindness and planting a flower or two, and finally babysitting the daughter of her across the street neighbor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled pleased and impressed with all the act of kindness Sandra had accomplished during her day. She had definitely chosen the right person. Meanwhile the redhead stretched her tired arms and she entered her small home. It was tiring work but her heart was in the right place so Sandra couldn't complain. Removing her signature sweatband allowing her short locks to sway free the young woman prepared to take a quick bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh\" The soothing feel of the water all across her fit form felt divine. Closing her eyes it was almost as if she could lose herself in the bath. Her body and mind completely relaxed at the moment. Cindy quickly realizing this was a great opportunity for her to speak with Sandra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, young Sandra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected the redhead was rather surprised when she heard Cindy's call out to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra was a kind person but once she had build up her muscles a bit she took it to the next level of learning some self-defense. Just because she a friend to everyone didn't mean she couldn't kick your backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologizes if I startled you. My intentions are not evil nor do I intent you any harm but I do need you or listen to what I have to say and keep your mind open to what I have to tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious yet understandingly not entirely trusting of Cindy Sandra decided to play along for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent now let me explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Cindy went on to explain how she had come to earth and how she had come across and chosen Sandra as her potential apprentice. It was an unbelievable tale yet oddly Sandra found herself believing in the otherworldly voice of the goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she needed some proof to Cindy's claims.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy had arrived on earth less than a day ago, but she was already enjoying herself by destroying a small city near the area where she landed. She had just finished her conquest of this city. It was relatively easy for her to do, but it had taken her quite some time to get these puny humans to submit to her. She was irritated by how long it took her to take over one measly city, and didn't even want to think about how long it would take her to become ruler of the entire planet! If it took her almost a full day to bring a small city to its knees, then a larger one might actually pose a challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that there was nothing that these humans could do to harm her, but the fact that they kept putting up these useless struggles against her and refusing to surrender meant that taking over the tiny planet wouldn't be as easy as she once thought. She had expected that they would simply cower in fear at the sight of her and surrender immediately to save themselves from destruction. She didn't particularly want to have to do any hard work to make the world hers. She decided that if she was going to have to spend so much time knocking some sense into this pathetically stubborn species, she would need some help to make things a bit easier. She scanned the wreckage of the city to find a person who she could take under her wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter searching or several minutes, a particular human caught her eye. She was a blond woman with a fairly large bust and a beautiful figure, who appeared to be about 20 years old. Her flawless appearance wasn't what grabbed Cindy's attention, however. It was what she was doing that interested her: This blond bombshell was in the middle of a dark alley, surrounded by four men, and was single-handedly beating the crap out of them! She had already knocked three of them unconscious, and had the fourth man in a scissor-hold. Cindy walked closer to observe as this woman had her legs wrapped tightly around the helpless man's neck. The man eventually lost consciousness just like his partners had, and the woman stood over him triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That's what you get for underestimating me! Remember to bring at least twice as many guys next time if you want to even have a chance of bringing me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the woman finished up her victory speech, the sound of someone clapping grabbed her attention. She turned around to stare up at the massive form of the giantess who had just leveled the city. Most people would have been terrified by this sight, but she simply smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, aren't you the one who destroyed this city?  What do you want with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy simply chuckled at the tiny woman. The vicious attitude, the fearlessness, and gorgeous to boot! She really liked this one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to say, human, I'm impressed. Not only did you take out four men at once, but you even had the courage to stand up to me! Yes, I think that you're <i>exactly</i> what I'm looking for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite simple, little human. I want to take you on as my apprentice. Join me in my conquest of this puny planet, &amp; you can rule by my side and crush all who dare to oppose you! Just imagine the power that I can give you! You could be-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was then cut off by the woman's quick response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck! No need to try and convince me! This sounds like a whole lot of fun! Where do I sign up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha! I like your style little human... Tell me, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Alyssa. And you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Cindy. And from now on you shall be Goddess Alyssa, my loyal second in command!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy then extended her hand toward Alyssa. Her hand suddenly began glowing, and Alyssa's body began to grow. Within moments, Alyssa had grown to the same size as Cindy herself: an incredible 100 feet tall! She spent a moment to take in the sights at her new size, and then turned to Cindy. She reached out to give her a handshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cindy, I think that you and me are gonna become great friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more, my apprentice. Now, shall we get started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Let's bring this world to its knees!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo then walked out of the city. Alyssa took the time to knock over her first building before they left. She was amazed at how easy it was, and Cindy giggled at how her apprentice seemed to be born for this sort of thing. She then says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your people are quite the resilient little bugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Cindy, don't ever loop me in with those weak little insects ever again,\" Alyssa demanded. \"I <i>was</i> human, but I have ascended into a goddess now. Now, these little humans are nothing but annoying pests that don't deserve to gaze upon my ascended form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My word, Alyssa, you shall make a fine goddess indeed!\" Cindy praised. \"Now, as I was saying, I wish to rule over this world as soon as possible, so I think a more <i>intimidating</i> figure is needed, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course! Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith but a simple thought, Cindy focused on both her own and Alyssa's bodies and began to infuse them with her own mystical energy. Once the connection had been established, the original giantess sighed in pleasure as she broke her focus, causing her and her apprentice to rapidly climb in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bow before your goddesses, you insignificant germs!\" Alyssa commanded as she watched the city shrink before her very eyes. The humans within the city merely looked up in both shock and awe as both girls grew taller and taller with ease, their increasing shadows slowly beginning to cover sections of the city in a wave of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 30 seconds of solid expansion, the two women's growth spurts came to a halt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now <i>this</i> is more like it!\" Alyssa laughed as she glared down at the minuscule city before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This size will do nicely...for now at least,\" Cindy chuckled sinisterly. \"I should've been this large right from the beginning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya know, Cindy,\" the beautiful blonde goddess began, \"we have an old saying on this planet: 'Bigger. Is. Better.'\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's such a wonderful little quote, dear,\" the stronger being giggled. \"I do hope this'll be enough. I made us equivalent to 750 feet tall in your Earth measurements. We should have no problem bending this world to our will now. And of course, if ever the need arises, we shall become even stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect! Now, shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's!\"</span></div></div>",

She didn't pay any attention to the screams of the helpless citizens below her as she squashed the neighborhood to pulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little worms are no match for me, hahaha! I used to be the same size as you, scumbags... Well, now I am a goddess to all of you! As such, I expect you to bow down to me and submit to will; if there are any of you bugs left, that is!\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she noticed a big highway full of fleeing citizens in their cars and any other vehicle they could find, escaping the increasing destruction. Crouching down in the newly created ruins and resting her black leather gloved left hand on a nearby factory which inevitably collapsed, she bent down to look closer at the fleeing insects in their vehicles, each insect no more than half inch high in their inch and a bit long tin boxes. She got so close that the terrified people could smell the leather of her skin tight catsuit and the aroma of her very obvious cleavage. The next thing that happened surprised even her, though she enjoyed watching it happen all the same. As she leaned over, the pendant she was wearing around her neck swung and crashed into several of the fleeing cars, taking many out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's sooooo cooool!\" She purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then karate chopped the highway, creating a big chasm in the road with cracks either side. The vibrations caused many nearby structures to collapse. She then swept her gloved hand towards her, causing numerous cars and other objects to pile up against the advancing black wall. The speed of the casual sweep caused many cars to fly through the air and explode in impact with whatever they landed on. The sweep was over very quickly and as the noise started settling down the air was filled with laughter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy couldn't believe her eyes. Her new protege was taking to conquest like a duck to water, and she really seemed to be enjoying it! She was one of them not very long before, but now she was relentlessly destroying everything in sight! Alyssa now stood there, her latex clad arms folded across her ample chest, which lifted up her cleavage that was already straining against her latex corset. Her platform boots themselves were buried in the remains of some neighborhood houses... Both Alyssa and Cindy simply looked around at the destruction and marveled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>'Well' Cindy thought, 'I have made an excellent choice,'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a hand of fleeing people in her hand. Her eyes glued to Alyssa, she continued to watch the new giantess. At the moment, a new helicopter was slowly being flattened inch by inch between her fingers. Grabbing a couple minuscule humans in her hands, Cindy meditatively chewed on them. She would keep watching Alyssa for a while. After all, she could always join in at any time. Laughing silently to herself, she consumed a few more human popcorn pieces and contentedly demolished a house with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was happier than she'd ever been in her life. She'd craved power from day one, and now that she had it she didn't hold back. Entire blocks demolished beneath her feet. Skyscrapers smashed to pieces. She lovingly recreated scenes from every giant monster movie she'd ever seen. After an initial moment of hesitance, she devoured two people she'd caught on a rooftop. The moment of indecision puzzled her. She'd already massacred hundreds, probably thousands of tiny people. Why did two more matter? But the second they hit her tongue, doubts vanished. Two tinies squirming, liable to be crushed by merely her tongue? This was truly all the power she'd ever wanted. Alyssa savored their taste as she swallowed them, and her last vestiges of guilt, alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n After that moment, she poured as many as she could into her mouth. The taste, texture, and tingling as they frantically fought for their lives inside her mouth was too much to pass up. But finally, her hunger was slaked. Alyssa was so stuffed, she couldn't even force her current handful into her mouth. Instead, she closed her fist, giggling at the blood oozing from her clenched fingers. She sat down. Cindy was almost entirely forgotten in her excitement. And the excitement didn't let her rest. The moment her supple ass touched the ground, instantly compacting the vehicles below, she felt a need to see and feel tiny people die by her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a brilliant idea sprang to mind, inspired by her pendant. Alyssa rose, her tight latex clothing giving off squeaks with every movement. She strode over to the nearest highway, bulldozing through a skyscraper that had yet to fall to her monster movie antics. She deemed the eight land highway suitably full, the understatement of the century. Alyssa placed an enormous black shoe on either side of the road, gazing happily down at the terrified people below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an earth-shaking thud, she dropped to her knees. Then she pushed them outward, through buildings and factories on the sides of the highway until she felt her bottom connect with the highway. The people running appeared a little larger now. Their expressions caused Alyssa another spurt of giggling. Sobering, she began her next move. She slowly lowered her chest towards a particularly dense cluster of cars and refugees. She inhaled sharply as her enormous mounds softly gave way before street signs and lights before snapping them from their mounts in the concrete. The tiny people still fled, even though their fate was as good as sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Feeling a different kind of excitement, Alyssa moaned as she felt the first gentle brush of cars on the tips of her latex-clad breasts. She savored each groan of tortured metal as her two 3,800 pound boobs pressed down on them. Just barely restraining herself, Alyssa forced her descent to remain slow. She felt cars give way, their roofs caving in, tires popping, suspensions breaking, metal twisting outward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she let out a barely muffled cry as she heard the screaming end, and tiny forms go *pop pop pop* against the thin material of her clothes. At long last, she felt the strong press of concrete and earth beneath her titanic breasts. Enough of her sanity returned for normal functioning to resume. She realized she was soaking wet. Apparently, she'd found that more fun than she'd realized. Secondly, she heard Cindy clapping in the background. Both the giantesses rose, and Cindy walked over to Alyssa. Both looking very excited, Cindy confronted the new goddess and said...</span></div></div>",

A shame for her because her juices were really going and her saliva was going too as she was savouring eating it like a cake with delicious filling. She turned round warily, what she saw next made her jaw drop. It was Cindy, but MUCH taller......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\", was all Alyssa could manage. Cindy was standing there, gloved hands on latex clad hips, legs astride, boots amidst carnage (the crash had been a city block crushed with one stomp from her now 1,200ft form). Her ears were twitching and she was looking stern. Not angry really, more like the way a teacher would glare at a naughty pupil to set them straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me? You've been having so much fun... Aren't we supposed to be doing this together? And you ARE my apprentice. You're very good but.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy couldn't believe what she saw next, she was sure Alyssa's lip began to quiver and her expression of shock was priceless... For the first time since they met, Cindy was seeing a look of fear on Alyssa's face. Cindy smiled a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, my baby. I didn't want to startle you, but destroying this pathetic planet was my plan. I'm just not going to settle for being left out of my own plans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 now unequally sized giantesses met in the middle, of course laying waste where their boots fell. Cindy took hold of Alyssa, and Alyssa pressed her face into Cindy's latex clad boobs and sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm so sorry, I'm so so, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was melting Cindy's heart. Her apprentice was not only the perfect killing machine, but also had a surprisingly cute side to her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, baby. Don't worry one bit, you're doing amazingly. Just to show no hard feelings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy then passed Alyssa a handful of fully laden airliners she had picked up from the airport, while destroying it in an idle moment while wondering how to attract Alyssa's attention while she was so carried away in her destruction. Cindy had began to really grow fond of this fiery, impetuous, beautiful girl that she had plucked from the mass of humanity she wanted to annihilate. Not only for her merciless nature and her ability to kill her own kind without hesitation, but also for this new side of her as well. She was almost like a young daughter, yearning to earn her mother's approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...it looks like you need something to eat\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alyssa looked up, red faced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" she said between tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She took the airliners and started eating them. Her perfect teeth cut through the metal so easily with a satisfying crunch, but it was the filling. So much so that by the third she snapped it in half and tipped the 500 or so people bit by bit into her mouth before consuming the casing. Meanwhile Cindy looked on, smiling, arms folded across her ample chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alyssa hungrily consumed the snacks she felt strange, could she possibly be... growing? A quick look at Cindy confirmed this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she grew the snacks became easier to consume more quickly. More importantly, another thing was happening, Alyssa's facial expression and body language was changing, she started smiling at Cindy as she ate, an increasingly lustful sexy smile as she started swaying her body. Cindy liked this and she started feeling things welling up in her as well. It came to the last airliner and instead of eating it, Alyssa took it, and sexily crushed it in her gloved fist and let the tiny people drop down her cleavage. Those that survived the initial fall were promptly smeared over her outfit around her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was now at 1,200 feet, the same as Cindy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, baby, now let's go kick the shit out of this place!\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two goddesses smiled at eachother and began to demolish block after block of buildings. As they continued to crush more and more lives beneath their feet, Cindy paused and noticed a large number of people fleeing toward a nearby stadium. A devilish smirk spread across her face as she gave her apprentice an order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alyssa, get down on your hands and knees! I want to see your boobs squish that stadium full of people trying to hide for shelter! Hahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa smirked deviously as she happily followed her master's order. Kneeling down, she allowed her bountiful breasts to press up against the roof of the stadium. Ever so slowly she continued to apply more and more pressure, until finally the weight of her chest became too much for the building to take. The stadium quickly caved in, and thousands of lives were instantly ended by the latex-clad breasts of the stunningly beautiful woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses simply laughed as Alyssa carelessly brushed the debris off of her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of this was much to the amusement of both girls. The remaining skyscrapers Alyssa, put between her boobs and squeezed them with her gloved hands watching them splinter. She knew this aroused Cindy, and she looked at her with sultry eyes, and Cindy knew that she knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's wipe this fucking place off the face of the earth!\" said Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Let's kill all of these little bastards!\" replied Alyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just love the way you speak, darling.\" Cindy said, sliding her latex clad arm around Alyssa's trim waist. \"Now, let's go and destroy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked off together, grinding everything in their path to dust and rubble, Alyssa even pushed a few more nearby skyscrapers over, accompanied by girlish laughs, Cindy responding by kicking an intersection filled with dozens of escaping cars, before stomping on the wreckage, you could even see the smears of squashed bugs. BOOM!, a stepped on petrol station, CRASH!  a boot through a mall, CRUNCH! a factory demolished in an instant. The two of them crouched down and poked or swept away hundreds of houses with their gloved hands, the sounds they made as a giant finger bore down them was exquisite to their ears. Cindy asked Alyssa to sit on an ancient amphitheater. Following her master's orders, Alyssa sat down and crushed the entire structure beneath her fine ass. As soon as she stood back up, her latex clad rear end was covered in rubble and blood stains, which Cindy promptly wiped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was the biggest structure in town, which they approached from either side and met in the middle, latex clad boobs touching as they had scythed through the structure and met up. This was electric and as the debris fell off their latex clad forms they looked at each other with desiring eyes, they embraced and kissed passionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like several minutes of this, they finished, there was electricity between them, and without a spoken word, smiled and started destroying with new vigor, new abandon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresently after many more square miles of devastation and more millions of deaths, they paused. Sitting down on a large public park, crushing hundreds of trees and their legs destroying neighboring streets, some all over again, as they stretched out, there was relative quiet. The remaining inhabitants breathed a sigh of relief at the pause, was it all over?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo was the answer...</span></div></div>",

They were the new mistresses of this world that they were gradually destroying around them. Suddenly they heard a low rumbling noise somewhere off in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is that?\" Cindy said lazily as they both turned round to have a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, it's the fucking military! I wondered when the hell they would turn up!\" Alyssa replied, resting her gloved hand on a the wreckage of a nearby public library, supporting herself as she got up to her full height. \"About time too, you wankers!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck me, it is too!\" Cindy said, slightly surprised, after she had also got up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other as Cindy said that, and Cindy couldn't help but notice a hint of lust in Alyssa's eyes......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them turned around, arms folded across their bountiful chests, and stood up to their full height as they looked down at the scene before them... The mostly destroyed city was swarming with hundreds of thousands of soldiers and tanks, and there were an equal number of planes flying overhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the two girls could do was giggle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a yawn, Cindy said quietly \"Let's get them. There can be no mercy for anyone foolish enough to oppose us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Alyssa cheered as they both, arms still folded across their chests, sauntered across their previous devastation, boots crashing down afresh at every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The military started firing everything they had at the girls, but they hardly noticed as they casually strolled over the first and second lines of tanks and squashed thousands of men without really noticing, or caring. As she walked by, Alyssa spat out the gum that she was chewing, and the colossal pink wad crashed down like a meteor on the helpless military, putting several artillery pieces out of action and trapping hundreds of soldiers within a sticky pink prison. The only real irritation was the planes firing missiles on their bare skin around their cleavage, necks and faces. These felt like small pinpricks, but nothing that a few sweeps of gloved hands couldn't stop as they casually swatted squadrons of planes out of the sky like so many gnats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then strolled up to what looked like the senior commanders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing and nobody is going to stop us from wrecking this feeble planet of yours, least of all you! So get out of our fucking way and leave us to destroy your world in peace, you insignificant scum!\" Cindy said commandingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We're going to kill you all either way, so it'd be in your best interest to leave us alone and go on living your meaningless little lives until we finally come around to crush you ourselves. Of course, if you fucks really do want to die that badly, then by all means, keep shooting your pathetic little toy guns at us. We'd be more than happy to finish you all off right here and now if you're really that fucking stupid!\" Alyssa said with a cruel and devious smirk on her beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just to emphasize their point, as soon as Alyssa had finished speaking, Cindy lazily swung her booted foot into a nearby building and caused the entire structure to collapse with the most casual tap of her gigantic foot. The falling building came crashing down directly on top of the military forces, and when the dust settled there were hundreds of dead soldiers buried under the rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa looked at her master admiringly, \"That was so fucking cool the way you did that!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giantesses then put their arms around eachother's shoulders and laughed before glaring down dominatingly at the powerless military. Knowing now that they had failed, that there was no way that they could possibly stop these two giant goddesses from doing whatever they pleased, the remaining military forces turned tail and began to retreat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as they all hated it, as much as it tore them apart on the inside, they knew that what the girls said was right. Stopping them was impossible. These girls were going to destroy the entire world, and human weaponry had absolutely no effect on them whatsoever. They couldn't be stopped, so rather than throw away their lives in a futile effort to fight against their fate, it would be better to simply accept the inevitable and be allowed to live, even if only for a few more days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the once-proud military fleeing from them like dogs with their tails tucked between their legs, the two girls began to laugh victoriously. Cindy then leaned her head in next to Alyssa's and whispered into her apprentice's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, we don't need to honor our promise to those fools. Just because we said we'd let them live if they surrendered doesn't mean we can't turn around and crush them like the bugs they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's face turned to a twisted smile as she realized the truth behind her master's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"YEAH! Let's smash those motherfuckers, fucking annihilate them, slaughter the little shits, beat the fucking crap out of them!\" Alyssa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master and apprentice duo nodded to eachother in agreement before quickly pursuing the fleeing military. With only a single step they closed the gap between them and their prey. In the span of a few seconds, they had completely smashed almost every single artillery piece, tank, plane, and footsoldier among them into a field of mangled corpses and unrecognizable scrap metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was getting really carried away with this and she carelessly smashed a nearby dam with one of her stomps, sending cascades of water to drown and wash away the remainder of the troops, as well as a few villages in the nearby valley. Alyssa glanced at Cindy briefly, almost as if she was seeking approval. She really needn't have worried. Cindy bit her lip, Alyssa's act was a real turn on for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fucking great, girl! You did well!\" she said as she strolled up across the landscape and put her latex clad arm round Alyssa's waist and gave a playful squeeze, \"I love you, baby...\", before they kissed each other full on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they just stood there gazing almost awestruck at the devastation they had wrought. A city of more than 250 square miles and 20 million people, reduced to little more than a smoking ruin in their wake. Plus they had effortlessly destroyed the country's entire military to boot. Their faces turned into beaming smiles of satisfaction, it gave them such a rush, a high, to be mistresses of the planet, destroying it as they pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think that I used to be one of those pathetic vermin down there... Now I can have them all groveling at my feet and then squash them like the worthless little bugs they are. Hahahaha!\" Alyssa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and what a good job you have done, my darling Alyssa... Now, let's do some more, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, yeah! Let's!\" Alyssa agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look around us, my dear. See all that land, those towns, the cities, the entire countryside?\" Cindy waved her gloved hand pointing it out, \"It all belongs to us. It's ours and ours alone, and we are free to do with it whatever we please. And you know what that means, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that we're gonna tear all that shit apart! Destroy everything! Show all those worms who their new goddesses are!\" Alyssa answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled at her apprentice and patted her on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct, my dear. So, why don't we make a competition out of it. Whoever can cause the most destruction and slaughter the most bugs in the next half hour will get to have first go with that dockyard in the distance. It will be such great fun breaking apart those ships.\" said Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sadistic smile spread across Alyssa's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it...\" she said in a sultry tone.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they turned round to face each other, their eyes met again, Alyssa's large cute eyes looked longing and dolefully at Cindy's, melting her heart. \"I fucking love you, baby\", Cindy said........\"before we have our little race, I would love to.......G*d, I'm dying for a piss!\".....and she did just that. Pulling down her tight latex trousers she squatted and let out torrents of warm yellow pee onto the landscape below. Any remaining structures were washed away as the stream gouged great holes in the ground. Alyssa could only look on open mouthed in admiration. \"Come closer, darling\", said Cindy. Alyssa trotted over squashing everything under booted foot and as she got close Cindy grabbed Alyssa's latex gloved hand and thrust it between her legs as she was peeing soaking Alyssa's glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa was so tempted to go further between Cindy's legs, but she hadn't known her mistress for long, and what if she resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can taste it if you want\" was Cindy's next comment. Gingerly Alyssa pulled her glove away and towards her own mouth. \"Go on, it's quite safe\", Cindy joked as the last dribble of pee came out and she pulled her trousers up and stood to her full height. Alyssa had eaten tiny bugs and smeared them over herself as well but to drink from Cindy's body.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting her eyes, she drank it. Cindy looked on approvingly as a little bit dripped down Alyssa's dimpled face out of the corner of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's face was a picture, opening her eyes wide, she beamed. \"OMG, that was fucking amazing! It's like nectar........oh shit that WAS GOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can do more of this later\", Cindy smiled, \"meanwhile here's a little snack for our task ahead, nice and fresh...as she had scooped up a mush of humanity trapped trying to escape, Cindy had destroyed their way of escape and drowned them when she peed. She opened up her gloved hand revealing a handful of red mush mixed with her pee, Alyssa loving the way it dripped from Cindy's latex glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I so fucking love you baby\", she said again, \"I would love to see you kneel down and sup from my hand, lick it up greedily, have some more of my power\". Alyssa knew exactly what to do as her latex clad knees crashed down on a power plant and how much it turned Cindy on, so ravenously and carelessly she fed from Cindy's hand licking everything from her latex fingers and making sure a certain amount dripped down her cleavage. Cindy bent down and softly kissed Alyssa's lustrous tress-clad head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe planet was their plaything to do with what they please and indulge themselves in every way and their next acts proved this in every way as if on cue both girls at the same time started racing each other across the landscape, pounding bootsteps taking out towns and villages, powerlines, farms, roads.......when they started getting out of breath they looked at each other and then separately started the pillage and slaughter of the land, as Cindy had suggested. While Cindy wrecked another airport, Alyssa was strolling down a river valley, carelessly scything through every bridge almost without noticing, Cindy smashed a nuclear facility, Alyssa crushed a coalmine, Cindy scrunched up a traffic intersection with her gloved hands, while Alyssa crushed a huge suburb under gloved palms, Cindy toppled a small mountain, while Alyssa toppled another dam, giving herself a soaking as she did so, which got some debris off. as Cindy destroyed a large factory, she couldn't but notice Alyssa sitting sensually on another stadium. This was another eyes meet moment as Alyssa was hoping Cindy would notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis death and destruction went on for many minutes when suddenly Cindy having crushed a petrol refinery with resulting huge explosions noticed that it was quiet in Alyssa's direction. She looked round and saw Alyssa kneeling down, her tight latex clad backside and back facing her and her lustrous locks cascading down her latex clad back, her arms were moving, she was doing something, but what? Cindy decided to investigate.....on tiptoes she stepped across the landscape to see what was happening.............. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You made me jump out of my fucking skin!\", Alyssa exclaimed as she visibly jolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry darling, I just wanted to see what you were doing\", she whispered in her ear giving it a quick peck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy looked and her eyes opened wide. All around were smashed up train carriages and torn up tracks and Alyssa was crushing more trains carriage by carriage with her gloved hands. There had been a bloodbath as many of the carriages had been full of people and you could see the blood mingling with the wreckage. Blood spattered Alyssa's outfit as well and her lips were blood red and dripping, she had been feeding, crushing the carriages like nutshells and consuming the contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG! This looks fucking awesome, baby! Could I join in? I LOVE playing trains\",<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, go ahead, you're the boss\", said Alyssa with a smile. \"Those little shits are so fucking tasty, I'm stuffed. G*d this is such a fucking turn on, I want to play with my pussy\". Cindy looked round and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me help you, baby\", Cindy said as she started rubbing the latex between Alyssa's legs and then undoing the zip. At the same time she was taking handfuls of railway debris and squashing it over her own chest and cleavage as her own pussy started throbbing, assisted by Alyssa\u2019s dextrous gloved fingers\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck! Fuck! Aaaaaah!\", the orgasm was tremendous as they both climaxed at the same time, their lithe latex clad bodies squirming over the landscape devastating it further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lay there in each other\u2019s arms, they were so comfortable with each other as they caressed each other's latex clad forms. The remains of 1000s upon 1000s of people lay all around, many squished to paste and merging with the remains of another once bustling city. Debris was everywhere, smashed trains, buildings, roads, power lines, cars, all that made up a modern city. The 2 giantesses didn\u2019t give a shit, to use their phrase, it was their calling to wreck and destroy, to terminate all they touch. Conqueror Cindy had found a soul mate in this (and more) in Alyssa, and she was from the very planet they were laying waste to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaaaaah, that was soooo good\u201d, said Cindy lazily as she stroked Alyssa\u2019s blood spattered latex clad front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, fucking amazing!\u201d, was Alyssa\u2019s response, \u201cthough I could do with a fucking piss right now\u2026.. Shit, shit. Shit! OMG I\u2019m fucking leaking!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPiss on me darling, then fuck me again my gorgeous, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me\u2026\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my mistress\u201d, said Alyssa, a cross between genuine obedience and equality. With a knowing glance Alyssa climbed on Cindy\u2019s reclining latex clad form and quickly undoing the zip covering her dripping pussy again, she let her hot yellow pee flow all over Cindy. Alyssa couldn\u2019t help massaging Cindy, swishing the pee around, and indeed fingering Cindy just as she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my G******d!\u201d, encapsulated Cindy\u2019s ecstasy, as Alyssa was all over Cindy, completely satisfying her\u2026\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn due course this was over and the 2 of them started chatting as they again lazily lay there in the ruins of a million people.<br>\r\n\u201cWe were going to smash some ships, weren\u2019t we?\u201d, said Cindy, \u201clet\u2019s go over there together\u2026..\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOMG! Look at us, we both need a fucking wash!\u201d, said Alyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit!\u201d, laughed Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both got up and brushed each other down, removing much of the debris, but pee and gore weren\u2019t so easy and gloved hand in gloved hand crashed their way across the landscape, heavy bootsteps mangling everything in their way. The fresh sounds of destruction at their feet pleased the 2 of them no end as they sauntered towards the port city of 10 million people\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You're the best fucking thing that has happened to me, no shit! Now let's smash this fucking place, fucking obliterate it, smash the fuckers and their shithole city to fucking smithereens!\". Alyssa was on a roll, her impulsiveness was coming out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, baby....\". Cindy wanted to calm her fiery new lover down, after all Alyssa was the apprentice and needed Cindy's guidance, yet....there was something in Cindy that was really turned on when Alyssa did let loose in this puny planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\", pouted Alyssa. \"Don't you want to see your baby smash stuff, smash her own planet, slaughter millions of people that were her fellow human beings? Eeeeeeew! That's fucking gross, those assholes below being my equals\", she spat in disgust demolishing a couple of apartment blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow their booted feet there was pandemonium, as the 2 goddesses stood still for a moment the population tried to use the window of opportunity to escape, in places dicey as Alyssa could not keep still for long, as her heavy booted feet moved things were squashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Alyssa turned to Cindy. \"There is something missing, where is the fucking military? No sign of them..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah, pre-planning and preparation, darling\", cooed Cindy. While I was looking for somebody to help me conquer this planet, I was laying waste to the military in each country as I went, this country no exception,  the funniest was the crushing of the nuclear submarines, heehee, so we can do what we like baby, destroy at will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking cool\", replied Alyssa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....tell you what next country we conquer, I will show you how to do it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlyssa's eyes lit up, \"really? That would be fucking amazing, killing the little shits and smashing their equipment!\". In excitement she aimed a kick, levelling a city block. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's destroy this fucking place\", replied Cindy, reverting to using her apprentice and lover's expletive laden speech, she found it sooooo sexy.</span></div></div>",

She was about 5`7 tall, with dirty blonde hair and sparkling, light blue eyes. Her long slender legs led up to a body that most women would kill for, and she was the biggest bitch in the city. She absolutely loved to manipulate men to do her bidding using her flawless looks. Cindy had observed her once as she was pulling her BMW into the parking lot of the school; instead of choosing an empty space she took the nearest one to the building - occupied by a scooter. The scooter did not had a chance as the SUV simply rolled it over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha just got out and walked into the building as if nothing had even happened. She later made the owner pay for the damage on her car with the threat that he would join his precious scooter if he didn't. She had tricked some football players into beating up a nerd just for looking at her on several occasions, and she easily destroyed the reputations of anyone who had ever talked badly about her. Once she even ambushed a girl, 5 years younger than herself, with her clique of 4 other girls while in the restroom. They had beaten her up, crushed everything she had with her - including her purse and her brand new iPad - and flushed her cell phone down the toilet. They ripped off her shirt and started to cut it into pieces. It was the same she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young woman this heartless was the perfect guard for her new planet. But how would Cindy go about making Samantha become her apprentice?</span></div></div>",

Samantha was on the way to her car, alone as she heard a voice in her head to turn around. It was the voice of an angel with commanding effects. She had no other choice than to do as it said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Samantha.\" the young women said in a soft voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the same voice she heard before. The same voice that told her to turn around. The women was beautiful - even Samantha had to admit that. Probably even more than she was. The feeling of hatred came up in her. How did this women dared to be prettier than she was?! Cindy smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't hate me for what I am.\" She said gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it short.\" was Samantha's harsh response to the lady she didn't like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have chosen you to be the one to protect my belongings.\" She said calmly. \"I want to make you a present. Something you desire most above everything\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love presents. Give it to me and maybe I'll like it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not that easy, Samantha. Your life will change completely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. I like my life as it is. Goodbye.\" Sam turned around and walked to her car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\" she heard the voice in her head again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap! I'm leaving!\" she yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you understand that I am a divine being? You are nothing compared to me, but I am willing to give you power for your own. You deserve it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A divine being?! Haha, don't make me laugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Is the voice in your head not proof enough?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarterback, Barren Stone, approached the two of them. Barren was the most popular guy in school but Sam treated him as some kind of security service. She just had to point someone out and he would have a problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Barry.\" She greeted him in her sweet charming voice, but his gaze was completely fixed onto the new girl. He walked straight up to the stranger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barren, darling. This women here is harassing me would you please... What the fuck?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarren knelt down in front of the women and bowed over that he could reach the muddy heel of the women. Without a word he started licking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems to know what I am.\" the women said casually. \"You won't need this shoelicker anymore if you take my present. In fact you have no choice.\" She lifted the sole of her shoe and immediately Barren tried to reach it with his tongue. Then he kissed the tip of her boot and got up. </span></div></div>",

Nobody but nobody was allowed to wear the same $500 leather jacket she had just splashed out on, where did they get the money? They must have stolen them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a cold day, just perfect for that jacket which she teamed with a cashmere scarf, black leather gloves, skin tight jeans which poured into her Louboutin boots she had for her 18th birthday. Her heels went clack clack on the pavement/sidewalk as she chatted away on her phone, totally ignoring everything around her, except shouting at people she had bumped into. Suddenly there was a great light that surrounded her and something quite extraordinary happened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew and grew and grew. Samantha was totally ignorant of what was going on, so absorbed in her conversation as she was, which for her surroundings had serious repercussions. As she approached 100 feet, it wasn't just clack clack but crunch crash as parked car after parked car was crushed by her strolling boots, interspersed with the crash of lamp posts coming down, as she was now too big for the sidewalk, not to mention the screams of panicking pedestrians and car drivers as they tried to get out of her way.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was delighted, Samantha was still showing no consideration for anything but herself and she was now truly destructively tall. Cindy's excitement increased further when Samantha stepped through a row of single story dwellings, wrecking them completely without breaking her stride. \"This has completely vindicated my choice of apprentice\", she smiled......</span></div></div>",

From her current 100ft size, she quickly doubled to 200ft tall. Then she was 300ft, then 400ft, and then 500ft. When her growth finally came to a stop, she was towering at a massive 600ft tall! All that time, Samantha simple strolled on. She was destroying everything before her obliviously as she was wrapped up in her phone call. Acres and acres of housing, shops, offices, and roads were all crushed beyond recognition under the soles of her massive high-heeled boots. Even when she passed by several skyscrapers, she just casually pushed them aside with her gloved hands, assuming in her self absorbed way that they were people who had dared get in her way as she walked. Cindy was delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Samantha's phone call came to an end, and she returned the phone to her bag. She had barely done so when she began to look around. Her face took on an expression of pure shock, and she quickly realized that something was different. She was huge now! The city below her looked so small in comparison to her mighty stature, and she could see a path of devastation which went right up to where she was standing. She soon dropped her bag, which crashed into a nearby shopping mall and nearly flattened it. Samantha simply stood there taking in the sight of everything around her, the look of shock never leaving her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then heard a voice in her head. It was a female voice, one that sounded like it belonged to somebody not much older than herself. Cindy was speaking to Samantha telepathically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Don't be afraid. There is nothing to be concerned about. My name is Cindy, and I'm the one who made you huge...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the crap?! Why?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it for a special reason. I want to rule this planet of yours, but I need somebody to help me. While I could take this world over by myself, a planet this big would take far too long to conquer all on my own. Besides, having someone along for the ride will make this much more fun! Anyway, I've been looking for somebody suitable to rule by my side, and you seem perfect for the job. Watching you as you unknowingly and uncaringly destroyed everything in your path was absolutely breathtaking! I would like to take you on as my apprentice. If you agree, then I can train you to become my equal, and we can dominate this pathetic planet of yours together! Just think of the unbridled power and control you can have! You would be free to do anything that you want. You would be a true goddess... So, how about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Samantha's response?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When do we start?!\" She cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now!\" Cindy said into Samantha's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sadistic grin, Samantha picked up a nearby bus full of people and looked inside, seeing the fear on their faces and laughing to herself as she slowly squashed the vehicle in her hand. She then carelessly tossed the ball of rubble away behind her, where it exploded into a nearby office block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly not far in front of her the traffic intersection collapsed as a figure appeared in front of her. It was a female figure, very beautiful, about the same height as her and seemingly the same age, the only strange thing was her ears... She was dressed in a silvery white catsuit with boots, belt, and purple elbow-length gloves that matched the color of her long silky hair. Even the normally-narcissistic Samantha had to admit that this woman was absolutely gorgeous. This was definitely not how she had imagined her new master to look based on her reputation as an interplanetary killing machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Cindy, destroyer of planets. I'm so glad that you've agreed to be my apprentice. I've been watching you for a long time. You may have even spoken to me, as I was posing as one of your kind for a while. You certainly have what it takes. Your amazing unrestricted destruction more than confirmed my choice, and watching you crush that bus... Mmmmmmm...\" There was something almost erotic about the mmmmm; the look of pleasure Samantha had when crushing the bus was really turning her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy approached Samantha, smashing everything in her path, and put her arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, come with me. I have much to show and teach you. From what I've seen of you, you'll certainly learn quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRASH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunch of 2 pair of giant boots crashing structures and vehicles alike was punctuated as Samantha pressed on a skyscraper with a gloved hand. The tight fitting black leather pressed against the plate glass of the windows until it began to crack and finally shatter altogether. Soon the entire building collapsed under the force of Samantha's palm, with everybody who hadn't yet escaped being crushed to death beneath the cascade of rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's my girl!\" Cindy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then slung her arm around Samantha's back, hugging her leather jacket clad waist.</span></div></div>",

Yeah...... That sounds cool\".........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrapping her purple gloved hand around a nearby skyscraper, she began her exhibition. Tearing it up carelessly scattering lots of tinies, Cindy played with it, moving it over her body, before it gave up the ghost and crumbled in her gloved hands. Every so often she looked over Sam whose mouth could be seen to be slightly open in awe. next she ripped up another building, this time squeezing it between her ample boobs, another she stepped on watching it collapse like a pack of cards, others she just trampled....cars were ground to scrap metal and people to paste......, she crushed trains and planes, she crawled through suburbs until nothing was left standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 20 minutes it was all over, as silence settled over the destroyed city, punctuated with fires burning out and final building collapses, Cindy gestured with her arms....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's how I do it...\" Cindy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG, that show was fucking brilliant!\", trilled Sam, \"This whole city is totally fucking wasted!\", she punched the ground, creating another tremor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, my baby\", Cindy gestured to Sam, and took her in her arms and gave her a big kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was such fun, It has been quite a bit of time since I smashed a whole city purely for fun......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", Sam replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fucking great\", said Cindy with a lowered voice. \"I have been so wrapped up in the conquest thing, the end, that I have forgotten a bit how to enjoy the means to that end\" The next thing Cindy said was equally a surprise to Sam, \"but thanks to you baby, I've rediscovered it, knowing that you were enjoying what I was doing, and the pleasure this gave me, mmmmm\", she touched herself. \"Now, let's find the next place to kick the shit out of on this fucking planet\", she said quietly and smilingly to Sam, \"and I'll give you some more tips, particularly on how to prepare a city to be smashed\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool!

Everyone assumed it was only a meteor so no further investigation was needed. But that meteor that fell was no mere meteor, but a spaceship for an alien goddess to come to Earth. An evil alien goddess. This being, Cindy as she was called, emerged from the meteor and rose to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked almost identical to a human but had chalk white skin with purple blotches forming a makeshift bikini on her and white ears. There was a gem encrusted in her forehead like that of a carbuncle of legend. She then snapped her fingers as she flew over the water and created a suit of purple armor on her body. Her eyes glow red as she shrinks to human size and flies off towards land. \"This world shall be the gem of my collection,\" she says. \"The thousandth planet to fall.\" Cindy snaps her fingers and a necklace appears on her body. The necklace is made of hundreds of planets shrunken to the size of marbles. These are the planets conquered by the alien goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Cindy rubs her chin and realizes something. \"But the last few conquests exhausted my army. I need a new army, but first I need a second in command. The second in command of a race of beasts. But the creatures of this planet are so small. I will have to create a new race of giantesses. This world has many creatures of legend. I know where I can find the perfect apprentice.\" Cindy flies to America, over a juvenile detention center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy perches herself on the top of the building and then she looks down to see it was a woman prison. Two of the inmates were fighting. A Hispanic looking girl with a eyepatch on and white hair with a red streak was fighting a blonde girl who was fighting harder. \"I say you're wrong!\" yells the Latina. \"You're the one who's wrong! I saw you rat me out! I would've been out of here if it weren't for you!\" yells the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy reads the minds of both the girls. \"The blonde girl is Daphne McAllister. Imprisoned for assault of hundreds of fellow students. A regular loose cannon with a volcanic temper. She has potential. But the other girl is Juantia Rojas. Imprisoned fro art theft and manufacturing illegal drugs. Now, which to choose as my apprentice. The brains or the brawns?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Cindy choose?</span></div></div>",

But she could use something to change her face.\" Cindy then makes her eyes glow as Daphne continues to stomp on Juanita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Daphne grabs herself by the head and groans, giving Juanita a chance to inch away slightly. \"Carumba!\" yells Juanita. \"What's happening.\" Daphne shrieks before she begins to change form. Her skin turns blue yellow as she becomes more muscular and her hair starts to turn into a bright yellow dorsal fin as her neck stretches out and she grows a lizard like tail. All the prisoners scream and run as Daphne grows bigger and bigger before she snarls and her eyes glow white. Fins appear on her arms as she looks around. Juanita inches back and screams before Daphne hisses at her. \"Hello there little squealer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuanita gets up and tries to run but Daphne snatches her up in her mouth and chews her up as the other convict screams. Daphne the newly transformed Loch Ness Monster lets out an evil laugh as the guards come after her with machine guns but one swing of Daphne's tail knocks them off their feet before Daphne starts to swallow them and her fellow convicts. Once Daphne is finished eating, she stretches out her neck and looks around herself. \"WHat's happened to me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy makes herself the same height of 300ft as Daphne and smiles at her. Daphne snarls but then Cindy starts to speak with her telepathically. \"Hello Daphne. Do not be afraid. I am the alien goddess Cindy and you have been chosen to be my apprentice as we conquer the Earth. I have converted you into a Loch Ness monster because I need powerful new lifeforms to help me take this world. You will rule alongside me over my collection of 1000 planets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne actually lets out an evil smile. \"Sounds like fun. She says.

By the time the spell is over, Juanita is a titanic cyclops. All the inmates are frozen in fear, but Daphne still wants a shot at Juanita. \"You're a snitch and a cheater Juanita! You won't get away with this!

How would you like to be the second in command to the woman who will rule over a thousand planets?\" Juanita rubs her chin. \"Intriguing. A higher lifeform with the power to phase shift living beings. I don't know whether to be in awe or terror. But it sounds intriguing.\" Cindy nods her head. \"But first there will be training.

It was Cindy, and she had come to the planet earth in order to conquer it. In the past, she had managed to conquer entire galaxies worth of planets with the help of the alien emperors fleets, and this world would inevitably fall to her just as all the others had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smirked as she did a mental scan of the planet and saw just how small and pathetic this world and its inhabitants were. She would own this rock within a week. Moments later, Cindy received a call through her communicator. Answering the call, she heard the voice of her emperor speaking to her in alien tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Have you reached your destination. my child?\" The emperor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, my master.\" Cindy replied loyally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good... Now, since this world is so small and its inhabitants so weak, I trust that you can handle this mission without the need of my reinforcements?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, master. These bugs pose no threat to me. You needn't waste any more of your troops on this mission. I alone am more than enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent... Now, see to it that every last living being on that puny planet kneels before you. You have already captured so many worlds for me, my dear Cindy. Complete this one last mission for me, and I shall have you promoted to be my loyal second in command. I look forward to seeing your great success, child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you, master. I promise that I shall not disappoint you.\" Cindy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then turned off the transmitter and walked toward the nearest land, which happened to be a Russian territory. As soon as she reached land, she noticed that there was a group of people on the ground below her who were running away in terror. They were a small police force that had been sent in to apprehend a pair of criminals who had escaped to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, when a giant woman suddenly appeared before them, they were far to terrified to think about the prisoners at all. The only thing they cared about was escaping to preserve their own lives. Cindy smirked at their feeble attempt at self-preservation before reaching into her pocket and pulling out her weapon of choice: a powerful alien ray gun that eclipsed all human weapons in both firing rate and destructive power. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Take this, earthling scum!\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then shot a single beam at the ground in front of the fleeing police force, causing a massive explosion that vaporized the entire crowd instantly. All except for two girls, who had been just far enough behind all the others to avoid getting caught directly in the blast. They had been blown away by the shockwave of the explosion, and now lay dazed on the ground temporarily unable to move, but no permanent damage had been done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Cindy put away her gun and walked over to examine the two girls. One was a short-blonde haired woman with gray eyes and a military coat on, while the other was long-brown haired women with green eyes and a normal civilian outfit on. Since they were both too exhausted to get up and try to run away again any time soon, Cindy took her time to reach into her other pocket and pull out a scanner before using it to find out a bit more information on the two ladies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde was named Alexandra. She was apparently a former military commander who had gone rogue and turned into a criminal mastermind. The brown haired woman was Lena, an ex-gang member who was trying to regroup with with her gang when she was found and pursued by the police. Cindy thought for moment and smiled. These two women were just as cruel and heartless as she was. They wanted power to do whatever they wanted and wouldn't let anyone stand in their way of getting it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that it might be fun to have a partner join her on her mission, Cindy decided that she would pick one of these two as her assistant and have them help her conquer this land for the glory of the empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Who will she pick?</span></div></div>",

Just think of all the damage I could do at that size...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as she had uttered that thought Cindy sensed it. Cindy also sensed Janice's cruelty and violent abilities. She would be absolutely perfect as an apprentice to her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy summoned Janice with her mystical powers and in shock Janice arrived, landing on Cindy's palm. Janice immediately took out a knife and jammed it into Cindy's palm.  Cindy was surprised by the sudden violence, it didn't really hurt due to the size. Janice saw that didn't work and quickly tried to climb Cindy's arm to try to drive her blade into a more vulnerable part like the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy was impressed with her quick thinking, her audacity and her skill. Smiling she said, \"Calm down little one, I mean you no harm, quite the opposite in fact.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice sensed the truth of those words and slid back down the arm to the waiting palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, I'm listening,\" she boldly said to the Giantess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy explained, \"I want to rule this world.

Long black latex gloves over the elbow complete the look.

As she removed her sole to examine the wreckage, she noticed a red liquid oozing out from the car's crushed remains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I stepped on a tiny.\" Janice said as she laughed dominantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cThat\u2019s my apprentice.\u201d Cindy said proudly, very pleased with Janice's behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could say anything else, Janice had already begun crushing more cars and people. All the while, she wore a sadistic smile on her face that clearly showed she was really beginning to get into this. </span></div></div>",

She had just managed to finish contact with the members of the new particle acceleration machine research team on the West Coast, and she was quite exhausted. She had spent all day trying to obtain data from rival accelerator machines, like Tevatron and the CERN facilities. She was trying to create a formula that would allow her to find every type of fundamental constant, force, and particle in the universe! If successful, Linda would surely be recognized as the greatest scientist in human history! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could already see the Nobel Prize in her hand now. The attractive auburn was reclining in her seat, and was about to take a short nap when something interesting happened. The world around her turned blurry, and then disappeared in a flash of light. When the light subsided, Linda found herself in the middle of the city, and she quickly realized that she had grown to giant size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda took a moment, looked around, and was surprised when she saw another female figure of equally giant size wearing a suit straight out of a sci-fi movie. She carefully walked over to get a closer look at this other woman, and observed that the other female had pointed ears. Straightening her lab coat and adjusting her glasses, Linda slowly reached out to touch this giant woman to make sure that she was actually real, and not just some stress-induced hallucination that she was seeing due to overworking herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her fingers came into contact with the woman's chest and sank into the plush skin of her fairly bountiful breast, a broad smile spread across Linda's face. It wasn't a hallucination. This woman was real. Forget particle acceleration, Linda had just made the first human contact with a real live alien lifeform!

Please forgive me for my indecent actions, Miss. I meant you no disrespect.\" Linda said, bowing her head repeatedly as she apologized to the alien woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was absolutely terrified that her absentminded actions may have just angered this alien woman and potentially even ruined humanity's chances of establishing peace with her race. However, as she felt the gentle touch of the alien woman's hand resting calmly on her shoulder, she stopped bowing and stood back up to look the alien visitor in the eye, adjusting her glasses once again as they had been shaken out of place by her bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please human, there is no need to act with such formality. The entire reason that I grew you to my size was so that we could converse together as equals.

Cindy cocked her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I understand, this gesture is a symbol of friendship among your kind.

Likewise.\" Cindy said with a smile, releasing her grip on Linda's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Cindy, mind if I ask what brings you here to earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. You see, I was traveling through space making an interstellar map, and as I passed by your planet I sensed the presence of many different lifeforms that have never been recorded before. You see, I am an avid researcher, and one of my goals is to one day create a catalog of every species of life to ever exist within the universe. It's not as difficult a task as you might think. Most planets capable of housing life only have a handful of species to catalog, and many of those lifeforms exist on multiple worlds across the universe. Out of the hundreds of worlds I've visited to date, yours is one of only ten planets to contain more than five different species of life. It's also the first one I've encountered to date to have such an enormous magnitude of different lifeforms not yet recorded to exist on any other planet. And that brings me to why I've decided to make contact with you. Cataloging all of the species on your planet would take me far too long as an individual task, so I would like to request your assistance in this matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My assistance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I would like you to teach me as much as you can about your world and all the creatures that inhabit it. Sentient lifeforms especially. I want to know everything that there is to know about your world. Would you please lend me your knowledge, Linda Smith?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda's eyes lit up with excitement. This was something that she had always dreamed of. An opportunity to spend time talking with and getting to know an alien lifeform on a personal level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly, Cindy. I would gladly help you out with this mission of yours. But in exchange for teaching you about my world, I would like you to teach me about yours. Oh, and you don't need to call me Linda Smith. Linda will do just fine.\"  Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That seems like a fair deal to me. Very well, Linda, I believe that this alliance will be mutually beneficial. Where shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we start with...\"</span></div></div>",

Upon meeting the tiny earthlings, she may try to peacefully spread her religion to them and enhance their lives, or be disgusted by how they would rather kill eachother off in pointless wars than work together and force her religion on them as a means of unifying them. Whichever girl she chooses as her apprentice will have to be one who agrees with her religion and will help her spread it to the rest of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 2) Business giantess: She travels through many planets to make deals with other alien life. She learned about the planet earth during a conversation with one of the colleagues she works with. She only has one thing on her mind: profit, and she will do just about anything if it means that she can make a nice amount of money.

She has hidden on many planets, only to be inevitability found and forced to run more. Eventually she discovered the planet earth during her all of her running, and decided to make it her newest hideout. Upon discovering that the planet is inhabited by such tiny and weak beings as humans, she may try to force us to cover for her and hide her from her pursuers, or she may use her powers to turn the human females into her own personal army to fight back. In the former scenario, her apprentice would need to be a woman with a position of power in earth's government so that she could use her influence to get her way. In the latter scenario, She would grow as many females as possible and pick the most skilled warrior among them to be her apprentice, who would help her whip the rest into shape and lead the army by her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Chef giantess: Cindy, a well known giantess chef, came to earth to show more people some of the best dishes from her home world while also learning some of the culinary arts of this planet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> In the far distance of the galaxy, Cindy was on a religious pilgrimage to achieve self-enlightenment. Throughout her quest she went to from planet to planet in order to see and help people who were being brought down by sickness, war, and other evil things. As she was in the midst of wandering the milky way, aimlessly searching for the next planet that she would provide her aid to, she sensed an intense sadness far from where she was. Feeling the overwhelming sadness, Cindy placed her hand over her necklace's pendant, a silver circle with two angelic wings on the side and a golden cross in the center, and clutched it tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This sadness... I must go see it!\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then flew off toward the planet where she felt it. Once she arrived on the planet, a small little globe known by its natives as earth, she was surprised to see just how beautiful it looked. It was a world of blue oceans and green continents in perfect balance with one-another. Cindy smiled, but at the same time she frowned little as she remembered the pain that she had felt coming from this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she landed in the ocean she walked toward the nearest city in order to meet with the native people who were in so much pain. Not wanting to cause any damage to this world and its inhabitants, Cindy quickly cast a spell that caused her body to float a few inches off of the ground so that nothing would be damaged beneath her mighty footsteps. As she floated forward, she paused as something came to mind...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I do want to spread my religion and help these people in the name of self enlightenment, but I cannot do it by myself... There is simply too much sadness in this world for one person to resolve...'</i> Cindy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, she had an idea that would resolve that issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'If I alone am not enough to save this world, then I will simply need to get some assistance from one of this world's natives. I shall take one of these poor lost souls under my wing, teach them the ways of my goddess, and have them aid me in my mission to save this world.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy immediately decided that this would be the best course of action. She would pick one person from the ground below and let that mortal become her apprentice to spread her religion far and wide. It was simple idea, but at the same time it was a grand one. Cindy looked around with a smile on her face, and  after a bit of searching, she finally found three people that she would be interested in adopting as her apprentice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n Jasmine: Jasmine is an average 16 year old who just started high school. She has light brown hair, a white shirt and a long green skirt on. She was always bullied since she was in elementary school, but she endured it as she was not a fighter. She wishes that someday she could spread the word of anti-bullying through school or even through society in general, but she doubts that she will ever be in a position of power that would allow her to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsuki: Natsuki is an 18 year old girl who is half Japanese and half american. She has short black hair, slightly slanted brown eyes and is usually seen wearing her school uniform. She moved to America six years ago when her parents went there for the religious mission, and Natsuki has always wanted to become a pastor like her father was. She is purely against war in all forms and has attempted to spread her words through the college that she was accepted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Beatrice: Beatrice is a 17 year old girl who immigrated from Italy to America. She has long dark brown hair, hazelnut eyes and usually wears a simple black and white dress. She is currently enrolled in a private all girls Christian school, and she always admired the religion of peace. She wished someday she would be able to help the pastor of the school to spread the peaceful religion without harming anybody.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy thought carefully as it was truly hard decision. Jasmine didn't have a religion of her own, so she would be the easiest of the three to convert. However, she was also the shyest of the three, and it might be difficult for her if she were suddenly pulled from her normal life and told that she would be playing a role in changing her world forever. Natsuki did have a religion of her own, and it wasn't exactly one that lined up with Cindy's teachings. Converting her would probably be incredibly difficult, but she seemed to be the most passionate of the three, so winning her over would probably be the most beneficial in the long run. As for Beatrice, it seemed that her belief in this earthling religion of Christianity was very similar in nature to Cindy's religion. Converting her probably wouldn't be too hard as a result, and she seemed like she would be a very helpful assistant once won over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy thought it over from all angles before finally deciding to pick...</span></div></div>",

She spoke few words and then she breathed out little on the hand, making a calm wind that would go to the shy girl. At the high school, Jasmine got out of the building since the class were over. She just started the school since she started the school year late due to the bullying issue that was going on. Jasmine felt depressed as she was bullied again today. She was punched, kicked, haired pulled and got hit with binder. Her friends told her that they would avenge her, but jasmine told them she didn't believe in violence so she continued to live her life. She truly wanted the power to change the world to be better place, but deep inside her chest she knew she couldn't get the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"*sigh* I might end up being bullied forever.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then felt the light wind from back and turned around, only to see the huge toe. She then slowly looked up and realised seeing the giantess! Jasmine trembled as the giantess moved her mouth little and then the wind picked her up to the opposite side. Jasmine didn't know what was going on until she felt light sting in her body. She soon grew taller to the giantess's size. She was trembling and the giantess spoke to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I apologize for sudden growth and meeting.\" Giantess said, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wh-wh-wh-who are you!? what happened to me!!\" Jasmine asked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Giantess nodded and breathed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My name is cindy, and I am from the far galaxy.\" She spoke, \"I am currently in the religious pilgrimage in the name of self enlightment. I came here because I have felt the tremendous sadness and suffering that were in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jasmine listened to what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I came here to end it by spreading the religion I follow, but I cannot do it by myself as the suffering is too big for myself.\" Cindy said, then rose her hand. \"Jasmine...I ask for your aid in helping me spreading my religion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jasmine were shocked to hear that as she just thought about changing the world. She figited little and then blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But...I'm just an normal girl with no power. What can I do?\" JAsmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"If you willing to convert to my religion, I shall bless you with holy power to extend life and many other thing.\" Cindy said, \"Please, jasmine. For the sake of the whole world..no, the ENTIRE galaxy..lend me your hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n JAsmine thought for moment and then smiled at the giantess pilgrim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ok..I will help you.\" Jasmine answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy smiled and took out an bottle filled with water. She then poured some into her hand and came next to the new giantess. She continued to float so she would not kill anyone and then put her free hand on jasmines chin and rose her water filled hand in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"In the name of the divine father, I shall convert jasmine into our faith.\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then poured the water onto jasmines head. The water trickled down and jasmine felt ease in her heart. After few second, cindy smiled to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Welcome to my faith, jasmine.\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thank you.\" JAsmine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The first task they would do is..</span></div></div>",

She soon joined the anti-war movement in hopes of spreading peace and resolving the conflicts that were causing the earth to suffer so, and ever since then she would advocate her beliefs to anyone she could get to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer current plan was to try and spread her message throughout the new college she would soon be attending. The people going there were all very intelligent people with enormous potential. They were all destined for great things in the future, so winning them over to her side while they were still small would ensure that she would have some form of influence on the world through them later on in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must convince the students and teachers on the issue. For the sake of the world, I cannot fail.\" Natsuki spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, she felt her heart throb and she passed out. She didn't know what was going on until she opened her eyes and saw that she was no longer anywhere near the college campus anymore, but instead a wide open beach. She wondered why she was at the beach all of a sudden, but that curiosity was put on hold when she turned around and looked behind her to see an enormous woman with pointed ears standing in the middle of the city, towering over all the buildings that surrounded her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsuki was shocked beyond words to see someone so huge. Then she looked down at herself, and realized something even more shocking. That strange girl with the pointed ears wasn't the only one who was a giantess; she herself had somehow become one as well, and she was now towering over all of the tiny little beach goers surrounding her. Wanting to know what exactly was going on, and assuming that that other giantess probably had something to do with her sudden massive growth spurt, Natsuki began to approach the fellow giantess and question her. The two giantesses simply stood there facing eachother, examining eachother, not knowing for sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Silence stood until...</span></div></div>",

She smiled and bowed to her in a polite way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I apologize for such rudeness. I am Cindy, an alien that is on religious pilgrimage for self enlightenment.\" Cindy replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh? alien?...wait, your alien?\" Natsuki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy nodded then noticed that Natsuki were no longer getting frightened by. Usually when Cindy comes to the different planet, many of the living being beneath her were terrified by her, but she proves to many that she's innocent and would hurt no such things. Before Natsuki would say anything Cindy spoke to her beforehand so there would be no misunderstandings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I have reason to come here, young mortal.\" Cindy said, \"I have felt the great sadness from this planet, and I want to help end this sadness by spreading my religion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Huh...\" Natsuki spoke, then looking at the pendant, \"...Are you christian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy shook her head. Natsuki were confused and then Cindy continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You see. My religion is sort of similar to the foreign religion of Christianity, but we are more strict then christians.\" Cindy said, \"And when a person hits the age, he or she must go on the pilgrimage of self enlightenment. Way to help other planets to end their suffering and pain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Go on..\"Natsuki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"But the pilgrimage is not easy as the one who is doing one must have a partner to help spread the word of peace.\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsuki now understands why Cindy called her and turned herself into a giantess: She needs help to achieve self enlightenment by spreading the words of her religion and end all of the suffering. Natsuki then remembered that she had her own plan to promote peace. She smiled and Cindy rose her hand toward her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Please, Ms. Natsuki...

Her father was the head of the electronic company and military company who makes weapons and tanks while her mother was the head of the restaurant chain and automobile industry. She grew up in the business world and when she became mature, she took many business deals to the other company, making them bankrupt due to the competition. As she was at her office writing, one of the associate came to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ms.Foxfire?

She was always one of the person who would go to the different planet and galaxy to make deals in cindy's name. Just then, the associate spoke to the head boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"S-say, boss? I have something that would interest you.\" Associate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy stopped writing and put the pen down. She leaned back on the chair, breathing out for moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"And what's this thing you want to speak?\" Cindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...one of my friend have told me about the planet that exist in one of the galaxy.\" Associate said, \"And the place is filled with people and business area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy looked at the associate and became interested. She asked the associate to bring something that provide the information and she did. Once she returned, she brought some books and paper works, and the place were in the milkyway and the planets name were earth. Cindy gave a long thought and then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess I have a great hope that I would go there.\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wait...what?\" associate spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Think for moment!

I should thank the newhire for this.\" Cindy spoke with smile, \"now then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then spoke few words in alien tongue and she immediately shrunk to human size so she would not scare the living beings (she grows or shrinks her body depending on the planet) and went into the blue planet. She landed safely on the beach side and once she landed, she noticed some people staring at her. She smiled and walked off toward the parking area.

It was a gravitational car that looked like a 70s mustang without a wheels. She got on, turned the engine on and it flew high. The saw this and were amazed and Cindy flew off. She was driving the car within speed limit, going toward the city and when she stopped by red light, the other drivers saw her and were stunned, then one driver pulled down the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey miss!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cindy cursed under her breath as she flew through the galaxy at top speed. Those rotten military drones just wouldn't leave her alone. Ever since she left she had been labeled as a traitor to her kind. Just because she was sick of all the meaningless wars and decided she didn't want to fight anymore, she was being targeted for extermination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course they couldn't let her live. She knew vital military information that, if it got into the hands of one of her race's enemies, would most certainly spell their demise. She had no intention of ever revealing those secrets, mind, but they weren't willing to take any chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they had made one big mistake when they began to pursue her: They had sent drones rather than actual troops after her. Certainly, those drones were powerful, and far more persistent than any living being would ever be, but the fact that they were machines meant that they were unable to adapt beyond what they were programmed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese drones were meant to pursue and apprehend a fleeing unarmed target. They had no ranged combat protocol at the ready, and so they had no way to react when Cindy reached into her pocket and pulled out a pair of tiny laser guns just slightly larger than her fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around mid-flight without ever slowing down at all, Cindy used her powers of size to return these pistols back to their original size. She then took quick aim at each of the drones and fired. The drones, not knowing what to do in the face of ranged weaponry that their target wasn't even supposed to possess, simply flew straight into the barrage of beams that reduced each of them to little more than giant metal hunks of swiss cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied grin on her face, Cindy turned back around and continued flying away. She knew she wasn't safe yet. The instant that the military lost the signal from those drones, they would surely send a second wave after her. Probably actual troops this time rather than just simple drones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy needed to find a planet that she could use as sanctuary, and fast. Luckily for her, as soon as she turned around, she caught a glimpse of a little blue planet somewhere off in the distance. She immediately set herself on course to land on that planet. With any luck, there would be some form of intelligent life that could aid her in hiding from her pursuers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long flight through space, Cindy finally touched down on the surface of the planet known as earth, having landed right near one of the planet's many beaches. She immediately did a mental sweep of the surrounding area, and discovered that there was a city nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached the city and got a closer look at it, Cindy discovered that this world's inhabitants were all surprisingly small. Small enough to hold in the palm of her hand. How very interesting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy shook her head as she refocused herself on the reason she was here in the first place. She had no time to be sightseeing or admiring the tiny locals, she needed to make preparations for the arrival of pursuit wave two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about that, she realized that maybe she could use these tiny people to her advantage. As much as she didn't want to drag them into a war that had nothing to do with them, Cindy was currently desperate, and really didn't have any other options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing to the conclusion that taking advantage of these natives was her only hope of losing her pursuers once and for all, Cindy began to think about what exactly she could do. There was a significant number of women among them who she could use her powers to grow into her own personal army. Or perhaps she could find one of their female government leaders and grow her in hopes of forging an alliance and using her influence to get these people to help hide her from her pursuers. Maybe she could just shrink herself down to their size and hide among them that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a fair bit of thought, Cindy finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

She was a member of the one ultimate species and so to reduce herself to the level of another inferior species, much less one as pathetic as humans, was something that her pride just couldn't get over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy immediately shoved her hesitant feelings aside, however, quickly realizing that this was an emergency situation and that her life was was far more important than her pride. Swallowing her pride, she began chanting a spell that would cause her to shrink. A light glowed around her and she started to shrink down to 6'1\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the light faded away, Cindy looked around and saw that there was a crowd of people beginning to form around her. She quickly ran through the streets for a few minutes until she was sure that she had escaped the eyes of her observers. Once she turned down a dark alley, she paused to reexamine her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I need better view...\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She squatted, putting strength on her legs and jumped very high so fast the people didn't noticed it.

Cindy could tell that she was truly scared so she then carefully walked toward the young girl. Luo backed off little, but then she noticed cindy summoning some sort of bag and taking out a small bag filled with lightly green herbs. Cindy stopped infront of luo and opened the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know your scared, suddenly becoming a giantess like me. Here, take a smell of this spice.\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Luo were skeptical about her, but did what she asked. She took the bag and took a quick sniff, making her head expload with many aromas in the spice. The spice had mild smell, but not too strong.

After she signed the paper, she put it aside and leaned back. Cindy was well known detective as she had many client from both domestic and international, and she always solved the mystery to find the culprit. As she relaxed, she sipped on the whiskey she thought to herself about maybe having a partner since she always done the mystery solving herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hm..I think I should have one..\" Cindy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, a knock were made from the door. Cindy shouted 'come in' and once door opened, it showed an normal girl with casual shirt. It was one of Cindy's friends and she walked toward her and stopped in front of the desk. Cindy knew her since she was younger age as they both went to school and such, but got separated when they left for collage, and she became an technical engineer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey Cindy. How's the business going?\" Girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Just finished with the previous one.\" Cindy replied, \"I'm just relaxing right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She sipped few more whiskey and stood up, offering her some drink. She refused and told her that someone want to see her. Cindy wonders who then someone came in. It was a long blond haired women with freckles and had white dress.

Once they all sat down, Cindy put the cup to the side and turned to her business mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well then, Ms. Sarah... What is your problem?\" Cindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well..Recently, 6 of my colleagues went to the planet earth to exchange the technique between our world and earth.\" Sarah explained, \"But I haven't heard from them since last month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This were intriguing to her and then tilted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Didn't our government asked the U.N. in earth to seek them?\" Cindy asked, \"You know out government have good relation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know, I did but I got the reply that they still haven't found them yet.\" Sarah replied, \"Please detective! say the price and I'll pay! so please help our colleague!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy looked at her friend and she nodded.

They discussed the pricing and after that, Cindy got her detective coat and her detective hat and went out to the door and flew off toward the planet earth. 5 hours later, she was now at the planet earth. She always  wanted to visit earth as she liked the beach and the scenery. Once she landed safely on beach area, she thought for moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n (I just can't do it by myself..I might just end up getting apprentice after all.) Cindy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then put her hand on the pocket and brought monocle. She put it on her left eye and looked at the city for moment and then saw three ladies that could be part of the apprentice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 1.) Alice: Alice is 25 years old girl with green hair, brown eyes and white dress. She loved the detective novel and movies, motivating her to be someday becoming one of the best detective in the world.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> In the galaxy where earth floated peacefully, a giantess watched over the blue planet. She was Cindy, the most renowned movie director on her own planet, famous throughout the entire universe for creating some of the best movies in history. She had directed many movies in the past, and she came to earth because she heard from her colleague that the planet would make a great set for her next big project: a giantess movie. She thought for a moment before nodding her head and reaching into her pocket, carefully pulling something out. In her palm sat her entire movie crew, who she had shrunken down to a miniature size so they could be carried around easily by Cindy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Let's make this movie a big hit like always, girls.\" Cindy said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy heard her tiny crew shouting and cheering. With a smile on her face, she placed them back into her pocket and flew toward earth. She landed on the planet in the middle of an ocean, and looked off into the distance. She soon located a big city and headed toward it. Once she reached solid land, Cindy looked around and smiled once again. Retrieving her crew from her pocket once again, she set them down on the ground below her and sent them off into the city to look for locations that would be ideal for shooting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir miniaturized size was for more than just travel purposes. At that size, they would be able to film amazing shots from the perspective of the puny humans that would be getting terrorized by her giantess star, and they could capture the action from a far wider variety of angles than anyone of her stature could. While she was amazing at picking out talented actors and pulling everyone together, they were the ones who were best at being able to tell which locations would be best for which shots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all that remained was to find that one perfect woman to fill the role of her giantess star. She needed a mature beauty, one with unparalleled acting talent and a willingness to follow any order her director gave her for the success of the film. Most importantly, however, she would need to be willing to cast aside her humanity and truly become a giantess. Part of what made Cindy's movies so great was that nothing she filmed was ever faked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAuthenticity was the one thing that she prided herself on more than anything else. If a scene required a city be destroyed by a towering goddess, she would find a real city and have it destroyed. For the movie she had in mind, her star would eventually end up conquering the entire planet and ending countless human lives. Certainly, she would restore everything to normal with her powers once all was said and done, but her star would need to be able to handle the idea of singlehandedly wiping out her own kind, even if only temporarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Cindy scanned the city to see if there was anyone nearby who fit her strict criteria and would become the universe's next big super star. After a few minutes of searching. she found 2 favorable candidates:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Zelda McRauld - a 28 year old with long blond hair, gorgeous figure and deep blue eyes. She was born in a small town and moved to the city when she was 12. She grew up loving acting as her parents were also actors, and from the very beginning she was a prodigy in the field. After she graduated high school she enrolled in the acting school and graduated at age 26 and now she is ready for the movie career. She has always felt a bit disconnected from the world around her due to how much more naturally everything came for her. She would probably take naturally to the idea of becoming a giant goddess wiping out those who were inferior to her, but maybe she might feel a bit nervous about actually ending the lives of real people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mackenzie Kim - a 30 year old with short black hair and green eyes. She is a korean american who grew up in the world of acting. She has been in many plays and acted in one of the most famous musicals on broadway. She loves movies and plays of all genres. Acting is her passion, and she takes it far more seriously than anything else. Once she gets a part, she fully transforms herself into the role. As long as her performance is utterly flawless, she doesn't care if anyone else gets hurt in the process. They were merely a necessary sacrifice for her own success, and naturally they should be honored to sacrifice themselves for the success of one as talented and dedicated as her, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy thought hard for moment and then decided to pick..</span></div></div>",

Talented and dedicated as Zelda was, she may still let her human inhibitions get in the way of her acting in such a role. Mackenzie, on the other hand, had already proven that she was willing to put the success of her performance before anything else. If she had to trample millions of innocent lives beneath her feet to make this movie a success, she gladly would do so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her decision, Cindy used her powers to bring the future star to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mackenzie was just getting out of the theater. She had a meeting with one of the directors, where she was offered the opportunity to become the heroine of the their upcoming movie. Always one to keep her options open, Mackenzie told them that she'd think about it and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What a day... It's not easy being so talented... Now, what should I do next?\" Mackenzie spoke to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then felt a light breeze, and once she blinked her eyes she was no longer in the city anymore, but instead on the shore of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Wha... What just happened?!\" Mackenzie said, looking around in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then saw a massive giantess with pointy ears whose feet covered by the ocean water!

They flew toward the earth until the enemy found them and fought them. Two femal stunted giantess, Biggs and Wedge survived the attack but the third pilot Jenah were killed by the aliens attack.

She then saw the cyborg that had biggs and wedge take out the alien assault rifle and started to run toward the enemy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"now then, think..\" Sakurako spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She thought to draw the weapon and the cyborg she was piloting moved and drew the weapon, and it was....</span></div></div>",

Sakurako was amazed see the sword appear before her and she could see that the sword were very long like sephiroths katana. She got the katana and got into the position to fight as both biggs and wedge assaulted the mutant with their respective guns. Biggs had assault rifle while wedge had shotgun. Sakurako gathered her concentration and let the cyborg run forward to fight against the mutant in close combat. The mutant saw her and swiped her with its hand as the mortal earthling tried her best to dodge, it hit the shoulder part, causing her to wobble little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Are you ok sakurako?\" Wedge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm fine! please continue to fight!\" Sakurako replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both biggs and wedge nodded and continued to shoot at the mutant while avoiding hitting sakurako. The mutant were dodging some bullets until sakura thrust her sword vertically, hitting the mutants body directly. The blood poured as the mutant screamed in pain, sakurako was in stance then attacked the mutant like what sephiroth in ff7 did, making another direct hit on the monster. Both biggs and wedge were amazed to see this and wedge were thinking that biggs made a right move on taking sakurako as part of the operator. The mutant were breathing heavy with heavy wound, and then sakurako pointed the katana toward the enemy mutant and she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You cannot win, mutant. We have won.\" Sakurako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mutant looked at the cyborg and scoffed at her. Sakurako didn't know why the mutant scoffed at her until the mutant looked at the sky and howled loudly. Both biggs and wedge quickly realized what the mutant was doing and wedge immediatly ran next to the mutant and shot the mutant in its head, killing the mutant instantly. Sakurako were wondering what that howl were and then the live image of biggs and wedge appeared on the left side of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Good job sakurako and wedge. We have defeated the monster that almost wrecked this city.\" Biggs said, \"And wedge, good timing on killing the monster before too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It was my job to do so.\" Wedge replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"why do you have to kill it instantly when it howled?\" Sakurako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The monster was trying to call for backup. Good thing wedge stopped it.\" Biggs replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sakurako understood where biggs was saying and once biggs came forward, she controlled her cyborg and a jet stream of blue light covered the carcass and within moment both light and the carcass disappeared. Sakurako didn't know where it went and wedge told her that she transported the carcass to the home planet so it could be disintergrated into ashes through fire. Sakurako nodded until she asked them where they would go for shelter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well...um....I have no clue.\" Biggs said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Oh no...you didn't plan ahead?\" wedge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hey, we were chasing the enemy!

The warehouse used be part of the department store that sold many good merchandise from plushy to video game stuff. Since the department went bankrupt and fell down, the warehouse became deserted as well. Cindy was making a circle that surrounded natsumi and once she wrote some alien letters on the side, she threw the chalk away and came next to the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"now then, I will do some ceremony and within minute, you will become powerful person.\" Cindy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes.

She made the gesture 25 times under minute and once she done the last one, she opened her eyes and clapped her hand strongly, making a light gust around the circle.

She had to kiss another girl to become powerful? She felt hesitant for moment but she got her confidence and she nodded. Both cindy and Natsumi got their shoulders and in seconds, they locked their lips together. Natsumi felt the tongue moving from Cindy's side and then she felt the immense power from her body. She never felt this power before and she was struggling for moment on this until she saw Cindy's eyes, telling her not to hold back. Natsumi got her courage and continue to lock lips until the light engulfed the area and bursted out of the warehouse. Once the light faded away, natsumi opened her eyes, realising that Cindy was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ma'am? MA'AM!!? Where are you!?\" Natsumi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'I'm inside you.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsumi heard an voice from inside and looked around.

I have used last of my power to transfer it to you. Because of that, my body faded away since it became useless. Now I'm inside of you to regenerate my power and to regenerate my body.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsumi were sad to hear that, but also glad that at least she is still around. Cindy explained to her that the body that Cindy had is currently inside her stomach to regenerate itself. Natsumi blushed at this and Cindy assured her nothing will happen to her body.

Her eyes are golden too, and she has some big gold wings on her back. Of course she does only have one head, but that's all she needed as she fire from her mouth some gold electricity to scare the boys away.

But where should she have went?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In the Forest/Mountain Area</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsumi wakes up in some big area and looks around her surroundings. She notices that she isn't in the city anymore, and that many trees don't go up to her waist in height when she stands. She then notices something is quite funny here. \"Uh... Cindy, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now a kaiju-size girl, but don't worry, you will be able to switch size at your own will between your human and monster forms. Your height well... 250ft tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you saying that I am the height of a giant monster?\" Natsumi asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsumi then got the thought. She is now a monster size girl, and with King-Ghidorah's powers. She wondered if she could roar like a monster. She then stands in the area, and then breathes in and then... she roar. It sounded like King-Ghidorah's roar, which surprised her. \"Wow... that is King-Ghidorah's roar. I can actually roar like a giant monster. Wow, I wonder if I could fly?\" she thought. She then flaps her wings and then lets off into the air. Natsumi is now starting to really love it now. She can roar and fly. (I know its short on details, but the fun stuff is coming).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loving it, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! So I am now a giant monster girl like you.\" Natsumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Now to explain, you are in the training zone, where I train my abilities.

Just then, three giant monster appeared from the sky and landed on the forest area. They were hideous mutated monster that were beyond recognition and natsumi gotten ready to fight. The three mutated monsters ran toward her and with few flaps, natsumi flew high in the sky and avoided the charging attack from the monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Very good natsumi. The monsters is strong, but brainless so it's a good training for you.' Cindy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yup.\" Natsumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then enhaled some air and breathed out an gravity  beam at one of the mutant. Two mutants evaded the attack but one of them got direct hit and perished in flames. Natsumi flew back little and landed on the land with ease. She noticed one of the mutant started to charge up on the beam and then cindy spoke up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Now listen! the mutant is about to use hydro beam against you! Use your wings to make whirlwind to block its attack!' Cindy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes, ma'am!\" Natsumi replied.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n The mutant then charged up the beam and attacked her with it. She noticed the beam was mediocre but did what Cindy ordered and flapped her wings very strong, making a huge tornado-like wind, making the beam turn to a mist. Natsumi quickly ran toward the mutant and stabbed the thing with her arm, killing the monster quickly. Once she pulled out her arm, she turned her attention toward the final mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Now remember one thing: the tornado wind might be strong, but it have limitation so beware.' Cindy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright.. now for him.\" Natsumi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The mutant then summoned fire balls around itself and threw toward Natsumi. She dodged the fireball, grazing few and once the fire ball was gone, Natsumi breathed in, mustering some power from her chest to her mouth and then spoke one thing to the mutant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"This is over!\" Natsumi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She charged up and spat an big fire-thunder like gravity beam at the mutant, engulfing the area. When the beam went away, she saw the scar of the earth as parts of the forest were burned, revealing the brown floor and mountain with hole on the top. Natsumi felt the strength from her chest and then felt something warm inside her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ma'am.. I feel something warm inside my tummy.\" Natsumi asked, \"Is it your regenerating body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'Yes. Everytime you come victorious, my body shall regenerate little.' Cindy replied, 'Now then. The training session is over, I'm transporting you back to Tokyo.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsumi nodded and closed her eyes, letting the light engulf her and disappeared. Back in Tokyo, light were made in the allyway of Ginza and faded away. Natsumi came out of the ally with her normal cloth still on. She looked around to see if there is no one that saw her, and breathed out in releaf that no one saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well, Ma'am. It's getting late so I'm starting to go home.\" Natsumi spoke, \"Do you thing my mom and dad would hear you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'No. Only you can make hear me.' Cindy said, \"By the way...what's your name?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"My name is Natsumi.\" Natsumi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'And I'm cindy' Cindy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsumi smiled and walked toward her home. She lived in high classed apartment with her parents and they truly loved their only daughter. Cindy observed the actions natsumi did as she was at the  kitchen to have some dinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n During dinner....</span></div></div>",

It was some fish dish, and it was high quality, and Natsumi always loved those. \"Say, I notice some bright light from the building earlier as if something happened. Did you notice it?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in fact, I was there.\" Natsumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you notice?\" her mother asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... it is something that happened to me, and I don't know I can explain it, but I will try my best to explain it to y'all.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she goes on to how she meet this lady who transferred some of her power into her, and how she accepted the responsibility. At first it was hard to believe, but then she show her power to them by firing at some random object with a gravity beam from her mouth (note she was normal size during this). They were amazed by this, and she even shown her form to them, and they were just stunned to see it. The parents understand that she couldn't leave that spirit to die anyway, and they also do believe in magic and stuff, and how their daughter got the power of a giant monster and stuff. Heck, she even teleported them to the realm that she was training that day, and shown them her new size. Heck, Cindy was able to talk to them there as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, so you saved our daughter and she did a favor by letting your spirit inside of her. (Note, in the realm, Cindy is able to talk to others, friends, but are asked to keep it a secret) Well, that's great because I think we might be having a giant monster attack in a few weeks, and I think our daughter have pretty much got her wish, now it's a matter if she also manage to not destroy the school and stuff.\" her father laughed. \"Don't worry Natsumi. Both you and I were once the apprenciates of the kaijus, and we fought alongside them as well, and we knew your time would be coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you knew about this?\" Natsumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" her mother replied with honesty, but then smiled at her. \"But I know you will make a great hero, as you are following in our footsteps. After all, there is alot more we can tell you, but that will be for another day. Heck, tomorrow is Saturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and I am thinking about giving my form a test drive.\" Natsumi thought out just as she thinks of trying her form out more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you will get the chance to. While I am cooking up stuff, say, your mother could use some help with the enviormentialist.\" dad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What it is mother?\" Natsumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's just say the forest I am really working on to perserve, well some people are trying to cut it down, and I told them repeatedly that they can not cut it down, so if you mind, perhaps we can use your size and stuff to scare them away. Don't worry, it's a good deed, as they didn't got permission to do so from me.\" the mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I shall do it!\" Natsumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time for me to go.\" Cindy said before they teleported out of the area. Everyone went to bed for the next day, a day that will be the beginning of the good deeds of Natsumi. For monster name... they decided... Natsumizilla.</span></div></div>",

The father bid them farewell and once they were outside, natsumis mother wrapped her arm on natsumis upper body and jumped very high. Both natsumi and Cindy were surprised to see this and Cindy could see that her mother was truly the part of kaiju people. Natsumis mother told her to transform into a kaiju and she nodded. Moment later, she became the giantess kaiju and put her mother on the back. Her mother directed her way and flew off with high speed. 20 minutes later, they arrived at the factory with the polluters. They saw heavy smog coming out from the chimney, making the three ladies mad at what they were looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I will go down, keep on watch out.\" Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, mom.\" Natsumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then jumped down from her back and landed on the cement floor, making a small crater. Both Cindy and Natsumi were surprised to see this as Mom had walked toward the factory, few mens came out from the factory to see what was going on. They saw natsumis mom, knowing who she was and then tried to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You! You're not allowed in this place! get out of here!\" Man shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I will not leave until you and your people stop what your companies are doing with forest\" Mom said, \"It's illegal movement!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The man and the fellow scoffed at her and was about to grab her. Natsumi felt danger so she landed behind her mom, showing the mens the kaiju form. The mens got frightened and started to flee, but natsumis mom disappeared and reappeared infront of the mens. The mens knew that she was no ordinary person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Who...Who are you!?\" Man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Listen to me and remember, for I am Yukiko Akahana, wife of great Masamune Akahana!\" She spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Masamune....MASAMUNE!? as the member of high council in the national diet AND a great lawyer!?\" Man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She smiled and the sweat was dripping at the mans face. Natsumi and Cindy knew the mens had no other place to hide, but to give up. One of the man grinned and took out knife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You may have caught us, but you will not take me to jail!\" Man shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He ran toward yukiko to attack but she dodged every attack. Yukiko were smiling at him as the man was doing everything to kill her but with no avail. Natsumi were looking at how pathetic the man were then the man fell to the ground, getting stomped by yukiko herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Give up, you have nowhere else to go.\" Yukiko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Just then, they heard an police siren were heard. Natsumi knew she shouldn't be around so she flew high as the police and the Japanese swat team came in. They arrested the males, shut down the factory and the case was closed. Natsumi were happy to see this and once the police went away, natsumi came down and picked her mother up and flew up. Cindy looked at the factory closly and observbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmm...something odd about that...or am I imagining thing?\"  Cindy spoke to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsumi and others then flew back to the house and once they got everyone back, natsumi returned normal and went inside and retired for tonight. Next day came and once Natsumi got up and put cloth on, she went down to the dining area to eat some breakfast. As she ate, she was asked by yukiko what she'll do to day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She answered.....</span></div></div>",

Natsumi and Yukiko then watches the video to see that a Godzilla like creature is rampaging in the heart of the city, destroying and crushing everything in it's path. People were running for their lives and all sort of other stuff, and the military is seen trying to defend the city as well. Then the giant dinosaur creature then uses it's fire breath to roast several tanks to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th\u00e0t is Gorzila... One of the most vicious kaijus ever conceived. I be careful if I was you, and try not if possible to destroy anything with your immense size and powers.\" Her mother than asked as well. Natsumi then smiled at her mother and shook her head as well, knowing she will be alright. Natsumi then runs off to face the creature. She talked to Cindy telepathically on her way to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, anything you know on this creature?\" Natsumi asked just as she runs to face the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gorzila is one of the kaiju that I fought. Gorzila is the most destructive beast I faced, and it's strength is truly monstrous. Thanks to all my training, I have complete faith that you can take Gorzila out. Just like the other monsters, they are brainless. But can you so me a favor as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Natsumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roar like a monster during battle. Just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, like to use my monster self as well.\" Natsumi smiled just as she continues to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The Park</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military tanks and soldiers where Gorzila is tearing them all to shreds. The monster's roar was like Red King's roar from Ultraman, and the beast was decimating the military like there is no tomorrow. Eventually all the military was nearly took out, and then they notice a young girl in clothing running towards the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry...I got this!\" The girl yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You aren't supposed to be here. It isn't safe.\" The commander pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, I know what I am doing.\" she said, and then she stood in front of the creature. \"Alright Gorzila, your days of terrorizing this city is done, I am here to stop you here and now to save this city!\" the girl shouts, and then... It happened. A white light engulfs the girl and then what the civilians and military saw will change everything forever.</span></div></div>",

The civilians and the military were very surprised to see this as natsumi looked at gorzilla, she pointed her finger at the kaiju.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I shall eliminate you under my hands!\" Natsumi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The monster just roared and natsumi ran toward the kaiju. Gorzilla swiped his hand but missed as natsumizilla ducked, she then swiped her razor-sharp claws at the monster, directly hitting on its chest. Gorzilla screamed and backed off little and natsumizilla started to punch the monster left and right until she gave an direct upper cut, causing the monster to float for moment and fell on the ground. The  civilians were cheering for natsumizilla as she jumped back, gorzilla got up and concentrated on itself.  Cindy quickly realized what the monster was going to do and spoke to natsumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Natsumi! The monster is about to unleash its strong beam attack! Stop him at any cost!\" Cindy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Right on it!\" Natsumi spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She flipped her wings many time, causing an tornado like gust against the monster. The monster were enduring the attack and once natsumi finished flapping, the monster were ready to unleash the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Damn! unleash your breath as well, natsumi!\" Cindy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsumi nodded and breathed in, making a light behind her back and minute later she was ready and the monster unleashed the powerful beam while Natsumi did the same, making the two beam clash each other. The two had the power struggle with the beam but ultimately, the beam that natsumi shot overwhelmed the monsters beam and engulfed it, hitting the invading monster directly and killing it. Once the beam were gone and everyone knew that the monster were finished, the civilians and the military cheered for natsumizilla. Once turned, Natsumi saw an white sphere thing floating on top of the monsters body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Cindy, what's that?\" Natsumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That's the monsters soul. Every time when you defeat the monster, it unleashes its soul.\" Cindy replied, \"It is also my food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Natsumi were surprised to hear this and cindy explained to her that her kind of kaiju is special one that eats the monsters and kaijus soul so they could become more stronger and wiser. Natsumi felt skeptical about this but just followed Cindys words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now then, will you please go to that soul and eat it.\" Cindy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"O..ok..\" Natsumi obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She walked toward the monsters soul and grabbed it. The soul were squishy and moving little, making Natsumi feel little skeptical about eating it but shook off her feeling as it was for the safety of the world. She then opened her mouth and touched the soul to her lips, then suddenly the soul were sucked into her mouth, making natsumi surprised and instantly swallowing the soul. Natsumi coughed little and then started to feel warm within her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ahh.... I can feel my body regenerate more thanks to the soul you ate.\" Cindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I see that you're recovering.\" Natsumi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Indeed. And I do not hope you would misunderstanding this process.\" Cindy spoke, \"I'm not eating the souls for fun, but for my nourishment.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I understand.\" Natsumi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She then let the light cover her and shrink back to normal size.

I got a picture.\" Mary said just as she shows a colored paper in her bag to her. \"I will be a hero, but I can also help out by destroying some buildings for them every once in awhile, and play with the kids, and act like a giant monster as well by roaring like a beast and feeling massive all the time. And also keeping the people safe. This is my monster idea.... MARYZILLA!!!!\" Mary said just as she shows a picture of her in some swimsuit, but with a Godzilla like look as well except for the head (The pale part, etc). Her hands, and feet are in green scales, and they have talons and claws for the hands and feet. Maryzilla in the image was also seen breathing her atomic breath at buildings. Cindy likes it as she can see that happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it. I will try my best, but be ready to accept the...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Responsibilities, I shall!\" Mary said, determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Time to make Maryzilla a reality!\" Cindy smiled.</span></div></div>",

She destroyed many vehicles along the way and once she stopped, she picked up one of the car and breathed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"RRAAAWWRRR!!!\" Mary roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The roar were very loud and even made crack on the windows of the building.

They move to Tokyo so they could stay away from the discrimination against the kaiju since not all country accepts the existence of kaiju. Mary was saddned by what she said and Alice just continued to smile to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Besides...who wants a Jewish kaiju like me?\" Alice said, \"The people here might have accepted me for who I am, but I know deep inside not all people would like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then I'll accept you then, alice chan.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Alice looked at mary and smiled, thanking her for what she said and turned back to the breakfast.</span></div></div>",

She knelt again, begging for forgivness and then porozi continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Look, I know you need to regenerate to regain your power. But for now you need to train this girl, since she is now YOUR apprentice.\" Porozi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Um..what do you mean  by that?\" Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Basically, any kaiju who wishes to take an apprentice, they must give some of their power to the fledgling.\" Porozi said, \"She gave some to you, so you are her apprentice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mary and others were surprised to hear that as mary was more then just a kaiju girl, but a defender of the earth. Mary was hesitant at first but deep in her heart she always believed in true peace. She made a fist and then spoke to cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Then please! continue with our training in the future!\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Cindy have forgotten about the ritual as she was going to  be master if she gave some of the power to the other. She looked at her master, and she just smiled. Cindy sighed and nodded, turned to cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Alright, alright.\" Cindy said, \"We'll train soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The others clapped and Porozi clapped her hand twice, and they got out of the domain and came back to the domitory.

She tasted the bullies for minute and swallowed them whole. She felt the bullies going down her throat and plopping into her stomach. She felt many urges to do something private but kept that for later as she was going to become the goddess of the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What should we do now, cindy?\" Harumi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Destroy this citys capital.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soyumi Nataokne was a serial killer, filled with hatred for society. Over a period of 3 years she was responsible for the murders of so many people, shot as she seduced them, sometimes letting rip with a machine gun if she wanted extra thrills. This proved her undoing as society caught up with her and she has spent the last several years locked up in a jail without parole. She was only 27 years old. After the initial severe incarceration, she settled down and the rules were relaxed a little. She had a lot of time to read, get educated, keep fit, and she had developed an incredibly taut figure with large F-cup breasts and a behind to die for..........she was allowed to accumulate possessions (controlled of course) and was allowed to wear her own clothes. However underneath her model prisoner exterior she still harboured dark thoughts, thoughts of hatred for society, her bad upbringing, the way she had been exploited, and she really wanted the world to suffer, and at her hands.........and some of her freedoms, well-intentioned and good, helped keep that going. Frequently dressing herself in the leathers she liked wearing as she went on her killing sprees, boots, trousers, jacket, gloves, matching her glorious long black hair, she often relived in her imagination her glory days and fuelled her hatred further.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne fateful day her dreams were fulfilled in a totally unexpected way........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, walking outside in a recreation period, teasing the guards flaunting her black leather clad body, she and everybody else gradually became aware of a rhythmic noise and slight shaking of the ground. An earthquake? It was too regular. What's more it seemed to be getting closer......suddenly it was very apparent what was happening and panic ensued as people fled in terror. All except for Soyumi, who stood there open mouthed and transfixed. The source of the noise and tremors was standing there in the street outside the prison. It was a humanoid creature, shaped and with a face like a young woman of the sexy kind, humanoid as her skin was an unusual pale colour and her ears were almost feline in shape, as they poked through lustrous long purple hair. She was dressed in an incredibly figure hugging bodysuit, with boots to the knee over the trousers, gloves to the elbow over the top and a belt which seemed to have some kind of weapon attached and the top was unzipped revealing an awe inspiring cleavage, emphasized by an incredibly large pendant round her neck, and was standing there gloved hands on hips and seemed to be looking straight at Soyumi. The other very obvious feature was her size, she had to be at least 100 feet (30 metres) tall. And had used he size to crash through the neighbouring streets to get where she was now as her boots rested on several squashed cars, the debris of shattered houses littering the landscape behind her for quite a way (up to what appeared to be portal which was closing as we speak).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature fiddled with the pendant and began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiiiiiii, I'm Cindy, and I would like you to help me destroy the world\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah! Extreme!\", thought Soyumi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy saw the body language....\"let me explain, excuse my directness but that is how we are. My job is conquest, to lay waste planets, as a form of worship to our chief goddess and to provide eventual living space as our race grows in numbers, and this seems an eminently suitable place to smash and destroy and exterminate the life forms. To show us around and to help our conquests, we have a programme to develop apprentices. We have ways of researching suitable people and you seemed to be he perfect fit....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoyumi again was open mouthed, she couldn't believe what she was hearing. She looked again at the creature, she was beautiful, and let what she had heard sink in. After being the confines of prison and fellow inmates and guards, Cindy was refreshing and Soyumi felt something stir in her, something tingling in her being, and as she thought about what she had heard she began to like it, to thrill to it, what an opportunity....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure...\"....Soyumi answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy smiled.......\"don't move, don't be afraid, just stay there\", as she said hat she knelt down onto the street with a resounding crash and clutching the prison wall not too carefully such that it partially collapsed and took hold of Soyumi and hoisted her high. Getting up again she brought her to her face, and Cindy smiled, Soyumi was beautiful as well and very quickly put the 4 inch Soyumi to her lips and kissed her. Soyumi didn't know how to react, it was all happening so quickly, but before any further thoughts crossed her mind Soyumi felt something........she looked at herself, she was growing.......Cindy put Soyumi down beside her and she continued growing. It didn't take long for her to reach Cindy's height when the growth stopped. Soyumi looked at her self, same Soyumi, same leather clothes but......as she looked around and down, she smiled....and she too had booted feet on squashed cars......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.........\"</span></div></div>",

Destroy some stuff? I know so much about you and want to see what you are made of?\u201d, said Cindy, gloved hands on slim catsuit covered hips. Soyumi thought she noticed Cindy slightly biting her lip, surely not. But she said the word grow, now that sounded brilliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take the 100ft tall Soyumi much time to start. First she stepped on more cars, delighting in the crunch, making sure they were as flat as possible and merging with the crumbled tarmac, there was an extra frisson of excitement in her when she noticed splashes of red in the mix. She sauntered along the street stepping on things and stroking her gloved hands on some buildings lining the street watching masonry fall on to the ground below adding to the panic. She had been surprisingly a little hesitant to start with, not quite sure how to proceed, or maybe she still couldn\u2019t believe what had happened to her and that she was now able to do this, but quite quickly she warmed to it, now shoving over buildings with abandon, crashing through houses, stepping on cars and people, and gradually laughs and giggles joined the sounds of panic and destruction in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c****ing destroy the b******s\u201d, said Cindy under her breath, watching her new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 so freely exercising her new size. Soyumi thought she heard Cindy say something but again discounted it. Soyumi felt liberated as she smashed the neighbourhood with abandon, delighting in destroying buildings, infrastructure, people and their lives and livelihoods, delighting at last in being to destroy her fellow human beings and playing her part in bringing the world down for all she felt it had done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy couldn\u2019t resist\u2026.shutting her eyes she willed Soyumi to grow\u2026..Cindy herself grew alongside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c****! This is amazing!\u201d, Soyumi said as she looked at herself as she expanded further. The she glimpsed Cindy growing likewise\u2026\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 of them grew and grew\u2026.200ft, 300ft\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.at 600ft they both stopped. Soyumi was speechless. She looked around, her boots were buried in the wreckage of several apartment blocks, houses looked so steponable, most structures were shorter than her, and cars\u2026.she picked up a few and felt them crunch as she squeezed them in her gloved hand and let them fall\u2026\u2026and people\u2026..hahahahaha she thought\u2026\u2026\u2026each a squishable 2/3 inch high\u2026\u2026She looked at Cindy who smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI so enjoyed watching you do that, baby\u201d, said Cindy. \u201cYou\u2019re so ****ing awesome, you know, you\u2019ve passed the first test with flying colours. You realise I haven\u2019t grown many of my apprentices so soon, but it was, like, so appropriate\u201d. Soyumi thought she could see Cindy biting her lip again\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow wait there, I\u2019ll come over, I have more for you\u2026\u2026\u201d. Without hesitation Cindy sauntered over to where Soyumi was standing transfixed, smashing all in her path, why bother walking round, she was tall enough and powerful enough and anyway, inferior beings and their surroundings really weren\u2019t important\u2026\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will be purely neutral and such, but it is different in a huge way. It won't feel very apprentice like at all in it and will actually be a lot more personal than ever. Well here we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we all know that the giant monsters can be totally misunderstood and such, as they are massive, easily can scare people, and whatever. Well Cindy has went through the experience of being a giant monster girl living with the humans in a big city, and now wants to help another giant monster sized girl with powers adjust. Now for this purpose, Cindy is with the girl when she was born and is reported to become one day a giant monster girl thanks to some strange disease, and will be developing her size and immense powers like laser beams from her eyes and such. Cindy helps the city, people, and even the girl who becomes a monster herself, to adjust to life for the giant monster girl. Issues like schooling, food, making friends, and such, Cindy went through all of that and she can help any girl in need, and she did it for centuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, wanna try?

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><span class=\"cnavy\"><i>One day, a giantess from outer space arrives on earth. Taking an interest in the much smaller creatures that called themselves humans, the alien goddess decides to take one of their females under her wing as an apprentice. After finding an ideal candidate from among the planet's populace, the giantess uses her power to grow the human woman to new heights. Now we follow the story of what happens between a  goddess whose true intentions in coming to earth have yet to be revealed, and a normal woman who must now learn the ropes of being a giantess. Only time will tell how this pair will get along, and what they plan to do to the rest of the earth.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, there's the basic premise of this story. I will allow almost anything, but I don't want any male giants or futa stuff. Other than that, I want you to keep the giantesses' personalities in line with whatever route has been chosen in the first chapter. I don't want them to spontaneously go from good to evil, or vice versa. Of course, I am willing to be a bit more lenient with the apprentice, as she may have difficulties adjusting to her new size. But once she has settled on how she feels about the situation, I don't want her to be switching back either.Also, no ending the story! Always leave an <span class=\"cmaroon\">\"other\"</span> option in case someone else wants to continue down a different route. Also, one last note: If I don't feel that the apprentices personality is fitting for the route chosen, I will edit it to fix the issue. I am fairly lenient and will almost never delete a chapter. At worst, I'll usually edit out any issues that I see in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\"><br>\r\nA few things you should know about the alien goddess:<br>\r\n&gt; She can alter the size of any object with her mind (this would be how she enlarges her apprentice)<br>\r\n&gt; Her name is Cindy <br>\r\n&gt; Her physical appearance is the same as a human, except she has pointed ears like an elf (I'll let you make up what the rest of her traits are, but that is the only major difference between her and a human woman)<br>\r\n&gt; Her standard size is about 100 feet tall (but as mentioned above, she can alter her size with her mind to grow/shrink at will)<br>\r\n&gt; She is able to communicate with people telepathically<br>\r\n&gt; Her natural age is about 21 years old (by human standards, anyway), but she can alter her own age at will. Based on the age of her apprentice, she will change herself to be in the same age group</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgrape\"><br>\r\nNote: I would like it if you made one of the first chapters in each route a \"tutorial session\" type chapter, where Cindy shows her apprentice the ins and outs of being a giantess. This isn't a requirement or anything (and I honestly may not even do it myself) but it is something that I would like to see.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><u><br>\r\nIn order to improve the reading experience, I'll try to correct any spelling and grammar mistakes I find. I also reserve the right to make minor alterations to chapters if it is necessary to insert detail or correct one of the above rules being broken. If a chapter is too poorly written for me to fix, then it will be deleted. Chapters that I have to delete will not qualify for the GP reward.</u><br>\r\n</b></i></td>",
