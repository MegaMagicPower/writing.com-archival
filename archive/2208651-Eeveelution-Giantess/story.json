            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your eyes hurt, staring at the giant black sun above you. It\u2019s been so long since you\u2019ve been stranded, and you hated every second of it. You stopped tracking days, and just feel the time pass. The supplies in your lifeboat almost out as you\u2019ve been trying to keep them right. You were no survival man, but you know sea water is not good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so weird, the storm came out of nowhere. If you knew it was coming, you would not have taken the cruise. It was made for young singles in order to get young love. Funnily enough, because of it you are going to die alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were by yourself on the boat, as no one else was on before it got cut off. You were trying to prepare it, but you sort of got out with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly sit up, moving and looking at the rations you had left. Only for a little bit more, and you were feeling hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are gonna be dead in a couple of days. Might as well eat some now, no point dying hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need a miracle right now, luckily for you, a miracle is gonna be exactly what you get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Vaporeon, I want to go now!\u201d The young girl said, stomping her feet. She has been wanting to go for the past five minutes, having her towel and sunscreen on. She managed to get her oldest sister to take her to the beach, however for Vaporeon it had more preparations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm down Eevee, I will be out in a minute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to wait a minute!\u201d The brown girl whined. \u201cI want to go now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon heard her little sister, and frowned. She might as well just go now, as she knows how annoying her sister can be when she whines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror one final time, growing a smile as she looked over herself. With a big pair of tits and a bis juicy butt behind her, she was glad about her body. The bikini she was wearing was only making it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing her own towel she joined her sister. The young girl pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time, what took you so long?\u201d Who only got a laugh and a head pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll understand when you are older, now let\u2019s go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they left their home. Taking the short path down to the beach. Eevee was practically jumping around as they get going, and she made her way down to the ground. Stepping onto the sand under her furry foot and running ahead. A big smile on her face as she dropped the towel on the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically tripped down into the water with how fast she was going, and she collapsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee! Remember not too far!\u201d Vaporeon yelled, making sure as she needed to watch her sister. With an unrolling of her towel, she laid down. taking her glasses and putting it there. While she was a fantastic swimmer, she was as glad to just rest on the beach under the warm son. A little disappointed though, seeing there was no other Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Eevee, she was having fun in the water. Swimming under and feeling the waves over her large ears. She has always been told to never go past where she can touch, but little did her bigger sister\u2019s know, she\u2019s done it time and time before. A happy and playful snicker as she does it now. A couple of centimetres where she can\u2019t touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s about as far as she goes, until today though. Cause her eye spotted something even further away. Something she did not expect. It was a toy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish out the orange and toss the peel into the pile, you lay down onto your back. If you are going to die, at least you won\u2019t have scurvy. Not to mention your potassium will be great due to all the banana\u2019s you have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes, you will just rest in the sun, not really having any other things to do at this point. You just relax, for a long while. Until you heard something the peaked your interest, it seemed to sound like heavy waves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee made sure her sister didn\u2019t see her swimming that way, as she moved over and got into the deep end. Far from where she could touch. This was because her child like curiosity has gotten the better of her, and she wants to know what it is. The closer she got, the more it looked like a little boat. One that left her curious. What is a toy boat doing by itself.<br>\r\n\u2028She would inspect it, but she can\u2019t do that when she is swimming. She will have to drag it more back to sore. So when she got real close, she brought her hand around and grabbed it. Her body turning as she dragged it back to where she could stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n\u2028For you though, you almost had a heart attack! The heavy waves sounded like they got closer and closer, when all of a sudden a monster\u2019s hand came from the water! Swinging around and grabbing the edge of the boat. Her wrist above you as you froze like you were in a freezer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea if you were seeing a mirage, or if this was true. That answer became clear when the thing pulled the boat! Tremendous speed as you feel it pull the boat. Water dripping from the wet brown fur down onto your face as you were confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028What grabbed you? Was a sea monster? Sea monsters didn\u2019t have fur right, they had tentacles. Or at least you assumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually it stopped, coming to a stop as you trip. You see another hand come around, right next to the other one. Finally something raised up, and you saw the face of the sea monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not what you were expecting, as it ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>... was a little girl! Well not really little, or a normal girl either. She was furry with two shades of brown over her body, her face young and curious. She seemed more like a normal animal than a sea monster. Only humanised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around once again, seeing more of her torso. Was she wearing clothes? What kind of weird place are you in now. Are you dreaming? Are you hallucinating?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Eevee herself, she looked down onto the toy boat, seeing a small little creature on it. She was left confused and stunned about it, as she did not expect to see anything on it, and especially not something she recognised it. It wore dirty clothes, and had little hair. Only the top of it\u2019s head a bit on the mouth. It was on two feet just like her and her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe\u2019s always been a curious girl and she brought her face down closer to the creature. Seeing him on his feet freak out as he backs several times, trying to get his distance with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Get away from me! Whatever you are!\u201d You say to her as you were thinking about jumping overboard. The sharks were not gonna be as threatening as this girl is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can talk!\u201d She said, her voice being loud as you looked at the monster. It can talk, she can talk? You looked at each other for a couple of seconds until you heard another girl\u2019s voice yell out from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee! Where are you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head and yelled back, basically deafening you. \u201cRight here Vaporeon!\u201d She said as you were a bit confused. Eevee, Vaporeon? Defiantly not human names, what were these things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her brown eyes back onto you and you froze under her gaze. What was she planning to do? Suddenly she brought her fingers forward and right to you. You could do nothing at the scary sight as she grabbed you between her fingers. Of course you try to squirm and fight your way out, but comparing how big her fingers are to how small you are that is useless. You would barely be three inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought you out of the boat and right in front of her eye, hanging you there for a couple of seconds as you froze. What was she going to do to you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee was deciding something. You were far too interesting for her to ignore. She needed to take you back to her room, it was just a matter of how? She didn\u2019t want her older sister to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she decided, hiding you in her one piece would be the best thing to do. Leaning her face in she began to talk to you in her fingers. \u201cCan you please not move for like... a couple of minutes. I\u2019ll try to take your toy boat with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes go wide at what she was saying, and you barely had enough time to act, as she then brought you around. Her fingers at her one piece swimsuit digging at the side right near her arms. She opened it up and you were plunged right in! Unable to do anything as you feel a wet blanket of fur up against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the snap of her one piece pushed you in even further, as you were basically pinned to Eevee\u2019s body, unable to do something, or at least anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were up against her hip at the moment, feeling your body against it. She moved around and started to leave the water. Stepping onto the beach and going to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey big sis, is it okay if I go back to the house?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, we just got here. You were so annoying about going to the beach, and now you just want to leave? What\u2019s that in your hand?\u201d Her sister said leaning up, her boobs bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a toy boat, I wanna put it back in my room. Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, you can make the way back yourself.\u201d Her sister said waving him off, going down and laying on her towel. Eevee grabbed hers and quickly made it back to the home. They all lived near the beach, as it was just a short ten minutes walk down a path to the beach. Hence is why her older sister felt okay with letting her go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee made her way over, stepping off the sand and onto the dirt path as she cleaned herself with the towel. Until finally she was out of sight and moved on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurrounded by trees, she moved the boat on top of the towel and reached into her side. Fishing around for you as she tried to get you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get grabbed and lifted out. Feeling a bit of rug burn as she was doing this. You were zoomed around in the air so fast you barely had time to see what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you were brought and dropped onto your boat. Landing hard on the wood as you instantly became panicked. Looking up you could see the brown girl once again holding the boat. This time her background has changed, as you could see gigantic trees behind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry about taking you like that,\u201d She said, her eyes and smile now friendly as it lowered your guard just a bit. \u201cI just needed to get you and your toy boat out the water. We are on the way back to my home, I\u2019ll sneak you into my room so we can talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right.\u201d You say a bit weary of her. She noticed this, but did not speak up about it. You were scared, it made sense given the size. This girl looked about 11... maybe 12. Her body yet to develop, although little do you know it\u2019s already started. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was gonna ask the same thing to you, I\u2019ve never seen someone so small! My name is Eevee by the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>... My name is (Your Name.) I\u2019m a human. Do... you know what a human is?\u201d You say just making sure, however she didn\u2019t really give you an answer, but instead a confused face. You sighed about this, as that was not something you wanted. \u201cSo I wind up on a weird island with giant furry girls, what a weird world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why were you in a toy boat?\u201d Eevee questioned as she had her eyes on you. It was a bit unnerving but you answered the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a toy boat, it\u2019s an actual boat. I was in a shipwreck and... well i\u2019ve been by myself for the past couple of days.\u201d You say to her as she listens. Was there more tiny people like you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were gonna keep talking about it, but suddenly a shadow came in. Turning your head, you could see the massive two story house! Holy crap! It was almost unbeilable how big this thing looked. Normal size it would be considered a mansion, but to you... it was other worldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes wide open, you couldn\u2019t help but stare. If you weren\u2019t aware enough, you wouldn\u2019t of heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh your back Eevee.\u201d A voice say as you instinctively ducked down. Hiding on your stomach and out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee reacted too, but it was far later, her eyes going to you to see you hiding. She breathed a sigh of relief as she looked over to see her sister Leafeon! Crouching down in front of the door watering her flower bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hey.\u201d She said, her eyes going to you. Her smile giving her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you have fun down at the beach with Vaporeon?\u201d She questioned, making a hole as she plants some seeds. Due to her and her alone, the outside of the home was covered with flowers, plants, vegetables and fruit trees. She loved nature, and she loved her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yes I did. I\u2019m gonna go to my room now.\u201d Eevee said making her way to the door, about to walk in as she got stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot so fast.\u201d Her big sister said standing up. \u201cYou are still dripping a bit, you can\u2019t go in wet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh w-w-w-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me help you with that.\u201d Leafeon said with a smile, making her way and grabbing the towel from her sister. \u201cArms up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee listened and raised her arms and the boat high. Her sister then gave her a wipe down, drying her sister as she wore a smile. Eventually the little brown girl got clean as Leafeon smiled.  You looking down and seeing her sister, as she looked nice. Loose clothes, a friendly smile and kind eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, all clean. Now make sure to put that in the laundry.\u201d She said, trying to put her sister in a good habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay I will, thank you Leafeon, you\u2019re the best!\u201d She said as she made her way in, thankful that you didn\u2019t get spotted. She stepped inside and you couldn\u2019t help but peak out, seeing the giant home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-How many sister\u2019s do you have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeven.\u201d She said as your eyes went wide. Suddenly, you began to get a lot worried. So many. She was going to go upstairs, but first she had to put the towel away. That was her first priority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved and you saw the world zoom by, far faster then you could even see. She moved so far that your view zoomed from the hallway to the kitchen to one of the two bathrooms. She got inside and dropped the towel in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for something to cover Eevee\u2019s eyes. You tried to look, but only saw a ribbon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess who~\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSylveon!\u201d Eevee said with a giggle, as she got turned around (With the boat.) She moved around and you could see another one of her sisters. Pink, and... well curvy. Her breasts were... absurdly huge. To the point where they were more like balloons. Staying down of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re back already, I was gonna join you down there, darn!\u201d The perky girl said as Eevee giggled, something she does often with her sister. She was always so fun to be with. Pausing she remembered you, her eyes shifting to your hiding form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly her sister also did. \u201cWoah what is that! A boat! Can I see? Can I see?\u201d She said, the girl getting worryingly close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No!\u201d She said suddenly, getting a confused face. \u201cI mean... Vaporeon is still down at the beach. If you go now maybe you can catch her and have fun down there. Maybe?\u201d Eevee said trying to hide you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I guess so. I\u2019ll have to get a bikini and a quick change! Bye Eevee!\u201d Her sister said as she got moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee quickly walked back, moving and moving as she left the laundry, only to pause. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were curious about this, as you brought yourself up to see where you were and why she stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two were in the kitchen and... it was just one sister after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was a yellow one, with spiky hair and fur, and in a training bra. Of course she was. She was drinking down water pretty heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Eevee was freezing for a good reason. Jolteon with a little harmless guy is not good. Eevee gets picked on hard enough, you don\u2019t need that either. With a run, Eevee escaped running through the room. She ran for a long while as she got up the stairs, until she entered her room. Breathing a sigh of relief as she was finally there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes turn down to you, seeing your laying body. Little did she know, all that running was throwing you around heavily. She moved over and sat down onto the bed talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo many sisters.\u201d You say simply. \u201cThere\u2019s those three, then the one down at the beach, plus three more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep you safe in here okay.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well you don\u2019t really have any other options, and she seems nice. A bit embarrassing but it\u2019s better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo..\u201d She said down to you. Her eyes directly on you. \u201cA-Are you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yeah a bit, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll get you some food!\u201d She said jumping and excited. She put you and the boat to the side as you panic for a quick second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey wait! Eevee you don\u2019t need to!\u201d You yelled, but it landed on death ears as she did not listen. She ran out and closed the door There was a small gap, but you weren\u2019t gonna risk it. Truth is you had food in the boat you can eat, so she didn\u2019t need to. But she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eevee ran down the room, she planned on just getting you some bread that Leafeon has grown, however she got stopped by another sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, can you come in here!\u201d A voice said. The young girl back up slightly, seeing her sister at the bathroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what\u2019s up Glaceon?\u201d Eevee questioned, only to get grabbed and pulled in. \u201cWhahhh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold still Eevee. I\u2019m just fixing those eyebrows.\u201d Glaceon said leaning in, with tweezers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy eyebrows, what\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTheir far too bushy! Just stay still and i\u2019ll fix them. Remember you owe me.\u201d Glaceon said as Eevee broke free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, i\u2019m good.\u201d She said, knowing the danger of owing Glaceon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, come back!\u201d Glaceon yelled as he sister just ran away, not thinking much of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve decided to just wait for her, and not eat your little food. She seemed excited to get you some, so you will just have to wait. Although you do get the joy of looking around the room. Nothing out of the ordinary about it, although it seemed not to have technology in it, not like you were expecting it. She had a bunch of clothes on the ground, a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, this girl\u2019s a bit dirty. She\u2019s young so that makes sense.\u201d You keep talking to yourself, as you\u2019ve grown accustom to it with your time of isolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat became a problem, as you heard a sound and freaked out. It was the door creaking open! You dive right down, underneath as you were hiding. Was that Eevee? Was the one of her sisters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising your head, you barely look up as you see the giantess. She had black fur, with yellow highlights. Even in her eyes, as it was as bright as a cats. The thing that scared you, was how emotionless she was. You couldn\u2019t even read her expression.  Nor could you tell if she actually saw your or not. Maybe talking to yourself alerted her, cause that would be dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she gave up. As she simply walked away, her expression not changing one bit. She left and you breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ntoo scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eevee walked her way into the kitchen, Jolteon wasn\u2019t there, but two other sisters were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Espeon, do we have any sweet bread left?\u201d Eevee asked her sister, who was reading. The girl\u2019s favourite pass time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her glasses. \u201cThird column, second row draw wrapped in a paper bag tied in a reef knot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh... thanks.\u201d Espeon was always the kind to give more information needed. She went back to her book as she looked where was instructed. Digging in and grabbing it. She pulled a slice out as she turned to her other sister. \u201cHey Flareon, can you heat it up for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer older sister jumped a bit, little startled at the sudden attention to her. Hiding one eye behind her long hair and talked. \u201cW-Well, I guess. B-Bring it here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee smiled. She brought the bread in front and was ready for her to heat it up. Although she had to turn her head. Flareon didn\u2019t really have the confidence to due it with an audience. As one of the oldest sister, she was the most shy and scared. Eevee was able to piece it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, Flareon growing up had both Vaporeon and Jolteon to deal with, and they would not be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Done.\u201d She said as Eevee turned, seeing the bread now hot. She grabbed it and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Flareon! Bye, i\u2019ll be in my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChange out of your swimsuit.\u201d Espeon commented, not raising her eyes from the book. \u201cIt isn\u2019t proper anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine.\u201d She said with a laugh, moving ahead. She went to her room as she broke in. Closing it once again with a smile. \u201cHey... i\u2019m back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank goodness.\u201d You say back to her, raising up off the boat. \u201cI thought you were your weird sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmbreon, you met Umbreon?\u201d She questioned as you laughed. Seems like everyone thinks of her as weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, she might have heard me, not sure. What you got there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s bread!\u201d She said happily and with a smile. She moved around and grabbed you putting you on her lap and out of the boat. She put you onto her lap as she then broke a size off, giving it to you. \u201cSweet bread that is, take a bite it\u2019s really good!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen and do just that, take a bite with a smile. \u201cHm... so good.\u201d You say to her as she wore a smile, taking a huge bite out of the rest herself. You could see her take a big bite as you were a bit stunned. Guess that\u2019s what happens when you have a bigger mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two ate for silence in a long while until you ate all you could. Half of your small piece, only half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring it back and talk to her. \u201cSo... i\u2019m staying with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha- Of course yes! Was that not clear before. I want you here\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike as a pet or...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>... As my little friend.\u201d She said with a smile, a smile that calmed you down a lot. She\u2019s a nice giant girl, and well, you are fresh out of options. You don\u2019t even know where you are, or if you are on Earth anymore. Eevee has never seen a human before, so it is up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d you say to her as she smiles as well. That was exactly what she wanted to hear. \u201cStill, if you set up like a little box for me to live in, that would be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA box? I might have one of those around.\u201d She said as she put you to the side as she got up. Some bread in her mouth as she goes looking around her room, eventually finding just that, a cardboard box. \u201cThis good?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY-Yeah.\u201d You say as it was at least from your perspective like a giant house. Still you had a question. \u201cHey, where did you get cardboard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh from the village, it\u2019s not too far away. My sister Glaceon. She got whatever was inside and gave me the box. It was the weirdest thing too, inside of it was a weird looking pink thing. The shape of a zucchini.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, moving on!\u201d You say to her as she listens. Putting the box onto the ground and grabbing you. She shifted you around and brought you down, placing you in the middle as you look around. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty nice. Could use some things in it. Do you have doll stuff or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I can still fill it up! Like with this!\u201d She said moving over and grabbing something. She placed it next to you and you could see a giant white sock, with brown fur over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was better than nothing, so you move down onto it. \u201cUh... i\u2019d rather a clean one but still, comfy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d get that, but first I got to switch my clothes, just wait in there okay!?\u201d Eevee said as she then got up. Going away from you. You couldn\u2019t see much from your point of view as she changed, and you were okay with that. Although every now and then, her wagging tail came into view for you, the giant brown tail moving. When Eevee came back, she was in much more casual clothes. A loose white tan top as well as blue booty shorts. She looked like a normal girl her age, well except for the brown fur, the animal ears and the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay i\u2019m back  what have you been thinking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell nothing much, those are pretty annoying.\u201d You say to her, pointing to the cardboard flaps that have been open. They hung over it and blocked part of your view from the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does, well let me fix that!\u201d She said happily as she leaned her way forward. Leaning forward and ripping the flaps off. To the point where you had no room. To say her little display of strength didn\u2019t scare you would be an outright lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore a smile as she asked. \u201cBetter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah it is.\u201d You say as she grabs the box. Your whole shaking around as you trip. She lifted the box up and put it down at the foot of her bed. \u201cThere, you can stay there. So my sister\u2019s wont see it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Great.\u201d You say as you lay down onto the sock. You need a rest. You may have been at sea for a long while but this experience has been weirder. You plan to just relax at that point, however when you opened your eyes you could see Eevee peering her way down into the box, Big and bright as you looked back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to sleep?\u201d She questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-Not sleep, just a rest. Been through a lot.\u201d You say to her as she understands, although it was not something that she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... okay, I just thought now that we\u2019ve set everything up we could have some fun.\u201d She said, a bit disappointed about it. You looked back to her for a little while before sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, you want to play?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my gosh! Yes!\u201d She said fast, bringing her fingers down and grabbing you. You were flown around by her hand, but only for a little while, cause she brought you where she wanted you to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were thrown around as she placed you onto the ground. Right by her furry soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then stood up, and it was at this point you saw her at her full height. It was insane. She was much bigger than you thought, and you felt much smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey... before we play what do you want me to do with this?\u201d She questioned grabbing the boat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got over your worryness as you replied. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past days in that boat all day, I frankly don\u2019t want to see it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I might keep it. Maybe it can be a fun toy when i\u2019m down the river or beach.\u201d She said as she brought it to the bottom of her bed and stuffed it under, with so many others. It wasn\u2019t intentional, but she did give you quite the view of her lingering butt over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot something you wanted to happen, just something that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she came back and clapped her hands together. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s play a game!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but after that you got to let me rest, I really need one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee was considerate, so of course she let this happen. \u201cDeal, but I get to pick the game, and you can\u2019t argue about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d You say back as she was really a kind girl. Guess her parents raised her right, or all her sisters. You were still a bit confused about this family dynamic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so i\u2019ve decided, that we are... going to play stomp!!!!\u201d She said, happily waiting for your reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Stomp.\u201d You say filled with nervousness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cIt\u2019e real simple,\u201d Eevee explained to you with raising her finger. \u201cYou have to run around, and i\u2019m going to have to try and stomp on you! You can\u2019t leave this room, or go under anything. We will see how long you can do it!\u201d She said as this was something that worried you immensely. \u201cDon\u2019t panic though, I promise to step on you softly. To the point where it will feel like a pillow. So you up for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess.\u201d You say back to her. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t plan on trampling me, it should be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGame starts now!\u201d She said eagerly, almost like she couldn\u2019t wait to start the game. You took the hint, and started playing. Running and sprinting away from her as she giggled above. She found this very and was so excited to play with you like that. Raising her foot, she brought it right down and stomped it behind you, playfully laughing as she saw you narrowly dodge it. If she got you under her first foot fall, it would of been funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dodged and kept moving as you remember the rules. You can\u2019t hide under anything like her bed, and you don\u2019t have any winning condition. So you were just playing to put a smile on her face, which funnily enough you were okay with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move and run dodging her foot as it planted next to your left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, almost got you that time! Keep running little guy! I\u2019m going to get you!\u201d She said with a laugh and giggle. Chasing you around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted her feet several time and you dodged every single one. You did have it on easy at the moment. Due to her not wanting to step onto you hard, she had slow steps and you had plenty of time to dodge and avoid.<br>\r\n\u2028Doesn\u2019t change the fact that you were starting to feel tired and a bit weary. You have been running for so long, and Eevee was still fine. In fact she seemed to love seeing you scurry around beneath her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did this for so long, until finally she caught you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a plan of hers, as she stomped down in front of you, causing you to turn and run the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going left, however her other foot stomped your way giving you little time to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou change course and started running away. sprinting between your legs as it was the closest option you really had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she suddenly dropped off her feet. She dropped down onto her rear as you see the whole body of the girl collapsing. It was like a cave in, and you could do nothing about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came right down and landed on her rear, quickly she perked up and looked around to see if you were still running or if you got caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she felt you, moving and wiggling under one of her thighs. She grew a smile about it as she looked at you. Your whole body trapped under, except of your arms and your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got you! I got you! I win the game!\u201d She cheered, raising her hands up in victory. It was an adorable sight, and you still talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you won, you got me. Although not with your foot.\u201d You say as she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this also counts.\u201d She said with a shrug. She waited and left you there for a while. She just smiled down to you as you felt her furry thigh onto you. It was weird, as it felt like you were under a carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking up about it you question. \u201cSo... are you gonna lift it off of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to do it by yourself.\u201d She said as you can tell the playful look on her smile. \u201cSee if you are strong enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and I both know I am not, but... sure why not.\u201d You say as you plan to entertain the kid, putting your hands onto the ground and trying to lift her amazing thigh off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not though, in fact you couldn\u2019t even move her sitting thigh. She was too powerful for you, as it was like you were trying to lift a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, I can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, I know, I just wanted to see you do it.\u201d She said as she moved around, getting up as she shifted back. You got up only for a second, until you could see her foot against you. Her sole in front of you as you were a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201ci was thinking, I didn\u2019t get the chance to really step on you, so... can I?\u201d She questioned as you thought about it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing under feet was not something you were really excited for. At the same time though, this girl was being too gracious and kind to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, a soft step though. And I\u2019m going to bed right after.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it! Oh!\u201d She said showing her white canines in a smile. She moved her foot to you and before you could understand what was happening, she brought it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing into your face and pressing into your body. She caused you to fall onto your back as her foot then rested on you. Turning your head so you don\u2019t get a face full of foot, it was not something you were expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee herself loved it, as she put her hands to her cheeks and held her breath. She has no way to hide how much she was enjoying it. To feel you under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to have you there as long as she can, but she was respectful enough not to do that. She was raised right... by Leafeon. None of her other sister\u2019s really contributed correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted it off of you as you smiled. \u201cOkay, you had your fun. Can I sleep now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Of course!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After Eevee moved her foot off of you, she reached down and picked you up. Holding you close to her chest as she moves around, laying on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her stomach, she dropped you into the box, right onto the sock. She could of been a bit more softer with the landing, but you were too tired. You needed to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis whole day has been unbeilable, not bad just insane. You needed to rest. You don\u2019t even care if it\u2019s on a girl\u2019s sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing your eyes and resting, you were about to sleep, until of course you hear Eevee above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... did you enjoy your first day with me?\u201d She was of course wanting yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why you gave it to her. \u201cY-Yeah I did. Let me just sleep, today\u2019s been a bit hectic for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Got it. Well goodnight I guess. When I go to sleep, i\u2019ll try not to wake you little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Eevee.\u201d Was the last thing you said until you rested. Eevee watched over you for a little bit, until she decided to leave you be. Walking out of the room with little sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t hide her smile, and you were all she could think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look happy today Eevee.\u201d Her sister said, walking by her younger sister\u2019s door. It was Umbreon. Of course Umbreon wasn\u2019t wearing a smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... well I guess it\u2019s been a good day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Eevee came back later that night, planning to go to sleep herself. You went to sleep in the middle of the day for her, so she stayed up a couple more hours until Leafeon got her ready for bed. Eevee walked in rubbing her eyes. She\u2019s already brushed and all she had to do was change and sleep. She came in and checked on you in the box, to see that you were sleeping still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile she changed her clothes into her pyjama\u2019s, white and brown. This was a great day, and she got a new friend in you. It surely was not what she was expecting, but she was so happy about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also thinking about if she should show you to her other sisters. Some would be okay with you, some Eevee wants you nowhere near. Leafeon, Sylveon, Flareon and Umbreon is on the good list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon, Jolteon, Espeon and Glaceon is on the bad list. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless she was going to decide later, as she climbed into her bed and got under the blanket. Resting her head on the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she followed you to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up about an hour before Eevee, and with nothing to do you\u2019ve just been waiting in the box. It was not like you really had a way to escape, so you were waiting. You were planning on tackling this day much better than tomorrow. Sure, it\u2019s your normal life (Normal would be the furthest way to describe today.) but it\u2019s still a good one. Much better than what yesterday was like. So you wait with a smile on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, time to wake up.\u201d You hear a door creak open and a voice say. One of her sisters and if you remembered the voice correctly, Leafeon. She seemed nice, you would be okay if Eevee showed you to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEhhhh.\u201d She said as you hear her stirring. Leafeon gave a giggle and moved away, while you remained quiet until you were sure Leafeon was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Eevee! Down here!\u201d You say to her as you could hear her whole mattress moving around crazily. Eevee got to the foot and looked down in the box, seeing you standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she was okay with being woken up. You were still there, and now happier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grew a smile as she reached her hand down. It was a bit startling as her fingers came and wrapped around you once again. Holding you as she lifted you to her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d She swung her legs around and rested them on the floor. \u201cAre you excited for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am, been awake for an hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, well you should of woke me as well!\u201d She said as you laugh at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t really leave the box, anyway. What\u2019s planned for today? What do you do around here. Do you go to.... school or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really, I do have to read books every now and then, but most days I just spend having fun!\u201d She said happily and with a cheer. \u201cThis time with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was good to know, and you were gonna go ahead and relax with her. She moved up and placed you onto the bed as she looked over herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me change out of my PJ\u2019s and then i\u2019ll get you breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd a bath, i\u2019m kind of sick of being dirty.\u201d You say to her. You didn\u2019t really jump into the water while you were in the boat. Fear of sharks and all of that. \u201cAs well as some new clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... I don\u2019t think I can do that. My clothes are just too big for you.\u201d She said as you understand. Clothes your size don\u2019t come normally, and your suitcase would be bottom of the ocean at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to change and you turned around, making sure not to see her changing form. As Eevee looked at her clothes, she was going to grab something casual but paused. She saw something at the back, and she was going to put it on for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t bother looking until she said she was finished. Once you did you turned around, and she was watching something you weren\u2019t expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short white sundress. One that stopped at her knees and looked clean. Almost like it was never worn before. White with red polka dots. On her brown fur, it admittedly looked cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d She questioned you.</span></div></div>",

She reached down for you and grabbed you, holding you in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Eevee, be careful please. Getting grab is a bit weird.\u201d You say to her as she understood about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Oh. Sorry about that, anyway do you want a bath, since you look a bit dirty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave you this, and you are wearing a smile about it. Enjoying about it as you tell her. \u201cSure! Let\u2019s do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved around and leaves her room. Peaking her head out one final time to make sure her sister wasn\u2019t there. She quickly skates her way over to the bathroom. Walking in and placing you onto the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you can take a bath here. Let em fill up the water for you.\u201d She said as she put in the plug, and started to work. You waited for it to fill up as you try to think about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we go, it\u2019s full!\u201d She said turning back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, since I did it for you, can you turn around as well once I get naked?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right!\u201d She yelled, turning away and looking away. You wear a smile as you start to take off your clothes as well. You were naked in no time, and you move over into the water even faster. Going down and under as you swim. It was perfect, like a spring hot bath. In fact it might be spring. You swim back up as you wear a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay you can look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee turned around, seeing you swimming in the middle as she loved it. \u201cSo cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh uh thanks.\u201d You say to her nervously laughing. \u201cYou got it perfect! If i\u2019m being honest I feel bad for you that you can\u2019t get in here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho says I can\u2019t!\u201d She says, taking the challenge as she brings her hand down. Plunging it right into the water and next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, pretty nice.\u201d She says as you two just relax and chat for each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what are we going to do after this? You got the plan ready?\u201d You question her just wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn\u2019t, but she was quick to come up with an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about the both of us just laying on my bed. You can lay on my stomach!\u201d She said, her towering form over you with a smile. It was a little intimidating, but it was Eevee so you don\u2019t dwell on it. \u201cDoes that sound nice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMost definitely!\u201d You say to her as she smiled. \u201cOh, also I thought of a way I can wear clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, can you tell me?\u201d Eevee said as she seemed actually interested about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you get me just a small fabric, not only can I tie it around my waist like a towel, but I can probably shape them into clothes, or at very I can guide you into doing it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be great!\u201d I can do that, I can do that right now if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second Eevee!\u201d You yelled, wanting her to stay. She did not though, as she left the room. Guess she was a fan of the idea, which was not good for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were you going to do? More accurately what can you do. Not like you can get out of the place, so you were still taking a sink bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move around and rest down into the water. Closing your eyes and just taking in the great water. Eevee was probably out looking for fabrics at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were planning on just laying down until one of them comes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, it was not going to be that simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one of the sisters came in! You heard the door creak open slightly as you got alerted. You were gonna ask if it was Eevee, but you were gonna be careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich one of my siblings let the water rest in here. How annoying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not Eevee! You move around and rest down below, dropping your body under the water as you tried not to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole body crammed into a ball in the corner and your mouth under the water. Breathing through your nose, you watch as a giant girl came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like Eevee, but had a skinnier body, pink fur and glasses on her face. Admittedly, the glasses were pretty nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon herself, needs to wash her hands. she\u2019s always been the experimental type, and that has grown into cooking. She finds the perfect mixtures, and Leafeon cooks them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sisters alway work together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she brought her fingers down, you stayed in the corner afraid. You don\u2019t know anything about this sister, she could be dangerous. Hurtful even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you are gonna stay down and not move around, or at least that was your plan until the giant cat swung her hands around. Cleaning them into the water as you felt yourself fly around. You had to stay under the water, and with eyes wide open you sae the fingers around. Smashing into each other as she cleaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic arose in you as you turn and began to try and swim away. Not easy so you had to just avoid at the last second. Fighting your way out as she swings her hands around, almost hitting you next!</span></div></div>",

You have been hiding this entire time, but you are certain she would feel you as soon as you touch her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, you were also losing air. Losing air at this point as you wanted to swim up and get your breath. You were done for, for so many reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon!!!\u201d A new girl yelled, Eevee at the door and seeing her sister washing her hands. Her eyes wide open as she looked down quickly, trying to find where you are. \u201cW-What are you doing!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWashing my hands, cleaning off the spices and hey!!!\u201d Espeon changed course when she felt her younger sister bump into her. Enough to send her stepping back several times. \u201cWhat was that for!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was Eevee\u2019s chance as she moved her hands down under. Sticking them in and searching around for you. Eventually she felt something, and wasted no time pulling you out. Her fist closed around you. Which was perfect timing as Espeon came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey what was that for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I uh...\u201d She said, trying to find a reason to justify her actions to her older sister. She didn\u2019t really find one, so she just ran. Turning quick and escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t the best thing, but with Espeon who seems to know when her sister\u2019s are lying, well it was smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran down the house, until she got out of the house and hid under one of the windowsills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her hand, and looked down to you. \u201cA-Are you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I need fresh air!\u201d You say to her as you take heavy breaths. The caring girl above you as she felt bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I shouldn\u2019t have left you alone, I\u2019m so sorry! I feel like a big dummy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax Eevee, now you know for next time.\u201d You say to her as she was looking right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2019re not mad?\u201d She questioned as you laughed on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, now you know. Simple as that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... you are the best!!!\u201d She cheered, bringing you to her chest and pressing you against it. You felt it against you, and you had to admit, you didn\u2019t think she was at that age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t big, but at your size they were noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled you back as she smiled. \u201cSo uh... what no-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee?\u201d A voice said as you got cut off. Acting quick she held you there, holding you against her chest for a very long time. Turning her head, she could see Jolteon at the door! She was at the door at the moment, a bottle of water in her hand and sweat covering her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hi Jolteon, c-come back from your jog!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d She said wiping her hand, getting some sweat off. \u201cWent twice the distance today, damn i\u2019m good.\u201d She said back with a smirk. \u201cSo what are you doing squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Don\u2019t call me that. I\u2019m big now.\u201d She said pouting her lip. Jolteon saw the chance and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but you\u2019re still the smallest in the house squirt.\u201d And to add insult to injury, she patted Eevee on the head. \u201cHow about you come for a jog with me next time. You can see just how unstoppable your big sis is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou peered through the fingers, seeing the egotistical girl that was her sister. Seriously she has too much sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s good for you!\u201d Jolteon said not backing up. \u201cMaybe you can get some sweat abs like mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolteon showed this off, lifting her tight shirt and shocked her six pack. She seemed to have a real good athletic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m good.\u201d She repeated as Jolteon simply walked by her. A laugh as she left going back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you are gonna have to explain to me all your sisters.\u201d You say to her as she understood that was the smart thing. She got up and moved back inside, making sure to get to her room quickly and this time, closing the door. \u201cYou gonna tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d She replied, coming down and placing you onto the bed. She got onto her knees in front and told you. \u201cI have 8 sisters. Vaporeon is the oldest, the one down at the beach. She\u2019s very confident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it, next.\u201d You say seeing how much sisters she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe second one is Jolteon, she\u2019s the one you just met.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith the abs, got it. Next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen there is Flareon, you haven\u2019t met her yet. She\u2019s nice, but a bit shy. I\u2019ve made her jump several times. But she is nice!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, nice is what I like. Next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEspeon\u2019s next, she was the one who almost felt you in the bath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I...\u201d Wait, have you forgotten this entire time. You stop as you close your legs and cover yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext is Umbreon,\u201d She said just continuing. \u201cShe\u2019s got black fur and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYellow highlights. Yeah I met her before, she almost spotted me remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, she\u2019s got good ears so we need to be careful with her. Next is Leafeon,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one with the garden, got it. Next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGlaceon. She\u2019s got blue fur and... well she got me this dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, is she like the fashion sister or-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo she\u2019s the... worrying sister.\u201d Eevee said as you could actually see fear in her eyes. That is worrying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen Sylveon. Watch out, she\u2019s full of energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery full if I were to tell.\u201d You say to her with a smile. \u201cWell they seem nice, now... can you get me some clothes, I think we left mine in the bathroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... here.\u201d She said getting up and grabbing a tissue. Ripping it in half and handing it to you. It wasn\u2019t the best, but it was better than nothing. You put on the tissue, wearing it like a towel around your waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank Eevee! Now what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... how about...</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not the worse she could think of, and you might even have some fun with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Logically, you agree. \u201cSure, let\u2019s play. Let\u2019s give me a win now though. As in... if you don\u2019t catch me in a minute, I win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but if I do, I win!\u201d She said with a cheer. In her mind, not only does she have a good chance, but she will win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping you down onto the floor as she lets you move. With a smile she toyed with you, with her finger as she hit you around. Nothing too much, but just playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll give you a minute to run out, go! Go! Go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said covering her eyes. You took this time and moved instantly. Not really thinking about where you could go as you just run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would seem under the bed is where you were going, as you could hide in many spots there. In your boat? No too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell what other things does she have buried under. Old pair of shoes? No that would smell bad, really bad you imagine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around some more, you saw a giant cardboard box. Was that a board game? Well regardless you couldn\u2019t actually make your way in so next thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you decided as you smiled, finding a small hat stowed under. You move around and get under it. Lifting it as you get there safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou relax, laying back as you peek under. You can just see her feet, but it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, i\u2019m coming!\u201d She said, as she then started. Moving around as she moves with speed, planning on getting you before she can expect She was fast, and totally trashing her room. She seemed to really want to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually she came down onto her knees. Looking under the bed as you lower the hat, making sure you won\u2019t be seen. You were mentally keeping track of the time. About thirty seconds left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear her rustling as you knew it was only a matter of time until she looked at the hat. So you do the smart thing, you go and hug the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy, well cause when she picked up the hat you weren\u2019t found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel her large fingers move and spin the hat as she didn\u2019t find you under the hat. Tossing you onto the floor which has very quickly gotten dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan where are you, it\u2019s got to be more then a minute at this point!\u201d She whined, leaning her head back as she cried. \u201cFine! You win where are you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, it was your entry as you lift the hat. Stepping out and into the open behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight here! I was in the hat!\u201d You shout as she turned around. Stepping onto her feet and looking down to you. She was about to congratulate you for the game, but something else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door behind you opened, and your froze. Turning your neck, you could see yet another sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had big hair, almost glam rock style size. Not brushed though, but very big. It was not one you knew, but the new red sister if you were to guess, was Flareon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Eevee! A-Are you okay!? I heard you shout and... I... care.\u201d Flareon said, pushing her fingers together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine!\u201d Eevee panicked. You had to give it to her, she tried to get her sister out, but something went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got spotted, but not for what you are. The bigger sister\u2019s eyes landing down onto you as she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Bug!!!\u201d It was loud, and ear wrenching for you. So you have been seen as a bug? You can\u2019t decide if that was a good or bad thing. Well looking at Flareon, the giantess seemed to be more scared of you, as she backed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreaking out with eyes open and a hand to her chest. Even though the door was open, she hit the wall frightened. Even if you were a bug, what could you do to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlareon it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you could see another giant form get into the room. She was big and blue, with a long wavy skirt and a top that hugged her body. Both with frost colours. Not to mention she had heels, and sadly her eyes landed down onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that the bug? Do not worry Flareon, I will handle it.\u201d This girl wasn\u2019t afraid of bugs, and that was bad for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her heel up to you, and you could see the polish on it. The polish on your soon to come demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought it down onto you and you narrowly dodged the giant step. Jumping between the heel and the toes as it was room for you to breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost just killed you there, and judging from the twists she was doing, you are fairly sure she thinks she got you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee, was shocked for words as she couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. Did she just see you die?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo\u2019t worry Flareon, I helped you, and now you owe me one.\u201d Glaceon said with a powerful smirk, keeping tracks of the favours. \u201cAs for you Eevee... you are finally wearing the dress! It looks so cute on you!\u201d She cheered, stepping her way forward and getting close to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee\u2019s eyes were on you! You were alive as she wore a smile, only to be talked to her by her sister. She can\u2019t focus on her though? She needs to get you to safety, but now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I hope there are no more bugs?\u201d Flareon said, shifting her gaze around the floor. Something that Eevee and you both noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed you safe. Signalling you to get to safety, she waves her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving it around you couldn\u2019t believe it. She wants you to escape out the room.</span></div></div>",

It makes sense, considering two of her sisters are in the room and you are in danger of getting stepped on. You eventually decide to back up and leave the door. Worse comes worse you just hang out around the corner until her two sisters. She could see you turn and run away, but she couldn\u2019t reveal it as Glaceon was in her face, talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you ran out, you wait near the door at the side. Your back against the wall as you just have to wait for them to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso hopefully not get spotted by any of the other sisters. So you just listen in on the conversation as they talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy I got you that dress, for free as well. You know what I think, you owe me something for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Do I really?\u201d Eevee said as that was not something she wanted. Outside you couldn\u2019t believe it. Glaceon seems determined to get favours, what will she do with them? Can\u2019t be good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee took the rest of her sister talking until it ended. You watch as Glaceon led Flareon out of the room. The red and blue sister\u2019s talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFollow me Flareon, you can pay me back with a foot rub.\u201d Glaceon said with a smirk as her sister followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but no pedicure this time please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will see how I feel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both walked down the hall and down the stairs you breathed a sigh of relief. You somehow survived that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can come back i-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot right now!\u201d You say to her as you then shut your lips, seeing more sisters walking down the hall. You can\u2019t move at the moment. First was Vaporeon, walking pass you and... well you didn\u2019t get a good view of her before, so it was nice to get one now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked like she was large and in charge, which makes sense given that she is the oldest. You just wait for a long while until she passes. She passes and you were about to move in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil Sylveon came out and you froze again. She was jumping playfully with a bag full of laundry. She walked into the laundry room as you take one last look. Before passing back in and stepping in. \u201cEevee, that was too much.\u201d You say to her as she instantly grabbed you. Freaking you out for a second as you get pulled right up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought you up and rubbed you against her cheek. \u201cI was so scared when she brought her heel down! You made it though, you are such a versatile little guy. Nothing can stop you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cE-Eevee, that\u2019s enough okay.\u201d You say to her, a bit more serious. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to tell the other sisters about me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d She said, hurting your ears for a second as she brought you ahead. \u201cN-No I don\u2019t have to! I can take care of you, my sister\u2019s don\u2019t need to know about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said this, you can understand where she was coming from. She wants to be the mature one, as well as take care of you. Problem is, that won\u2019t work at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have too many sister\u2019s Eevee. I\u2019ve already met all of them, and I almost got stepped on at that point. So in other words, it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I just got to keep you in my room! I Just got to take care of you!\u201d She moved over and lowered you down into the cardboard box that has been arranged to be your new room. \u201cSee, if you are in there, none of my sisters will even see you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be true, for now. I just don\u2019t want to run the risk of getting stepped on by another one of your sisters.\u201d You say trying to reason her. You are smart enough to know that at her size, she is determining your fate and you have to convince her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou won\u2019t, I promise.\u201d Eevee said with a smile. \u201cI will take care of you, and keep you safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was it, you weren\u2019t gonna convince this giant child you knew that. Well guess all you can hope for is the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at the very least can you close the door so you won\u2019t be spotted talking to me?\u201d You question as she perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, is a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door, and for the next while you two talked. Just talked and bonded. You told her about your life before you arrived at this place, while she talked you more about her sisters and told you about stories with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to her, and using your prior info, you pieced together who you want to be near. and who you don\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the latter is. \u201cSo... she bought you that dress? Glaceon right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah... but I don\u2019t usually wear it. She bought it for me for a favour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s really into getting those, isn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s never good! She makes sure to cash them in perfectly and even makes events happen so she gets them.\u201d Eevee said as you can tell she needed to vent about this. \u201cLast thing I did for her, I had to be her seat for a little while. She sat on my back while she did her nails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say no?\u201d You question as that would be what you did in that situation. Well not with this size obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Do that, she usually tries to freeze you.\u201d Eevee said casually, a little bit too casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-Freeze? What do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know freeze, like a block of ice. It\u2019s not good, Leafeon has scolded her on it, but she\u2019s sneaky.\u201d Eevee said casually, until she looked down to you and her eyes open. \u201cOh you don\u2019t know! Well, we have powers.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah powers. All my sisters have them. Types is what they are actually called. Vaporeon is a water type, Flareon is fire type, Jolteon is an electric type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are saying that those girls, have powers? What can Jolteon shoot lightning from her fingers?\u201d You question as she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you get it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen.. what type are you?\u201d You question with the most confused face about this<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh i\u2019m normal type?\u201d She said with a smile, as you guess she had an answer for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what does that mean? What is your power?\u201d You question just wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh... don\u2019t know yet. My sisters usually got theirs around my age, all through different means. I just got to wait for mine.\u201d There was an air of silence until you just had to comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you, not for a second. Your trying to mess with me.\u201d You said with a knowing smirk. \u201cYou can\u2019t get me that easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s true! Everything I said is true.\u201d She said bringing her fist down in a bit of a tantrum. You didn\u2019t show fear as you smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice try, you won\u2019t get me that easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it\u2019s true.\u201d She said pouting just like a child would. \u201cLet\u2019s do something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your mind, she just wants to get past, about the fact she was caught out. So you do just that. \u201cSure, another game?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression changes and she gets happy. \u201cYes! Okay i\u2019ve got a good one in my mind, you might need to be convinced about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she said that, your eagerness admittedly dropped as you look at her. \u201cWell that\u2019s not a good sign. What is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, This is gonna be fun. I want you... wait for it. I want you, to climb my body!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cheered about this, almost like she expected fireworks after she said it. You were left confused about it. Your eyes having to look over the girl as you debate if you should do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clearly wants you to, but it also sounds like a lot of trouble, and you don\u2019t know if you can do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually decide that you might as well. \u201cfine, but you got to get your hands ready just in case I fall. And you must be on the bed, so I would at least bounce!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Of course yes!\u201d She cheered happily. Scooping you up and putting you into the middle of her bed. Of course her blanket not made up as you were on the mattress..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bed then shook as she lifted her foot onto the bed and stepped in front of you. Towering over you once again as you saw her towering frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer toes wiggling in front of you as she looked down playfully. You don\u2019t think she thought this entirely the way through, because you were able to see under her dress. Seeing something you should not be. You were not going to bring it up of course, cause you know better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, ready for me to start?\u201d You question her as she giggled. She gave you an answer as she brought her toe and tapped your chest with it. It was a small tap, but it was enough to send you falling back onto your rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, let\u2019s start!\u201d She said happily as you do what she wants. Stepping onto your feet and getting up. You prepare to move over and jump onto the toe that had just knocked you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up onto it as you step onto the nail, it was a bit weird, looking up at the tower you were about to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile hard, not impossible. She had fur all over her body, and you were going to use that brown fur to scale up her legs. Taking steps onto it, you move over and walk your way through. Until finally you reach the heel area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way and climb up, hands on the fur as you lift yourself up. Lifting yourself up as you proceeded to go Eevee climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled, moving her body as she felt your small efforts on her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey! Be careful okay!\u201d You shout to her. You don\u2019t know if she realises but her smallest action was enough to cause danger for you. You reached her ankle as you keep climbing. Basically nothing stopping you as you go up and up. The bed became further from you, and you were glad it was going to be soft if you fall. Hoping that the bounce would soften your drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt you onto her knee as she insticevly kicked it, just a little bit, but enough to make you almost let go. One of your hands go loose, but one grabs. \u201cCareful Eevee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m trying, your just so ticklish. I love this!\u201d She said with a voice of pure joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I imagine so.\u201d You say as you move above her knee and finally to her thigh. Getting up more and more. Eevee\u2019s head leaning forward as she was trying to spot you. She was trying to not only spot you, but keep her eyes on you. You get up there, until finally you had to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Eevee? Do you think you can push your dress to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why?\u201d She questioned, until the child pieced it together. If you were climbing the way you were, you would go into her dress. Not only that, but into her privates. \u201cS-Sure!\u201d She said with a little blush. Pushing it closer to you as you thank her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving your hands there, you grab on and she lets go. The dress freely swaying back and forth. While she was doing this, you moved up and got your way up. Climbing the outside now for the road now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>currently, you were moving up the outside of the dress, making sure you would go up and up. You can see her excited smile gleam down onto you, as you were really glad about it. She was nice, and amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move up and up until finally you were at her stomach. \u201cHey Eevee?\u201d You question playfully as she giggles. \u201cAre you ticklish on your stomach?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No!\u201d She said with a bit of a hesitant situation. Making you smile as you already know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you so are! How would you feel if I tickled your stomach? You would burst out laughing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, well are you ticklish!?\u201d She said, fighting back as you were left thinking about it for a little while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Yours was more sudden, and she was able to understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you are too! If you tickle me, i\u2019ll give you an even bigger tickle! So watch it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, right.\u201d You say back to her, rolling your eyes. You move around and get up, until you were basically on her chest. You don\u2019t want to focus on it, not one bit. So you keep moving up and up as you scale her chest. It was a slight hill, but thankfully only a slight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, if I have a pocket, you could stay in there all day.\u201d She said, just thinking about that as you were a bit shocked, but still nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a good idea.\u201d You say as you just keep moving. Ignoring what you were on as you get to the top of her opening. Standing there and smiling, even turning around and looking down. It would be quite the fall for you, and that was not something you were okay with. You were gonna have to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move up and get closer up, as you grab the fur from her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, hopefully this doesn\u2019t feel too weird.\u201d You say to her, feeling like you need to clarify this. You move up more and more as she started to feel a bit wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lips and not looking happy. Until finally she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. None at all as she told him. \u201cGet off!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her finger around and knocked you off. You felt yourself go loose and go down. Screaming as you fall the way down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhhh!!\u201d All your screaming and flailing did nothing as Eevee perked up. She tried to catch you as you were dropping down her dress. She moved her two hands together and closed planning catching you, but instead missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling yourself falling as you were bracing for impact. You are about to explode on contact, and this was the end of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hit the ground, stopping your entire momentum as you hit the bed. Only to then bounce back up, like you were on a trampoline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour back hurting due to the heavy hit, but not enough to cause you pain, in fact... not enough as it should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee looked down afraid of what would happen to you, however her gaze changed as she saw you bounce. She got more excited, and totally relieved. \u201cAmazing! You are okay!\u201d She said coming down. You were already bouncing, so when she got down, you started to bounce even more. Going up and down without control as you look at the girl\u2019s knees, which was right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, What was that!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I felt you on my neck, and you felt all weird grabbing that, I-I didn\u2019t mean to actually drop you! I\u2019m so sorry, come here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed you before you could actually do anything, as she pulled you up and brought you right to her chest. She brought you right there and pressed you against. Crossing both of her furry hands over you as she gave you the biggest hug you have ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, I am so sorry.\u201d She said as you guess it was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-It\u2019s fine, just be careful. It\u2019s my life you almost ended there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know!\u201d She said bringing you back and smiling. \u201cI promise next time, I will be more careful for you. A lot more careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think needless to say, I don\u2019t feel like climbing anymore.\u201d You say to her, a bit of a chuckle as you are not in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t have to, cause you have won!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused what Eevee said, but felt yourself moved onto the top of her head. Right onto her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair, not fur just to clarify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee, you won!\u201d She said happily as you had to admit, it was really a nice gesture of hers. Guess she figured out that she made a mistake by hitting you off and wanted to let you win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow for your reward!\u201d Eevee said bringing you down, right in front of her face. She was smiling, but an ease of nervousness was on her face. She let you sit there, staring right at her face as you were confused about what she was going to do next. Suddenly she brought you forward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing you close as you saw something you didn\u2019t think you would ever see. She puckered her lips. Puckering it as it drew closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it hit you. Her two lips pushing down onto you, as this was one of the few parts of her body that was not covered on fur. She kissed you only for a second, before she then pulled you by. She saw you sitting on her hand, seeing that you were left stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Vaporeon always said a kiss would stun a boy, but I\u2019ve never done one before. Guess you are my first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled at this, while you were left stunned. That was by far the biggest kiss you have ever seen. Literally the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two quickly moved pass this, as you two talk a while in the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil later that night\u2019s event.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She even let you... do your business in your box. It was a bit disgusting, but you manage to convince her to get some toilet paper and quickly discard it after you were finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two just talked, until there was a knock on the door. Eevee reacted quick, moving her hand around and covering you. Just in case someone was going to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one did though, instead Leafeon yelled from the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee dear, come down, dinner is ready! We are having homegrown salad!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are!!\u201d She said, pretty much leaping. \u201cOh, i\u2019ll be right down!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uncovered you and proceeded to get up, moving onto her feet. She proceeded to run ahead and get some food, when she heard your voice behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, can you get me some!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019m going to. You are gonna love her salad. She gets it from her garden, and throws dressing on it. You are going to love it!\u201d And with that, she started to leave. You were by yourself on the bed, just slapping your knees a couple of times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust got to wait for her to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee moved down and joined the rest of her sisters at the table. They always ate together, with four on one side, four on the other and Eevee at the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of conversation and a lot of eating. Eevee grabbed her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Leafeon questioned at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you for the meal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all started to eat, some of them talking to each other but Eevee didn\u2019t listen. She had her mind on the food that she loved, as well as you back in your place. She needed to sneak you some. Now logically, someone would sneak some of the food they currently have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was not what they did, cause instead, she wanted more. \u201cLeafeon, can I have some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow you know the rules Eevee, only one for everyone. I made it just enough for a meal each.\u201d She said as she looked to Jolteon, knowing what other girl would break it in literally an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not for me, it\u2019s for...\u201d Eevee trailed off, becoming more quiet about it as she hoped none of her sisters have been listening. That would not be good, she almost just revealed your existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor who?\u201d Leafeon questioned as Eevee thought about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, it is for me!\u201d She said, quickly defending herself. \u201cCan I please have it. I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, on one condition though, tomorrow, you have to help me in the garden.\u201d Leafeon  said with the kindest smile.<br>\r\n\u2028She was really happy about it, and brought her fingers forward. She reached forward and scooped some more on her plate. Getting up she then turned. \u201cI\u2019m going to be eating the rest in my room okay. Bye!\u201d Eevee said, thinking she could not have done it better.<br>\r\n\u2028She left the room and walked right up with her food. Going to her room to share with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all her sisters, could not help but look at her a bit confused. Sure, she didn\u2019t love eating with all her sister, but what else would she do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that about? Squirt\u2019s acting weirder than usual.\u201d Jolteon said simply eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean weirder?\u201d Sylveon questioned, not knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that for starters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe had a bug in her room that I stepped on,\u201d Glaceon added. \u201cWhen I killed it, she seemed almost, heartbroken in a way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe wanted to go to the beach, then moved on almost as soon as we got there.\u201d Vaporeon added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI heard a boy\u2019s voice in her room.\u201d Umbreon added, this one being the most intriguing as all the girls looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you are just now, sharing that!?\u201d Jolteon said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExplains the dress, my theory. Is that our little sister has found a boy down at the beach, promised to sneak him into her room, and is now sheltering him in there. Hence is why she is bringing spare food up there, as well as wanting to look good with the dress.\u201d Espeon said as she quickly pieced it together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t explain the bug poindexter.\u201d Jolteon mocked as Espeon rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s our little sister, of course she doesn\u2019t want to see an insect dying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, she has a boyfriend!\u201d Vaporeon said with the biggest smile. \u201cI\u2019ve got to see this, i\u2019m going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHang on a minute,\u201d Leafeon said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just... barge our way into her room. This is her life, and as protective as I feel, we should let her make her choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could, or we could hang this over her and tease her nonstop.\u201d Glaceon countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI vote for that one.\u201d Vaporeon replied with a smile that was just as big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two blue sister\u2019s started to get up. They got stopped by the only sister that hasn\u2019t spoken up about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... I might have something to add?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... when I saw the bug, I saw that it was... not, looking like a bug?\u201d Flareon said, her gaze looking around. \u201cIs that weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow i\u2019m interested.\u201d Espeon added, wanting to inspect this bug, or at least others like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs am I. I am passionate about going.\u201d Umbreon said as her expression did not change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s see what she\u2019s up to. Maybe she has a whole bug farm!\u201d Sylveon said, the excited girl excited as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonder if I can stomp on some?\u201d Jolteon laughed. This lasted for a long while as all the girls were on board, except Leafeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she could do nothing as they all get up and walk up to their sister\u2019s room. She joined of course, It\u2019s like a giant parade going to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were about to be seen</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of the girls made their way in, keeping quiet making sure not to alert their youngest sister of the stampede they were going to get. Jolteon and Vaporeon of course leading the pack. Both of them with teasing smirks on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Eevee was hiding, she can expect a lot of sisterly teasing and attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolteon put her hand on the door and raised her fingers,                                                                                                                 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3, 2, 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolteon pushed with all her might the door. Pushing it open. Well more slammed it open, as it hit the wall with her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Eevee! What\u2019s going on!\u201d She said, as fast as she can so she can startle her sister. It really did, as Eevee was on the bed and screamed. Leaping onto her feet and screaming at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n\u2028She brought herself back down though, very quickly. Little did her sister realise, not in the same spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJ-Jolteon, don\u2019t do that!\u201d Eevee said, her legs closed and her fingers on her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolteon ignored her little sister\u2019s pleas, and just kept walking. Looking around the room as the rest of her sisters piled in. \u201cOkay Eevee, where is it!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Where is what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you are hiding,\u201d Jolteon replied. \u201cJust tell me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have figured out you are hiding something, we are here to investigate.\u201d Espeon said, as she didn\u2019t need an invitation, she just started to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey, i\u2019m not hiding anything!\u201d She said, as her eyes shifted to something that luckily none of her sisters have seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bug farm?\u201d Glaceon said. \u201cWhich is pretty much why you freaked out when I stepped on one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No. I just don\u2019t like you stepping on something.\u201d She replied as she was hoping they would leave, like right this minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well did you find a boy down at the beach and bring him in?\u201d Umbreon said, as that was the one she was going for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d She said quickly, a bit too much. Something that Vaporeon caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you did! You so did! Where is the young strapping lad, is he hiding under the bed?\u201d She said, getting uncomfortably close to her sister, her boobs hanging in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen why... did you bring the salad to your room?\u201d Flareon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I was hungry!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what is this then?\u201d Sylveon added, lifting something at the foot of the bed. It was the cardboard box and looking at it Eevee tried to fake it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d She said, as none of her sisters bought it. Clearly she was hiding something, and the sisters were not going to leave until they could know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon understood, so she stepped her way forward. Crouching down to talk to the youngest sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, I just want to know, are you hiding something? We aren\u2019t mad, we just want to know. Our family has never kept secrets, and I don\u2019t want us to start now. Please tell us, it would mean a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee looked at her only responsible sister and was struggling to get the words out. Should she tell her, or should she not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon could see she was on the air of telling her. So the leaf girl looked around among all the other sisters. \u201cGirls, please give her some air to breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAir... to... Breath.\u201d Eevee said simply, when suddenly her face turned to horror. \u201cHe needs air to breath!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprung up into the air, causing Leafeon to take several steps back in surprise. Her little sister turned around and got down onto her knees. \u201cNo, he\u2019s out of it! Please don\u2019t be dead! Please don\u2019t be dead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her sister\u2019s on the other side all approached the bed, looking over Eevee\u2019s shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe salad is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I see something else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe bug... it\u2019s the bug I stepped on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... Is it dead?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy was Eevee sitting on it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bug under her butt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird thing to hide?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, you mind explaining?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, you feel your body aching a bit. It was so good, and you were enjoying the salad that Eevee snuck into. When suddenly before you could understand, Eevee moved and sat down onto you. Her heavy weight on you as you were unable to lift her. You even ran out of your breath and passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee?\u201d You question trying to grip your head. \u201cWhy did you sit on me? And why... can\u2019t I move my arms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, guess he does talk.\u201d A voice said as your eyes shot open, seeing a giant eye in your path! Surrounding by yellow fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her face back and chuckled with a smirk. Seeing your small and weak power. You jerk around, freaking out as you were in a giant room, dangled in the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her finger and pushed it onto your front, sending you for a swing as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJolteon!\u201d Eevee said, sitting on the couch in the back, Glaceon at her side. \u201cDon\u2019t pick on him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, guess you aren\u2019t the squirt in the house anymore Eevee.\u201d She said as she did take a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how this happened, but all the girls are looking at you! All the girls know about you. While your eyes dart around crazily among all the girls, one of them walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon, and you could see her giant chest right in front of you. It was right where you were getting dangled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, my little boy.\u201d She said straightening her back and pushing out her chest. You try not to focus on it and shift your gaze, but Vaporeon could see the red blushing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLearning what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-why am I tied up?\u201d You say as you were dangling by a string from the ceiling, wrapped around your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s for Flareon, this is to make her feel comfortable. Now girls, lets talk about him.\u201d</span></div></div>",

A bit intimidating, but still you continued. \u201cI-I didn\u2019t want to be under there! Eevee just wanted to hide me and-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelax squirt. She already told us she was trying to hide you.\u201d Jolteon said as this actually did calm you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow we are just trying to decide what to do with you.\u201d Leafeon said as your eyes went open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen, Eevee just found me in the ocean and she took me here. She\u2019s been kind enough to house me and... well i\u2019ve taken it. I haven\u2019t done anything bad I swear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTechnically you violated both trespassing and squatting.\u201d Espeon added as you can\u2019t really argue that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-Maybe. You got to see though I have no other option! I-I\u2019m not really sure. but I come from a land far across the ocean. I was part of a shipwreck and got here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA shipwreck?\u201d Umbreon added, showing some intrigue. Of course you didn\u2019t pick up on it. \u201cAnd you escaped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, I was stranded in the ocean until Eevee found me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen I brought him in, took care of him, had fun with him and made him safe!\u201d Eevee yelled, seeming like she wanted to say that for a long time. \u201cI can look after him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, your too young to look after something.\u201d Vaporeon said as she then fluttered her eyes to you. \u201cEspecially one so... handsome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an air of pause after this, as all her sisters knew what was going to happen. That is, if you are staying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... what are we going to do to him?\u201d Flareon questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I say we keep him!\u201d Sylveon said, moving her face right close. \u201cI wanna play with him, and he can play with me! Hey, do you wanna keep me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left thinking. \u201cS-Sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen you\u2019re staying!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to all pick that Sylveon.\u201d Leafeon said as her sister giggled, the ice one smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, like any of us don\u2019t want him here.\u201d Glaceon said, smirking at you in a way that made you feel a bit uneasy. \u201cAlso, fairly sure he would want to stay here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a long while as you just had to ask. \u201cA-Am I allowed to stay?\u201d You say, knowing that was the question you had to ask. \u201cPlease, I have no other place to go. Not really sure about most things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to stay! He\u2019s just got to!\u201d Eevee said stepping onto her feet. She moved around and stood next to you. \u201cYou girls always taught me that if someone needs help, we help them. He needs my help right now? So we can\u2019t kick him out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I want him here, and... if you kick him out, y-you are gonna have to kick me out too!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shouted this for a long time as all her sisters looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay girls, who wants to keep him!?\u201d Vaporeon said, knowing this will be able to ease Eevee. \u201cI for one, want to keep him. I think it would be nice, having a little boy here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the squirt here, the fun I can have with him.\u201d Jolteon added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well, I guess it would be rude to kick him out.\u201d Flareon said moving her hair in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare to pass this study.\u201d Said Espeon, who admittedly scared you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Umbreon said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf Eevee wants him here, I will support her choice.\u201d Leafeon admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe can stay, in exchange... for a favour.\u201d Glaceon smirked, which worried you cause of course it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! It\u2019s of course a yes!!\u201d Sylveon jumped around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you smiled, as you had to do it. \u201cThank you! Thank you so much, I owe you all everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all smiled to you, as you were so glad. Not as glad as Eevee seemed, as she brought you around and pushed you her chest. Hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying! You\u2019re staying!!\u201d She was so happy about this as she let you go, letting you swing around and unable to do anything. She moved her fingers around to the top and tried to untie the rope, but that was the mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCause as you saw her doing this, another sister came. A big blue fur hand coming and grabbing you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed you and pulled you up to her face, letting you see the seductive look she was giving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Vaporeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I suppose as the oldest sister, i\u2019ll look after him. He can stay in my room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! He was in my room!\u201d Eevee said up to her sister and stomping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow now, i\u2019m sure he would love to sleep with a woman, rather than a girl.\u201d Vaporeon teased, as she taunted her sister. Even moving her finger around and covering your mouth. You could not talk to her because the blue finger was in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him here! Give him here!\u201d She yelled and complained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVaporeon give him back to her.\u201d Espeon said. \u201cI will create a chart and divide his time among us evenly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoring!\u201d Jolteon added. \u201cLet\u2019s just say first comes first serves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about... if one sister has him, you can\u2019t grab him yourself! Sounds fair right?\u201d Sylveon said as the girls had to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would complain you weren\u2019t a toy, but your mouth was being covered and... well this was the life you chose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd since I have him right now, you girls can\u2019t take him from me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d Eevee said up to her sister. \u201cLeafeon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls. Stop fighting! I\u2019ll take him for tonight and we can decide later.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was any other sister, there was no chance she would agree to this, however because it is Leafeon. \u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon smiled and walked to her oldest sister, holding her hand out in front of Vaporeon. The girl sighed and handed you over, placing you in the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, but he will have so much less fun.\u201d She said before giving you a wink. A wink that sent a shudder down your spine. Leafeon started to untie you completely as she turned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i\u2019m going to sleep then, Eevee... can I have the cardboard box home?\u201d She questioned as Eevee nodded. That didn\u2019t come up with the conversation, you guess they were talking about you when you were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the box, she headed to sleep. Eevee looking at you a bit sad. She wasn\u2019t going to be the only one looking after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leafeon stepped into the room, you looked around. Green walls, green furniture and a lot of dirt on the ground. Not enough that it\u2019s covered, but enough that it\u2019s noticeable. She locked the door, telling you. \u201cI have no doubt in my mind, one of my sisters will try to take you when I sleep. Let\u2019s prevent that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed over and placed you onto the dresser, making you trip a bit. \u201cApologies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-That\u2019s fine.\u201d You say back to her sending a smile. \u201cSorry about this, -\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo need to apologise yourself.\u201d She said cutting you off. \u201cYou need help, and Eevee was willing to help you. I\u2019m very proud of my sister, seems like she did the right thing. Granted she should of revealed you to us as soon as she could, but i\u2019m still very proud. She seems to have taken a liking to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I guess she has.\u201d You say back to her as you then think. \u201cYour sisters seem to have as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, they might be playful and mischievous, none of them would actually be willing to hurt you.\u201d She said, now do you want me to set up a bed for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I have one, I lay on Eevee\u2019s sock and... yeah can you see if you can get me a better one?\u201d You say changing it as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved ahead and looked around, trying to find something for you. When she came back, it was with tissues. One balled up and one flat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can sleep on these, i\u2019ll prepare a bed in your box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d You say back to her. \u201cWhat are you, the nice sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t say that, i\u2019m just very understanding. Looking after all of them and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn\u2019t argue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere, let me show you your new bed.\u201d She said lowering her hand down. She wasn\u2019t grabbing you, she was letting you step onto it. That was very nice of her.<br>\r\n\u2028You step onto her fur and she raises you up, letting you see over the walls of your home. She has arranged them perfectly into a bed. Mattress, pillow, blanket. That was just too nice of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, thanks Leafeon! I\u2019m gonna have a good sleep tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it (Your Name).\u201d She said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... I don\u2019t think I told you my name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee did.\u201d Leafeon said simply as she gave you an answer. Now, stay in there while I change myself.\u201d She dropped you onto the cardboard as she left. You simply wait for her to come back, as you had nothing else to do. When she did, she had a green night top on as well as long baggy pants. Her hair down and looking like she was ready to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an early riser, so I might wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine, so am I\u201d You say back to her. \u201cIn fact, I woke up before Eevee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI imagine it wasn\u2019t fun waiting for her,\u201d Leafeon giggled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t have that problem with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you wake up so early?\u201d You question as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s prepare and water my garden. I\u2019m... a bit of a green head, as Jolteon would call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, I mean I get wanting to have a garden, but an early morning for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s... a big garden.\u201d She said as you could imagine. \u201cMaybe, you would like to accompany me in the morning. It would be nice to have someone to talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure i\u2019d love that.\u201d You say back to her as the date was made. You were glad you were spending time with Leafeon first, as it seems she is the most level headed and nurturing of all the sisters. \u201cSo, we going to sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i\u2019m very tired and it\u2019s an early morning for me. Let me just tuck you in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Tuck me in?\u201d You question as you were a little bit shocked at her words. she simply just smiled and moved her fingers in, pulling the blanket back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I did it to Eevee all the time when she was little. Just get in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure?\u201d You say to her sitting onto the bed moving your win. You rest your head against the makeshift pillow and lay, her smile over you. She put the blanket onto you and made sure you were properly in. \u201cDon\u2019t you find this a bit weird.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually a bit refreshing, Eevee doesn\u2019t let me do it anymore, and it is something i\u2019ve missed.\u201d She said as you guess you can\u2019t argue that. She patted the bed several times as she brought her finger to your cheek. \u201cGoodnight, I will see you in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-Okay, see you then.\u201d You say as she did everything shy of a goodbye kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon left, going to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It didn\u2019t take you long to actually fall asleep, as the bed was set up for you. Same could be said for waking up, cause as the daylight hit, you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr more specifically, Leafeon woke you up. She was going with her morning routine of watering her garden, making sure all of it got the sun during the day. She quickly got changed into a light green sweater and soft pants. Mostly to make sure she won\u2019t freeze while she waters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she quickly got reminded of you, walking over and seeing you still sleeping. She brought her finger around and poked it down at you gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting you to not only wake up, but shift around to her. You see her giant face and for a second you were a little surprised to see that it wasn\u2019t Eevee. Only to remember that all the sisters know about you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, hehe. Seems like i\u2019m more of an early riser than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeems like it.\u201d You smile back to her as she drops her hand next to you. \u201cHop on, i\u2019ll get us some coffee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCoffee? Yeah sure.\u201d You say as you roll over onto her hand, having trouble since you literally just woke up. She raised you up and walked out of the room. Making sure not to make heavy footsteps and wake up her sisters. So she lived upstairs as well, seems like most of them do. Although you did see some bedrooms downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon walked down and got to the kitchen dropping you onto the counter as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll prepare myself a cup, and you... maybe something smaller.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe?\u201d you question as you felt like it was a guarantee. She looked around for a little while before finding a small bottle cap. Turning it around, it should be more than enough for you. She grabbed the coffee beans while she has grown and picked, and scrunched them up. You were just waiting patiently, hands on your lap as you rub your eyes. Sun was barely out, and you can\u2019t imagine any of her other sisters being up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Leafeon, pour me one will ya?\u201d A voice said as you turned, seeing Jolteon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow furred girl just waking up to, and in nothing but a training bra and tight leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure Jolteon and... put some more clothes on, you will be freezing out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly for a little while, then i\u2019m gonna pump up a sweat and feel hot!\u201d Jolteon said with a laugh and a mock. moving and sitting down, as her gaze shifted to you not so far away. \u201cOh, what\u2019s up little guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-Hey Jolteon.\u201d You say trying to sound not intimidated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJolteon, how many times have I told you,\u201d Leafeon started. \u201cKeep your voice down not to wake anyone up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, seems like this little guy won\u2019t have that problem.\u201d She said teasingly, moving her finger and tapping you in the stomach. \u201cEh squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... do you two usually wake up in the morning?\u201d You question as they both nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe checks her garden, I go for a morning jog. best get it out of the way early.\u201d Jolteon said as you guess that makes sense. \u201cWhy you up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to \u2018check\u2019 out my garden with me.\u201d Leafeon said with a smile. \u201cHe\u2019s going to give me company while I water and manage the plants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh... yeah bore him to death.\u201d Jolteon said as she smiled. \u201cYou know what you should do, let me take him for my jog! He would love it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuiet, trust me he would love it!\u201d Jolteon said as Leafeon rolled her eyes. While you was keeping your distance... just because. It didn\u2019t matter in the end, cause she moved her fingers around and grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanking you up in the air and up to her face, a smirk across her lips. \u201cFine, you can go with Leafeon, but sooner or later i\u2019m going to get your small body, and i\u2019m going to have so much fun with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell... looking forward to it.\u201d You say as that was all you could really say. All you could really say. She smirked more as she positioned her fingers around and faced it right to you. Facing it and started to prod you. You just had to accept it as she felt you up for a long time. Not something you were a fan of, but at the same time something you couldn\u2019t stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough of that, put him down and drink some coffee.\u201d Leafeon said coming back with three cups. Two regular sized ones, and one for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, somewhat peacefully you three drank your coffees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jolteon got some distance, starting her jog and leaving her house, you felt confident to whisper to Leafeon. \u201cI\u2019m scared of your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s playful, but she\u2019s nice.\u201d Leafeon said as you guess you better trust this girl\u2019s opinion. She walked around the house to her garden. It was a large garden, and you could see her walk into her gardening shed. All her tools in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was ready to grab her watering can, but looked at you. \u201cI think I found a place you can stay. Tell me if this is nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought you around and placed you down into a place that was pretty smart. Right n her shoulder, between her neck and between the collar of the sweater. It was warm for you, do to the heat and you enjoyed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs it a good spot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic! Thanks Leafeon!\u201d You say as she smiled, moving her fingers around and gripping the watering can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are very welcome. Now let me show you around the garden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watered the garden, to say you were impressed would be an understatement. First the vegetable section, with rows and rows of them, fruit trees which she plucked the ripe ones, and even herb spices she has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a green girl, surely.</span></div></div>",

All I did was give you company.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered you down onto the table as she smiled. \u201cAnd that is enough. I would be glad t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s awake!!!\u201d A voice yelled as you turned around to the source. You hear two hands slapping down as a giant body leaned down in front of you. A white and pink furry body in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon. She currently had her pyjama\u2019s on, with her shirt hanging over her shoulder. You weren\u2019t surprised that she would wear that. She wore a smile on her face as she was so happy. \u201cHi there cutie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Cutie?\u201d It was something else being called that by this girl. She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah, you are a cutie! So cute, I mean the size of course helps, but I would still call you cutie anyway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChipper, would be the perfect way to describe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeafeon, can I take him to my room to play with him!?\u201d Sylveon said up as you paused for a long while about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me Sylveon, it\u2019s up to him.\u201d Leafeon stated as that went a long way for you. You don\u2019t want to be seen like property or a pet, even if you are the size of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, whoops! Sorry about that cutie. You wanna come play with me in my room! It will be fun, so much fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about this for a second, looking back to Leafeon just in case. She didn\u2019t seem to have a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh sure... why not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!!!\u201d She cheered, moving her fingers to you and gripping you. Her fingers wrapped around your body as she lifted you up, right next to her toothy grin. The furry girl turning to her room. She stopped for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right, breakfast. That\u2019s why i\u2019m here. Hey Leafeon, can you cook me pancakes!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPancakes, I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!!\u201d She said as Sylveon left, going away into her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped to her room, until finally she was in. She closed her door and you looked around the room in your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, have you... ever cleaned this room.\u201d Just clothes, all over the floor. All of them bright colours with polka dots, stripes or something else cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound like Leafeon hehe. I figured, why put it in my closet, where I have to go through all the effort of finding it! I can have it on the floor and easily grab it, now. Let\u2019s have some fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her foot, kicking clothes to the side so there was a small patch of ground. The carpeted floor under you. She sat down and crossed her legs, until she dropped right in front of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bounce a couple of times as you look around. The clothes around you look like hills, and Sylveon looked like a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh... you wanted to play?\u201d You say to her as you could see her eyes right onto you. They were basically not moving. \u201cWhat exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, with these.\u201d She said turning her head and showing you something you didn\u2019t notice before. She had... ribbons?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were close to her head, right under her ears. This made you realise that these girls were more unique then you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to climb it or something?\u201d You say back to her as she thought about it, and then grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes climb it! Do it right now! Do it!\u201d She said moving her head forward and sticking out her ribbon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like a gym class rope above you, with a toothy grin above. You get up and start to stretch yourself for a long while, until finally you grip it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing both your hands and your legs, you start climbing up. Getting closer and closer to her ear. Her big blue eyes on you. Since it wasn\u2019t stable, the ribbon you were climbing on swayed with her head. For a long time until you were about half way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, wanna see something cool!?\u201d She said as you pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of climbing right now, but sure. What you gonna show?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust this!\u201d She yelled, as suddenly you found the ribbon moving and swaying around. This happened for a real long time, until finally you noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou assumed she was just doing it with her fingers, but the ribbon was moving by itself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, Tadaa!!!\u201d She said as her head titled up, and the ribbon rose. Above her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can control this thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, yep! Look at you go!\u201d She cheered, waving you around with the ribbon. She had so much fun playing with you and toying with you, while the same cannot be said for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact you were having struggles. \u201cI... Sylveon stop, i\u2019m slipping!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you shouted this, you felt your grip going until you started to fall. Waving your hands as you were preparing for another fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t fall on the ground though, instead you fell onto the other ribbon from the other ear. Which quickly wrapped you up within it, like a rope around you she lifted you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, got you!! now you are my prisoner. Hehe.\u201d She was having so much fun, that it was admittedly a bit contagious, as you wore a smile to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKind of weird, are those ribbons like part of your body or...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it!\u201d She said cheerfully as you guess that was the only answer you were going to get.</span></div></div>",

Sylveon didn\u2019t care that much at the point, as she started to throw you around. Tossing you like a toy as she giggled the whole way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had some fun with you on her ribbon, until finally she pulled back and let you go to her hand. You get dropped down, falling into her hands as she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you wanna do? Anything, I will do literally anything!\u201d She said showing her teeth. You know the one place you didn\u2019t want to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... we can just sit and talk. I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat no! That is so boring, pick something else.\u201d She said as you paused for a second on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you said anything I wanna do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but it\u2019s got to be fun!! Real fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTalking and sitting can be fun.\u201d You say back to her as she just rolls her eye. She calms down for a second, before then getting excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, we can just sit! Hehe, I just got a fun idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo clearly she wants to do her own thing. So you were gonna let her just have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved over and lowered you down, right onto the bed. She stood up over you with her hands right in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what you said before? I realised that was a fun idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit and talk?\u201d You question to her as you thought you didn\u2019t like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, just sit! I\u2019m going to sit on you!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused for a second, until you watch her spin and move. Showing her backside, but more specifically her giant butt. It was high above and lingering over you, and... it was pretty big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you know the size of you really made it seem bigger, but it was already big as it is. Guess she was granted well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pyjama bottoms hugged her butt really well and it seemed they were struggling to even contain them. This lasted for a long time, until finally she brought it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncoming!\u201d She said down to you very loudly about it. She fell off her feet and brought her butt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a meteor coming down, you panic for a second before accepting that you can\u2019t really do anything about it. You have already been sat on by Eevee, but you have a good feeling this is gonna weigh a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her giant butt down and plumped it onto you, sitting down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet in the air and all of her weight down onto you. To the point where it was feeling uncomfortable. Only that though, which was worth noting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Eevee who was trying to hide you, Sylveon just wanted to sit on you. Giggling around and moving her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found it easier to breath where you are, maybe because Sylveon was moving around so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I can feel you down there. Right under my left one, you feel kind of funny. Like a weird little cushion.\u201d She laughed this, and started to shift and move her body around. Going left and going right as she was playing with you. Rocking her body and rubbing her buttcheek over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let her do this, as she does it so many times, until finally she put her feet onto the ground. She lifted her giant body up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp into the air with power as she was above you, only for it come back down onto you. Lowering her butt as she flattened you. She was so powerful, and you were getting hit hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon laughing and giggling about it as she found it pretty funny. She did this about three steps more, over and over until she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got right up and turned around, seeing your flattened body in her butt crease. You were down and flattened as she came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, how amazing was that!\u201d She said back to you, her big blue eyes staring down at you. \u201cYou felt really good. if only there was two of you, one for each cheek. Hey can you close yourself?\u201d She joked as you were getting up slowly and surely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the weirdest thing in the world, being under a butt, and you are a bit disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSylveon, can you not do that next time.\u201d You say simply to her as she was more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, why not? Did you not like it are you sure? I mean it was fun to me.\u201d She said down to you, telling you for a long time as you had to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, I was getting sat on.\u201d You say simply as she learned about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah but are you hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem! Being under my butt is great, I wanna be under my own butt.\u201d She joked and teased about this. Trying to get you to do it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply roll your eyes about it as you tell her. \u201cLook just not a fan, ca-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSylveon!\u201d A voice yelled out. If you remember their voices correctly, it was Glaceon. \u201cPancakes are ready, Leafeon wanted me to tell you. Oh also bring the small boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkie!\u201d She said as she grabbed you, you sitting in her hand as she was ready to go. Pausing for a second, as she raised you back to her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so you don\u2019t like being under my butt, but it felt pretty great to me, so i\u2019ll make you a deal!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about this for a little while until you responded. \u201cWhat deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvery time I want some butt fun, I will owe you fun of your own. Whatever you pick i\u2019ll do, and I won\u2019t argue this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t k-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s go down and eat pancakes!\u201d She said as you watch her leave. She leaves and goes down, ready to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as you got down below back to the kitchen, all the girls were there, and they were all looking at you. You try not to focus on this as Sylveon dropped you right in front of her as she sits down. Moving her fingers around she grabbed some pancakes that were in the middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls eyes on you as they eat, you were the centre or their interest. \u201cCan you not all look at me, please.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe!!!\u201d A voice said as you suddenly feel something wrap hands around you Turning around it was Eevee. The girl you remember and who saved you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you okay, Sylveon didn\u2019t hurt you right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No i\u2019m good.\u201d You say back to her as she smiles, clearly glad to have you back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, take a seat and i\u2019ll serve you some up as well.\u201d Leafeon announced. \u201cAnd one for your little friend as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened and sat down, dropping you onto the table in front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both got your pancakes, and looking at it, Leafeon did take your size into consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pancake you were given was a lot thinner and smaller then the rest, with the sugar and honey lightly drizzled on for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Thank you so much!\u201d you say to her as she smiles. You were gonna take a bite, until you had to stop and look. \u201cCan you not, all look at me please? Don\u2019t think I can eat like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201chere, i\u2019ll help.\u201d Eevee said, raising her hands and covering you. She covered you, making sure no other sister could see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that works thanks Eevee.\u201d You say to her as you eat. You were comfortable with Eevee over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cbuzzkill.\u201d Vaporeon said, as she changed her gaze from you to Sylveon, who already had a pancake basically shoved in her mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll ask you then, what did you do up there with him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn was filled with interest, so the girl answered. \u201cOh, well he started by climbing my ribbon, he was real spooked when I started to move it around, let me tell you! Then I sat on him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly Eevee could see it, but you choked on your food for a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sat on him?\u201d Eevee said, shocked about this. Her gaze looking to you as you looked ashamed. Sure, the brown furry sister sat on you as well, but to think you were under her sister\u2019s butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, oh that sounds kinky. How exactly did this happen? Did you want to sit on him, or did her beg and plead with you to flatten him?\u201d Vaporeon said as you had to stop. Moving around and talking pass the hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, she sat on me! I wanted no part of it! None at all!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone at all, that might not be true. You do seem like a bit of a pervert.\u201d Glaceon uttered as well, being the only one to cut the pancake with a knife like a civilised girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I seem? I\u2019ve done nothing, you haven\u2019t even been near me long enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we are going to have to correct that, won\u2019t we.\u201d Glaceon said with her own interested smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... n-no.\u201d You say as that was the best you could get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDibs.\u201d A voice said as you got interested, Looking past the hand, you could see that it was Jolteon who said, eating her own pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t call dibs on him!!\u201d Glaceon said, feeling like she got cheated just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I did, so i\u2019m next.\u201d Jolteon said, eating her food and smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf dibs are in place, I call second dibs after Jolteon.\u201d Espeon added. \u201cI have many things I want to test with him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTest? Like what?\u201d You say wanting to know as she just looked at you. \u201cCancel that actually, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! He\u2019s mine so I get him.\u201d Eevee said, a bit angry about how this is going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, he\u2019s not anyone\u2019s, you can\u2019t own him. And you girls should not be talking about him like he\u2019s property.\u201d Leafeon said as you were starting to have her take the place of your favourite. Although you won\u2019t do Eevee like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, trust me he would love it.\u201d Vaporeon said with a giggle. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many boys I\u2019ve known that like to be talked down to. He\u2019s probably one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you say.\u201d She said with a smirk as you plan to just stay out of this conversation. The more you talk, the more you get annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked about you for a little bit more, but the conversation shifted away from you. It was like you were almost no there, and you were fine with that. Eevee even lowered her hand so she could eat herself. You were okay with it, since the eyes were not on at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, two of their eyes were on you. Flareon was one, but she was making it subtle. It was between glances, the quiet girl just taking shots at you from across the table. The other one was Umbreon, who more stared at you rather than taking quick glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCouldn\u2019t read her, but you can imagine what she would be thinking. All these girls seem to like you, and you imagine she is the same. maybe your size is helping with that, or maybe they have a thing for hairless primates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just relax and eat for a long while until the morning was over. Eevee went to grab you, but a sister was quicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself grabbed as you get pulled around. Only to be brought right to the face of Jolteon. \u201cSorry too slow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive him here!\u201d Eevee said, stomping her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI called dibs, let me have him.\u201d Jolteon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeafeon!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEevee, he needs to meet all of us properly. You can have him sleep in your room tonight, I promise.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cS-So i\u2019m going with Jolteon? Do I have to?\u201d You say as you were not very glad about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolteon raised you up to her smile as she laughed for several seconds. \u201cDon\u2019t worry squirt, i\u2019ll treat you well. Now come on, let\u2019s go to the backyard.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t really get a choice, as she simply walked away. You finally see the backyard as it was better than what you expected. Basically a giant grass lawn that spread around, a wooden gate around as well with a a small wooden house, one that you doubt any of the girls besides Eevee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was shining bright, and you were afraid for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo uh... hehe, Jolteon what are we going to do together?\u201d You question as she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna go for another run will you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but I am going to exercise.\u201d She started, heading over onto the grass. \u201cNot a mat, but it\u2019s gonna have to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, the words don\u2019t worry me. It\u2019s that smirk you have on your face.\u201d You announce to her as she understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, same with my sisters. Don\u2019t worry just gonna do a little exercise. let\u2019s start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she got to the middle and sat onto the trimmed grass. Stretching her legs out as sat on her rear. Bringing you around she brought you to her front and rested you onto her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just looked at you until you had to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExercise how? Just curious. Not to seem so wary but... well your sisters haven\u2019t painted you in the right picture. It\u2019s probably just my mind making stuff up b-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah they are right.\u201d She said being surprisingly honest. \u201cI\u2019m just a girl looking for some fun. Now let\u2019s have some fun. Lay down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL-Lay down. Sure.\u201d You say on edge as you do just that, relaxing on your back. Laying down as you see her face over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s do some lifts for you.\u201d Jolteon said, as she then pushed her finger down with power. Right down to you and pinning you with her finger. \u201cCome on you can do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes and do what she wants, lifting her furry yellow finger into the air. It took all your muscles to do it, but you lifted it high above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for her to change the pressure and then the weight. Pressing it down as you feel her heavy finger onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to lift it away into the air and squirm, but not being able to. \u201cJolteon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you lifted that up without much problems. Guess you were stronger than you look squirt? Probably got some nice muscles on your little body. Come on you can do it, i\u2019m not lifting my finger off otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel it and understand what she was saying. You do what she wants and try to lift her finger into the air. Only to find it too much for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I can\u2019t Jolteon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, then we are going to be here for a real long time.\u201d She said with a teasing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to take her dare, and see how long she would really let you wait. Only to gain some sense as you try to lift it again. This time with all your power, as much as you possibly can. Using all your strength for a long time as you shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you get it up. Slowly, but surely. Up in the air as you breath for a second, closing your eyes as you were struggling to hold it. \u201cOkay! Did it now stop!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you yelled this, Jolteon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did, now next level!\u201d With that, she brought you down and pushed her finger onto you. Holding you under her finger as the weight was a lot more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, i\u2019ll give you a break this time.\u201d She said as she figured that was a bit mean. Moving her finger she grabbed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers all around you as you get dropped onto something. She relaxed her body and laid down onto the lawn, placing you on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere, well of course her abs. She looked over her tits at you on her abs. A smirk on her face as you could swear she would not take that off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, i\u2019m gonna do my own workout squirt. Make sure to hold tight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over her abs you had to admit, she put in work. Not only was her rock hard abs a six pack, it was well defined even from above the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she brought her hands to the back of her head and rested her body. Getting up and walking around, until finally you feel her entire body come upwards. You were risking it as you could tip off and fall. Moving and getting onto your knees.<br>\r\n\u2028Right onto your knees as you grab her fur as she lifted herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was doing a sit up at the moment, and she was going to continue for a long while. bringing it down as you feel your world shift around, bringing you back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe repeated this several times, working out as she did sit ups fast and with power. Normally she would not do this in the back of the house, but she felt like it would be nice for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling you grip her over and over as she was liking your touch on her fur. She could see you as she raised her body up every time, and you were frightened about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really did not want to let go as it just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt your fingers let go. You were unable to do anything, as you fell down her abs. Getting a hard hit as it hurts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis happened for a long time, as you roll down off her stomach and onto her lap, pressing against her shorts and onto the ground below.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not something you wanted to do, and it was quick so you move and fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll around and drop to the bottom, hitting the grass as she smiled down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, seems like you couldn\u2019t hang with me. Don\u2019t worry squirt, I didn\u2019t think you would be able to. Still thanks for trying.\u201d She leaned her body forward and brought her finger to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoving it to you before you could truly get up. It came near you and lifted you into the air. You get pulled up for a long while as she dangled you over her finger. For your side, you had to hold on as you made sure not to fall down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, let\u2019s move onto the next thing. I want you to do some pull ups.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPull ups? Really?\u201d You question as she rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, do it. Just keep going until I tell you to stop, or... I don\u2019t i\u2019ll sit on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine i\u2019ll do it. Just make sure to catch me if I fall.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t get a confirmation from her, but you still did it. With her finger stretched out, you lifted your body up her finger. Using all the strength you could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did one easy, and let your body fall down to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s only one squirt,\u201d Jolteon said with a smirk. \u201cKeep on going, that\u2019s not enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I have gone through so much at this point, give me a break!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, just a few more though and you can do it at your own pace. Here, i\u2019ll even help you squirt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were confused, until her other hand came and her fingers came near you. They came right down under your feet, her finger giving you a platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for her to then raise you up, high above her finger as she was helping you. You could let go of the finger you were holding to at this point and you should be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side though, Jolteon m-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as you had that thought, she moved her finger and you came dropping like a trapdoor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went down and risked falling and dying, but grabbed her finger the last second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Jolteon not funny!\u201d You say back to her as she listens about it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on hahaha, it was hilarious! Get a sense of humour squirt, now... if you don\u2019t want me to do that again, you better start lifting your small body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen about it, and decide that in the end you should do what she wants. Lifting yourself up over and over until finally you were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing anymore, I don\u2019t think I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, i\u2019ll just do some stretches and we can be done.\u201d She said as she dropped you onto the grass. Maybe a bit too much, as you fell onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her shift her body above you until finally her rear was in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou risked getting sat on, and knowing Jolteon she just might so you back up a bit. If she was going to try to sit on you, she was going to miss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation wasn\u2019t what she was doing though. With a smirk once again, she moved her tight athlete\u2019s clothes and stretched herself back and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Well it was to do what she loved doing the most, tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeasing you with her giant ass, as it came right behind you and stuck itself there. You paused and felt a bit weird about it, seeing her giant furry cheeks in front of you.<br>\r\n\u2028She stretched herself forward, and moved back into the same position. This happened over and over again, as she toyed with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were not happy about it, but it was not like you really had a choice in the matter. You just try not to focus on her stretching. Looking away so you didn\u2019t see her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second that Jolteon saw your interest go away, so did hers. Her hand coming up and grabbing you. Getting onto her feet as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust did a little workout, you know for a little squirt. Still it\u2019s not bad, you got quite a bod there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teased and lifted your shirt with her finger, which you try to push away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you. Still, I think i\u2019ve got a perfect workout buddy. See how well you can go hanging with a big girl like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d You say a bit sarcastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cgreat, so you agreed. Next time we are going for a jog.\u201d Jolteon said as that was something you cared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Wait a second, please.\u201d You say finally as she rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, that\u2019s until tomorrow. Let\u2019s just rest until next time.\u201d With that, she finally moved down and went into the house. She walked right in, as she then brought you down near her giant yellow foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelp, gonna let you just walk around and go.\u201d She said simply, letting you rest. You see her giant towering body walk away as you were by yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you gonna do about this? Well, you were by yourself and you might as well go exploring. Near the outside room, you walk around and look out. Seeing the giant place. The backdoor was connected to a small laundry room, which connects to the kitchen. No one was there, so you did take the time looking around. They mostly had fruit, but you could see some other foods you are pretty sure Leafeon didn\u2019t grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the next room, it was the living room. They had a lot of chairs, with two sets of couches. You could understand why, considering how many sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting on a couch, man you could use that right now. That was the plan, but you stop when you see Flareon.</span></div></div>",

You could tell the girl hasn\u2019t seen you yet, which did interest you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could move along and explore the rest of the house, or you can go ahead and talk to this girl. She seems a bit more shy about you then the other girls, and if you are going to be living with them, you might as well try to break down this barrier that was between you and her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nyou approach her on the couch, standing near her foot as you looked up. Legs closed, with a tight white skirt over her body, a white sweater neck and more hair then the rest of her sisters. It was so big and had so much volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello.\u201d You say, trying not to spook her. It didn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEeepp!!\u201d She freaked out, jumping her body into the air. The book dropping down on her lap and her feet raising up onto the couch. Cradled in a ball, you can\u2019t believe you just scared this giant girl. Given your size at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlareon looked around until finally her eyes landed on you down below. Just standing by her and watching. Almost by instinct, she moved her fingers around and covered part of her face with her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there Flareon, what were you reading?\u201d You question, only to not get an answer. She just stayed at you and remained silent. You gave her time, but you guess she still wasn\u2019t okay with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could walk away, but you were going to try and stay. \u201cOkay... so mind if I get up there with you? I need a rest at this point.\u201d While you said this, you were expecting an answer back, but she didn\u2019t give one. In fact all she did was stare at you, like a deer caught in headlights. You slap your knee several times before giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s fine i\u2019ll just sit down here.\u201d You say to her as you onto your rear on the carpet. Crossing your legs. \u201cMy size, it\u2019s not like I could properly rest on the couch hehe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still looked. This was getting more and more awkward as we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...\u201d You say as you were starting to run out of questions. \u201cFlareon, how are you? How has your day been? Anything planned?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were general questions, a bit inclusive but you just had to strike up a conversation. She did not take the bet though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-Well mine have been a mixed bag so far. Waking up with Leafeon was nice, we even went out to her garden. Then Sylveon had me and... well let\u2019s just say she was playful. You can imagine can\u2019t you.\u201d You say laughing and trying to talk about something the both of you can relate to. She didn\u2019t have an interest though. Or she was just too scared to actually talk to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen Jolteon had me and oh boy, that was tough. That sister of yours is even more playful, and not in a good way.\u201d You say waiting for a reaction. She didn\u2019t give one, just the same watching face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren\u2019t getting anywhere, so you start to give up. With a sigh of disappointment, you turn around away from the girl. \u201cWell uh... i\u2019m just going to go now. Bye Flareon have a good day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were walking away, feeling like you didn\u2019t get any closer to the girl, she did say something that raised your interest/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did she do?\u201d She questioned. It was light, and even you had trouble hearing her. However this was your ticket in and you were gonna take it. Turning your body back to her, you see her eyes once again. Slightly changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well... she took me outside and forced me to lift her finger, putting down more and more pressure on it.\u201d You say as you see her listening, but she was not responding. Once you realise that this was not going to be a conversation, you continued talking to her. \u201cThen she did her own sit ups, and made me grab onto her abs as she moved. of course I feel down off her body onto the ground. She lifted me up, then forced me to do pull ups with her finger. Your sister is very intense, i\u2019m also pretty sure she\u2019s planning on doing that often so yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-Are you okay?\u201d She questioned as you smiled even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh yeah i\u2019m fine. Just kind of need to rest right now. Don\u2019t worry about it though, i\u2019ll find a different spot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Y-You can sit next to me... if you want?\u201d She said as this was your chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, thanks!\u201d You say as you get up close to the couch. Looking up at her eyes you just had to. \u201cUm... it\u2019s not like I can get up there by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cR-Right.\u201d She said before closing her eyes and laying her hand down next to you. With it near you, you step onto the platform. You can tell Flareon jumped while you did this, but clearly tried to keep her hand down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay uh... lift off!\u201d You say thinking she would be okay with that. She lifted you off the ground and into the air. Her eyes poking open as she saw you on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand was shaking, but as she lifted you up more she got more steady. Her eyes on you for a long time as she just holds you there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Flareon, she was a little scared of you before. After all, she hasn\u2019t been the most courageous of the girls, in fact she was scared of small things like bugs as well as bigs things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, you were a different creature, and she didn\u2019t know you. A true introvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding you in her hand though, Flareon felt relaxed. You weren\u2019t mean, or angry. You were just small. Who was being nice.</span></div></div>",

You could see a small smile appear on her face as you guess that was a good thing. She was kind, and she was opening up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... Flareon? You okay?\u201d You say just wanting to make sure. She looked right at you for a long while before blinking her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Sure. Sorry.\u201d She said putting you down onto the couch. She let you down as her hand rested on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comfy couch as you were excited. You needed a break due to Jolteon and this was over. You move around and relax. only for her fingers to curl up. Acting like a gate to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take several steps as you look back at her. \u201cUh... Flareon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her hand as she started to talk once again. \u201cYou asked me what I was reading before. I\u2019m reading a romance book.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA romance book?\u201d You say as you suddenly turn and smile to her. You were gonna take the chance. \u201cSure, what\u2019s it about!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled hearing that you were excited about hearing. She moved you around and rose her book showing the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story about a water type Pokemon and a fire type Pokemon falling in love. Although due to their types, they were from two different worlds. I\u2019ve gotten to where they first find out that they love each other.\u201d Flareon said as you smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really into those kind of books, but glad to know you enjoy them.\u201d You say back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI enjoy all types of books, every genre.\u201d She said, as she was really sharing at this point. Guess holding you was the trigger for her to open. Maybe because she could just feel how small you were. \u201cI\u2019ve got bookshelves in my room and i\u2019v read most of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you got one my side I would love to read it.\u201d You say trying to make a joke, but she didn\u2019t listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right you probably don\u2019t want to hear me go on and on about myself. You just want to rest after Jolteon right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, yeah of course. Although I would still love to hear your interests. You can move me around and sit me down onto the couch and then you can talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe couch?\u201d She said as she was glad you were going to listen, however she wanted you somewhere else. She wanted you close and reward you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile on her face as she brings you around. She brings you around and dropped you onto her stomach. Right onto her sweater as she leaned her body down. Even moving her hand around and covering you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were left confused, looking right up to her and seeing her smile down to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlareon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I-I hope this is more comfy for you.\u201d She said as you were enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, kind of is.\u201d You say relaxing your body. \u201cSo tell me about yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, well I like books. Like I said, i\u2019ve been reading them ever since I was little. I was young with Vaporeon and Jolteon, so when they were outside, I was reading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith those two? Couldn\u2019t be easy.\u201d You say to her as she didn\u2019t want to insult her sisters, but brought her face in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone, but when Jolteon asked me to play and I said I was busy, I was just reading books.\u201d She said as she gave out a giggle. Wasn\u2019t that big a thing, but the fact that she was treating it like one made yourself giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two talk around for a little while, as you were doing what works with girls the best. Asking about them. She told you mostly about her books, until the conversation went somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou knit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI knit in my room. I don\u2019t do it in front of the other girls.\u201d She said a bit ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn your room why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Jolteon would make fun of me, and Glaceon would use me. I just do it for peaceful times.\u201d She said, both of them thinking about it for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you enjoy it keep doing it, don\u2019t let your fear of what other people thinking stop you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, I knit and I wear what I knit all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about it for a long while, until you realise something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, this sweater. Did you knit it, just to make sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-Well it depends. Do you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... yeah it really is well made. Couldn\u2019t even tell you did it by hand.\u201d You say this to her as she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad you like it!! In fact... well if you need clothes, I might be able to make some little ones for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t expect this, so of course you took your smile and plastered it on your face. \u201cReally! That would be amazing! I\u2019ve been wearing these clothes for the past few days. In fact, if you didn\u2019t give this, I would be taking some tissues and wearing them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, i\u2019m g-glad I can help.\u201d She said, not use to being thanked like this. She never spends this much time with people, not even her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two talk and relax for a little bit more, until finally you closed your eyes and truly rested. You have no idea why, but her body was warm, even a bit hot. Almost like she had a fever or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you were going to go from hot to cold in a quick second, as you hear a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFlareon, i\u2019m taking him now.\u201d You get your sight and see Glaceon! The girl in a long light blue dress that covered most of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Uh... h-he wan-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d Glaceon said grabbing you, before you could answer you were grabbed by her cold fingers. \u201cYou\u2019ve had your time Flareon.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So you were being grabbed and taken somewhere else. You really should expected it, but it was not like you could do anything about it. You can just hope Flareon will stop Glaceon, but considering her sister isn\u2019t confrontational, you doubt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlareon had her mouth open several times, but it did not actually happen. Not a single word being uttered, as it was finished. Glaceon headed forward and moved into her room. Flareon having to go back to her book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was happening, you were getting thrown and tossed around in the closed hand. Unable to do it as she took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing into her room, she opened her fingers, letting you see the room. It was well kept, well decorated, but it was not enough to make you relaxed. You can\u2019t help but worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Glaceon, what are you plannin-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you call me?\u201d She questioned, her face looking a bit serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... I called you Glaceon, is that not okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue girl smiled. \u201cYou see, I think, considering your size it wouldn\u2019t really make sense. Those my size call me Glaceon, but I feel you need to add a... certain title in front of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA title?\u201d You say as you were confused. She smiled as she sat down, crossing her legs and relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right a title. Now how would you like to address me, Queen Glaceon, or Goddess Glaceon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe questioned this, as you were left confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPick one, I will only let you address me as one. You see, Goddess makes me sound powerful, which I am, but Queen makes it sound like I am in charge, which I am.\u201d She said as you were gonna guess she wants one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQueen I guess. Queen Glaceon, you happy about that?\u201d You say as she relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery, now as your queen.\u201d She said placing her hand to her chest. \u201cI think some servitude is in order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-Servitude?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, your queen does not like repeating herself, you should really correct yourself about that.\u201d She said as you were left confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you have no idea about girls do you? Oh you are so cute, perfect for a servant. You see, while my sisters looked at you and thought, \u2018oh he is so cute\u2019 while I was thinking about something else. He can serve me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat.\u201d You say simply, unable to get the smile about it. \u201cSo, what am I do-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you are cute, but extremely stupid. I want you to serve me. A foot rub I believe will be a good start.\u201d She brought you down to the ground right in front of her feet. Sticking them out in front of you as you panic and make sure not to get touched about it. \u201cWell get to it, you Queen demands it from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine i\u2019ll do this, i\u2019ll play along.\u201d You say back to her as she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlay along, no your Queen is forcing this on you.\u201d She said leaning in. \u201cYou see, I usually force my will onto my sisters. From a very yo- Wait, start rubbing first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped her monologue just to order you. Well you are gonna listen to the giant girl who can crush you under her cold foot. You move ahead and start rubbing her sole that was hung above you. Ignoring the large toes as you and her both know she can grab you with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect, now you see from a young age I taught myself how to trick my sisters. Do small and simple things for them and get a favour about it, and then cash the favour in for something much worse. It\u2019s a bit annoying though, I will admit. Having to constantly do things for them just to get them to listen to me, and it can\u2019t even be that extreme. I cleaned the entire house when my sisters were away, and they didn\u2019t even consider my \u2018Worship\u2019 idea. That infuriated me.\u201d She said as you were a little bit concerned. \u201cYou however, I don\u2019t need manipulate, I just tell you to do it, and you do it. You know why, you are small and if you don\u2019t listen I will step on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat... is very obvious.\u201d You say as you just work on her sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will admit, you can work on your tone. Perhaps I need to train you, make you a better servant.\u201d Glaceon said as you were not liking how she was talking about you. More like her property. You had a good mind to talk back to her, but given your size, your position and the fact that no one else will see you be quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work and rub her foot several times as she relaxed. Feeling your small effort on her foot as she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo... you want to be treated like a queen?\u201d You question to her speaking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll girls do my little servant, they are just too afraid to admit it.\u201d Glaceon said as she moved her feet around. Sticking the other foot in front and over your face. \u201cOther one now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it Queen.\u201d You say as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just love when you call me that. I did make the right choice with Queen didn\u2019t I?\u201d She said waiting for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah you sure did. Tell me something Queen, do I still have to call you Queen when others around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI expect you to address me exclusively from that from this point on.\u201d She said finally as you guess that was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work on her foot for even longer, until finally she dragged her feet back and away from you. Placing them as she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSix out of ten for that foot rub, I expect better next time.\u201d She said as you guess she was planning to do this again. \u201cNext thing, is the nail polish. This will be interesting now.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She came close and moved her fingers down to you. Opening the cap and giving you the brush. The brush was easy enough for her to hold it between two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you though, it required a firm grip as it was like you were holding a broadsword. Not happy about it, but it was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her foot down in front of you as she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, get to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, my Queen.\u201d You say with a bow, which was an attempt to suck up to her. You know that was the best thing for you. Moving closer you try to stick the brush into the opening, only to find that you could not really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was high above you. So climbing up the bottle, you stuck it in there. Wasn\u2019t easy, but seems like Glaceon was willing to wait for you. She was willing to wait because of what she is going to get. Eventually you stuck it in, and it was covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a jump down, you carried the brush over. Already a bit tired, and you haven\u2019t even touched the first toe. \u201cS-Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, your Queen is a forgiving one, well... sometimes. Now she is, so get to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood.\u201d You say finally as you start putting polish on her toes. With a shift left and right as you feel pretty good about this part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were able to not only even it out because you were so close, but made sure not to get any of the blue polish on her blue fur. Which was not very easy to see honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking steps back from the paw, you look around and try to decide what you are gonna do next. Moving onto the next toe of course!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was happening, so you were gonna try to get through it quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you are so cute. Tell you what, why don\u2019t you shower your Queen with compliments.\u201d She said this as you paused, looking to her for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cF-For real?\u201d You say as she frowned. \u201cOh my mistake. For real, my Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo it, now. That is an order.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my Queen, how beautiful you have.\u201d You say doing what she wants. \u201cBy far the prettiest out of your sisters, envy of all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, keep going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am so glad! That I get to worship your royalties. It is an honour of a lifetime. I totally want to be here right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTone down the sarcasm, and try again.\u201d She said as you guess you were going to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing up and getting more paint on the brush, you tell her. \u201cUh.. your hair is amazing, the amount of volume it has, not to mention the way it\u2019s brushed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... you are trying to hard. You have to make it natural.\u201d She said as you were not really sure what she wants. Getting down you start brushing more toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you are pretty. Probably the most of the sisters. I doubt it\u2019s fully the makeup.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, keep talking about your Queen\u2019s beauty.\u201d She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that is what happened, talking about her and polishing her toes. You were driven to finish it quick, so when you did you were so happy, even dropping the brush onto the carpet of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, done.\u201d You say in between breaths as you were looking up to her. She was inspecting her work and she had to admit, it was good. \u201cYou paint toes much better than you rub feet. As for the compliment\u2019s to your Queen, get better at that. When you can compliment a girl easily, you can get any one of them. Or us, if you were gonna go that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my Queen. Am I done my Queen? I am, so tired my Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDone, no we are just getting started!\u201d A voice said as you blinked a couple of times. \u201cAfter all, my fingernails I feel deserve the same treatment, and that\u2019s an order from your Queen.\u201d She said this with so much joy. \u201cNow say \u2018thank you Queen\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*Sigh*, Thank you Queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat a good day we have had! You are always welcome in your Queen\u2019s kingdom!\u201d Glaceon said happily, waving you away. \u2028\u2028After a long day of servitude, you were finally getting free. She had about fifteen more things after painting her nails, just menial jobs. You were exhausted, more than it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just hope it\u2019s getting late, you really need a sleep. Not to mention you were also very hungry. \u201cMaybe I should find Eevee, I-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh good, you are free.\u201d A voice said as you paused in the middle of the hallway. Turning your head and looking at a sister peeking through the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was large, pink furred and had glasses on. It was Espeon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you come in here please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I\u2019m kind of tired, and hungry-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have food in here. A much shorter journey than the kitchen downstairs.\u201d She said as you guess she had a point. \u201cYou coming?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes my Quee- Espeon!\u201d You say as she was not going to focus on that. She headed inside and you can hear her setting things up. You follow, while noting not to make a habit of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into her doorway as you look into her room, clean and... a bit boring. Well instead for the long desk she had. She has more things there then in her room in general! It wasn\u2019t like it was crowded either, everything was organised and you were a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon was already sitting down, on a swivel chair as she moves around. Dropping her hand. \u201cGood you are here, please get on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.\u201d You say back to her getting on the hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSimple really, I am planning on testing you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

This is a story just for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch less of an interactive, as it's just gonna be me adding a line to a story ever now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription on the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEevee.  She's still young, and just wants to play. Doesn't understand the whole appeal of boys thing, but does feel funny when with the little guy. Her body is just developing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVaporeon: Oldest sister, flirty and sedcutive. Got large boobs and large ass and loves to show them off. Not to mention a fantastic swimmer, and just feels comfortable in the water<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJolteon: Sporty sister. Loves going for runs, and is a bit of a tomboy. Athelete's body. She's a teaser, and would sometimes be described as a bully. However to her it's just fun<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlareon: Shy girl who blushes easy. Hiding behind her hair most of the time and wearing her sweater. Soft spoken, however when she gets heated and passionate, it could be dangerous for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspeon: Skinnest out of the girls, with glasses. Total bookworm, and would be more interested in studing if anything. Her sister's have called her too direct and too rude, but she doesn't see it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUmbreon: Goth and dark. has a very monotone voice and rarely shows emotion. She could be totally excited, but none of her sister's will ever see it, but the tiny might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafeon: The most down to earth girl. Understanding, kind, lovely. Mostly works on her large garden. She cleans up the house and scolds the others as she takes a motherly role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlaceon: Glaceon is rude, condescending and cheeky. She keeps up her appearance well and can be described as cold. Has one dream, to be treated like a queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylveon: The second yongest sister, but has the biggest pair of the lot. Excitably, happy and very playful, always able to get a laugh and a giggle from all the other sisters</td>",
