The Luna really hadn't been that deep into space when the accident had occurre, so the food was still better than the completely inedible andimagitively named 'nutrient biscuits', which studies had shown decreased the morale of ship shwose crew members had been forced into eating them by about 20%. You reach the small cabin, with just enough room for all seven of the Luna's crew members to eat, though Karl would have to stand in the doorway if he insisted on wearing his cowboy hat. You stride up to the vending machine capable of almost instantly producing nearly any food found anywhere on earth (though Mr. Gray was disappointed and irritated, in keeping with local tradition and custom, to discover that many of his favorite snacks weren't classified as 'food'). Humming, you declare to the machine \"Surprise me!\" And a large, roughly spherical object rolls out onto a tray at the bottom, next to a plate and some cutlery. You can't help but feel like you've seen it somewhere before, possibly on a movie... Moving on to another part of the song, you sit dwon and start prodding at the dish, the unidentifiable substances smeared over its rough brown surface, wondering where to start eating it, ass you lean over to look at it from above though, a dozen or so flaps suddnely fly open in all directions, and something inside leaps out. The bony thing lands on your face, thrashing crazily and hanging on with a half-dozen legs, while it seems to be doing something horribly remeniscent of kissing you. \"Gah! It's on my face! The mess rations are trying to eat me! Help!\" You scream falling over onto the floor, hands going to ypur face to wrench the bony, slimy thing off. \"Hold still, Dev! I'll get it off!\" You hear someone yell, and you suddenly fell something-flat, metallic, and very hard-slamming into your head repeatedly. \"Dang! Persistent little bugger! Don't move!\" before you can ask what he or she's going to do, you feel like you've been badly sunburned all over your head and shoulders. You groan as the thing comes, free, leaving a patch of mucus all over the front of your head, and it scuttled up the table, in to the thing impersonating a meal, and then out the door with shocking speed. \"What the hell are those lunatics provisioning us with? Those rations almost bit my head off!\" You look to your saviour, Alex Reed, holding a faintly smoking PLS in one hand and a frying pan in the other. \"I don't think that that thing was food. I was just in the science lab, and scanners indicated there to be an unidentifiable lifefrom on board. Something about it makes it hard for the computers to indentify its exact location, but I could see it was in the galley area. Good thing I came in here to check it out. And haven't you seen any of the<i> alien </i>movies?! I think that it might be able to sense things in our memory that scare us, and might react instinctevly by morphing into their appearence; why it looked identicle to an exenomorph egg. C'mon, lets get after it before it can cause any more trouble!\"</span></div></div>",

Apparently she wants you to come closer.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou casually stroll over to her and plop down in an empty chair. \"Yeah, Captain?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Officer Barrak, Officer O'connor is missing and we need to find him. I'm afraid he may have been injured somehow and is now lying somewhere unable to contact us.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Did he survive the crash?\" You ask\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes, I just spoke to him 40 minutes ago. He said he was going to the galley. When I went to find him he wasn't there.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"And... you want me to go look for him?\" You shift uncomfortably in your chair.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Either you can go with Alex Reed to the top decks, or Dana Pendrell to the bottom decks.\" Brea said, and then leaned forward to whisper, \"I need to keep those two seperated.\"</span></div></div>",

Let's see if you can survive this excitingly scary and at times hilarious adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story you'll be playing the part of either Trish Barrak or Devin Porter (Obviously you will choose Trish if you are a girl and Devin if you are a boy... but of course you can switch if you want, you know, and choose the opposite one)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Luna is a spaceship in the year 2455 which has (at this point in the story) crash landed on a planet far away from Earth (which will be can be called Terra in this story). The real bad part comes when they find out who else is on that planet. It turns out that the planet is inhabited by an extremely hostile alien species (of course!) called the zylogigs. Pretty typical? Well maybe, except for the fact that these aliens can shapeshift to look like anything or anyone. That can be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your character must try to rescue the crew of the Luna before everyone (including you) is eaten up by those nasty aliens. Now to brief you for your mission:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapons:<br>\r\n<b>PLS</b>---Mostly referred to as PLS but sometimes referred to as a Pulse Laser Shooter. It's a nice, revolver sized gun which is very powerful, but pretty much ineffective against the zylogigs due to their alien genetics which makes that particular type of laser basically useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Melamine Phaser</b>---A small weapon with little actual fire power. Usually good for humans, but it's like sprinkling water on a bonfire when it comes to zylogigs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Pipes and other parts of the ship</b>---Generally good for combatting zylogigs as you can hit them over the head with these misc. pieces. One word of warning though: Bashing their head in won't kill them because their brains are located in their stomachs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<b>Trish Barrak: </b> A 23 year-old engineer who has short brown hair (above shoulder length) and dark brown eyes. She cracks jokes when she's nervous or uncomfortable and isn't very sociable in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Devin Porter:</b> A 25 year-old chemist with black hair and blue eyes. He's usually a pretty warm and sociable kind of guy who's very witty and clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>Non-Playable Characters</i></b><br>\r\n(Characters which can appear in the story but you can't *BE*)<br>\r\n<b> Brea Marlson:</b> The captain of the Luna. She's stubborn and likes things done her way. She has an iron fist and fiery temper to match her red hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Kal O'Connor: </b> 2nd in command of the Luna. He's cowboy-ish and truely Texan in nature. With a flashing pearly smile it's no wonder he's married with children (two small girls).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Alex Reed:</b> Computer Specialist who constantly gets in fights with Dana Pendrell. The two are almost inseperable like brothers and sisters who love to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Dana Pendrell:</b> Physicist with short red hair and blue eyes (the one who fights with Alex Reed). She's cute, but try not to get in her way or she just might rip you limb from limb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Kamira Roberts: </b> Head Scientist of the Luna. She has grey eyes and long black hair. She usually wears glasses and has a very good temperament usually, but sometimes she gets so mad she's scary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Anorian Johnson:</b> Squirmish yet lovable. Faints at the sight of blood and vomits when stressed or views something unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> Dos Gray:</b>An old, bitter engineer who hates almost everything. He complains all the time and has a typically bad attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know that's a lot of characters, but those are all you can have so you should be grateful so many are included, lol. Don't worry, you don't have to use all of them *grin*. Just have fun!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n So now you are ready to begin. When you come to a dead end *PLEASE* write a new chapter!
