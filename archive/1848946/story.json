From levitation and fireballs to force fields and meteors they teach it all. You are16 making this your second year at the school. You\u2019ve passed all his introductory courses so you know the basics like some electricity and freezing spells (they\u2019re your specialty). It's the first day of the new year so everything is a bit chilled out. The seniors and teachers are giving demonstrations of the courses you can take in the sophomore classrooms. You should probably attend one or two to see what you want to take this year. Alternatively sophomores are allowed to take requests at the job board in the main hall. The jobs range from item collection to demon slaying. If you\u2019re feeling more like just hanging out you can go chill out on the quad see if anybody's doing anything interesting. The principal has also opened the vault for the days events so students can come and see a museum of the most powerful and ancient of all magical tools and artifacts. And if you honestly doesn't give a crap about school he can always just go to town and see what's going on down there. What do you choose to do:</span></div></div>",

You walk down the hall and see a list of classes being held in this section of the building. There is a class specializing in transformation spells. Things like turning enemies into cats or yourself into the/ enemy, it truly is a broad category. Summoning is the next one which catches your eye. You start out small with bats and owls but in the later classes you can summon things like golems and magic birds. If you become a master you can even summon avatars of the gods themselves. The next class while being a bit less grand then the previous two is a necessary class for any sorcerer, potions. It covers simple things like healing and stamina drinks as well as explosives and ritual ingredients. The last class to grab your attention is teleportation. It's a rather self-explanatory class. They teach you how to preform spells that send you from here to there. You decide to go to:</span></div></div>",

You find a seat near the back and focus your attention on the professor at the front of the class. He starts to go on about the essentials of transformation spells and the inner focus and blah, blah, blah. You stop caring and take a nap. You wake up at the point when you here people getting up. You look around and it seems it has come to the part of the class that's hands on. You get up ready to try your hand at these new spells. You all stand at the front of the class A pile of objects on the table in front of all of you. They instruct you all to pick an item. After that you should clasp it in your hands and focus on the object you should then imagine yourself with the object as a a part of you. The spell is the most amateur of transformation spells as you can't really control what you turn into. Instead of using your magic to control your form you use the essence of the object.
