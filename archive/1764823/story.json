She was constantly getting lost in the myriad of similarly shaped corridors, even though for the past month she had spent most of her time in the same 300m radius. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was an empath. From a young age her grandma had taught her some basic astrology skills, and Karen combined those with a keen sense of body language and emotional receptivity to a point where she began to attract the attention of a few local news casts. Not a week later, she got an invitation to a special academy offering to hone these skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, she really enjoyed the program, the people who were running the program had an itinerary of events and studies that Karen would never believe people could get funding for. There were courses on remote viewing, telepathy training, and these strange breathing exercises that reminded Karen of yoga, except that afterwards she would always get extremely disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the program started to get weird. Clearly some of the other participants were feeling strange effects from the courses as well, but the studies just got stranger. Karen refused to be a part of one project where a specialist came in to do touch therapy. Karen got a very strange vibe off of the man, and watching the first volunteer starting to bleed out his ears was too much. Karen stood up to protest and was quickly ushered out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Karen was moved to a separate group. They were gathered around some occultic symbols drawn on the ground. Karen understood a few of the signs to be astrological, having to do with Saturn and the Sun. The man leading the group talked about contacting extradimensional forces through emotional concentration. Karen's mind was still reeling from the previous course and began to drift off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hazy half sleep she saw a shadowy figure behind the man talking in the center of the geometric pattern. The shadowy figure moved towards Karen with a sharp clarity that contrasted with her drowsy state. It didn't say anything, but rather seemed to be considering Karen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren half reached out to the shadowy figure, and as she did it quickly reached out and grabbed her arm. Karen would have screamed if she wasn't asleep. The feeling of the creatures arm was sharp and frightening, but momentarily Karen realized that the feeling was actually information being transferred into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up with a start, back in her own room. Judging by the snoring of the three other girls, it was night time. Karen still felt extremely out of sorts, realizing she had a feverish amount of sweat pouring off of her. Her head began pounding with an unfamiliar weight. What she didn't realize is that she had been altered in a very significant way:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blurry headache passed, and Karen got up and went to the washroom. She splashed her face with water, trying to dissipate the strange feeling in her head. She could feel everything around her, like there was a giant static charge to everything around her. She could feel the guards walking outside the washroom before they knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright in there Karen?\"<br>\r\nKaren heard the words, but felt the underlying unease and fear in their voices. She wished they were calmer.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, just needed to pee.\"<br>\r\n'I wish you'd go away' she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And just like that she felt them walk down the hall. Karen was very excited about this new ability. She closed her eyes and started to feel the space around her. She spread her mind past the walls of the bathroom, finding the girls in the room across the hall, before finding her room with her bunk mates. She then probed down the hall, finding a few more rooms, the empty class room, and then a hidden staircase she had never known was there! Excitedly she passed through the staircase to a level above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the upper level the energy was much different. Karen scrunched her face... it felt like pins and needles in the first room. It felt like it was empty but Karen hesitated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No' she thought 'It feels like something is hidden. I want you to show yourself'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again she had felt as though she had affected something. The feeling of pins and needles began to unfold in her brain. It was all Karen could do to keep from screaming. A large voice boomed in her ears 'You do not hold jurisdiction over this space!' Karen staggered around the washroom trying to fend off the vertigo that was taking over her balance. 'I suggest you go back to bed little girl.' The voice was a command. Karen started to walk down the hall to her bedroom before she regained some measure of self control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren sent a thought to the receding feeling in her brain. 'Tell me what you are, and give me your power.' Suddenly the feeling of pins and needles was back full bore, and Karen collapsed against the wall. The being she was communicating with was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She understood in an instant that the being she had contacted was some sort of extra dimensional entity that had been bound to this world by a devious contract. Suddenly she felt a strange surge of power run through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren's shirt pulled tight around her as she felt every muscle in her body tense up. She started to feel cramping in all her extremities before a thunderclap headache overwhelmed her consciousness, and she passed out. She awoke a few minutes later with a strange buzzing around her. At first she couldn't figure out where the hum was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over herself Karen realized that she wasn't hurt, though she was slightly dissappointed in how dirty he had gotten her clothes. 'I wish I was in something clean' she thought, and instantly she was dressed in a clean set of jeans and a tshirt she was sure she had left at home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding slightly stupefied Karen wished she could understand what had happened to her, and instantly she grasped the breadth of power she now wielded having absorbed the multidensional energy of the djinn she had just contacted. Probing with her mind, she realized that the djinn had been released from its contract by whatever she had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuivering with excitement Karen realized the faint humming was her body trying to contain the massive energies now swirling invisibly aroun her. 'well perhaps I need a more appropriate body' she thought to herself as she started to grow taller. Inch by inch she grew until she stood at a commanding six feet. Her breasts began to blossom into a mouth watering pair of DDs that strained her tshirt. Karen created a mirror in dept of her to watch her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself the teen realized that she was literally ascending to god hood. She grabbed herself lewdly as she perfected her body, layering the images of beauty that she had been inundated with her whole life onto her body. Her legs grew long and swelled with sinew strong as steel. Her ass rounded out tight and juicy, flowing beautifully into her hips. Her tight waist etched itself into a cut 8 pack, while her torso followed suit. By the time she had reached her face Karen hardly recognized herself anymore. She plumped her lips ever so slightly and raised her cheekbones, accentuating her almond eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren was an exotic goddess, looking almost comical in her undersized clothes. She waved her hand and in an instant was gowned in a diaphanous toga that did little to hide her supernatural allure. Smiling at herself she made the mirror vanish, and paused to consider what her next step would be.</span></div></div>",

As her mind billowed outwards dimensions unfolded within her brain and she begun to grasp the true extent of the universe. Eyes watering, this vision of beauty began to orgasm as her mind was overcome with infinite powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaren pawed her oversexed body as her powerful body was almost boiling under the skin. Karen then lifted out of her body and into a nebulous indistinct sort space, much like the sense she had gotten from the djinn originally. Knowing this to be one of the higher representations of reality, Karen found herself drawn to a light source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon approaching the light, the nebulous fog cut away and Karen was face to face with her jaw dropping self. Hesitant Karen moved closer, somewhat unnerved that her double was moving independent of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you me?' Karen thought at her double.<br>\r\n'No' her reflection thought back, in an alluring chorus of thoughts.<br>\r\n'You may call us Sophia, we are here to guide you in the higher realms. This form is a fraction of your essence as experienced in the fifth dimension'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophia leaned in close, causing Karen to catch her breath.<br>\r\n'I chose your form because you chose it, now I have something to share' <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had just finished a very specific DNA program and was triple checking her notes before uploading it into the engineered virus she had injected into the lab rats, Pinky and Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was very good at what she did. A PhD in Bioengineering with a minor in Computer programming, Helen had been working on this project for 3 years. 3 years of unmarked flights from Newark to this remote lab. Helen understood the gravity of her work. She had signed enough non-disclosure forms that she resigned herself to never being able to talk about her work in public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet.\" she muttered to herself under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the project was extremely compartmentalized, Helen was smart enough to know what exactly the scope of the project was. The programs she was writing in the DNA would be wirelessly uploaded to the engineered viruses, at which point they would upgrade certain physical attributes while reducing others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen was working on a project to create the perfect soldier. The software was still in it's earliest stages but the concept was that whatever biological unit was infected could have it's entire physiology and mental abilities altered to the desires of the controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the monitor, Helen opened up a rudimentary control screen. It had options to increase and decrease intelligence, physical size, and aggression. Saving her work, she clicked opened a connection with pinky. She decreased the mouse's intelligence, watching it stop feeding and instead running into the wall over and over. She then altered the physical size slider. The response was much more gradual, but she saw Pinky grow to 150% of his original size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting the sliders back to the original setting, Helen sighed a troubled sigh on contemplation. She knew that her many years of work was for this moment. She had spent years working for what she knew in her heart to be a black ops project, and now was the time for her to start biting the hand that had been feeding her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen rolled some of the heavy lab equipment in front of the lab door. She slid a USB key into the computer, and began copying over the virus she had on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately alarms started ringing. Helen's initial fear was replaced with adrenaline as she prepped a syringe with a small amount of clear fluid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now or never\" she said even as she plunged the needle into her butt. She quickly turned on her phone, and began running a much more complex version of the app she had just tested out on the mice. This phone app had a number of interesting sliders on it, all much more articulate than the one being deleted by the virus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelen tapped the slider for strength and density, sliding them halfway. She slid the size one a quarter of the way. Guards began to pool on the other side of the lab door, banging on it, trying to push through the mass of lab gear on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear was streaking through Helen's brain before a different feeling crept over her, as her clothes began to creek. Looking down on herself, Helen watched as her once frail body began to tone up, surging forward like a sensual claymation. She dropped to her knees as her skirt blasted off her hips. Rising to her new height of  6\"0 Helen turned to see the guards slowly pushing the piled of lab equipment that blocked the door. Eyeing the serious looking guns they were all pointing at her through the glass, she turned to her phone she decided to:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hands moved over her erogenous areas as her hips began to smooth and widen, while her breasts crept forward to a full perky D. Her whole body began to emanate sexual tension as her skin began to glow a healthy hue. Her ass pulled her somewhat plain panties into a dramatic g-string.

Her sleep was restless as she flitted through various dreams, all very similar seeming but with a strange nightmarishly foreign edgE to them. She woke up I a cold sweat. Looking down at herself, Lee was shocked by the vividness of all the colors around her. It was though somebody had supercharged reality with luminescent energy. She could even see trails of energy trailing down the halls, it was exciting and slightly surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee's first thought was that she was drugged, and that's when her emotions began to play games on her. She started laughing maniacally before collapsing in tears. One minute she felt elation and the next utter depression. A part of her mind began to feel increasingly detached as her body racked through the extremes of human emotion; and then it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee climbed back on to the cot she had fallen off. Her body was trembling with exhaustion, but her vision was starting to change too. Strange characters were flickering in her peripheral vision, and the walls around her were blinking translucent, and Lee could see through the walls. Suddenly pleasure began to course through her body. This was the mounting pleasure of an orgasm but Lee had not even time to grope herself before the pleasure had exploded within her. She fell off the cot again as her body paroxysmed with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to the writhing girl her body was changing too. She was lengthening, and piling on lithe muscle on her once petite frame. Lee was frantically fingering herself while crying out in a low voice , trying with urgency to find the same release she had felt just moments before. She glanced down at herself and was shocked to see her body straining against the non-descript hospital gown she was in. Her body, once frail and thin was now tall and athletic. She grabbed her now B cup breasts and twisted her nipples, finding the sensation she needed to Put herself over the edge. She came in a torrent of vaginal fluid, and felt vaguely guilty and satisfied at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up to her new height, which she estimated to be closer to six feet than not at this point. Lee could not believe the dramatic changes that had occurred in her body, but still felt some of the detachment she had gained earlier. Looking around her cell at the strange patterns of energy, she felt a strong pull towards this unique pattern. It was very faint but it seemed close by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlinking to the door of her cell, Lee pulled on the door, which was obviously pocked. Something in her felt like tugging hard, and she wasn't very surprised when she pulled the door open, along with a chunk of concrete from the wall. Lee smirked to herself as she disapPeared down the hall towards the source of that pattern.</span></div></div>",

One of them opened it's eyes and made eye contact with her. The energy patterns which seemed to emanate from thes beings swelled as a sudden torrent of information flooded Lee's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the various dimensions that reality operated on, and the differing energitical densities of each level. She understood that these creatures were slowly dying and there was nothing she could do for them. She saw that they were actually born on earth, and that their civilization lived in the depths of the ocean. From what she could understand their species seeds water onto planets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contact was brief but Lee felt like a completely different person for it.

The energy signatures of these poor creatures stuck out because of how rotten the energy was in the rest of the building. Even looking at herself, lee could see trace amounts of this filthy energy coursing her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew it was time to reset the structure in this place. She was part of a movement, a process of complex change that was sweeping the globe. She had no clue who else was connected to it, but she knew what she had to do. Glancing around her she found the heaviest piece of industrial machinery, some sort of large generator that was fused into the wall. She slinked over, and with a small amount of effort tore the generator from the wall. Immediately sprinklers started spraying and an alarm went off. Lee didn't care she was lost in the sensation of using her strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee had never been a physically imposing person. Though quite fiery and self confident, much of that was due to her short and plain appearance. Now that she was a superstrong supermodel, she felt a torrent of sexual energy being loosed in her by her superhuman acts. She threw the generator as hard as she could, watching it tear through walls and floors for nearly 200 meters before embedding in rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee felt how slippery her thighs were when she walked over to another gigantic industrial apparatus and similarly destroyed it with only a minimum of effort. Lee was sweating harder from her sexual desire than any physical exertion. As Lee continued to destroy the high tech world around her, explosions and structural collapses began to occur around her. Lost in her sexual frenzy Lee was now masturbating furiously. Around her the base was burning, the backup sprinklers had been completely demolished by Lees impromptu redecorating.</span></div></div>",

From the bumbling staff who couldn't see past the menial tests they ran to the faceless military grunts who were used to experiment on. It was sad that a woman of her intelligence was stuck playing mommy for these idiots playing soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused and recomposed herself. The sneer was off her face for about 30 seconds before it crept back on. The test subject earlier today had confirmed Anna's suspicions that the drug was more than ready for military application. And of course the fact that they were stalling meant that Anna's knowledge may finally have outlasted her usefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna smiled remembering how long it took to gas the subject. Anna knew that escaping this high tech dungeon would require a lot more than the temporary invulnerability that the drug seemed to provide. Pulling a number of catalysts from a shelf, Anna walked into her lab and locked the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouring over her lab equipment, Anna work tirelessly on a new batch of the formula. According to her calculations the duration of the drug would be greatly increased, along with a possible increase in the effect of the drug. She was especially excited to feel the change. Watching those low-life test subjects rolling in ecstasy before transforming into true human beings... Anna shuddered. She took delight in the extermination of each of these subjects, a sickly jealousy guiding her emotions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine was half done packing the gel capsules with Anna's wonder drug, when one of her subordinates knocked on the door. Anna glanced over and saw Marina, her lead researcher. Anna could not be bothered to think of a story to make her go away. Instead she focused her attention on deleting any of the relevant information on the computer, while falsifying other information as to completely undermine her project. She couldn't chance anyone coming after her. And she knew they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes ticked by, before an alarm sounded in a far side of the base. Anna was used to the drill, all the lab equipment would power down in 2 minutes, and the complex would be on lock down. Looking back Anna saw that Marina was no longer trying to get in the door. 'All for the best' Anna thought to herself. She collected around a hundred pills from the packing machine, slipping them into ziplock pouch. She pulled one out, and with no ceremony, swallowed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna glanced through the window on the door. No one had caught on to her yet. Likely the alarm was miles away. A slow warmth started spreading through Anna's stomach. She started to moan as the fire spread down to her crotch, and then up into her breasts, and finally her brain. Anna collapsed on the floor as strange patterns and flashing lights overtook her vision. Her body started vibrating at an inhumanly fast rate, bouncing off the ground and knocking over some of her lab tables. She started moaning sensually and tightly grabbed her crotch and breast as an overwhelming orgasm overtook her body, causing her to temporarily blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna awoke to the mess in her lab. She had tattooed the floor with her kicking heels. A surge of excitement ran through Anna. She was strong enough to dent steel with her feet! She rose to her feet, and glanced in the mirror, almost afraid of the cold beauty that stared back at her. Gone were any wrinkles or creases on her face. Her body looked like it was carved from a fitness model's dreams. She felt like a lithe machine, and staring at herself was making her aroused. She raised her shirt, staring at the cobbled geometry of her abdominals, knowing that her body was now at super human levels. She lowered her hands to her ass, feeling the buttocks of steel that she had always wanted. Her firm smooth flesh was unyielding, and soon Anna was playing with herself again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother orgasm tore through Anna. She was very pleased with herself. But she also knew that she had to escape the complex in order to truly reap the benefits of her drug. Anna went over to the door, tearing it open despite the magnetic lock that was on them. It felt like opening a sliding door. Anna smiled to herself. There were no guards anywhere to be seen.</span></div></div>",

Her hearing was playing tricks on her too; she'd hear footsteps from half a mile away that sounded like they were right behind her. Not to mention she could swear she felt taller. Anna grit her teeth and cursed the test subjects who never explained this feverish state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna bowled into a metal wall, severely denting it. The distressed sound of the metal, and the curved form was somehow comforting to Anna. She plunged her hands into the wall and pulled out large chunks of metal and conduit. Giggling to herself she began to fondle herself with the metal, watching it eventually deform against her smooth nearly impenetrable skin. Frenzied with arousal she ripped off her panties, grabbed a thick piece of conduit and began to pleasure herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body felt like she was experiencing with completely different nerves. She reached orgasm in record time and collapsed against the wall. The doctor steadied herself and continued down the hall. As her feverish state seemed to break for a few moments, Anna realized that she was lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, trying to quell the unlimited energy that was just bursting from inside her. She calmed slightly and felt a sort of instinct take over. She started back down the tunnels.</span></div></div>",

She had finished her job... And something had gone wrong... The drugs were making it hard for her to recall. She closed her eyes and suddenly she was on an operating table. She barely registered the cold of the table before a new round of drugs took her into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda awoke part way through the surgery, surreally watching a group of masked doctors operating on her. Thank god they were professionals she thought before passing out again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came to she was in a hospital bed. She had no idea how she had gotten there, or even her name at first. Slowly elements of her memory came back, but her head was feeling extremely foggy. Part of her job as a covert ops agent involved a 'reset' period where certain elements of her personality or memory were altered. Amanda had signed some sort of agreement to allow the agency to delete specific memories related to national security, but by now she could hardly remember her 14th birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda looked down at her bruised and recuperating body. Amanda had the figure of a born athelete, slender and tall. Though she didn't feel it at the moment, Amanda was quite sexy. Her slender waist gave way to rounded hips, and her lean torso contrasted her large sloping breasts. Amanda looked down and felt her breasts. SomethIng in her chest felt out of place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda swung her legs over the bed preparing herself to stand. The blood rushed to her head and she had to lie back down. The dizziness conceded to a faint hum that soon became an articulated voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'hello Amanda, this is your new guidance system, installed 48hrs ago to regulate your physiotherapy and to introduce you to your new upgrades. When you are ready your next mission will be divulged through this same system. Don't bother talking back, this transmission is one way.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Great.' Amanda muttered to herself as she prepared to swing her legs over the bed again. </span></div></div>",
