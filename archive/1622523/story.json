I should give this to Cloud\"she though to herself as she picked it up,and walked back to Midgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes,she walks to Cloud's house upon a hill.She knocks on the door and the door opens,and in the house revealed Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Aerith\"Cloud greeted her with a smile\"what brings you here?\"Aerith stares down at the flower she picked out for Cloud with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just came by to give you this\"Aerith replied as she held out the red/white flower she picked from the forest.She then handed to Cloud with a smile.Cloud looked down at the flower.He raised it up to his nose and took a sniff of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow it....smells.....great.....\"Cloud stammered.All of a sudden,his visions to becomes blurry and he soon becomes melancholy.Aeris had a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloud are you ok?\"Aeris asked frightfully and with that,Cloud falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-30 minutes later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuuuuhhh what happened?Cloud asked to himself and he woke up from his slumber.He looked down below and saw that he was laying on a unfamiliar surface.It was pink and it looked like it had little slits of mounds in it.He then looked up and couldn't believe what he saw!He saw a gigantic Aeris!Her eyes were staring at him,the site was so unbelievable it made him jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHHHHH!! Wait,Aeris?What happened to me!?\"He asked his giant companion as he tried to stop his heart from having a heart attack.Aeris had a concerned look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know! You sniffed the flower I gave you and all of sudden you passed out.The before I knew it you shrunk!\"Aeris replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we have to fix this somehow!What should we do?\"Cloud responded.Aeris though for a moment and decided that....</span></div></div>",

Gently Aerith placed him on her right open palm and started walking back through Sector 7 to get back to her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConstantly her eyes darted to Cloud, filled with worry but surprisingly they were also filled with a ironic sort of humor. It just seemed funny to Aerith that Cloud; SOLDIER 1st class, master swordsman, and heroic bad boy was literally nothing but a small bug on her palm. Fate was funny like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud saw the irony too but he obviously found significantly less joy in it, he didn't like relying on anyone for anything. Sephiroth taught him that and now he was to trust everything about him to Aerith? It's not that he didn't trust her but he didn't like feeling weak. Cloud felt powerless, should a foe like The Turks show up Aerith was on her own, heck even a weakling grunt of a monster would prove too much for Cloud at his size. Fortune seemed to favour them though, for once no monsters seemed to be patrolling the slums and there was no sign of Shinra or The Turks either, Cloud and Aerith could rest easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's it like?\" Aerith asked, breaking the silence the two had ever since they started to walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently indifferent Cloud looked back at Aerith, \" What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being small.\" Aerith elaborated. \" Being as big or maybe small than my pinky. I mean, I must look huge! Like a god or some kind of gigantic monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most monsters aren't that cute.\" Cloud smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith's cheeks puffed as if she was slightly mad, \"Most? So you're saying there is a monster out there cuter than me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you were an ego maniac nor the jealous type.\" The shrunken hero replied with a deviant grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep talking and I might make you walk yourself to my house, or just hand you to Yuffie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't do that to me would you?\" Cloud sounded confident but slight sweat building up showed Aerith's words had a deep effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her little friend the Ancient stuck her tongue out teasingly. \" I guess that depends on how much of a gentleman you'll be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud turned away from Aerith, \" Chivalry is dead, besides I doubt my jacket would cover a puddle for you. Not that I even have a jacket to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith eyed her brown boots, \" True...I guess I could settle for you cleaning the dirt and water off of them when we get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to Aerith Cloud flashed a witty smirk, \" You're nowhere near as innocent as you act. But that's why I like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're nowhere near as tough as you act but that's why I like you.\" Aerith retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment the two laughed; just in time too as Aerith's home came into view. In complete contrast to Midgar's gloomy slum-like society Aerith's house was bright, shined by light, surrounded by hundreds of flowers she planted. It might as well have been in an entirely different world apart from Midgar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the front was Aerith's mother, sweeping the porch clean with a broom. She gave a small wave to Aerith but didn't show any true attention to anything other than sweeping. Aerith waved back with her free hand, grateful that her mother was too busy to notice Cloud in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith opened the door and just like that Cloud felt like he was at peace; it was the kind of effect Aerith's home had on people, like it was a sanctuary. Aerith however, was more preoccupied with running up to fix Cloud so she stormed up the steps towards her room. Upon entering she shut her door softly and locked it as a precaution. Then, very gently she placed Cloud on her dresser counter as she sat herself down on the bed beside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your idea for fixing me?\" Cloud asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith appeared lost in thought and took a moment to look back at Cloud...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remember I'm SOLDIER 1st Class, you'll have to do pretty good to get to me.\" After a moment Cloud added, \"You need to practically be a demon, you're a marshmellow.\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore replying Aerith playfully flicked Cloud with a calm smile on her face, causing him to land on his back. \"Maybe but at your size a marshmellow can take you out.\" She looked down at her boot clad feet before looking up with a playful smirk, \"Or I could give that job to my toes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see....fairly athletic girl...boots...slums...yeah I don't think I would enjoy that too much.\" Cloud did not now, nor anytime soon want to experience Aerith's feet, at least not while shrunken anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith continued to smile and shrugged, \"But I would, in fact you could go for a foot massage and everything and I would just <i> love </i> it.\" She laughed before continuing, \"But I wouldn't make you do that, I'm too nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget big headed!\" Cloud added mischievously, he was replied with another flick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway....like I said you outta pay a little for those comments....\" Aerith's face was one of genuine kindness and not a hint of evil hidden remotely in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spiky haired hero rose with a sigh, slightly dizzy from repeated flicks, \"Well what did you have in mind dear? Or would you prefer some sort of more...powerful title like Goddess or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clear as day that Cloud was making fun of her but Aerith didn't care, nope the flower girl didn't care one bit. \"Maybe later, if you keep misbehaving. But again, time to pay.\" She gripped her slender fingers along the dresser Cloud was on, \"Climb my arm up here so I whisper what I have in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea what you have in mind, this is to stall for time.\" Cloud muttered with a smirk as he hopped on and began walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith giggled, \"Shut up...\" But Cloud was right, and as he climbed up Aerith thought about what to do. Her notion of a foot massage earlier was a joke...but it <i> did </i> seem like a nice idea now....of course Aerith still had yet to tend to the church flowers...that would definitely be a nice job for Cloud. The possibilities were nigh endless in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Cloud arrived at the base of Aerith's chin, slightly bothered that even that close he had to look up to even gaze at Aerith's lips. \"Alright, what's my job Boss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith's breath coerced him as she replied, \"I decided.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That you can help me tend to the flowers in the church.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose are the words that Cloud heard. Crossing his arms Cloud says \"A little work never hurts.\" Aerith smiled and says \"Well at your size it might not be as simple as you might think.\" Silently nodding Cloud indicates that he's ready. Without a second to waste Aerith wraps her hands around Cloud's small body and inserts it in what seems to be a bag of some sort. Aerith closes the bag and begins to move. As she moves Cloud can feel himself swinging back and forth while inside the bag. \"<i>How long is this supposed to last?</i>\" thinks Cloud to himself as he's taken around what he imagines is the slums of Midgar. After a few minutes the bag opens up and Cloud sees Aerith's all too familiar hand looking for him. Quickly it finds and grasps him. Once out Cloud is able to see the yellow flowers that were there when he first met the flower girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith steps forward and once close enough to the group of flowers she places Cloud's small form on the ground. In addition to that she also hands him what appears to be a small knife of some sort. As the item is placed into his hands Cloud asks \"What's this?\" Aerith says with a smile \"Your job is to take care of the weeds growing in the group of flowers. Simple hm?\" Swinging the small knife like a blade and getting a good feeling Cloud says \"Sounds good to me. But what will you be doing?\" Aeirth punches a fist into her open palm and says with confidence \"As you do your job, I'll be watering the plants.\" <i> Wouldn't that make all the dirt into mud? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</i>  \"Wouldn't that make my job harder?\" asks a negative Cloud. Aerith not losing any of her spirit says \"It won't be hard if you finish quickly. Plus there aren't many weeds in here. That said, let's get to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking ahead and then back Cloud sees Aerith preparing the watering can and all her tools. Realizing it would be for the best to get ahead of her before she makes the dirt muddy Cloud rushes into the \"forest\" of flowers. Not long after entering the patch of flowers Cloud encounters the first weed. A rather brownish plant that seems like a pine tree of some sort. Not wasting time the miniature blonde approaches it and gets into a fighting position. He quickly attacks the plant and manages to make a good cut, but not enough to get rid of it. Thinking for a moment Cloud says \"If I just cut it, it would just grow back. I need to pull it out completely.\" Getting an idea Cloud begins to concentrate and stares with determination at the undesirable plant. He rushes towards it and stabs his weapon into it at the base. Moving his arms upward Cloud is able to perform his famous Climhazzard Limit Break to pull the weed all the way down to its roots. While in the air he's able to get a temporary view of the rest of the area. He spots two more weeds for him to take care of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he lands, Cloud hears a most pleasant sound. The sound of humming and soon that sound is accompanied by moisture as water begins to fall on the area where Cloud is. Seeing his earlier jump Aerith comes down and says as she grabs the already pulled weed \"I'll take care of this. Not bad so far little guy.\" Aerith then continues her work on watering the plants. Feeling like the ground is a little slippery Cloud says \"If I don't hurry, it will be harder to do all this. Setting out in the direction of the second weed, Cloud is able to get rid of it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally reaches the third weed he can hear loud footsteps approaching. No doubt it's Aerith who is coming to water the plants in the area near the weed. If she succeeds it may as well be impossible for Cloud to finish his task. Digging his tool into the base of the final weed Cloud begins with great effort to try and dispatch the final undesirable plant. The footsteps are getting louder and Cloud is beginning to worry slightly. He's admittedly a bit tired since he's no longer \"fresh as a daisy\" after pulling two massive weeds out. But he will not give up. Suddenly the footsteps stop and he can see a wall of pink and red, no doubt it's Aerith's dress. She's arrived. Concentrating like he's never done so before Cloud forces the knife upwards and manages to throw the weed into the air as well as himself. A sigh of relief came out of Cloud's mouth as he saw the end of his task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he felt himself land on something soft, but it was not the ground...it was Aerith's hand! Looking up he saw Aerith's smiling face who says \"Good job. Just in the nick of time I'd say.\" Her other hand has the final weed that Cloud just pulled out. Aerith quickly dispatches it and waters the plants in the area. Continuing to smile Aeirth says to Cloud who looks a bit dirty after his job \"I may not be able to pay you, but I'd say a bath should clear up all the dirt, wouldn't you say?\" Cloud nods and says \"You're also sweaty. Just because you're not visibly dirty like me, doesn't mean that you don't need a bath.\" Giggling a bit Aerith says \"Guess we're even.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will happen now?</span></div></div>",

These flowers, even in a city like this, grow beautifully, in the midst of a slum no less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud's eyes were distant when he eyed them, \"Yeah...it's proof that no matter what anything is possible. That no matter what happens being stubborn enough will allow you to persevere....\" Cloud playfully eyed Aerith, \"Maybe they learned from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith made a face at him, \"Oh behave. Or I might just drop you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The flowers cushioned my fall before didn't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith giggled, \"They had something to cushion then, like this I doubt you'd get such a soft landing. In fact, you would probably go right between any flowers that could save you. But you did a good job taking care of the flowers, I won't do anything to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make it sound like the possibility of you doing something like that is pretty high.\" Cloud laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith's eyebrows raised in amusement, \"If you keep yapping that mouth the odds just keep going up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't harm a fly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Cloud, I've helped you fight monsters remember?\" Aerith was no sitting on the edge of the garden, Cloud in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you always played healer!\" Cloud grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww how cute.\" A mocking voice called from the back. Aerith looked over her shoulder and in the opening Cloud saw who it was too, and they both paled. Elena, Elena of the Turks was at the door of the Church, no doubt ready for some form of resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAerith rose back up and eyed Elena threatingly, albeit failing, Cloud did a much better job. \"What do <i> you </i> want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smirked, \"No hello? Not even going to get angry at me for ruining your little moment?\" Every word she said was clearly mocking the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud took a few steps forward in Aerith's hand and pointed the small knife at Elena, \"Not at all, but you ignored my question. What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intruder's gloved hands went up in a peaceful gesture, \"Relax shorty, unless you think you can take me with that butter knife of yours.\" Cloud gritted his teeth and calmed, Elena was right of course; at his size there was no way he could take on a Turk. \"By the way...I see you've gotten...smaller. Was it flowers by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShock appeared on both Aerith and Cloud's face, Aerith saying \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena shrugged, \"Hojo's experiment, he was apparently doing something with Mako and the genetics of plants....I think Jenova cells were involved too. He said it was pure research but if you ask me the nut was trying to make plant monsters. Anyway that's not important right now, I'm here on orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Cloud felt a renewed hatred for Hojo stirring, but he didn't act on it; before he returned to Midgar with the gang Vincent told him all sorts of stories, and his experiences in SOLDIER didn't help his impression either. But Cloud put aside his vendetta and continued staring down Elena, \"And those orders are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Turk spoke with the clear sound of quoting someone, \"Find the Ancient and bring her to me, any resistance can be dealt with as you see fit.\" She smirked, \"Tseng's orders, now girl...come with me or I take you by force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you will!!\" Cloud roared, pointing his blade at Elena with renewed vigor, she just saw his bravado and laughed. \"Get real! You aren't even a match for my work boots, let alone worth me even drawing a weapon. And girly there isn't one that good at fighting on her own. So there isn't really any choice in the matter is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Cloud and Aerith gritted their teeth, but Aerith spoke up first. \"If I go willingly would you leave Cloud alone and just bring him to someone like Tifa or maybe Vincent? Someone who can take good care of him?\" Cloud looked dismayed and prepared to respond, but Aerith quickly jammed her thumb into his mouth to silence any protests. Her eyes looked at him with sadness, and a hope he would cooperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more Elena chuckled, \"I hold all the chips and you're bargaining? I like the guts girl...alright. I'll honor you're request, on my word as a Turk I swear to do what you ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you....\" Aerith softly muttered as she rose to her feet, and walked to Elena. She kept Cloud's mouth covered, and it would remain covered as long as possible until she absolutely had to let go. If she heard his protests Aerith might lose her will. Elena opened the door of the church for them and led the way through the slums, towards a helicopter. The group boarded and instantly the machine took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one spoke while on the chopper, Aerith just looked sad, Elena stared intently at her, and Cloud was still unable to speak despite his attempts at prying Aerith's finger from his jaw. It took about twenty minutes before the helicopter landed and whirred to a halt. Once again Elena led the way by jumping from the chopper. They didn't even take five steps within the building before a Shinra guard came, \"Sir! I am here to escort the Ancient to Mr. Tseng Sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena groaned but she gestured for Aerith to go with the soldier, as she passed by Aerith slid Cloud into Elena's gloved hand. In that one second Cloud was gonna scream protesting but Elena somehow knew that she was to shut him up now too, which she did. Cloud was forced to watch sadly as Aerith nodded solemnly at him and turned to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Elena began, \"Does Tseng have anymore orders for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard replied quickly, \"No, but he did have a message. Ahem...\"If you succeed in getting Aerith feel free to take the next few days off, having to get past her friends has more than earned you a break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena chuckled, \"He's forcing me to take a break? How funny.\" With nothing left to do the guard turned and led Aerith away, she gave one last concerned look at Cloud as she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Aerith was out of sight Elena removed her gloved finger from Cloud, \"Okay now then, I swore I'd keep my word so I'm gonna do it.\" Elena turned the opposite direction Aerith went and proceeded down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a moment before Cloud responded, his voice was distant and sad. \"Will Aerith be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tseng will make sure of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud seemed slightly reassured, \"Okay then, where are you going to take me then? Because there's a few of my friends I don't think would really be good for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud nodded, \"Yeah. Barret would likely let Marlene play with me, and I have no wish to be a little girl's plaything. Cid would probably make me do something involving machines. And most of all keep me away from Yuffie. I don't have a single doubt she would turn me into a toy for her on the spot. In a lot of ways she's the worst person to take me to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....\" Elena sounded like she was thinking but she quickly changed the subject, \"Why didn't you fight?\" Cloud appeared surprised by the question. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena peered at him, \"I know your skills. If you really wanted to do it you could've freed yourself from me or the girl ages ago. So why didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....didn't have any real options after that. It's like you said I wouldn't be able to best you like this. It's why I'm going to look for a cure as soon as possible. I hate feeling weak like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena laughed, \"You're sharing state secrets with the enemy you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chill seemed to form in the air. <i> Man take away his girl and he gets real emo! Maybe I should do something.... </i> \"Relax, you'll be in the hands of someone who will take <i> real </i> good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena eyed him with the eyes of a hawk, with a smile as demented as it was evil. </span></div></div>",

The next thing Cloud sees is is Elena's gloved finger in a special position. Realizing she aims to flick him in the head Cloud tries to get out of her grasp, but is unable to as he feels a massive force hit him in the head. Instantly he feels his eyelids becoming notably difficult to keep open and without fail the tiny blond has been rendered unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginning to come to, Cloud slowly opens his eyes and feels a great warmth all around him. The first thing he spots is the hot bright sun. Not wanting to end up blind, Cloud looks away as he sits up. Right in front of him he sees a massive beach with plenty of people. He can't help but take notice of the hot sand as he's sitting on it. His clothes being dark enhance the already infernal heat of the vacation spot setting as he can feel his whole body beginning to sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awake already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud looks to his side and sees the form of a large Elena sitting on a beach bed. Next to her is a small wooden table with a refreshing lemonade beverage. Elena is wearing a two piece bikini and dark sun glasses. Grabbing her drink Elena says after taking a sip \"How do you like the environment?\" Cloud more concerned for Aerith's sake says \"Like I care for this place.\" Putting her drink on the table, Elena lowers her glasses a bit and says \"Don't think you can do what you like.\" Putting her sunglasses back on, Elena continues to focus on the sun to allow herself the opportunity to get a good tan. Seeing how inattentive she's being Cloud decides to try and escape her to try and reach Aerith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that if I was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud stops in his tracks and looks in Elena's direction who continues to say \"If someone else finds you, you might become lost forever. Besides I'm your closest tie to getting back with that flower girl.\" At hearing those words, Cloud sighs in frustration and begins to head back towards his captor. \"That's right, you should be a good pet and come back to your owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he returns, Cloud asks \"What do you want?\" Elena ponders for a moment and says...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After thinking for a moment Elena leaned back on the beach bed, stretching her well toned legs towards the ocean. \"Why don't you put some suntan oil on me? I'm just starting to get comfy and plus you can probably do a better job than most people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud eyed the bottle of suntan oil beside Elena and shook his head, \"What do I look like your maid? Do it your damn self.\" Cloud may have been...well puny but he still had pride, and rubbing suntan lotion over a Turk of all people was not high on his list. He just turned around, \"I think if this is the kind of thing you'll be asking me to do I'll just take my chances with the strangers. Later.\" He started to walk away but stopped when the disturbing sound of Elena's laughter reached his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still hadn't even turned her head to him but Elena spoke with a firm mocking tone, \" You really are kind of dense aren't you? First off, even if you tried to leave I could just pin you with my foot. I mean, what could you do fight it? And you have to remember just how far you are from Midgar too, it isn't cheap getting there and I doubt some stranger would just lend you the money out of the kindness of their heart.\" She paused for a moment, respeaking with a rather menacing tone. \"And of course...this all means you are at <i> my </i> mercy. I'm your only connection to the Ancient Girl and unless I'm pleased with how you treat me you can just kiss even seeing her again goodbye. Now...will you still leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud bit his tongue, slowly turning around and returning. \"Good pet.\" Elena commented with a smile. Cloud ignored it and walked to the suntan oil bottle, it dwarfing him by at least ten times his size. Cloud had to be no bigger than one of Elena's toes and she expected him to do this task? The humiliation alone was impossible to bear, but with Aerith in his mind Cloud did it. He sighed, \"How...should I do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena clicked her tongue and pointed a finger at the edge of her beach bed, looking there Cloud saw, just by him, a sort of hill made from the sand of Costa Del Sol; reaching just high enough that someone Cloud's size could walk up to the beach bed safely and arrive at Elena's feet. All Cloud had to do was get the suntan oil on his hands, walk up the hill, and apply where needed...but how would Cloud get the oil? Elena seemed to read his mind and acted accordingly, with a flick of her pointer finger the bottle fell to it's side. \"Get started before I throw you into the ocean.\" She muttered impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuttering something under his breath Cloud dragged his feet to the bottle. Lucky for him it seemed Elena opened the bottle prior to him awakening and with it on its side the hole made a perfect opening for Cloud to get in. Of course some oil got on the beach but the hero had a sneaking suspicion if he used that oil Elena would punish him for it, so he crawled into the bottle to be safe. Inside it was...a new experience to say the least; the smell of all that suntan oil at Cloud's size was absolutely unreal, it was scented with what seemed to be a strawberry scent and the odor was strong enough to even make Cloud a tad light headed. But with Aerith still in his mind he managed to focus on his task, and as much as he despised it he rolled around in the oily liquid until his entire body was covering in a thick layer of it. He exited the bottle with the brown goo covering his entire body and proceeded up the sand hill, once there he was face first with Elena's soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud sighed as he began; he threw himself against Elena's sole and rubbed his entire body against it in an attempt to get the oil as well spread as possible. It worked oddly enough, but....it made Cloud look like he was humping or caressing Elena's foot...something he did NOT want to do no matter the situation. But he took it like a proud SOLDIER and went back down to repeat the process. Memories of Aerith were all that Cloud focused on as he carried out his task; his body was working, his mind was reminiscing. Because of this time seemed to fly, and Cloud barely gave notice to anything. Before he knew it he was at Elena's calves, rubbing himself against the well toned muscle which oddly had no hairs at all even at Cloud's size. Next were thighs...the hips...the enormous butt....flat stomach...breasts....and finally Elena's admittedly beautiful face. During all this Elena said nothing, and did nothing aside from turn over for Cloud to get the other side; but she was practically enimating the aura of absolutely adoring the power over Cloud. And finally, when Cloud finished rubbing his body and spreading the oil along Elena's forehead the girl's fingers lifted him into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was absolutely exhausted no question about it. Having to make all the trips and apply the suntan oil.....it was probably the most physically grueling task Cloud had ever done, and that wasn't even bringing in the humiliation and emotional aspects of it. But ever being a tough guy Cloud didn't show any signs of being scared, he didn't want to give Elena any leverage at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still didn't raise her head to address the young man but regardless Elena spoke, \"You did a very <i> very </i> thorough job SOLDIER-boy. You even got my breasts and butt...you're lucky I didn't just smack you for being a pervert; especially for the way you were spreading the oil...were you getting freaky with my whole body?\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud averted his gaze, \"Shut up, your body holds no attraction for me.\" But his face was bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your face tells a different story my pet. But anyway you did an alright job, but next time work on spreading it evenly...about half of it is uneven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud eyed her with a bored expression, \"And you're rather calm about it...knowing you I would've figured you'd just tossed me into a work boot or something and forget I existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena made an obviously face dramatic expression, \"Why I would never....yet. But that is a good idea. You did what I asked, no complaints after that little outburst. I know you have to be tired after that little ordeal, so I'll be a little kind for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill appearing apathetic Cloud eyed the still very bright morning sky, \"What're we going to do now? Leave for the hotel you're staying at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena chuckled, \"Nope, I need to work on my tan. And as for you.....</span></div></div>",

There will be plenty of time for you to please me.\" Sitting down on the hot sand Cloud can't help but feel frustration. Biting his lower lip at the thought of Aerith in Shinra's hands only enhances his anger. But he can't honestly do much as Elena's made it quite clear. \"If only there was a way...\" says Cloud sounding rather bleak as the hot sun bears down on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in Costa del Sol near the inn two children have managed to appear. The boy has black hair wearing blue shorts and a white shirt. While the girl has brown hair, a white hat, a white shirt with a one piece red bathing suit. In addition to that the girl has a refreshingly cool sweet chocolate ice cream cone on her right hand to help fight off the heat. Giving it a lick the girl asks \"So what was it that you found on the boat?\" The boy opens his palm and says sounding rather excited \"This!\" In front of the girl is a yellow sphere and she asks \"Is it a jaw breaker?\" The boy defensively says \"No you idiot! It's materia!\" Getting mad the girl sticks her tongue out and replies \"I'm telling on you for calling me stupid!!\" Gasping the boy says \"Oh no you don't!\" Within moments the boy passes his hand across the girl's face and a bluish aura appears on the girl's face. The boy smiles arrogantly and says \"It's Manipulate materia dummy. And if you're gonna try to get me in trouble then I'm gonna get you in trouble first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the beach the boy spots the blonde Turk sun bathing on the beach bed. Looking at the girl's ice cream the boy forms a wicked grin as he's got an idea. With the girl under his control he says \"You see that blonde lady over there?\" The girl shows a glazed look in the eyes as she listens to the boy and \"looks\" into the direction she's been ordered to. \"I order you to go over there and throw your ice cream at her. That's what you get for being a tattle tale.\" Silently the girl makes her way towards Elena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena on the other hand unknown of her incoming nuisance is enjoying the sea air and weather. Knowing she has a companion of sorts only sweetens the deal. Suddenly Elena feels her sun blocked as she notices someone is casting a shadow over her. Removing her glasses she spots the little girl holding a rapidly melting chocolate ice cream. Not liking this invasion of her privacy Elena demands \"Get out of here kid.\" Without a word from the girl, she continues to throw the ice cream towards the female assassin's stomach. Feeling the cool temperature on her bare flesh makes Elena's eyes widen as she yells sounding very much upset \"What are you DOING!?\" Elena's words rang so loudly that the girl comes out of her trance and notices what she's done. Gulping she starts running and behind her she hears Elena yell \"That's right, you better run you brat!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud who saw everything had to admit this was an interesting development. One of those karma or what goes around, comes around sort of thing. He chuckles softly to himself, but to ensure that Elena doesn't hear him he covers his own mouth with his dark gloved hand. Wiping the chocolate ice cream off her stomach with her bare hands Elena complains \"My boss gives me some days off and this happens.\" Tossing the ball of melting chocolate ice cream to the side Elena looks down at her dirty stomach. Realizing how bad it looks to be in public dirty Elena says \"I'm going for a swim, you better not go anywhere because if I return and you're not here, you'll be in big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena wastes no time in standing up and heading towards the water. Looking back Cloud spots the little kids not too far from where he is near the stairs that lead out of the beach. He sees the girl turn red with anger as the boy laughs holding the yellow materia in his open palm. The girl yells \"I'm telling mom about what you made me do with this stupid thing!\" Keeping with her anger the girl nabs the yellow sphere from the boy's hands and throws it directly to the ground. The materia broke into pieces. The boy looking shocked as well as on the verge of tears says \"Not if I tell her first that you broke what's mine!\" Both kids quickly leave the beach to tend to their own affairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she was under control?\" asks a curious Cloud. Feeling curiosity taking hold Cloud wanders towards the broken yellow shards of materia. Grabbing a piece Cloud gets a feel for its properties. \"This is...Manipulate materia.\" Feeling like he's just had a revelation Cloud says \"With this, I may be able to help Aerith.\" No doubt Manipulate Materia has its uses, but \"It works better when the target is weak.\" Beginning to get ideas on how to manipulate Elena to save Aerith Cloud can't help but form a small smile. He also considers the kinds of things he would need to do to ensure Elena is tired enough so she can't resist the Materia's effects. Pocketing the piece of materia, Cloud heads right back to the beach bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sits there under the boiling sun waiting Elena to return. The hot sand just keeps on getting even hotter and Cloud continues to sweat. Trying to comfort himself Cloud thinks \"<i>Elena's swimming right now. Swimming is quite a demanding activity. So she's already wasting energy, so I'm off to a good start.</i>\" Soon enough droplets of water begin to fall around Cloud. This is followed by a large shadow covering him. Looking up he sees Elena her body notably moist after her swim. \"Did you miss me little guy?\" Cloud kept his mouth clamped shut. Elena laid down on her beach bed and says \"You sure like to give the cold shoulder.\" Elena closes her eyes to relax and immediately opens them when she hears Cloud's voice as he asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something I can do for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena turns and looks down in the direction of Cloud's small form. Feeling curious she asks \"Didn't you ask me this question before?\" Trying his best to keep casual Cloud says \"You're on vacation and it seems to me like you're not being properly pleased.\" Scoffing after hearing his words Elena says \"And you think you can pamper me? Get real.\" Cloud not wanting to let his chance slip by says sounding confident \"If you'd give me a chance, I'll show you how far I'm willing to go!\" Keeping silent for a few moments makes the scene feel rather fragile. Elena wonders what's with the change in attitude. Admittedly it is appealing to see her man servant on with the program and what if he fails to satisfy? He'll just make a fool of himself in front of her which would be amusing. After her moment of silence, Elena says \"Oh alright, what do I have to lose? Let's see what you can offer me since you seem so eager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting off her beach bed, Elena begins to gather her things and heads back to her hotel with Cloud engulfed in her hand. When the hand opens Cloud is treated with a view of the room of the Inn that Elena is on. Truly an interesting looking place. Expensive looking to boot with how fine the dressers, the mirrors, the bathroom, the windows, beds, tables, etc look. No doubt, Shinra pays her well if she can afford such accommodations. Within moments Cloud's thoughts are interrupted as he hears Elena say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we start with...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Since you're so eager to please me I do believe a massage would be nice. That hot beach sand hurt my poor little feet...\" It was clear as day Elena was being sarcastic but Cloud didn't comment as she sat on her bed; not even attempting to dry first or change from her swimsuit. She had her back to the wall and her feet outstretched before she placed Cloud at the edge of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he expected something like this Cloud's pride still swelled, massaging a pair of feet probably a dozens times his size...not exactly a perfect day activity. \"Doesn't Costa Del So supply massages?\" He remembered his time here with his friends at one point, and they did do massages...admittedly good ones too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena sneered, \"Yeah, at 10,000 gil a body part! I'd much rather have a freebie done by my oh so obedient pet. I mean, with your new appreciation for me and my power you might even show my feet proper respect through something like...licking all that water off of them. Of course you don't if you don't want to. A massage is more than enough....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud saw through that ruse easily; basically what Elena meant was \"If you're a good pet lick while massaging. Go above and beyond.\" It was a test to see just how far Cloud was willing to go to please her, to see if Cloud really had become a meager pet so quickly. <i> Leave it to a Turk to be suspicious... </i> Cloud sighed. <i> Wait for me Aerith, I'll be on my way soon enough. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpatiently Elena eyed her pet, tapping her finger against her forearm. Instinct said Cloud was up to something, and a massage would be a good way to boost her strength and lower his...plus get a rush from humiliating him a tad. Weakly Cloud drug his feet towards Elena's towering own, placing a precautionary hand against one and feeling it sink in slightly. It was soft...yet there was a clear layer of muscle mass not even an inch deep, with sea water clinging to every possible orifice. Cloud hadn't even started yet and already he felt ashamed, and the feeling only increased when he placed his hands along Elena's sole and began rubbing the stress away. Making him even more self loathing Cloud leaned forward, and took one long enunciated lick that absored a decent amount of the salty liquid. The horrific taste of sea water mixed with god knows whatever Elena stepped in was enough to make Cloud want to die, but if SOLDIER taught him anything it was how to suffer abuse. He'd probably be embarassed for a month but he would do this, and do it well; there was no other way to make Elena lower her guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Cloud took a lick a shocked gasp escaped Elena's mouth, followed of course by a taunt. \"Well what do you know...my pet is a foot freak....I think I like you more already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> Shove it </i> Cloud thought bitterly, biting his tongue and continuing to massage. He was doing alright...but the foot was just so...big...Cloud had to punch it like a punching bag to make any progress; and having to lick up the sea water was an absolute pain as well. But like with his previous task Cloud went away to his mind, memories of Aerith...Tifa....hell every one of his friends. He did nothing but think of them as he carried out his task. His body was still doing the task very well, but Cloud barely registered any of it. The bitter taste of salt water was still rather bothersome though....really really disgusting, but the spiky haired hero stomached it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime passed, god knows how much, but the sun was in position for the afternoon by the time Cloud had finished both feet. He had just licked and massaged every crevice of Elena's admittedly cute feet. And even with all that sea water Cloud got a taste of old sweat and even sock lint...he wanted to vomit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point Elena was relatively dry anyway, not that the same could be said for the bed she laid on. \"Not bad SOLDIER-boy, I think that's the best my feet have felt in ages. This may be a regular thing, but may I ask one question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Cloud had to bite his tongue to stop the real response, but aloud he said \"Why of course Misses Elena!\" In a peppy voice that made Cloud just want to die inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena chuckled, \"Formalities...not bad...but I think I prefer Mistress...or maybe even Goddess....Anyway I wanted to ask you this; do you like my feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loaded question; if Cloud said no then Elena would likely torture him with her feet, if he said yes he was some foot nut...ugh he hated the woman. But the act came on again, \"Why of course Mistress!! You're just oh so beautiful!!\" He may have been laying it on a tad thick but Elena seemed please with the ass kissing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to smile softly at his answer, \"I see, in that case.....</span></div></div>",

However his expression soon changed to one of complete disappointment as he says loud enough for Elena to hear \"This isn't what I had in mind...\" After Cloud heard Elena say her rather provocative words, Cloud thought he was going to finally start his plan to get back on track and save Aerith. However the plan seems to be on hold as Elena's idea of a \"fun\" place ended up being grabbing Cloud laying him on her left butt cheek as she lays down with her head on the pillow of the bed. \"Don't complain so much. It should be an honor for you to serve my behind. Not many men get to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his new surroundings, Cloud notices that due to the nature of the two piece bikini her butt cheeks are quite exposed. Trying to keep his spirits up Cloud thinks \"<i>It's not a completely hopeless situation...</i>\" Getting on his knees Cloud digs his hand into the flesh of Elena's ass. The fruits of her labor are showing without a doubt. Elena is a Turk and Turks have to be in prime shape to accomplish their tasks. Elena must work out a lot thinks Cloud as he keeps on digging and pressing his hands against her buttocks for its hard to ignore how soft and yet firm it is. \"She does have a nice ass...\" says Cloud under his breath. Feeling like he's losing focus on his task Cloud shakes his head and continues to massage Elena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting an idea Cloud remembers what he did to recently with Elena's feet, he licked them. \"<i>What if I licked her butt cheeks? Maybe that could...</i>\" Having enough of thinking Cloud lowered his face and opened wide to stick out his tongue. The moment his tongue covered in saliva made contact with Elena's fleshy behind the first thing Cloud could taste was the salt from her recent swim in the beach. It wasn't so bad at all compared to the skin on her feet which had that and additional elements like sock lint and natural body sweat. Working with his own saliva after his first lick Cloud spreads the saliva to work as a filter of sorts to reduce the salty effect on the rest of Elena's butt cheek. As he continues to lick on Cloud stops as he hears Elena making an odd sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...ah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she gasps Cloud notices between each sound she utters her breathing pattern is changing. Beginning to form a very simple smile Cloud says sounding glad that his plan seems to be working. Elena's voice is heard as she says \"Don't forget my other butt cheek. That felt wonderful.\" Hearing the short haired blonde Cloud jumps towards her right butt cheek. He begins his massage mixed with licking combo and begins to moisten the flesh of Elena's right butt cheek all the same as he did to her left. Enjoying the pleasure she's receiving Elena thinks \"<i>This was a good decision. Having my own personal pleasure servant.</i>\" Letting the uplifting feeling take hold Elena lets out a sigh of relief. However, soon enough the sweet feeling stops. Opening her eyes and turning her head slightly Elena  asks sounding a hint frustrated \"Why did you stop?\" Cloud says with confidence \"There is so much more I can do for you.\" Rousing her curiosity Elena asks \"Really? What do you have in mind?\" Keeping up with his act Cloud says casually with a smile \"Why don't you turn over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding this proposition promising Elena's hand grabs Cloud. She rotates her body and her head is now facing the ceiling as it rests on the pillow. Cloud is placed on Elena's stomach and soon enough Elena says \"I kept my word. You can start with what you had in mind.\" Getting on his knees Cloud starts to lick Elena's stomach. Feeling the pleasant feeling Elena closes her eyes as she lets Cloud continue his task. Noticing that Elena has closed her eyes, Cloud begins to move on with his plan. Elena's skin continues to get moist the more saliva that Cloud spreads with his tongue. However, Cloud doesn't remain on Elena's stomach at all. He's moving piece by piece as he licks, traveling all the way to her chest. Once he's reached Elena's bikini top Cloud wastes no time as he lifts the material and reaches Elena's massive right breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling what he's done Elena thinks \"<i>That degenerate--</i>\" \"Ahh...!\" Her thoughts are interrupted as she gasps in pleasure. Inside the bikini top, Cloud's lips are locked with Elena's nipple. He grips it and continues to lick it hoping for the most favorable results. Though Cloud is doing this for Aerith's sake it's hard to deny that this isn't turning him on as feels his own member beginning to rise. But rather than focusing on that he continues working on Elena's nipple which has gotten erect just as his own sex organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!...mmm...! Ahh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Elena doesn't know what to do. In the past she's had feelings for Tsung, her boss, but what she's feeling right now is overwhelming. Would it be okay to keep going with this? Would it count if she lost her virginity to someone she considers her pet? \"Ah!\" she moans again as she feels her cheeks grow red with a blush. Making up her mind, Elena realizes that she's still a woman and she does have her needs. Evidently they can't go ignored especially right now considering her current state with her accelerated breathing, the recent warmness that's coming from her nether regions, and even the moisture she feels down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up and undoing her bikini top Elena looks down and sees it fall on the bed along with Cloud. Getting out from under the bikini top, Cloud looks up and sees Elena's face. Going by the way she's breathing and turning red he's gotten the result he wanted. Her bare chest heaves up and down and within moments Elena grabs Cloud and brings him to her face. Taking a moment she says trying to sound as if she's still in control \"You're a little daring aren't you?\" Spotting Cloud's own hard on Elena smiles and says \"You're in luck, I am going to give you a very rare opportunity.\" Cloud looks on with great interest. Within a few moments Elena opens her mouth and says....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At hearing those words Cloud felt relief, he's gotten the chance he wanted and needed for his plan to have a better chance of success. \"But I don't want any sand in my pussy, so you can start by taking off your clothes.\" Opening his eyes in shock Cloud forgot about this detail. Judging by the look on his face Elena grins and asks \"Did you really believe that you're going to enter my pussy with those sandy clothes of yours? Tch, even if you weren't dirty with sand I'd still demand that you remove your clothes. After all, that's the way that sex works right?\" Elena does have a point. However, doing this kind of action, wouldn't that betray the purpose of his mission to save Aerith? It would be fraternizing with the enemy. \"Can't I just take off my gloves and stick my arms inside you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling impatient Elena's free hand comes and with little effort starts tearing apart Cloud's clothes. As she rips his shirt and pants Elena says \"You got me hot and bothered and now you're going to do something about it!\" As she continues her actions, Cloud's main concern is Elena finding the piece of Manipulate materia that he kept in his pocket. Lucky for Cloud once the last of his attire is ruined and forcefully removed which were his shoes, he notices that Elena drops the damaged pieces of his clothes on the bed. Laying completely naked on her open palm Elena's brown eyes gleam as she says \"Now let's started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena uses her free hand and removes her bikini bottom. Griping Cloud with her fingers, Elena says once she's completely naked \"Here we go!\" The world seemed like it was going fast forward for Cloud as he saw Elena's massive pink pussy. As it neared Cloud noticed that she shaves her pubic hairs, so the skin around her hole is no doubt smooth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud was quickly thrust head first into Elena's powerful vagina.  Inside her he could hear her heart beating with excitement.  What little air there was in there quickly lost its freshness. Not wanting to forget his task at all, Cloud began to squirm with all his might. Waving his arms and legs in any and all directions as they clashed against Elena's vaginal walls. However, that only encouraged Elena as she began to moan rather loudly enough for Cloud to hear. Inside the pink world Cloud could start to feel the firm pink walls pressing him all over. He felt her fingers grab his tiny feet as she eased him out of her vagina giving him a chance to breathe a bit...and then quickly back in. Elena repeated this over and over for what seemed to be the next few minutes. Cloud continued to hear Elena's loud screams of pleasure and feel the crushing pressure of her pussy become greater as she neared what he hopes is her climax.  Suddenly Cloud felt Elena's fingers disappear. Cloud wonders \"<i>She's left me inside her!?\"</i>. His thoughts are interrupted as the hold her vaginal walls have on him increase around his small form. Squeezing the air out of him Cloud thought he was going to be crushed to death inside of her as her walls closed in on him like a vise. What little space there was was quickly decreasing due to a most desired development. Cloud felt a rush of a foreign fluid. Without a doubt the flood of her thick juices indicates that she's came. This was followed by Elena opening her mouth and screaming:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAHHHH!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying down on the bed and her body working up a sweat Elena begins to unwind. Beginning to stabilize her breathing, but still feeling quite worn down Elena thinks as she gasps for air \"<i>That felt...so good. I'm really...enjoying this. Maybe this is...why the flower girl...had an eye for this guy</i>.\" Just as Cloud was on the verge of passing out from lack of air and exhaustion, he felt Elena's all too familiar fingers close on him and pull him out of her pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the cool air against his naked flesh was a bit bothersome but Cloud managed to endure it as he sat on Elena's open palm. Covered in Elena's love juices Cloud manages to say feeling quite battered \"I hope..you enjoyed that.\" Eying her body and noticing the sweat Elena's produced and how her breathing pattern has changed, Cloud feels like he's accomplished what he wanted and that was for Elena to waste energy and feel worn down. Elena smiles what seems to be a sincere smile as she says \"Oh I enjoyed that a lot. Who knows we might need to do this more often.\" Feeling his body tense up Cloud doesn't want to go back inside Elena's sex organ, it would probably finish him off if he goes inside another time. Trying to get his owner to change the subject Cloud asks \"Shouldn't we celebrate?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about the proposition, Elena asks \"Celebrate? What do you mean? I was planning to go to sleep. If you haven't noticed its nightfall.\" Cloud struggles to stand up and suggests \"How about a little sake to complete the evening?\" Thinking for a moment Elena shoots a grin and says \"Okay then you've earned it.\" The next phase of his plan is going well. By getting her drunk Cloud has a better chance for the materia to work. It's a good thing Elena is easy to please, otherwise the situation would be hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking a call to room service Elena orders a large bottle of sake. She gives a small cup to Cloud made of carton. Not wanting to get intoxicated Cloud says \"Turks are tough, right?\" Elena takes a sip of her alcoholic beverage and says \"You got that right pipsqueak.\" Cloud continues by saying \"But I've never seen a woman drink a lot. Some women can be uptight.\" Feeling challenged, Elena says sounding confident of herself \"Ha! I'm off duty. You're about to see how I put men to shame!\" She proceeds to gulp down her cup in one go. Quickly serving herself another round Cloud cheers motivating her \"Show me what you've got! I know you can do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tired Elena lies on the bed of the hotel room. Wearing a white hotel robe, Elena quickly dozes off into slumber land. Getting Elena to drink up an entire sake bottle without any food enhances the effects of the alcoholic drink. Only a fool would drink to get drunk like how Elena displayed. She might be a Turk, but she's still green in different areas. \"<i>Without a doubt her brain is no longer on the best of conditions</i>\" Cloud thinks as he sits on her bed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Elena is tired from swimming, tired from her sexual release, drunk, and even sleepy. \"It's the perfect time to strike.\" says Cloud. Not wanting to let the blonde giantess rest up and regain her energy Cloud rushes to the shredded remains of his shrunken clothes on the bed. Unusable at this point Cloud admits, but still they did a good job in hiding the piece of materia that he needs. Pulling out the piece Cloud heads towards Elena's massive face as it's pressed on the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching her face Cloud gathers a deep breath and screams at the top of his lungs \"WAKE UP!!!!\" Groggily the giantess manages to wake up. After falling asleep a person who wakes up is doomed to feel the side effect of being a little drowsy the moment they open their eyes. Not wasting time, Cloud grips the Manipulate materia tightly and a blue aura shoots towards Elena's barely opened eyes. \"Did I get her?\" Cloud says under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough Elena shows a blank look in the eyes. Smiling, Cloud realizes that his efforts have been well worth it. \"Soon Aerith, soon...\" exclaims Cloud sounding more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen now?</span></div></div>",

Elena was nothing but his puppet right now, something a sadist would abuse but Cloud had other ideas. He focused his thoughts on the materia he grasped, making it echo one command. <i> Take me to Shinra Headquarters! </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was the moment of truth, whether or not the materia would take effect and make Elena obey such an outrageous order. A couple seconds passed and neither person so much as moved; in fact for a second Cloud thought he failed. But that changed when Elena's hand came before him. \"Climb on.\" Cloud began to, until when he noticed Elena was still wearing her scandily outfit. <i> Uh....go get your Turk suit first...then get me </i> Elena obeyed and returned moments later in her suit, gloved hand outstretched for Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud hopped on, minorly embarassed he was still naked but overflowing with happiness at his success. \"Alright Elena, next stop; Midgar, Shinra Tower! Take me to Aerith!\" Wordlessly Elena pulled out her cell phone. \"Get me a chopper to HQ stat.\" There was some talk on the other line but Elena cut it off, \"I know the time, I know Tseng's orders, just do it!\" She hung up the phone and walked outside, waiting. Cloud was left with no choice but to wait too, not that he didn't want to it was just...taking forever. Time seemed to drag on as he finally came close to rescuing Aerith, and he had nothing to turn to but his own thoughts. And Elena wasn't one for conversation right now; he looked at her with a soft smile. The woman was probably the Devil but Cloud had to admit, the time he spent with her wasn't <i> all </i> bad, the only reason he had slave labor was because he asked for it. She may have been a tad misguided but Elena was a good if not rough person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by deafening whirring, the helicopter had arrived. Elena wasted no time in jumping on, and instantly the machine took back off into the air. Now it was time for more waiting. God if time ever took so long....Cloud began wishing for some monsters or something; anything to make the time go by faster. But of course nothing happened, he could do nothing but wait for a couple hours and constantly pray Aerith was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at Elena, still under the effects of the materia. <i> Please stay in affect until we get there....</i> Cloud stared absent mindedly at the window, too high for him to see out of. He just had to wait.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully they arrived at the roof of Shinra Heaquarters after what felt like an eternity. The helicopter landed on the helipad and Elena leapt out with Cloud in hand. Cloud pointed to the nearby door, \"Alright now take me to Aerith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away Elena started walking towards the door, proceeding inside and walking further in. On the way.....</span></div></div>",

However this woman has longer hair than Elena and its rolled up in a way as if to defy gravity. In addition to that she wears red earrings and a purple esque dress. Recognizing her Cloud says \"That's Scarlet, head of the Weapons Development of Shinra. I better keep this short. Elena tell her that you're busy trying to report to Tsung and have no time for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am busy. I am trying to report to Tsung and have no time for you.\" says Elena rather coldly. Showing a hint of frustration Scarlet scowls. Admittedly in the past Scarlet didn't much care for Heidegger to the point she's openly insulted him. By default its no surprise that she doesn't much care for the Turks, an organization that works directly under Heidegger himself. However, this girl has shown a real lack of respect towards her. Glancing upwards she sees Elena already walking away showing Scarlet her back. No doubt this girl could use some manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Scarlet do?</span></div></div>",

As Elena keeps on walking down the stairs she makes it to the research section of Shinra. No doubt Hojo's department. Getting an idea \"I'm sure there might be a way to restore myself here. But first things first, Aerith must be saved.\" Cloud loudly says \"Elena take me to where Aerith is being held. Elena silently moves through the halls of Shinra HQ and eventually finds herself in front of the door of the detainment section. Knowing Elena's a Turk, Cloud commands \"Open the door.\" Elena without fail from one of her pockets draws out an ID card. She swipes it on the console and soon enough after some random sounds the door opens. Once it opens the first thing Cloud sees is Aerith sitting on the bed of the cell looking depressed and worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud yells standing on Elena's palm. Aerith turns and sees Cloud's small naked form with one hand covering his privates. Aerith looking away as she blushes asks \"C-Cloud!? What are you doing here? And why are you-\" \"It's a long story. One I don't want to get into the details of, but I'm here to save you.\" Looking at her tiny savior Aerith's eyes look like they're on the verge of tears. \"Cloud I really appreciate this.\" says Aerith. Looking at Elena Aerith asks \"But how did you get her to help you?\" Cloud says \"I'm using Manipulate materia, she's under my control.\" Looking up at Elena Cloud grips the materia piece and says \"Take me to the research development department!\" Not understanding his reasoning Aerith asks \"Why do you want to go there?\" \"Remember what Elena said before? Me shrinking had something to do with Hojo's experiments. Elena knows about how this happened in the first place and if we go to the research section of the building-\" Catching on Aerith says \"You can get your normal size back.\" Nodding Cloud says \"Right, so let's move!\" Looking at his giant puppet Cloud says \"If any guards see you with Aerith and question you, tell them you're taking her to Tsung.\" That said and done, all three of them headed for the research department of Shinra HQ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there Cloud asks \"Elena, how is there a cure for the shrinking problem?\" Elena blankly says \"Yes.\" \"What is the cure?\" Cloud follows up. Elena replies by saying \"Being placed inside the pod while another person presses buttons on the control console will lead restore any victims of the shrinking problem. \"Aerith catch! Being quick Aerith opens her palm and feels a small object land. Looking down she sees a yellow shard. She asks \"Is this the Manipulate materia?\" Cloud says \"Yeah, I want you to order Elena to place me inside the pod and then to control console to restore my size.\" Nodding Aerith gets the point and without worry does as she's told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud feels the pod rather spacious after it closes, but soon enough he knows that he'll be free from this massive nightmare. Back outside Elena is blankly pressing buttons on the console obeying Aerith's orders. Within moments gas fills the pod making Cloud cough. Suddenly the pod opens and he's greeted by something he very much desired, the world at his normal size again. Aerith smiles warmly to see that Cloud is back to normal. Still covering himself Cloud says as he nears Aerith and the still mind controlled Elena \"We've done good, but we're not out of the woods yet. We need to get out of here.\" Aerith trying not to look down even though Cloud covers his genitals says \"And you need some clothes. I doubt you can sneak out of here like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing Aerith has a point, Cloud says \"You're right. Okay I have a plan. We'll use Elena to bring us a grunt guard and I'll knock him out, then-\" \"Takes too much time\" cuts in Aerith. Aerith silently moves towards the door that leads to the stairs. She sticks her head and says loudly \"Yohoo!\" She quickly jumps to the side and crabs a metal pipe lying on the floor. Soon enough footsteps of a lone blue colored guard are heard. The moment he steps through and sees the naked Cloud in front of him he says trying to get his gun ready \"Hey what are you do-\" His words are stopped as Aerith has striked him on the back of the neck. A part of his body that remains exposed despite the head gear. After seeing Aerith's actions Cloud says \"...That works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting changed and taking the guard's gun Cloud has also taken back the Manipulate Materia shard from Aerith. He says to Aerith \"Here's the plan, we'll keep on pretending to take you back to Tsung. We'll use Elena as the 'commanding officer' to tell off the other flunkies just in case. Got it?\" Aerith smiles and nods. Cloud turns to Elena and gives her her orders. Without wasting time Elena leads the supposed captured Ancient and soldier. They descend on the panoramic elevator. As soon as they hit the lobby Elena continues to lead them outside of the Shinra building. Everything is going according to plan until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop what are you doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud and Aerith turn to see another blue Shinra guard.Elena turns and replies \"I am moving the Ancient to a new position. Tsung's orders. If you have a problem with that, I could connect you to him.\" Feeling intimidated the solder says \"Nevermind mam, do as you're told.\" and quickly heads back inside the building. Walking a little distance further from the Shinra building Cloud finally decides enough distance has been made. Taking off the metal helmet Cloud turns to Elena and says \"Now head back to Shinra HQ and if anyone asks you anything tell them you accomplished your mission at Tsung's request.\" Giggling a bit Aerith says \"He'll be so mad when he hears she let me go.\" Elena blankly turns and heads back on route towards Shinra HQ. Cloud and Aerith however disappear into the darkness of Midgar's slums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding himself back in Tifa's Seventh Heaven and wearing a new set of the same clothes he usually wears, Cloud takes a seat and makes himself comfortable. Tifa approaches him with a drink and asks \"Haven't seen you lately?\" Cloud takes the drink and says after taking a sip \"Been kind of busy. Right now I'm a little tired.\" Getting the point Tifa backs down and lets Cloud catch a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really saved me back there, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting his glass down he sees Aerith at the entrance of the bar. Aerith approaches and takes a seat. Cloud asks \"Are you okay? Did they hurt you?\" Aerith shakes her head and says \"No. They need me after all.\" \"Hmm...\" replies Cloud. Aerith takes a moment and asks \"Cloud?\" Putting his drink down Cloud asks \"Yeah?\" Aerith shows a grateful smile as she says \"Thank you.\" Giving a smile of his own Cloud says \"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scarlet was not going to let Elena's behavior go unpunished and given her disposition rushed towards Elena's sleep walking mind controlled body and grabbed her arm. Unfortunately for Cloud this was the arm that contained his tiny body and upon being grasped he felt the grip of Elena's fingers loosen. Within moments he found himself free from Elena's hand and free falling towards the carpet on the floor of the room. The landing was rough, but being a carpet meant it was soft enough for Cloud to not injure his body upon collision. Finding himself sitting naked on the carpet led Cloud to panicking a little as thoughts such as <i>\"This isn't good...!</i>\"entered his mind. For Scarlet on the other hand, she was experiencing quite an odd dealing with the Turk girl who showed her no respect. Grabbing her arm did not deter Elena's movement and soon enough had to let go lest she be dragged along with Elena. After unhanding her Scarlet could only watch the zombie like blonde young woman walk further away in silence. \"What was wrong with her?\" asked a confused Scarlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Cloud's view point on the carpet he got to see a better view of the monumental Scarlet. Her blonde rolled up hair, her ice cold blue eyes, her creamy overall complexion. He could see some cleavage even as her red wine colored dress allowed. Going by the design of her red dress she was a woman of good taste when it came to attire. Inadvertently    Scarlet extended a leg from the cut in the skirt which allowed Cloud to see more of her outfit. On her exposed leg Cloud managed to see that Scarlet wore dark stockings with white tips at the top where the thigh of the leg is. To complete the ensemble Scarlet wore dark red high heels that made the giantess look even taller. All this gazing however came at a price for the shrunken young man as soon the shadow of this woman befell his form and heard her exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing found out in his current state by someone like her would be nothing short of dangerous. Rising to his feet Cloud prepared to dash for his life. But this came to an immediate stop as he felt a hard leather sole press down on his bare back. Cloud's vision started to descend and within instants found himself head first into the carpet. The sole of Scarlet's high heel gave a light stomp to secure and weaken the object that caught Scarlet's attention. Cloud could only groan in pain as he felt his body crushed in one single movement by Scarlet's foot. The high heel that pressed down on his body removed itself and in its place Cloud felt himself grasped by Scarlet's fingers. Up and up he went until he was staring at the face of the head of Shinra's Weapons Development department. A cruel smile formed itself as Scarlet realized who she held in the palm of her hand. \"Well look what found? A slave to please me. Now aren't I telling it like it is, member of Avalanche?\" Cloud didn't want to dignify those words with a response. It was out of the frying pan and into the fire as he yet again found himself in hostile hands, literally. To bear this humiliation Cloud gritted his teeth in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet wasted no time, she wanted to give her slave a test run and as such raced to a private room in the Shinra HQ. In it there was a large bed, a mini bar, a bathroom, and all sorts of accessories. Nearing the bed Scarlet sat down on the edge of it. Lowering Cloud on the floor she kicked off her high heels and exposed her large black stocking covered feet. It was odd, but they didn't smell bad. Instead they had an unusual fragrance to them. \"<i>Perfume?\"</i> wondered Cloud for a moment. Feeling crushed at his predicament Cloud worked the nerve to look up and he saw Scarlet announce triumphantly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slave you will start your duty by massaging my tired feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud remained silent. His silence didn't go unnoticed making Scarlet follow up her orders by stating \"But I'm not without heart. A little freedom does make for a more willing and diligent worker. So how about this? You may choose whether or not I keep my stockings on or remove them for the massage. But remember, in the end these feet WILL get pampered.\" concluded Scarlet in a more forceful tone. Given these developments, Aerith's rescue will have to wait. Taking a deep breath, Cloud made his choice and his selection is...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cloud let out a humiliated sigh, mumbling, \u201cTake them off please.\u201d Scarlet leaned her ear forward with a smirk on her face, \u201cPlease take them off\u2026what?\u201d The young man raised his voice, \u201cPlease take them off Mistress Scarlet.\u201d His tone was unenthusiastic but it seemed to satisfy the woman trying to degrade him. \u201cMistress? Look at you accepting your new job!\u201d The woman laughed as her fingers began to slide off her stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so Scarlet continued to talk, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you ended up so small but I think you\u2019ll come to enjoy serving me little SOLDIER. I can be a very kind and generous owner, but you have to be willing to put in the work.\u201d One stocking was now off, Scarlet wiggled her toes and eagerly brought the foot before Cloud. \u201cPlease me and who knows? Maybe things will work out better than you could have imagined.\u201d The other stocking was now off too, leaving Scarlet\u2019s soles bare as they towered over Cloud. \u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly what I\u2019ll do with you so you might want to do a good job. Let\u2019s just say you have a lot riding on this.\u201d The malicious woman let out a sinister laugh as she awaited Cloud\u2019s hands along her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time Cloud barely listened, <i>She talks a lot.</i> He boredly looked up to the foot well over his height. It was menacing sure, after all a single step could very well end his life. But at the same time the spiky-haired man just eluded a Turk, a notorious fighter. This woman was someone who was all brain, no brawn. It would make tricking her harder, but if all else fails he had a decent chance at a fight if he could get a blade. Cloud planted a hand of Scarlet\u2019s left heel. Unlike Elena\u2019s foot this one had very little muscle beneath the skin. It was soft and stressed, the feet of a wealthy woman who wore nothing but heels. It was considerably easier to began to mead the folds of skin and massage than with Elena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud grimaced as his hands grazed over a thin layer of liquid he knew to be sweat. At least with his last captor the water came from the ocean, this was just disgusting. Not that he showed it, but Scarlet seemed to smile as if she felt his negativity all the same. However, Cloud\u2019s casual massaging was not satisfying her. \u201cI hope you can do better than this. You were in SOLDIER; I know you have it in you to go much, <i>much </i>faster. Keep this up and I can\u2019t guarantee my kindness will last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snobbish attitude directed at him made Cloud want to hit Scarlet in the face, but he couldn\u2019t risk upsetting her. Not when he was so close to rescuing Aerith. \u201cSorry Mistress.\u201d In an apology the young man leaned forward and gently planted a kiss along Scarlet\u2019s tender soles before increasing his pace exponentially. Looming above Scarlet laughed, \u201cI rather liked that, keep doing it.\u201d Another mental sigh came as Cloud started to combine kissing Scarlet\u2019s foot with his massaging. It was degrading and Cloud would never live this down, but in comparison to how things went with Elena he\u2019d manage. The only difficult part was knowing how close he was to his friend, but still so far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few minutes later Scarlet once again grew unsatisfied with how Cloud was doing. When she spoke it took large amounts of self-control to just not shout for her to shut up. \u201cYou\u2019re doing alright I suppose\u2026but I feel something is missing. I think it\u2019s because your hands are so small, use your whole body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud couldn\u2019t tell if Scarlet was trying to humiliate him or if she was honestly this spoiled about a foot massage. Either way he kept up his fa\u00e7ade of the meager little slave and began to rub his entire body along Scarlet\u2019s foot. The result was in instant moan from the woman who urged Cloud with her hand to keep on going. \u201cI think this is just the job for you little one! You can be my permanent foot slave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not if I can help it</i>. He thought bitterly. It was truly impressive Cloud was still fighting back every quick remark and stayed silent the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence was not always best though. Scarlet was no fool. All her poking and prodding didn\u2019t so much as draw a reaction other than submission. SOLDIERs were better than that. That could only mean Cloud had an ulterior motive, and it didn\u2019t take a genius to piece together what it was. Watching Cloud climb up her foot to continue his massage of her toes Scarlet began to smirk as she approached the torture from a different angle, \u201cI realize your loss may be hurting you but I hope you\u2019ll come to think of life as my slave as much better than what you\u2019re leaving.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud couldn\u2019t help but react, \u201cMy loss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, losing that Ancient girl. I honestly feel bad for you. Shrunken and then you lost your lover? Such a life is cruel, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. To make your life better.\u201d Scarlet peered from between her soles, smiling an evil smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud climbed down from Scarlet\u2019s toes he just finished massaging and approached her second foot. \u201c\u2026She\u2019s not my lover.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I do apologize. Though I guess that\u2019s a good thing\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken man\u2019s reaction was a tight clench of the foot he was massaging. The woman smiled further. \u201cWhy is it a good thing\u2026?\u201d Cloud was almost hesitant to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause she keeps trying to resist us the President gave Hojo permission for some\u2026<i>experiments</i>.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExperiments?\u201d There was no hiding Cloud\u2019s alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlternatively, Scarlet was getting increasingly malicious with each word. \u201cOh yes, his latest obsession has been materia. So he\u2019s attempting to use materia to try and change the girl\u2019s memories. If it works she\u2019ll be more than willing to see things for how they really are. Shinra Corporation as the good guys, and you AVALANCHE members as nothing more than worthless bugs. In some cases more literally than others.\u201d Scarlet laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud stopped his massaging, unable to react. Was Scarlet bluffing? What if she wasn\u2019t? It definitely sounded reasonable. If that was so he had limited time, he had to rescue Aerith! But how? \u201cAhem.\u201d The giantess cleared her throat to remind Cloud of his duty. She realized he was hurting and desperate for time, that\u2019s precisely why she was starting to get a rush from making him wait with menial tasks. But a massage could only go on for so long, and ten minutes later it was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet wiggled her toes with a soft smile; her feet felt better than they had in years. \u201cNot bad at all, a bit rough but I think we can work that out over time. Welcome to your new life as my toy.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Well then, its time to resume my work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnounced Scarlet. Her thumb and forefinger found themselves pinching Cloud's torso. Her touch was eerily precise as she knew how to grasp him not only with so few fingers but with just the right pressure so as to neither let him slip between her digits or kill him. Cloud was lifted high towards Scarlet's face and he could see her all too familiar sadistic face. Scarlet however didn't much care for the almost personality of a rock that her toy was displaying, so within moments she shifted her fingers that held the tiny member of AVALANCHE and held inches below a familiar object to Cloud. A white circled cloth for a top and past that white hole lied a dark abyss. Cloud's eyes widened as he realized what that was, it was Scarlet's stocking. Picking up on his reaction Scarlet smiled and said smugly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, you'll keep me company while I do my job! kya ha ha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat unbearable characteristic laugh of Scarlet's was always annoying, but at Cloud's size it was unbearable enough so that he thought he'd go deaf as he planted the palms of his hands onto his sensitive ears. But the laugh soon proved to be the least of his worries as he felt a fastening chilling sensation. Paying attention to his surroundings and how everything began to blur Cloud realized that he began to fall. His body collided with the dark portion of Scarlet's stocking and it was a tad painful against his naked form. \"Ugh!\"exclaimed Cloud as he landed on the bottom of the stocking. He knew what she was planning and it would come as no surprise that soon her foot would follow and right on cue what little light could enter from the stocking's opening was blotted out as Scarlet inserted her foot. From Cloud's perspective he saw Scarlet flex her massive toes who looked like hunting dogs trying to catch their target, but Cloud would not want to be caught by her toes. Grabbing onto the material of the stocking Cloud started to climb as fast as he could towards the incoming foot. The massive appendage soon bypassed Cloud's body and as it did the friction between Scarlet's foot and Cloud's body was painful, but the end result was worth it as Cloud felt Scarlet beginning to fasten her stocking and and flipped his body's position. If he remained where he was, no doubt he could be at the mercy of her toes. Currently Cloud is face up with his front nearing the arc of Scarlet's sole. His lower front is being forced against the portion nearing the end of the ball of Scarlet's foot. Cloud's back is tightly held  by the cloth of the stocking itself. From outside Cloud heard his captor announce:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the heels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet began to lower the stocking clad foot that contained the tiny blonde into the heel. As she did, Cloud began to feel a rougher surface collide with his back, it was the insole of the heel Scarlet wore. Due to the nature of high heels, Cloud's position began to change slightly as he felt himself placed in a more diagonal position along the sole of Scarlet's foot. In no time Scarlet finished putting on her attire and stood up. To Cloud the pain was excruciating as the weight of Scarlet's body was on him. He might not be dead, but he's in plenty of pain. This was followed up by Scarlet taking her first step. Cloud could feel an elevating feeling as Scarlet's foot rose in the air.  The feeling of vertigo sent a chill down Cloud's spine and knowing what was to come, his tiny hands grasped the foot flesh around him and embraced it as he felt Scarlet's foot descend. Upon placing her foot on the floor the sole pressed down on Cloud forcing him to let out Agh...!\" as the air was pushed out of his lungs. Feeling the cool little tid bit of air on her sole made Scarlet smile as she enjoyed that cooling little sensation and with no further ado continued her walk towards her working area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Scarlet's foot descended and squashed his body, Cloud was forced more and more into the foot flesh that assaults him with every step Scarlet took. Due to the softer tone of Scarlet's feet Cloud could almost feel how they were absorbing him and worse yet, he began to feel a moist sensation with each footfall. <i>\"Sweat...!</i>\" thought Cloud as yet again the appendage came down upon him forcing him to exhale his breath. Up above Scarlet was enjoying the sensation of a small man that's at the mercy of her feet. The sense of domination, the power she held over his life, with just a toe she could break him. Not only that but she relished on the feeling of his warm little body being pressed onto the squishy flesh of her foot. \"<i>And in time my feet warm up. It will be his tiny body heat against the heat my feet produce, I'm sure the latter will overpower him.</i>\" thought the head of Shinra's Weapons Development as she entered her high quality office and neared her dark brown desk. Taking a seat Scarlet grabbed a file and began to type in her computer as she began her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the confines of Scarlet's stockings, Cloud's eyes were burning. A little of Scarlet's sweat managed to slip into his eyes causing them to sting. By this point after Scarlet's foot had its way with him, Cloud felt not only discomfort in his eyes, but his body was battered and sore. Not only that but his body was also hot, growing desperate he began to struggle as wildly as he could digging his fingers into the oppressive appendage that was on top of him. Fortunately for Cloud Scarlet's sole was sensitive as he established before during the massage. Unfortunately Scarlet seemed to not like his recent action as he felt the foot rise in the air and then suddenly and swiftly was sent towards the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>THUD</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCame a painful stomp that threatened to break every bone in Cloud's little body as he felt his body consumed by the wall of foot flesh. The back of his body pressed down onto the insole of the heel and his front being smothered by Scarlet's sole. Gritting his teeth and slowly parting his mouth Cloud moaned in pain \"Oww...\" Wincing in pain Cloud dared not to try his recent maneuver again. If his body felt battered before during Scarlet's walk, then right now its feeling like its in a critical state. Trying to calm down and draw breath, Cloud stumbles upon an odd element in the tight confines of Scarlet's stocking. \"<i>What is that?</i>\" thought Cloud. Sniffing around he felt not the unpleasant smell of sweat anymore. Feeling it to be a known scent, Cloud began to analyze the feeling. This was a pleasant aroma, it smelled of roses, of fresh pleasant flowers, the kinds one would give to someone special. And it filled Cloud's body with a warm sensation separate from the body heat generated by Scarlet's foot. It brought back memories of Aerith, it smelled kind of like her...Gasping Cloud understood what it was \"<i>The perfume...!</i>\" This was the perfume that Cloud briefly detected on Scarlet's stockings not too long ago. The warm feeling that began to consume Cloud's body only grew, Cloud felt himself blush. Gasping for breath he couldn't help but wonder why he's feeling this way. \"Unless...\" uttered Cloud as he felt his body and mind grow anxious \"It's an aphrodisiac!\" concluded Cloud sounding alarmed. It didn't take long for the effects of the perfume to affect Cloud's nether regions. He could feel his member rising and press itself onto the ball of Scarlet's foot. Even worse he could feel how the warmth of the ball of Scarlet's foot seemed to stimulate the tip of his dick and pre-cum was beginning to moisten the layers of flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove Scarlet continued her work, she was typing diligently, but suddenly she stopped. She felt like a tiny prick or needle was trying to impale the ball of her foot. This was followed by a wet sensation. She couldn't help but smile at the feeling. Like a little pulsating warmth was trying to overpower the heat of her foot. Not being ignorant she knew what was likely going on down inside her stocking.  She most certainly didn't expect her perfume to lead to this development, but now that it has she may as well kick back and enjoy the situation. Besides she's worked enough and could use a break. Scarlet removed her heels and stockings and the one that contained the shrunken young man was held upside down. In a moment Cloud landed on Scarlet's open palm. Hot, sweaty, and clearly erect Scarlet knew that her little slave might be ready for even more. Opening her mouth Scarlet stated \"You really seemed to have some fun with my feet, but it seems you couldn't go all the way.\" Cloud tried to cover his genitals in embarrassment prompting Scarlet to say sounding quite mocking \"Oh I'm sorry, would you have preferred the Ancient girl's feet?\" Cloud didn't respond.  Losing her smile, Scarlet said sounding a bit testy \"Well then I think you're ready to take it to the next level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does do? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With each word Scarlet uttered Cloud found himself only half-hearing it. The woman\u2019s perfume had clouded his mind; he could understand what was going on but he was sluggish, passive, and most of all, aroused. His body\u2019s lust for sexual release was beginning to feel painful. The throbbing of Cloud\u2019s nether regions seemed to match the beat of his very heart. He wanted to try and talk, or at the very least take his mind off of what was likely to happen. But easier said than done, Cloud was powerless. The woman holding him could clearly see all of this. That\u2019s why she began to lower Cloud back to the ground near her toes. The massive digits wiggled in anticipation, waiting to pounce on their spike-haired prey. Beyond that, far above Scarlet only smirked down at Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs your kind owner I\u2019ll help you with this problem of yours my little slave.\u201d Right then Scarlet\u2019s toes pounced on Cloud, clasping around his head and gently squeezing it. The pressure made Cloud cry out in pain, whiffing in another deep breath of the perfume, only further muddling his sense. Below he could feel the ball of Scarlet\u2019s foot gently grazing his penis, teasing the appendage. \u201cIf you lick I\u2019ll stop.\u201d The giantess laughed at her toy, applying more pressure with her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud let out another wince at the new dosage of pain. With each passing moment the perfume Scarlet wore was making him worse and worse. His vision was getting blurry; everything was starting to fly by in a heated moment. The willpower the little hero was known for seemed to have left him. All that remained was the desire for release from this sexual tension. The toes that seemed to torment him began to resemble the tools he needed. At Scarlet\u2019s command Cloud looked to the crevice between her toes he was face-to-face with. There was a coat of sweat forming, but if it meant ending this Cloud had no regrets. He leaned forward and gently began lapping away at the toe cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs promised, once Cloud did as he was asked Scarlet removed her toes, planting her big toe on the SOLDIER\u2019s chest. \u201cBy the time I\u2019m done with you you\u2019ll be calling me a goddess.\u201d She laughed. The toe on Cloud\u2019s chest heaved upward and slammed back down, making him gasp again. \u201cI never said stop now did I? Keep going otherwise I\u2019ll just leave you to suffer.\u201d Feebly Cloud leaned his head forward and continued to lick Scarlet\u2019s big toe, each second wishing she\u2019d go ahead and end things. His member had reached the point it was starting to hurt quite badly. The pain plus more and most of that perfume scent just made Cloud lick all the harder, ignoring the taste like it didn\u2019t even exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKya ha ha ha!\u201d The woman laughed as her other foot began to lift Cloud by his head. \u201cKeep going as I warm you up a bit.\u201d The toe on his chest shifted, Scarlet turned her foot and covered Cloud with it. Behind him he could feel the other foot doing the same motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it would turn out \u201cwarming up\u201d meant Scarlet would begin to rub her feet back and forth along Cloud like she was rubbing him out of existence. The shrunken warrior was being rolled around like a ragdoll. But the woman was cruel; it was only the upper-half of Cloud\u2019s body. His erect penis only occasionally bounced along the mounds of foot-flesh. Any other time it painfully throbbed while remaining completely untouched. It seemed like the aphrodisiac of Scarlet\u2019s foot finally reached its peak though, as the breaths no longer seemed to change anything. But it didn\u2019t matter; Cloud was already past the breaking point anyway. Any thoughts otherwise were just remnants of his actual personality behind the uncontrollable lust wrought upon him. Even the pain of being grinded between two massive feet seemed to pale in comparison to his intense desire. Scarlet no longer seemed like a sadistic bitch; at the moment she practically owned his soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Scarlet had her fill of her torture of Cloud she released her feet and let him fall back to the ground. Cloud meekly looked ahead as Scarlet\u2019s second and big toes stood like a pair of legs in the distance. Much like her dress they had the deep-coat of red paint that matched. Red\u2026the color for passion\u2026Just the sight of it seemed to spur Cloud\u2019s desires even more. The second toe moved first, motioning forward with the big toe taking the next step. They were walking towards him Cloud realized, stopping just at his feet. Cloud looked at his feet and realized his legs were closed; Scarlet\u2019s toes fixed that. Her big toe jammed itself right between his legs and forced them open, where it continued approaching Cloud\u2019s privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet\u2019s big toe stopped just short of Cloud\u2019s crotch, \u201cBefore I begin the big show I want you ask me. Not as your owner, but as your Goddess. Pray for me to save you and I might consider it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud was so long gone that the idea of humiliating him seemed redundant, \u201cPlease Goddess! Save me from this torment with your feet! I beg of you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk appeared on her face, \u201cAre you saying you want it to be me? Not the Ancient girl? Not your little barmaid? Me? You\u2019re saying I\u2019m the most beautiful, the one who should do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you know how to charm a woman.\u201d Scarlet\u2019s eyes lit up as her toes grasped Cloud\u2019s member in a vice-grip. The two digits wasted no time in slowly rubbing the puny thing between them. Finally receiving what he\u2019d been wanting Cloud found himself moaning. The pain began to turn to pleasure; the unbearable desire and pain became an intoxicating euphoria that made everything nonexistent. Nothing else existed right now; it was just Cloud and his kind Goddess. His friends never did anything this grand for him; they never saved him from such torment. No, it was Scarlet who had saved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the build-up of the last few minutes had warmed him up, Cloud could feel his release approaching quickly. Scarlet seemed to sense it too as her toes changed to an up-and-down motion. It was almost there, Cloud could feel it. He was finally going to be satisfied. Then it came, with a strong cry of pleasure Cloud released himself all over Scarlet\u2019s toes. With his request met Cloud slowly panted, soon greeted by Scarlet\u2019s toes in his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClean your mess.\u201d She commanded. After being saved from his hell Cloud wasted no time in licking his semen off of his Goddess\u2019 marvelous feet. It just took a couple licks, with a few more as a thank you before he lowered his head and began to feel his heat die down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet drew her feet away with a smile on her face. Her eyes darted to the computer on her desk; the clock showed it had barely been ten minutes since she stopped to play with her pet. <i>Ten minutes to completely break him</i>. She mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each moment the passed Cloud found his mind returning, and with it, shame. It was all a blur but he knew what he had done. There was no forgetting this. Scarlet just broke him, even for a couple minutes. And she knew how to do it again. This wasn\u2019t over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking up, Cloud saw Scarlet putting on her stockings and heels. Once ready Scarlet's massive hand enveloped the physically exhausted Cloud and brought him to her face. A cruel smile on the woman's face indicated she was up to something sinister. \"How about we see that Ancient girl of yours to see how she's doing?\" Cloud's recent ordeal became irrelevant as he sprang to life and asked \"Really?!\" Scarlet nodded her head and replied \"Oh yes, I am curious about how she's doing. Who knows by now she'll be loyal to us and will see you as insignificant.\" Remembering how he heard Aerith is being experimented on to change her disposition made Cloud frown. But he had no time for despair as he felt Scarlet's hand cover him completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the warmth it provided all over. No doubt he couldn't fight against Scarlet's fingers, they'd squeeze the life out of him in retaliation. Within moments Cloud felt Scarlet stand and begin to move. She turned this way and that way for a couple of minutes and soon she stopped. Opening her hand Cloud saw that right in front of him was Aerith looking dull in the eyes. So lifeless, so depressing, this wasn't the lively Aerith he knew. The thought of what kind of experiments they did to her horrified and angered Cloud. Looking around it seems like Scarlet brought Cloud to a private room in Shinra HQ. Similar to the one she used for when Scarlet had her massage. It had a bed, a nightstand, a table, a bathroom, etc. \"<i>So this is where they keep Aerith after the experiments end.</i>\" wondered Cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud suddenly felt Scarlet's palm extend itself forward towards his massive friend. Aerith looked on at Cloud's tiny form being offered to her. Aerith did not speak a single word. Not even a sigh, a moan, or a grunt. Aerith raised her own hand and started to reach out for Cloud. The silence was highly unnerving as Cloud felt Aerith's fingers wrap themselves around his body. Lifting him off Scarlet's open palm Cloud was now at the mercy of Aerith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enduring Shinra's experiments Aerith...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tifa\u2019s eyes lit up with joy when she heard Cloud say that she was the one he wanted to be with. She smiled brightly and fought the urge to crush Cloud to her chest, knowing that doing that might hurt the shrunken man. Unable to control her excitement, she started kissing Cloud, seeing no harm in giving the man that had returned her affections a few small pecks. Cloud raised his hands feebly as he was brought to Tifa\u2019s plump lips and pushed hard against them. He sank into the spongy flesh as Tifa softly kissed him, which felt more like she was trying to suck off his face. His head was pulled into the gap between her lips and he struggled to pull himself out. Pushing against her lips, his head popped out and he gasped for air. All of this went unnoticed by Tifa as she continued to kiss the small man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally pulled away from her lips, Tifa smiled down at her new boyfriend and carefully placed him on a table. Cloud lay there dazed, only vaguely listening as Tifa slowly backed away and started speaking. \u201cLet me just change into something. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d No waiting for him to answer, Tifa left with a skip in her walk. Cloud watched her go and then fell back once he was left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I gotten myself into?\u201d He asked himself, knowing the answer was obvious; he had gotten himself involved with his sexy giant old friend. He and Tifa had a long past together and his reason for agreeing that he wanted to be with her was based not on love and friendship, but survival and lust. He was alone with Tifa, a very temperamental girl, if he turned down her affection he knew he would suffer. If he was lucky she\u2019d just stomp him and things would be over, but if she decided he needed to be punished, Cloud knew she\u2019d make his tiny body suffer. Tifa was a very nice girl, normally, but Cloud knew that if he pissed her off he would be doomed. So, he had told her what she wanted to hear because he wanted to stay alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn\u2019t just survival that made him return Tifa\u2019s affections, it was also a growing desire for her. He had been with Aeris for a while now and all they had done was hold hands and share small kisses. Cloud knew he was supposed to be a hero and a man of virtue, but he had his needs and Aeris didn\u2019t satisfy them. Tifa was smoking hot, with those big breasts of hers and that tiny skirt that showed off her well-sculpted legs. Cloud knew he could go all the way with her easy. That would have to wait though, if they tried to consummate the relationship, Cloud would end up a smear on Tifa\u2019s body. Once he got fixed, then they would get it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he was hardly being noble or living up to the expectations a lot of his friends had for him, but wanting to stay in the good graces of a girl that could kill you at a whim and had a killer body was just smart. Why do the heroes always have to do the right thing for everything they did? He\u2019d still fight for good, stop villains and protect the weak, but he also wanted to be safe and get some action. He was only being human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m back,\u201d Tifa deeply called out as she stepped back into the room. Cloud sat up and stared openly at Tifa, a smile on his face at the sight of what she was wearing. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look marvelous,\u201d Cloud told her as his tiny eyes looked at the giant landscape in front of him. Tifa was wearing her old outfit from when they had been traveling around and fighting bad guys. She was wearing the sleeveless white shirt that tightly clung to her big bouncy chest and bared her stomach. Also, she had on the short black miniskirt and pair of black suspenders that she wore back then. She even had on the big brown boats with black socks. She looked gorgeous and Cloud couldn\u2019t wait to hold her in his arms when he was back to normal. However, Tifa wasn\u2019t going to wait that along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou should see me without my clothes on,\u201d Tifa said as she reached down to scoop Cloud up. His tiny body fit nicely in her palm and Tiffa had to giggle as he fell onto his back as she lifted him up to her face. He was so perfect at this size. He looked so adorable at his current height, like a pet you have to cuddle. He was manageable too. Tifa would never have to worry about where he was because she could carry him in her pocket or in other places. She was sure Cloud wouldn\u2019t mind being out in her bra or even in her shoe. It would be nice feeling her new boyfriend huddling around her toes as she went for a walk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we talk about fixing something important first?\u201d Cloud nervously said as Tifa hungrily looked at him. She had that look she got when they were kids and she had something bad planned for him. She never saw it as bad as long as she had fun, but Cloud would disagree. Tifa could be a very caring person, but when she wanted to do something, nothing could talk her out of it. Cloud was hoping she\u2019d feel like she had to protect and care for him, but instead all she wanted to do was play with her new tiny boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, there is something important that we have to fix,\u201d Tifa quickly said, realizing what she had forgotten to take care of. Cloud sighed, knowing his new giant caretaker would help him fix his current predicament. That hope was dashed when she started walking towards the door. \u201cWe need to fix things between you and Aeris. We need to tell her we are together now and you two are done forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you want to do this now? I mean, we just got together, shouldn\u2019t we wait until, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m normal size?\u201d Cloud suggested, fearing what was going to happen next. He didn\u2019t want to break Aeris\u2019s heart, especially when all she needed to do to kill him was grab him from Tifa and throw him to the ground. He wanted to avoid angering any girl that might want to hurt him and Tifa\u2019s announcement would anger the flower girl to the point where she might break him for breaking her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope. No better time then the present,\u201d Tifa said without looking at Cloud. She wanted to end that part of Cloud\u2019s life so they could start their own. Besides, if she waited until Cloud was normal size before talking to Aeris, she might never tell her. Tifa had no real desire to see Cloud back to normal. He might have been her knight in shining armor, but she preferred him as her pet boyfriend more. She wasn\u2019t going to help him return to normal, not until the novelty of having him this size wore out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut..but\u2026but\u2026\u201d Cloud sputtered, wracking his brain for a reason not to go that might not tip Tifa off that his reason for being with her was not solely based on love. He needed a reason to keep her away from Aeris and only one idea came to mind. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t leave your home, not without first celebrating our new relationship. Let me treat you like the princess you are. We\u2019ll do anything you want. I\u2019ll do anything you want. Lets just be alone together.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her free hand found its way to her hip where it situated itself along the apex of the curve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis entire pose combined with Tifa's sentence led Cloud to a very simple if not perverted idea. Immediately his cheeks flared as red as the darker portions of Aeris' dress. \"You aren't gonna....no way! I know we're together but that is going way too fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa's smile quickly turned into a confused frown, \"What are you talking about? I was talking about maybe a massage, like at my feet and shoulders. Even now I still have knots and bruises from back in our adventuring days.\" Embarassed the spiky haired swordsman averted his gaze, his voice box locked in discomfort. Cheeks redder than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was confused, not even ten seconds and already her boyfriend was acting odd. What was he....it all clicked in that moment. The frown of confusion turned back into a smile filled with lust. \"I get it....you thought I was gonna put you...in \"there\" \" With her hand on the hip Tifa outstretched her index finger and gently tapped along the edges of her crotch; the thin fabric of her miniskirt literally hiding next to nothing. As if entranced Cloud watched, aroused in a way he had never felt with Aeris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully aware of Cloud's eyes on her Tifa giggled like a little girl again. \" You gotta learn to control those urges my little Cloud. You'll get to the finish line eventually but you have to compete in the race first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud shrugged, slowly regaining his cool demeanor. \" In that case I'll cheat.\" he smirked up at his giantess of a girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa shook her head, \" Afraid not, cheat and you'll suffer some penalties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn retrospect Cloud probably shouldn't have asked but before he knew it the question escaped his lips. \" What penalties? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling again Tifa's cheeks turned slightly red once more. \" Well you may get a chance to experience what you want but it may not be the way you envision it.\" Cloud didn't even want to imagine what Tifa was hinting at with that statement. \" Maybe a nice punishment in my boots, possibly even as I wear them. I could probably make you do some excersises with me too.\" Again Cloud didn't want to imagine what Tifa meant or had in mind with that series of statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly....\" Tifa continued, now enjoying her little teasing taunts. \" If you really be a bad boy I might let Yuffie have you for a couple days....or weeks.\" No matter how hard he resisted Cloud instantly pictured any and all possible results of that. Take Tifa's anger, moodiness, and pretty much every negative trait and stick them in a teenage girl and you got Yuffie. Granted she had her own happy go lucky personality but that definitely didn't make her an appealing owner. God knows the horrors she would make Cloud go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll play fair..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa laughed, \"Somehow I knew you'd say that. Anyway we got sidetracked, we need to decide what you can do to please this princess. I'm thinking massages, you can do my feet,shoulders and back...and if you do really good maybe it could turn into a full body. \" She paused for a moment to think, \"Hmm....it sounds more like slave work but you could probably do some good cleaning and such. Like between my toes, maybe my ears, possibly beneath my nails. But like I said that stuff sounds more like slavery than a relationship, it'd be no different from asking you to lick my foot or eat my ear wax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe miniature SOLDIER seemed to turn green, \"Please don't be so clear with the examples....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly ignoring Cloud Tifa playfully poked her boyfriend, knocking him flat onto her palm. \"What do you think we should do baby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCloud didn't even have to think, the choice was between slavery and what would likely turn into a very kinky massage. \"Massage of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTifa smiled.........</span></div></div>",

Even if the Sorceress' menace was over, SeeDs jobs was not done, as the need for hired mercenaries was still felt, given all the monsters that roamed the wilderness. <br>\r\nHowever, nothing major was happening, or at least not major enough for the Garden to deploy some of its best soldiers, and many of them decided to use this time to just relax and take some time off while still being ready if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZell Dincht was not one of them, and many would say he was unable to simply stay still. Since there were no missions for him, he spent days at the Training Center to keep his training going and he enjoyed it enough even if all he did was punching and kicking Grats, because every once in a while a T-Rexaurus could decide to show its ugly mug.<br>\r\nFor Zell that was not a normal day however, for more reasons than one, but the first one was that the Garden recently requested and received a supply of brand new monsters directly from the technological paradise of Esthar. Finally he could kick the butt something different than Grats for a change!<br>\r\nAnd he was in pretty good spirits when finally one of these monsters showed up after Zell defeated its third Grat: it was another plant type, but noticeably bigger and tougher-looking, with a giant mouth taking the place of its face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! Finally a change of pace!\" Zell said excitedly, ready in his fighting stance and sizing the enemy: it looked a lot like an Ochu, but it was purple instead of green.<br>\r\nZell didn't waste any time after cracking his knuckles and immediately charged at the monster. It didn't move, but as the blond kid was getting nearer, it raised one of its tentacled arms to slam him. Zell noticed it just in time and leapt sideways. He then kept his charge but didn't punch the monster: he lowered himself and hit Ochu's legs with a slide kick, making it lose its balance and leaving it flailing helplessly with its giant mouth facing upwards. <br>\r\nZell turned around and noticed a big red gland on the back of one of the monsters' arms. He grinned.<br>\r\n\"That's a weak spot if I ever saw one!\"<br>\r\nHe then jumped up and hit it with a spinning kick, destroying it immediately while the Ochu cried in pain. It wasn't all good however: as soon as Zell destoyed the gland, a purple-ish smoke surrounded him. \"W-What the...?\"<br>\r\nHe said confused, looking around still in his fighting stance, but noticed that he was breathing normally, didn't feel sleepy and, once the smoke cleared, he could see the Ochu's corpse in front of him.<br>\r\nHe was apparently perfectly fine, but was pretty disappointed by the quick match, so he decided to call it quits for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as soon as Zell went into his room, he started to feel strange.<br>\r\n\"Ngh! W-What is this? Was...it...that...?\" he asked himself as suddenly he felt his body growing weaker and almost struggling to keep his eyes open, but it was not the effect of some sleeping magic. <br>\r\nHe didn't fall to the floor only because he managed to get close enough to his bed to fall belly up on it, with his legs hanging slightly over its side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zell was unconscious, his body shrank out of his clothes and slid down his now huge jeans and hit the floor after rolling a short distance away. This was enough to wake him up, and he was now facing his enormous bed.<br>\r\n\"How did I get so small?!\" he asked himself in a mix of anger and confusion. He answered himself almost immediately after: \"That smoke...so that's what it does!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He nodded to himself: his mind was set! It was all perfect: he would get a few hot dogs and could just go get help later after all. <br>\r\nHe glanced at the alarm clock one more time: it was late, but the cafeteria was not far from the dorm and Zell was confident he could make it before it closed for the day. After that he went to his room's door and crawled under it to get out, since it was closed, and then started running towards the cafeteria. At his current size, the corridor seemed huge and far longer than normal, almost endless, but Zell kept running undeterred and unhindered: as it turned out, no one was around there at that time, probably everyone was training or studying.<br>\r\nAfter a much longer time than he anticipated, Zell finally reached the end of the dorm and the connecting pathway to the Garden's main ring that, unlike the dorm, was actually pretty crowded as usual. He stopped for a moment, in his over eagerness, only now he realized that he was completely naked and didn't bother to try and find something to cover himself with. For a moment he thought about going back and remedy this, but he shook his head.<br>\r\n&lt; Wait! What am I worried about? &gt; he thought to himself, shaking his head. &lt; If I go back, I'll never make it in time. Besides, now I'm so small, no one will notice me! &gt;<br>\r\nAnd so he kept running towards his destination, going into the main ring that connected all the Garden's facilities. His thoughts proved to be true: no one paid attention to him, and no one actually noticed him.<br>\r\nHowever, not all was well for Zell, as that meant that, while he was running to the cafeteria, he had to also jump and dodge to avoid being stepped on. Luckily for him, he was able to do just that thanks to his athletic physique and training. He finally went out the ring onto the connecting pathway leading to the cafeteria and, after a brief stop to catch his breath, he finally made his way to the cafeteria proper. There were fewer people down this hallway, so Zell could easily avoid them, and again, no one seemed to notice he was there. <br>\r\nHowerver, when he finally was in sight of the cafeteria door, he could see the staff accompanying the last few students out and he knew what that meant: it was closing time! He wasted no time, and started running at top speed towards the door, to reach it before they closed it, mustering all his strength to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what happens next?</span></div></div>",

And in that moment the door  never felt so far away. Nonetheless, Zell wasn't one to just give up without a fight, so he kept running through the empty corridor and confident that he wouldn't be noticed.<br>\r\n&lt; I have to make it! &gt; He thought.<br>\r\n&lt; I've come too far to fail now! &gt; <br>\r\nThe cantina staff had just put the key in the keyhole, ready to close shop, and Zell knew this was the time: make or break it. <br>\r\nHe then leapt forward and, luckily, managed to lunge himself beyond the door that was shut right behind him as he ducked and used both hands and feet to soften the impact of his landing. Only when he stopped he looked upwards to the staff with a cocky grin that looked like it said <br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" <br>\r\nAfter standing up and trying to keep his balance against the earthquake he felt as the staff walked away, he took a moment to look around now that he didn't need to hurry anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cantina felt like a completely different place from his perspecive, and not just because he was as big as an ant, if even that. There was a different atmosphere alltogether when it was almost entirely empty save for the cooks and cleaning staff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZell took some time looking around and taking in the atmosphere to unwind from the race against time he had just before. All he needed to do now was to wait for the cooks to prepare the following day's hotdogs and leave so he could act undisturbed. <br>\r\nHe sat down next to a chair leg to wait and for a while all was quiet: no one came close enough that he risked being squished and still no one noticed he was there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this would not last, as while it was true that he didn't have to hurry anymore, it was also true that his troubles were far from over.<br>\r\nThat's because...</span></div></div>",

His vision was blurred as he rubbed his eyes, eventually things came into focus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately he could tell something wasn't right here. With a heave, Zidane gets to his feet and looks around, the air was still, which probably meant he was indoors, but this room was massive! Glancing around for something to give him an idea of where he was, the thief suddenly gasps. He should have pieced it together, the soft spongy ground beneath his feet, the soft colours all around. He was on a bed, in a bedroom. Judging by the pastels and decoration around the colossal room, a girls bedroom at that. Doing a quick mental calculation, Zidane estimates himself to be around a half-inch tall. Miniscule by anyone's standards. Even Vivi, the diminuitive black mage would tower over him in his current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master thief's musings are cut short when a mountain draped in linen and bedding, the sleeping owner of this room no doubt, begins to stir. The simple act of this titaness turning in her sleep caused Zidane's very world to shake. At least now he could see who the girl was, and figure out how best to get her attention.

Occasionally the princess rolled over, but lucky for Zidane she was on the other side of the bed and he was at least somewhat safe, eventually Dagger just rolled onto her side and let part of her blankets slide off revealing a portion of her torso. Much to his disappointment Zidane saw Dagger was dressed in a pure white nightgown that probably barely reached the middle of Garnet's thighs, which as a benefit showed off Dagger's sizeable cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if only the blankets weren't in the way of the rest...\"Zidane smirked, he felt like he could sit there, staring at Dagger forever, just...stare at her. He realized ages ago he liked Dagger, heck he hooked up with her not that long ago; just after Zidane \"returned\" from the dead at the end of their journey. Still being Queen since her mother's passing Dagger was often busy, so Zidane didn't get to see her as much as he wanted. To kill time he regrouped with Tantalus and started pulling jobs with them again, but if Dagger ever had his free time he was there before anyone noticed he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling with a dopey expression Zidane reminisced about his journey, all of the friends he made, all his quality time with Dagger, even their for all intents and purposes \"Marriage\" in the Outer Continent.

As he turned around, he saw a burning orange sphere in the distance, coloring the sky in a beautiful shade of sunset red, and he saw another orange sphere spread across the rippling surface, the ripples rushing underneath the scattered lily pads.

The water stopped short of enveloping her whole feet, reaching halfway up her toes. Tidus was spared from a dunking, and after sighing in relief, he got back onto his feet, and looked up to the summoner towering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna submerged her hands into the water momentarily, and began rubbing water over her legs.

The unusual appearance piqued her curiosity, and she leaned in to eyeball it. Another shock overcame her as she recognized the figure standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tidus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus was overjoyed that Yuna finally spotted him, and he jumped on the spot waving his arms and yelling \"YUNA!\" at the top of his lungs, though his voice was significantly quieter because of his smaller lungs that went with his shrunken body. Yuna knew it was Tidus from his reaction, though she could only hear faint muffling coming from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move.\" Yuna said to him, as she placed her hands together and started to concentrate. Tidus recognized this expression, as it was the same expression she uses to cast Esuna in her battles.

At last, his problems would finally be over, and he'd be back to his usual regular sized full volume self in a matter of seconds. His hope was cut short however, when the growth stopped abruptly. He had grown, but not by much. The spell had worked, but only to a short extent. Tidus was about as tall as Yuna's big toe, and repeated casting of the spell did nothing to further his growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what's wrong, it's not working anymore.\" The summoner said with a guilty tone in her voice. \"I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's OK! At least it's better than nothing.\" Tidus replied. \"Can you hear me now?\" Tidus' voice was still rather faint, but Yuna could understand him clearly now. She gave a nod of confirmation, and started to wonder what could've gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. It must be a very unusual condition if I can't cure it any more than this. I'm sorry, I wish I knew how to remedy this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus got down on one knee, and started rubbing her foot to console her. \"I'm just glad you found me. I was afraid I'd have to climb all the way up to your ear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be pretty difficult to get up my skirt.\" Yuna chucked. She could always count on Tidus to cheer her up, and this was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you come looking for me by yourself?\" Tidus asked.<br>\r\n\"We all went looking for you, but the rest wanted to set up camp before it got dark. I insisted that I would keep looking though.\"<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure glad you did, otherwise I'd still be out there.\"<br>\r\nYuna smiled. \"You know, it's funny. Wakka kept pacing up and down the highroad looking for you. If I had known you had shrunk beforehand, I'd be afraid he would've trodden on you already!\"<br>\r\n\"Yikes. That sounds painful.\" Joking around about the situation with Yuna helped take his mind off the perils that would come with his new size. \"So, shall we head back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna takes a moment to think to herself.<br>\r\n\"Actually...\"</span></div></div>",

My feet feel really sore from walking up and down the Moonflow.\"<br>\r\nTidus felt bad for Yuna. After all, it was his fault that Yuna had to stop the pilgrimage just to look for him, when he was supposed to be guarding her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, you can stay all you like. I was supposed to guard you, not make you worry. So I'm going to make it up to you.\"<br>\r\nYuna smiled and tilted her head slightly. \"That's so sweet of you. But how will you do that?\"<br>\r\n\"How about your feet?\" Tidus replied. \"If they hurt so much, I'll massage them!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh no, it's fine. I'll just splash some water on them and it'll be fi-\"<br>\r\nTidus interrupted. \"Not another word Yuna. I insist. It is my fault they're sore in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna appreciated how dedicated her newest guardian was to her. She really could trust him to stand by her, no matter how small the problem.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\"<br>\r\nShe laid out her hand for Tidus to climb onto, and then moved her feet away from the water. She positioned her sandals under her feet, sticking out enough for Tidus to stand on, then placed him in front of her left foot. Tidus gazed at how beautiful her toes were. He had never noticed them before, as she wore boots throughout most of the pilgrimage, and he spent the last ten minutes clinging onto her foot for dear life. They looked creamy, smooth and majestic. Tidus was slightly taller than her big toe, and thought he could probably fit in between the crevice of her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can start with my toes if you like.\" she suggested.<br>\r\nTidus was more than happy to oblige. Anything for the summoner. He began by wrapping his arms around the front of her big toe, and started massaging. He rubbed with his arms, feeling the soft silky texture against his arms, and frequently gave the toe a squeeze, embracing the smooth and comfy toe. He spent five minutes caressing her big toe, before moving onto the next one in line. It was just small enough that he could lean over the top, so he wrapped his legs around the toe, and leaned over on top of the foot to hug it, and he cheekily planted kisses on her toenail. He repeated this for the rest of the toes, embracing the soft cushion-like feeling of her toes against his body.<br>\r\nAs he finished on the little toe and walked back towards the big toe, he wondered what it would be like to shuffle himself in between her toes and caress the crevice. Yuna spread her toes just enough so he could fit in, then closed them around him. He could feel the toes pressing against his sides, and enjoyed the feeling. He massaged the crevice with his hands, before kneeling down and rubbing his body against it and kissing it repeatedly. He could hear moans coming from Yuna. She was without a doubt enjoying every moment of it, and she could tell from the amount of energy Tidus put into the massage that he was enjoying it too. She teased him by clenching her toes tightly, trapping Tidus and squeezing him between her toes.<br>\r\nThe initial force of her toes pushing towards each other shocked him at first, but the feeling was more enjoyable than anticipated. The force sandwiching him between her toes was cushioned by her soft skin, though the pressure was tight enough to hold him in place and smother him. Tidus could hardly move, only barely managing to turn his head towards one of her toes. The side of her toe pressed against his face, and he could feel it spread across his face. He kissed the skin compressed against him, and heard more moans out of Yuna, which caused her to clench her toes further out of delight, pressing her toes deeper into his lips. The cycle went on until Tidus stopped feeling pleasure and started to feel pain. He repeatedly pressed his heel into her big toe as a signal to relieve the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna spread out her toes, and saw Tidus wander out in a daze, albeit with a large grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry! I hope I didn't hurt you!\" She said in worry that she could have crushed him to death.<br>\r\nTidus could barely string two words together. \"That... was incredible.\"<br>\r\nYuna's initial expression of shock turned into joy, not only at her friend being OK, but that he also enjoyed it as much as she did. She smiled for a moment while she watched Tidus snap out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidus looked up to Yuna, and saw that she had something to say.<br>\r\n\"I think you've forgotten something.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything was covered in the darkness of night. Stars shone brightly in the dark sky as the wildlife of Gran Pulse began to find their resting places for the evening. L\u2019Cie were no different, the group of Lightning, Sazh, Snow, Vanille, Fang, and Hope had set up camp in the valley near the Archylte Steppe. The girl\u2019s of the team were currently asleep, the guys were on watch. Even at night Gran Pulse was as dangerous as possible. The terrain was tough, the monsters, tougher. Especially for Hope, the youngest and most inexperienced of his fellow L\u2019Cie. The power he held was undeniable though. His friends trusted him enough to leave him on watch.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope gave a yawn, bored from the inactivity during his watch. Snow and Sazh were each at separate entrances doing the same duty he was, and likely having the same boredom he was. At first the party was under constant attack by the native Pulse monsters, but each encounter only made them stronger; and now, few monsters dared cross their path. It was still best to be ready though, hence the guard duty. Hope understood all that, it didn\u2019t do anything to reduce the boredom though. He leaned against a tree staring over the mountains, faintly spotting the form of Titan dozens of miles away. The bored thoughts turned to his newly found friends, who without them he would\u2019ve never been where he was today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSazh and Snow were each respectable men. Although with Snow Hope was still a little uneasy, his mother\u2019s death was almost directly caused by that man. To an extent the young lad still blamed the man for it, but he now knew Snow was a good guy and deeply regretted what had occurred that day. Fang was someone he admired too, remarkably beautiful and yet as much of a warrior as Lightning. Vanille he often thought about, during the course of their journey together Hope and Vanille had become essentially best friends, always keeping the other going. Last was Lightning, the beauty who taught Hope how to survive and fight. Each of these people had made Hope into the person he was now, a stronger person. He would cherish these feelings forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze shifted to his brand. <i>If it wasn\u2019t for this thing I\u2019d have never met them\u2026</i>The mark of L\u2019Cie glowed as he focused on it, as it always did. It was this mark that gave Hope all of his powers, what made him more than human. <i>There was once a time when I cursed this thing\u2026Now I\u2019m almost grateful for it</i>. He released his focus on the mark on his hand, yet the glow it had did not vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Hope removed his glove to look at his hand; its glow had grown darker than its usually green aura, the brand changing shape slightly. This usually meant one thing, \u201cTimes running out\u2026\u201d The boredom Hope was experiencing moments ago was replaced with a sense of melancholy. Less time to head to Oerba\u2026and then what? No one knew what would come after their journey, or even if it would be a success. They didn\u2019t even know if they would ever see one another again. It pained Hope to think he might be unable to see the friends he\u2019d finally made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome bushes in the distance rustled, Hope stood braced himself for battle. Right on cue a small group of three of Pulse\u2019s wolf-like creatures stepped from the bushes, fangs bared. The young man gave a look to his still-glowing hand, then looked to the wolves with a determined look. \u201cYou guys picked the wrong moment to mess with me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves were weaklings; Hope didn\u2019t even need to draw his weapon. He aimed his palm at the leader of the beasts, charging up a Firaga spell to end them. When he released it, it wasn\u2019t a Fire spell that came out; it wasn\u2019t even an attack spell. Truth be told, Hope didn\u2019t know what it was. He just felt its power come over him along with his foes. The beasts appeared as offset as their prey. All four of them looked around expectantly; it seemed as if they all realized at the same time what was happening too. The land around them was growing! No\u2026it was more accurate to say they were shrinking. The valley loomed further and further up as the grass quickly got big enough to cover Hope\u2019s ankles, and then his knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of them nearing a fifth of their size, Hope about a foot tall, the beasts realized what was going on; but in their simple minds they only knew one thing for certain. Their prey was responsible for it. All three began running towards Hope with all their might. Hope pulled out his Boomerang to ready himself. The shrinking effect continued though, and in the minutes it took for the wolves to reach Hope the grass that once surrounded his feet was like a forest. The tree-like grass stood a couple hundred feet up in the sky. This was bad, on all sides were places the wolves could be, and they were good enough hunters to know it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope gritted his teeth, eyes on his brand. <i>I can\u2019t risk another spell\u2026it might just make things worse!</i> But he wasn\u2019t a very physical fighter. In the terrain Hope might actually lose if all he could resort to was his boomerang. But his friends never gave up, and neither did Hope. He readied himself to fight off the wolves when they arrived. Adrenaline pumped through the L\u2019Cie\u2019s veins, his senses heightened. It seemed as if every blade of grass for miles on end was rustling with the sound of movement, the wolves were impossible to detect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Crack</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a twig snapping behind him, Hope turned around just in time for a wolf to lunge at him. His boomerang held back the fangs rather well. The feral beast and L\u2019Cie were nearly face to face, ready to fight to the death in this forest of grass. Hope raised a leg to kick it off just as the other two wolves to appear in the air. The kick sent one off by it quickly regained itself and joined its companions in attacking the young man. Hope didn\u2019t falter, he continued trying to fight off the wolves with his weapon; but they had the advantage, and small wounds were quickly gathering all over the shrunken L\u2019Cie. Pretty soon he was panting from exhaustion, and the wolves seemed to grin at him as they back away into the grass for another attack. Hope could follow their movements since he knew where they started at. The loud booms of normal-sized creatures moving around made it harder, but the L\u2019Cie found the chance to attack and threw his boomerang. The forest of grass cleared away for several dozen meters from the weapon, revealing the two wolves who managed to avoid getting hit. The third died from the blow it received. Both forces stared at one another in the clearing, Hope felt his strength dwindling. The wolves were still more than strong though, and sensing the weakened prey they lunged for a direct attack. Hope braced himself for the fangs to dig into his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA never ending shadow engulfed everything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was that, Hope stared in disbelief at what had just happened. The wolves that were so close to killing him were dead, crushed beneath the foot of something at normal size. It was a relief to see the foot belonged to someone human, even if the footwear they wore was large enough to be its own mountain. The person rose an endless number of feet into the air, probably big enough to even start thinking miles. So big they probably didn\u2019t even realize they just crushed two monsters and saved Hope\u2019s life. In fact, past their ankles they started becoming little more than a blur. The person was a girl, that much he was certain of (Mainly because their chest prevented him from seeing their face.) The overall figure was clear though, as was the person itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one who unknowingly saved Hope was\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He knew he had shrunken but to see one of his friends tower over him so was more than unsettling. Above him Fang loomed like a true giantess, seemingly even bigger than the fal\u2019Cie Titan. Before him her left foot was an enormous mountain in itself. To give a good idea of how small he was, roughly ten feet overhead the sole of Fang\u2019s sandal ended and then there were her toes. It was difficult to put a number on it but by his estimate Hope was about a fifth the size of Fang\u2019s big toe, which meant roughly a fifth of an inch give or take. That was not good. Fang may have unknowingly saved him but that meant nothing if he was going to get crushed under her like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to do Hope did a quick jump to get atop Fang\u2019s sandal, where the looming toes of the woman impatiently drummed. He had to be careful; those very toes could very well crush Hope without Fang ever noticing. Though the woman\u2019s appearance begged the question. What was she doing there? It was Hope\u2019s turn to stand watch. Overhead the woman let out a careless yawn, \u201cWhere is the little bugger?\u201d Her head swayed side-to-side scanning for signs of Hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>She has no idea how accurate that name is. </i>The young man bitterly thought. Amidst the dangerous situation he took the time to stare at the brand on his hand. It no longer had any weird glow to it but Hope still didn\u2019t feel safe using any magic. So if he wanted to get Fang\u2019s attention he would to do it without any aid from his powers. Considering his time on Pulse this would be a lot easier. Battles against the wild had made Hope stronger than he could have ever imagined. The young man looked to the gigantic toes before him wondering how to get Fang\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe just see if I can hit it or something\u2026? </i>Hope took a couple steps forward before the massive appendage of Fang\u2019s big toe drummed along her sandal once again. Hope let out a brief shout before leaping back, narrowly dodging getting hit. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s try something else\u2026\u201d The young l\u2019Cie reached for the boomerang in his back pocket. It seemed small but if he put enough force into it maybe even this could catch Fang\u2019s attention. Hope prepared to throw his weapon when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like he left.\u201d Fang mumbled under her breath. In a single motion she raised her foot and turned around to begin walking, totally unaware of what such a simple action caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the tiny l\u2019Cie he brought his hand back to throw his boomerang. But the moment he started to bring it forward the ground shifted, adjusting a slight angle and rising up high into the air. Hope managed to keep his footing but it threw him off just enough that his boomerang was off course. It completely missed Fang, which was horrid luck considering how big she was. Then Fang brought her foot forward in a basic stepping motion. To someone of Hope\u2019s stature this created a strong wind pressure that pushed his further into Fang\u2019s sandal. He finally lost his footing and slid, to his dismay, right between Fang\u2019s big and second toes. \u201cUgh\u201d Hope landed face-first in the toe cleavage and grimaced. He had to escape otherwise he could end up underneath Fang\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">BOOM</font></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roaring sound of the titanic foot making contact with the ground was deafening. But worse than that it reminded Hope that all his troubles had only been over a single step. There was still a long way to go. Sure enough, soon the vertigo of rising rapidly through the air made the young man feel slightly queasy. Simultaneously he was moving forward at a speed fast enough to push him deeper into the crevice between Fang\u2019s toes. Hope wanted to gag when he felt a sticky liquid begin to soak into his clothes: foot sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope cringed at the sound in his ears, awaiting the next step. But it didn\u2019t come, Fang stopped. The l\u2019Cie used the chance to free himself from his spot between the woman\u2019s toes; though he wondered why Fang suddenly stopped. From both sides he heard the movement of her massive toes. For a brief moment Hope wondered what was going on, then it hit him, literally. Hope felt himself being surrounded on all sides. In the moment before being surrounded he saw Fang\u2019s toes completely surround him, eventually blotting out the little light left. Hope winced as Fang\u2019s toes grinded him between them. If he had to guess the woman probably felt an itch between her toes and stopped to remedy it. That\u2019s all Hope was to her right now, an annoying itch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrack. Hope cried out as he head his shoulder bones let out a sickening crack sound. If it didn\u2019t stop soon Fang\u2019s toes were literally going to grind him to dust. But what could he do? The little l\u2019Cie was unable to move, his body was being contorted and toyed with by the large toes surrounding him. His mind turned to the brand on his hand. Magic? But what if it shrunk him further? There was a small feeling of power in his palm, but Hope decided against it. He could ride this out. He knew he could, Lightning was way rougher on him than this. Almost as if they acknowledged his sudden determination, Fang\u2019s toes eased their vice and released Hope. For a brief moment he landed back on Fang\u2019s sandal and chuckled with clear exhaustion. \u201cI may not be the strongest guy around but I can at least live through this.\u201d Hope opened his eyes and instantly widened them. Directly overhead was Fang\u2019s big toe, which wasted no time in landing on top of Hope and completely engulfing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope tried to struggle against Fang\u2019s toe but the appendage was too big and too strong. Once again he was immobile and sandwiched between two surfaces. Though by comparison, this was much easier than the last one. In fact, as his initial fervor died down, Hope realized he wasn\u2019t actually in all that much pain. Most of Fang\u2019s weight was on her foot and her toes weight alone wasn\u2019t all that bad. All it really did was secure Hope beneath her foot. Considering how easy it would be to fall off as she was walking, this was actually a good thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang slowly began to walk again and it only proved it to Hope. Little pain and he wasn\u2019t flying around anymore. Sure there was still the foot sweat but after so many minutes the little l\u2019Cie was beginning to adjust to it. He began to notice details about Fang\u2019s feet he had never noticed before. For instance, despite always wearing the same sandals; not only were the sandals in perfect condition, they smelled just fine. Same with Fang\u2019s feet, no foul foot odor. Being on her feet constantly left her sole extremely firm and well built, but still a degree of feminine softness that was oddly appealing. Hope began to appreciate all these little things, especially in the given circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes began to pass and the l\u2019Cie\u2019s mind wandered to other realizations. What was he going to do? He couldn\u2019t spend the rest of his life on Fang\u2019s sandal. He had to get his friend\u2019s attention. But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about then the pattern of footsteps stopped and Hope began to feel his position change. Gravity suddenly seemed to be pushing him towards Fang\u2019s foot and it felt as if her sandals were now vertical. Was she laying down? A moment later her foot was on its side, with just enough space for Hope to slide from his place beneath Fang\u2019s toe to the grassy plain below. The young man landed with a soft tap along the dirt, before him he saw the long form of Fang\u2019s body laying against the ground. She was trying to go to sleep. Actually, not even trying. In less than a minute soft snores could be heard coming from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimilar sounds came from the left, Hope turned to see a pair of familiar boots going at least a mile into the air. He gasped at them, \u201cLightning!\u201d Sure enough, beside her removed boots Lightning Farron was sleeping. Behind her was probably Vanille. This was their camp for the night. Hope praised his luck; he could get his friends attention with ease!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough that begged the question. Which friend to try gaining their attention? Vanille was too far away so he was left between Fang and Lightning. Being right beside Fang she seemed like the natural choice, but her general rough and casual disposition made Hope iffy. Lightning on the other hand may have been rough as well, but Hope felt a bit of a natural inclination towards her. She was rough but he and Lightning got along better than most did with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who to choose\u2026</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lightning may have been his preferred choice, but the fact was Fang was simply closer. At Hope\u2019s size that meant a lot. Before him was miles of woman, and for any chance of getting her attention he would have to be at least somewhat close to her face. Magic still left him wary so Hope had only one alternative: he began to walk. Beside him the sandaled feet of his friend tilted to lay on the ground, thankfully not landing on Hope again. Not one to push his luck though, Hope put an extra bit of speed in his step before Fang\u2019s toes somehow grabbed him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first moment since shrinking it was actually somewhat peaceful. No drama, no monsters, just Hope and his gigantic friends. To the side he saw Lightning completely still, ready to awaken at a moments notice but still asleep. Behind her there was a faint glimpse of Vanille turning over. Sazh and Snow were likely still out on guard duty like Hope was. And of course there was the giantess right next to the shrunken l\u2019Cie. Up close each movement Fang made caused Hope to jump slightly; he had to stay prepared lest he get crushed. All it would take is Fang to roll over and he would be done for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment Fang was just sleeping on her side, facing her shrunken companion. Aside from regular snores that got increasingly loud there wasn\u2019t much to take in. She looked like she always did but she was just\u2026<i>big</i>. It was odd to look at Fang\u2019s foot beside him and to be smaller than it. Even as he left that realm and approached her ankle Hope was still much smaller than it. Near the end of the road he saw the two cushiony mountains that were Fang\u2019s breasts, enticing as always and big enough that Hope found himself blushing at the mere sight. Catching the mammaries got the young man thinking about just how beautiful his companions were. He always knew this of course, but now that he was smaller it seemed to almost elevate to a greater scale. Hope could appreciate the little details that went by unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang radiated complete beauty, the ideal woman for sex appeal. With all the bare skin and impressive body features. Hope never tried to stare because, quite frankly she kind of scared him, but Fang was beautiful. Glancing back to her feet he saw they were shaped in what was essentially perfect, with toes not too fat or narrow and just the right length. Hope was by no means a foot guy, but it was just something small that went a long way. Much the same story with Fang\u2019s legs: up close it was clear they were completely devoid of any leg hair and were toned to the ideal level so that they were muscular, but not overly muscular. Thus far that was all he could completely see so he looked over to Lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like Fang Lighting also gave off the strong aura of a beautiful woman. The main difference however was Lightning was clad in less revealing attire. Sleeping on her right side though Hope found himself looking directly at her rear, which was shaped rather marvelously all things considered. Further down Hope glanced at her feet, seeing soles that were shaped perfectly. And for some reason something about Lightning\u2019s hair color seemed to radiate in the moonlight. She seemed almost\u2026godly, in both beauty and power. Hope shook these ideas off instantly, he respected Lightning too much to think of things like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left Vanille, who Hope couldn\u2019t actually see so moot point. But he did wonder a bit. Being one of the youngest alongside Hope Vanille had this odd relationship with him that almost seemed\u2026romantic at times. He wasn\u2019t sure of it himself but something about seeing a gigantic Vanille didn\u2019t seem all that bad to Hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Hope stopped his daydreaming to look to Fang; she was moving. Just at her thighs Hope looked nervous as the woman began to turn over and lay on her opposite side. Thankfully she rolled in the direction opposite of Hope. <i>Whew, that could\u2019ve been bad.</i> He sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis relief came too soon however. An uncomfortable grunt came from the sleeping giantess and her body instantly rolled back to how it was before, this time rolling the opposite direction: towards Hope. Hope had no time to react, overhead Fang\u2019s thigh was incoming and he couldn\u2019t jump away in time if he wanted to. The night sky was blotted out by a new tan sky that moved in closer and closer until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM!</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026It missed? Hope had his eyes clenched shut but after several moments he opened them. To his surprise he actually did avoid Fang\u2019s thigh. The woman rolled onto her stomach and Hope was just lucky enough to have been standing in a place between Fang\u2019s legs. He narrowly avoided them, but it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a bit close for comfort though; Fang was close enough that Hope felt the air warm up with her body heat. On either side of him was a high wall of tan skin that led up to her shorts and dress, both of which now in Hope\u2019s way if he wanted to keep going. Once again Hope found himself blushing as the first thing he saw was Fang\u2019s looming butt in his path. If he wanted to keep going, he would have to climb it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not perverted\u2026I have to do it.\u201d He told himself repeatedly before continuing his walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes the l\u2019Cie reached the base of Fang\u2019s shorts, just at the spot where the lower end of her crotch ended and her butt began to rise into the air. Redder than ever Hope forced himself to grip the woman\u2019s clothing and begin climbing, ignoring the idea that just underneath this clothing was the body of a woman. He wished he could just climb the dress but unfortunately it ended up on either side of Fang\u2019s legs. Regardless, Hope continued to climb up his friend\u2019s rear. At first it was hard but as it began to curve and grow more horizontal the climb slowly got easier. Once he got the top though Hope had to look away as he saw the two massive cheeks and their meeting point. He ran to try and get away before he kept staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he cleared climbing Fang\u2019s rear the walk got easy again, just walking on her back. It felt odd to Hope that each step was slightly squishy against his friend\u2019s back, but that was just something that came with the size. He\u2019d probably have to get used to all sorts of weird terrain like this. Luckily for Hope, weird terrain or no Fang didn\u2019t move again as he walked. Before long he was at her shoulders, looking down at Fang\u2019s sleeping face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman snored louder than ever up close, and quite frankly it scared Hope. The soft sounds came off like the roars of an immense beast. With each breath Fang made for the next snore Hope felt the suction all around him. If he wasn\u2019t careful he\u2019d end up with the air on that one. <i>Is this a good idea? </i>He looked to his other two friends; from his vantage point Hope could see Vanille. She was asleep and looked as happy as can be. Lightning still hadn\u2019t seemed to move either. He was closest to Fang though; there was no chickening out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping his hands around his mouth Hope called out, \u201cFang!\u201d Even as loud as he could shot it was nothing compared to Fang\u2019s snores. He took a step closer to her ear, \u201cFang!\u201d Still nothing, so he took yet another step and repeated. He didn\u2019t have much choice but to do this until something happened. Finally after several attempts, Hope\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hope struggled to stay upright on the weird terrain by Fang\u2019s face. As his first round of shouting ended in miserable failure, Hope decided that he would need to get to a batter vantage point before he could try again. Groaning, Hope began climbing up Fang\u2019s hair to get closer to her ear. As he struggled up the long, black strands, the young boy realized that Fang\u2019s snoring was blowing the hair back and forth as it swayed before her mouth. Hope gripped onto her hair tighter as he felt the sucking force of Fang\u2019s breathing tugging on his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFANG! Wake up already!\u201d Hope shouted as he drew closer and closer to the sleeping woman\u2019s ear. Hope\u2019s shouts were drowned out however as Fang snored loudly, shifting in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope grasped onto Fang\u2019s hair for dear life as he began swinging in front of her open mouth. Terrified, Hope desperately began struggling up the strand of hair he was on. As the hair began cutting into his skin, Hope found he was swinging against Fang\u2019s upper lip. A chill went down Hope\u2019s spine as he saw the vast cavern that was Fang\u2019s mouth before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFANG! I\u2019m serious here! Wake the hell up and help me out here!\u201d Hope said as he tried to scurry up the hair more, but to no avail. Fang stirred in her sleep, her mouth opened wide as she yawned deeply, pulling Hope inside her awaiting maw. As Hope hit her tongue, Fang sleepily pulled her hair from her mouth, leaving Hope trapped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFang groaned as she flipped over in her sleep, laying on her back with her mouth open once again as the giant woman started snoring once more. Hope meanwhile, was busy holding on for dear life on Fang\u2019s fangs. The young boy felt his hands beginning to slip as Fang\u2019s saliva coated tooth as she shifted in her sleep. Slowly, Hope felt gravity getting the better of him as he looked down into Fang\u2019s gaping throat. As Fang began snoring once again, Hope felt the rush of air pull him towards the dark cavern of Fang\u2019s throat with each booming breath. As hope felt the strength in his arms begin to fail him, he felt more and more like this was going to be the end. Just as Hope felt his fingers give out, and his plummet begin, Fang unknowingly saved him. The giant woman\u2019s tongue had slipped up; licking her parched lips in her sleep, and knocking Hope back up onto the top of her slippery, smooth teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope wasn\u2019t sure if he should be disgusted for having been covered in Fang\u2019s saliva, or grateful for not having fallen into her throat. As he got up and felt like he was 20lbs heavier thanks to her spit, Hope felt the prior more so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFang! Get me the hell out of here!\u201d Hope shouted up through the giant woman\u2019s open lips. As Hope continued to shout, he failed to notice that Fang had taken notice of him, but not how he had wanted. Annoyed, the giant woman snaked her tongue up to her teeth to get rid of a tiny object that was annoying her lips. She smiled to herself as she scooped up the tiny pest and spat it out of her mouth. Fang stretched out further and went back to sleep after slipping over once again onto her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFANG! GO DIE!\u201d Hope shouted as he was sent into the air from Fang\u2019s graceful shot. As he hit the top of his arc, Hope looked around to see all three of the lovely ladies he had been journeying with fast asleep, all of them unaware of his plight. As Hope began falling from the sky, he looked down and noticed that there was a problem\u2026he was headed for Fang\u2019s foot next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAreo!\u201d Hope shouted as he cast a wind spell to cushion his fall. The small burst of wind was enough to keep the fall from killing Hope, but as the blast changed his trajectory and knocked him into Fang\u2019s sandal, Hope begins to think that dying would have been better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hope slammed into the soft skin on Fang\u2019s heel, he felt the giant woman shift in response to his presence. Hope tried to get up, but he found himself struggling to stand on Fang\u2019s tanned heel. Grabbing his boomerang, Hope used it like a walking stick to keep himself from falling over. As Fang fidgeted in her sleep, Hope slid backwards and fell deep into her sandal, getting caught between Fang\u2019s heel and her insole. Hope\u2019s nose was quickly assaulted by the smell of Fang\u2019s foot. After the past few days of fighting, Hope knew none of them were exactly clean, but Fang was an outlier by far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hope felt that he was being crushed by her foot, he began beating on Fang\u2019s foot with his boomerang. The giant woman began moving around, crushing Hope even more. As the tiny boy felt like he was going to die, he decided that he needed to act quickly. Slamming his boomerang against Fang\u2019s heel, Hope\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Running around every which way, people trying to kill you all the time...it was why he valued Malon giving a place to relax. But what would piss Link off more than anything was his 'non-adventure time' being turned into a challenge for him. What made him furious was that his enemies most likely would figure that out. Link opened his eyes and found himself lying in the middle of some unknown forset. Link found that alarming. He'd been all over Hyrule and had never seen this place. Link turned when he noticed that he was standing in a shadow but the sky was still blue. He turned and Link swore like he was in a sailor convention. Standing right in front of him was Malon, BUT SHE WAS HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She turned to head into the barn to start milking the cows and Link paled, remembering she had been feeding the chickens earlier. He HAD to get Malon's attention!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It seemed like an impossible task, with each small step Malon was covering a good ten yards or so and Link running full speed barely covered eight if even that. Link's mind raced as he pondered what equipment could help him; the only thing that seemed like it could possibly work was using the Ocarina of Time to summon Epona but Link was small and Epona would be too big even if she came. All the shrunken hero could do was desperately chase after his dear friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase went on for a couple of minutes, Malon casually strolling into the Horse training area and a small green dot of a hero running along the grass. But right in the midst of the field, where no horses were Malon stopped and did the one thing she did best, she sang. To Link at his size the melody was absolutely amazing, like the voice of a gigantic angel singing from heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you old habits!\" Link grinned as he picked up speed with renewed vigor. With Malon standing still Link caught up in no time and stood before the toe area of Malon's boots. Now came the tricky part, how would Link grasp her attention. Making a mental list Link thought of what could and wouldn't work; Deku Nuts wouldn't last long enough, Lens of Truth was useless, Megaton Hammer...well if he wanted to piss Malon off that would be a way to go. His bow could possibly work but like the Megaton Hammer it could result in just pissing off Malon and something told Link an angry giant Cowgirl was not a smart thing to face. One by one he crossed off every thing he could do, soon Link's choices for action fell down to just two small things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne, he could play his Ocarina and hope that Malon would hear it. Or he could use the Longshot to reach the tip of Malon's boot and climb from there. Link thought for a moment and made his choice. Malon singing as loud as she was really killed the Ocarina idea so Link was left with one option, to climb his beautiful childhood friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushed slightly at the idea of climbing Malon, especially in her adult beauty but Link knew it had to be done. Sitting around would likely end in his death beneath Malon and everything else wouldn't work or make matters worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully Link pulled out and aimed the Longshot, mentally measuring just within its reach. If it could grasp the leather of Malon's boot as it did wood and other materials Link would be successfully propelled to just below the tip, right where it starts to rise. He had to act fast so pulling the trigger Link shot the Longshot; like he thought it collided with Malon's boot but would it work? At first it seemed like it wouldn't but no Link was right all along, the moment he let his guard down Link flew through the air fast as a bullet, screaming like a child again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the end of the Longshot's chain Link stood panting at his position on Malon's boot. \"Man I never get used to that.\" After removing his tool from Malon's boot Link stared up, his friend appearing like a living mountain as she swayed side to side in song. Quickly the boys face turned bright pink as he saw a sliver of red right between Malon's legs. Embarassed Link looked away from Malon's panties, \"Focus! I gotta climb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention to Malon's boot again Link started to climb, Malon's boots being and rough and worn as they were made it amazingly easy to climb. Every little scuff ad tear was a perfectly placed foot hold for Link. All the while he was amazed at his size, at the very least he had to be as big as Malon's thumb and well.....Malon was about fifty times bigger at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to his hero training Link reached the tip of Malon's boot in no time, but now came the hard part. Malon's boots were rough and easy to climb but her skin was silky smooth, unexpected of a farm girl and while normally attractive it made things diffilcult for climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly musty odor worked it's way into Link's nostrils, almost instantly he recoiled back. The scent reminded him of ancient ruins monsters had effectively turned into a foul hellhole but the source of the smell this time? The inner part of Malon's boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad I'm not in there\" Link chuckled as he figured it out. Reaching an arm up Link grabbed Malon's lower calf and rushed up a good ten feet. He only got that far because he rushed though, once he had to grab again the skin was too soft to support his entire body weight and he began to slide down....</span></div></div>",

With his back to the incoming ground Link got a good look all the way up Malon\u2019s dress, her muscular yet feminine legs\u2026those luscious thighs\u2026the dark red underwear she wore\u2026the sight was making Link happy in a way he didn\u2019t understand; maybe if he aged properly he would\u2019ve known but skipping seven years in time left him rather clueless. The lack of teenage perversion did have an advantage though, Link managed to keep his head clear and focus on the matter at hand, his death if he didn\u2019t save himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe already got a faint whiff of the inside of Malon\u2019s boots, he did <i>not </i>want to experience that at Ground Zero, nor get acquainted with the ground or Malon\u2019s boot treads. No matter where he could land Link would end up dying, be it the impact of falling, crushed inside Malon\u2019s boot, or simply getting crushed by the boot. Something had to be done in order to save himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a single split second Link ran through all his tools in his mind, seeing which would work. Most of them weren\u2019t even relevant to the situation; in fact, the only one that could possibly be of help would be the Longshot, but Malon\u2019s legs weren\u2019t like leather, it wouldn\u2019t likely latch on. That ruled out every single tool he considered, but Link\u2019s subconscious knew what to do. Link\u2019s hand found its way to the Master Sword, quickly unsheathing it; and like many times before, in order to save his life from plunging to his doom, Link stabbed the sword into the nearest surface possible, Malon\u2019s upper ankle. He didn\u2019t want to use it given it could hurt Malon, but Link\u2019s instincts basically forced him to do it. It worked wonderfully, Link slid a few feet to a stop, no longer falling. There was but one thing Link regretted about this\u2026the several feet of leg cut open by the Master Sword, blood started pouring out in gallons; although to Malon the cut was maybe an inch, the blood hardly any. Some of Malon\u2019s blood dripped down to Link, but he didn\u2019t even notice it in comparison to what happened moments earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cYEOW!!!\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Link stabbed Malon the giant cowgirl let out a deafening roar of pain, it couldn\u2019t have hurt that much, but the surprise was what caused the scream; Link instantly felt bad. But there was a silver lining, \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d Malon verbally questioned as she began to lean over to examine her wound. Surely she would see Link beside her cut and all would be well, he might have to pay for cutting Malon later but at least he\u2019d be found!...Right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even close, Malon sat down and, with her ankle on its side, investigated her cut. Her self diagnosis didn\u2019t do much to make Link happy, \u201cOw\u2026I must\u2019ve stepped by a sharp twig\u2026or maybe even a small shard of glass\u2026I better find it to make sure the horses don\u2019t get hurt\u2026\u201d Link stared sadly at his sword, the legendary Master Sword, a small twig? Not a proud moment, especially given Malon didn\u2019t notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Link\u2019s hopes raised back up when he saw it, Malon was looking right at him! \u201cWhat\u2019s that\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, waving with one arm while the other held his blade, yelled for Malon\u2019s attention, \u201cMalon!! Don\u2019t here! It\u2019s me\u2026Link! Fairy Boy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon\u2019s hand began to come towards Link, she heard him! Now she\u2019d pick him up and all would be well in Hyrule again\u2026wait\u2026that hand was coming awfully fast\u2026and it was open\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>SMACK!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon smacked her ankle with a bit of force, \u201cUgh, damn mosquitoes; drink my blood? Not on my watch, if you guys are around then the Cucco\u2019s get hurt too!\u201d It was sweet that Malon was looking out for Lon Lon\u2019s Cucco\u2019s\u2026but what about Link? Malon brought her open palm up to her face to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight in one of the wrinkle\u2019s of her hand was a slightly red, very light headed, Link. He had an almost comical expression, \u201cHey Malon\u2026I see Cucco\u2019s\u2026I didn\u2019t know they could fly\u2026\u201d He was literally seeing birds, but Link managed to recover a moment later. \u201cUgh\u2026Malon\u2026! I\u2019m right here! It\u2019s me Link, don\u2019t hurt me!\u201d He would\u2019ve waved his arms or something, but Malon\u2019s strong smack had left his puny form embedded into the wrinkle\u2019s of her palm, Link couldn\u2019t even move. And to fit into a wrinkle of the farm girl\u2019s hand\u2026Link\u2019s pride took another blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalon meanwhile, stared intently at her hand. The mosquito looked rather odd\u2026some sort of a mixture of red and green; Malon never saw anything like it, and for some reason she seemed to have a desire to examine it further\u2026the red could be her blood but that would mean the mosquito was green\u2026what kind of mosquito is green? Not any Malon knew of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink continued his pleas for help too, but his small, squeaky voice didn\u2019t even register point blank. He soon realized it was futile and took to struggling for the use of his limbs. Some red liquid got into his face, maybe his or Malon\u2019s blood\u2026he sort of hoped his because he didn\u2019t want to accidentally ingest any of Malon\u2019s blood, that would be a little weird\u2026and maybe taste funny. But it did end up making Link wonder how bad he looked. If Malon saw bright green she\u2019d have a better chance of recognizing the Hero, but if it was mixed in with a lot of red then there would be no way of telling. Link\u2019s first plan of action would be to free a hand and wipe the blood off, not just for his own comfort but it could help boost his odds of getting recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even a moment after the planned was formed did Malon say, \u201c\u2026Wait a second\u2026\u201d Link stopped his struggles.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a face slight disgust, Malon brought her hand to her shirt, about to rub the remains of the mosquito onto her work clothes. Another stain wouldn't be a bother. A solid wall of living fabric came up and sandwhiched Link between itself and Malon's hand. As the tiny green hero struggled to breath, his arms feebly trying to wedge himself free, he realized Malon had mushed him up against her chest. \"GA-AA-AH!!\"Link screamed at the embarressment of it all. After a few more seconds, the giant farm girl had stopped rubbing Link into her shirt, satisfied that the 'bug' was finally deceased. Of course, our tiny green hero wasn't, he was simpy paralyzed and embedded deep in the fabric of the clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink blanked out into a welcome darkness, allowing himself to rest from the trials before.\"A nap would be nice...\"He muttered under his breath. Beyond the veil of sleep, all he heard was rumbling and a lovely singing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time Link awoke, he was in a sea of fabric. Freeing himself from the fibers, he rose to his feet, looking about at his surroundings curiously. The forms of the landscape looked familiar. He was still in Malon's shirt, offin the distance some mountains that looked like boots, undergarments next to those...it appeared to be night, and he was in a pile of clothing that needed a good washing regarding the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to leave behind the pile, the tiny green dot guessing he had wound up inside Malon's home. The wooden floor acted as a terrain, the only path given for him to follow. An all too familiar rumbling was heard after an hour of walking, and out of nowhere a masive bare foot slammed down in front of him. High above, the still huge Malon, clad in her sleep wear, yawned and took a sip from a glass of water. Futile to the end, Link jumped up and down, cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting. He was still not heard, and the giantess was about to leave up. Before she raised her foot, Link latched on, gripping with all of his strength to the smooth skin, trying to hold on for life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Princess Ruto was most displeased. She was royalty, had a kingdom, and would one day rule over all the Zora, but she was also a woman that had waited a very long time for her husband. Link was her husband by her people\u2019s traditions and he should be there with her, doing what all Zora husbands were supposed to do. But he wasn\u2019t and Ruto was getting angry. She had accepted that he had to go on that silly quest to stop Ganondorf, but he had accomplished that years ago. Hyrule was safe, princess Zelda was safe, so why hadn\u2019t he come back to be her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in her room, Ruto looked at it with sad eyes. She\u2019d had a special room built that wasn\u2019t underwater and was especially private just for her to live with her husband. She had decorated it too with blue and green colours, their favourites. There wasn\u2019t much for Ruto to do with her father running the kingdom. She had no responsibilities, no ambitions, nothing other then the desire to see her husband again. It was in that moment of loneliness she decided that she had waited long enough. It was time for Link to fulfill his role as her husband, whether he was ready or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto started writing a letter to send to her husband that would lure him back. Ruto may have been a fish, but that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t know how to reel prey in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking quickly towards an above water citadel in the Zora kingdom, the Hero of Time Link\u2019s face remained impassive as he went to meet the Zora princess. He had gotten a letter this morning, warning him of a potential threat to Hyrule that only he could stop. The letter had been vague, but it said to speak to princess Ruto about the danger and to tell no one. Always the hero, Link went right away bringing his shield and sword just incase. He was a simple young man, believing in justice and protecting the innocent. He gave no second thought to coming to see princess Ruto, an old friend from childhood.  He just hoped she didn\u2019t bring up that whole marriage thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink noticed that there was no water in Ruto\u2019s home, which was odd for the aquatic race. Pulling out the letter, he read that she wanted to meet him in the top room to discuss something of the greatest importance. Always vigil for danger, he entered Ruto\u2019s room and for the first time in years saw his old friend sitting on her bed. She looked unchanged, same smooth blue skin, same cute face, and same sleek body. From what Link understood, she was quiet a beauty in the eyes of Zora males and sought after by many of them. He also knew from rumours that she refused them all, claiming she already had a husband and some day he would return to her. Link knew she meant him, much to his discontent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is good to see you Hero of Time. We have much to discus, sit beside me,\u201d Ruto said formally and gestured to the empty spot beside her. Link did as he was told silently, secretly grateful that Ruto was all business and not mentioning the marriage. Maybe he could get out of here without her asking him when he was going to settle down with her. Once he was seated next to her, he noticed she had a bowl cradled in her hands that blue liquid sloshed around in. He gave no second thought to the strange liquid, focusing on whatever danger was at hand and what Ruto had to tell him. He stared at her in her center eyes, unflinching as he waited for her to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBefore I tell you the danger, you must drink this special potion. It is crucial to your destiny.\u201d Ruto held out the bowl and Link took it without a second thought. She had said destiny and Link knew never to question that. He lifted the bowl up and took a gulp. The liquid tasted foul, but he had tasted far worse on his travels. The liquid went down smoothly and he drank every drop. Handing it back to Ruto, the princess remained serious a second more before grinning merrily. She explained with a giggle, \u201cThe great danger is me spending another day without my husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink grumbled, saying nothing else as usual, as it sank in that he had been tricked into coming. Never one to talk things over, Link started to rise, but tumbled to the ground. His body had suddenly gone numb all over. Lying on his back, he stared up at the ceiling and cursed inside his head for drinking that potion without asking any questions. Ruto stared at her husband lying on the floor and slowly rose to her feet. Walking around him, she admired her paralyzed hero and gleefully anticipated what was going to happen next to him. \u201cYou might be cute and brave, but you can sure be dumb too husband.\u201d She told him lightly, kneeling down at his side to take away his weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink watched helplessly as he was disarmed. It was humiliating for the great hero to be defeated so easily and he would have some strong words with Ruto once he got control of his body back. She tossed his sword and shield away like they were worthless, she was much more interested in her real prize. Link stared back at her angrily, but it bothered her none. Soon, petty things like anger and independence would be unimportant to the Hero of Time. He would belong to her forever and there was nothing he could do. She could see it had started. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuto\u2019s face seemed to be getting further and further away from Link by the second, which made no sense because they weren\u2019t moving. Feeling his clothes getting larger and his feet start to come out of his boots, he realized what was happening. Somehow he was shrinking. Ruto got further away, her body growing larger as her face disappeared seemingly hundreds of feet above Link. His clothes draped over him like a blanket, as he became only a few feet tall. Ruto kept smiling warmly, reaching down for Link\u2019s cap as it became too big to fit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoor hero, I wouldn\u2019t have to do this if you had just acted like a Zora and not run off. Now you\u2019re going to be my pet husband. It\u2019s so sad,\u201d Ruto said, not sound upset at all about what she was doing to him. Link\u2019s shirt became too big for him and he disappeared into it, saving him from looking at the happy face of the Zora responsible for doing this to him. He wasn\u2019t a foot tall by now and his shirt was getting heavier. Link wondered when this would end as he became smaller then a doll. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This young man journeyed all through Hyrule and even time itself to save the land with his fairy companion Navi and he succeeded so all was well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one truly recalled the events of it all except for a select group of people Link himself; because through journeying through time he did save Hyrule but when he returned to his normal time period the events of his victory had yet to actually happen, if they would indeed happen. Along with Link a group of people known as Sages remembered it all; and it was their duty to be sure Ganondorf would not rise again. Each Sage was at some point a good friend of Link, except for the Sage of Light. His childhood friend Saria, his sworn brother Darunga, supposed betrothed Ruto, friends Impa and Nabooru and lastly Zelda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of these people were at their homeland, living life and fulfilling their duties. Link didn't have anymore duties, with Hyrule safe he was done but there was one thing that troubled him. Navi perhaps his greatest friend had left at the end of their journey and with determination Link was preparing to search for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in front of Hyrule Castle, beside him was a reddish brown horse equipped with a saddle and before him were all of the Sages. This was a farewell meeting, there was no way to tell when or if Link would return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young hero stared at his trusted comrades, smiling weakly as he kicked a boot into the dirt. \"I guess....this is goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the Sages appeared sad or at the very least unhappy, \"Are you sure?\" Impa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink nodded once, \"Yeah, I have to find Navi. I just have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goron Darunga stepped forward and stared into Link's eyes, \"Are you sure brother? Is this what your heart tells you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Link nodded, \"Yes, with Ganondorf gone Hyrule will be safe. Especially with you guys around. I'm not needed and I feel like I have to go journey looking for Navi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be sure to bring back some treasure!\" Nabooru teased, tossing Link a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Link did was smile nostalgically as he began climbing atop his horse Epona. \"Link...\" A girl's voice whimpered, looking up Link saw it was Saria who had tears on the edges of her eyes. For a moment it appeared as if she would run towards Link but Ruto and Zelda held her back, each shaking their respective heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment Link hesitated, out of all the sages Saria was probably the one he was closest to but his resolve was sound and turning his horse around Link set out; behind him he could hear Saria crying and even Zelda giving a few small sniffles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sound haunted him for hours as he traveled, by the end of the day he had reached the edge of Hyrule. Come tommorow he would be away from his homeland but it was night and he needed to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's dreams weren't much better than his thoughts for the day, nothing but constant images and memories of Saria, each making Link feel even worse for leaving. His night was spent reveling in this nightmare. Unbeknownst to him in Link's sleep a familar face payed him a visit, but in his nightmares he didn't sense a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Link did something he hadn't done in ages, he slept in; but when he finally did awaken he was shocked by what he saw. It was all familiar, the wooden furniture and floors, the humidity, even the way the air smelled; he was inside a Kokiri hut, but there was one big issue. Unless Link was heavily mistaken this room was massive! Like the kind of room a giant the size of the Deku Tree would reside in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have got to be dreaming\" Link muttered, conking himself on the head a couple of times to see if it would help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove a familiar voice giggled and said, \"Sorry but you aren't the one dreaming. I am and the dream came true!\" Tracing the voice Link looked directly above him, above him was the typical Kokiri bed but more importantly Saria was on the bed staring right at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAwestruck by the sheer size of his friend Link muttered out pointless jibberish, he had fought ghosts, ghouls but nothing had ever prepared him for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling again the giant green haired girl spoke again, her thunderous voice echoing through Link's very being. \" I'm sure you wanna know what's going on. To keep it simple I didn't want you to leave, so I did something about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...why like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaria smirked, even sticking her tongue out teasingly. \"Cause you're so stubborn nothing else would've worked! But don't worry, now that you're like this we can be together even if only for a little while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously Link muttered something that in retrospect he probably shouldn't have. \"Doing what exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess lit up as if this were what she was waiting for \" How about....</span></div></div>",

Conparing his own stature to the rest of the room, he estimated he was around an inch tall. He realized it was impossible to climb the bedpost. This narrowed his choices down to the multiple chests on the floor. The chests were quite old, so he would be able to use the knotholes to climb in. However, the inside was well-polished, so once inside, he may be unable to escape. Inside, however, were stacks of bras and panties, meaning his fall would easily be broken. Looking across the room, he saw a pair of Saria's boots on the floor. He'd be able to blend into the dark green, but it'd be even harder to escape, or even get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only two minutes left, Link. Better get looking! Hee hee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled, Link decided he only had a moment left. He'd have to choose quickly. In a split second decision, running low on time, he sprinted towards...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a groan, Link opened his eyes. His head ached, and he looked around in confusion, trying to remember what just happened. He remembered sailing the Great Sea in search of the two pearls following Din's Pearl, which he had obtained on Dragon Roost Island, and encountering a strange cyclone unlike any he'd seen before. It was different than those used by Cyclos, and though it worried him, he still had decided to sail into it. And it apparently didn't end well, considering how he blacked out upon entering it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued looking around and examining his current location. Clearly, the cyclone had lifted him and his boat out of the ocean and dropped him somewhere on land, but where exactly? And come to think of it, the King of Red Lions was missing too... That was a bad sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut an even worse sign, as Link realized with a jolt, was that he had not just been transported... He had been shrunk too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finally recognized his current location as the ravine right before the entrance to Dragon Roost Cavern. He sat near the entrance of the ravine, amongst a cluster of bomb flowers, with a pool of lava between himself and the cavern itself. To the other side was a large pond. The cave itself was visible in the distance, set in the wall at the end of the ravine. He stood up, recognizing that the bomb flowers were way bigger than they should have been--in fact, they dwarfed him in size! He had shrunk to only a few inches tall, at his best estimate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink stood still, his hand on his chin as he glanced about and took in his current situation. Apparently that cyclone had both transported him and shrunk him down, and that was certainly not a good thing. Being at this size was dangerous, and with that in mind, he was determined to return to normal. But first, he had to figure out his next course of action. Crossing the lava was impossible at his size, and the edges of the pond were too high up to grab and pull himself up if he jumped into the water. For now, he was stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink paced around, wondering what to do... And began to hear flapping wings coming from the pond. Quickly, he ducked behind a bomb flower and peeked around the edge to see what was approaching. He was surprised to see a winged individual wearing a grey/blue dress flying over the pool. He recognized this individual as Medli, the stern yet kind Rito girl whom he had met and helped during his efforts to find Din's Pearl earlier. She flew over the pool, white feathers falling off every so often behind her, and landed at the pond's edge on Link's side, her scaly yellow bird like legs and feet touching down as her wings morphed into arms. She walked forward, focusing on the cave, and Link knew that she could possibly help him out. But, hesitantly, he also thought that she might end up hurting him, considering their significant size difference. Plus, he didn't know if she would even recognize him, or be kind to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, the question was... Should he reveal himself, or stay hidden behind a bomb flower and let Medli pass for now?</span></div></div>",

She was big enough to easily crush him, but he knew she was his only hope of escaping this place. So, he waited until Medli was just passing the cluster of bomb flowers, then he stepped out from behind the bomb flower and began to yell. The half-bird half-girl stopped in her tracks, looking around in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... That voice,\" she murmured. \"That sounds so familiar... Isn't that Link's voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink continued to shout, and at long last, Medli seemed to realize that the voice came from somewhere on the ground. She turned and looked towards the cluster of bomb flowers, and her big red eyes fell on the shrunken form of Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Rito looked at Link for a few moments before suddenly gasping, covering her mouth with a hand. Link simply waved at her, but did not move from his spot as the Rito girl stepped towards him, her talons clacking on the stone ground as she made her way over to him. Soon, she loomed over Link, and he stared up at this building sized girl in silent awe. She seemed so much bigger up close... and more frightening. When he interacted with her earlier, she seemed friendly enough, but considering that he was the size of a doll compared to her right now, he found it hard to not be scared of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gazing down at Link for a few moments, Medli crouched, her red eyes squinting as she examined him. Link remained silent and motionless, waiting to see how the Rito would react. He got his answer when she reached down towards him with a white-feathered arm. Link realized that Medli was about to grab him, but he still did not move, knowing that he had to be brave and trust the girl, as she was his only hope of escaping this place. So, he stayed motionless, allowing the hand to reach him. The fingers curled and tightly enclosed the tiny boy in a fist before lifting him off the ground and bringing him up to the face of the Rito girl. Her big red eyes examine him closely, and after a few moments, she spoke up at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you really are Link!\" she exclaimed, the mouth beneath her beak nose hanging open in shock. \"But... How did you shrink? What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink, resisting the urge to squirm in Medli's tight grasp, told her about the cyclone and how it shrunk him and sent him here.

After a few seconds of this she loosened her grip a bit and Link felt something running across his head, dimly he tried to look up and realized that she was petting him with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just so adorable like this Link, I can't let you go...and besides, it's way too dangerous out there for you now, but don't worry, i'll keep you safe.\" Medli said bringing Link closer to her face.

Link attempted to protest, to explain that he had to rescue his sister, but Medli just put her giant finger over his mouth after a few seconds of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Link, like I said, it's far too dangerous for you to be doing that, you need to stop worrying about all of the hero nonsense, you won't be doing anymore of it\" Said Medli, sounding as if she was scolding a young child, or even a pet. Link felt indignant and incredibly humiliated, he DID NOT have time for this and was prepared to take action...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Tetra's hurried steps against the floorboards came to a halt, it was already too late. The three goddesses had determined your fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pirate princess took her last movement forward, her toned knee shooting up into the air - along with your whole body. You could feel her sandals' worn leather rising behind your back, pushing against it. The only thing visible above was the bronze expanse of her foot's high arch. Soon, the rise of Tetra's leg reached its climax; you barely had a second to fill your lungs with salty sea air before your platform shot downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like the world was rapidly rising up around you. The only thing you could do was hold your green-clad arms out and scream - hoping that high above, your voice could slip into a valley of her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Earth-shaking THUD surrounded your body. The sole landed. Instantly, you felt the full weight of this behemoth pushing down on your twig-like body. How could a girl with such a fast running speed (that you just experienced firsthand) be exerting THIS much weight down? Even when she froze in front of her desk, the ship's slow rocking was disorienting. Back, and forth... Back, and forth... Your face soon turned as green as your tunic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... No, that doesn't match Zuko's maps at all! Unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the echo of her voice in the cabin around, and the distant sound of a quill touching paper, it sounded like she'd just found some clue that could lead to treasure. And now, she was counter-checking them against existing notes. With her body finally still, you tried squirming out from the mighty weight above. With the sandals leaving Tetra's feet open, you'd just have to move aside, and you'd be free on the ground again. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality crashed down on you like a smelly anvil. Throwing herself more into note-taking, she leaned forward. The ball of her foot pressed hard against your face, engulfing it in her flesh. You called out again, only to have a drop of salty water forced down your mouth. For just a split second, your tongue could feel the individual whorls and ridges forming the texture of her sole, like complex runes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, pushing back was hopeless; your gigantic captain stood firm, unmoving. The simple pull of gravity rendered you unable to move your little arms. You could only hopelessly flail your legs around, hoping she'd feel your tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery attempt at breathing, with the pirate's skin smothering you, only had your nose fill with... How to describe it? Seawater wasn't adequate for cleaning clothes or bathing, and their crew went long periods with limited freshwater. The clash of odors generated from earlier quests, as a result, had little to clean it away - save the thin strand of your saliva from before. It was putrid, and yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know this smell. As disgusting as the situation is, being with Tetra as long as you have means you've picked up faint whiffs of it before. As your lack of air forces you to breathe in again, you can almost pinpoint the exact moments that contributed to this musk. Like the time you two were on shore, looking for treasure - all you managed to get was a fairy in a jar. You were starting to feel sorry for that fairy now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, when you're facing Northeast - THAT explains it.\" The voice above, all at once, pulled you back to your senses and makes the memories feel more vivid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the walls of an ancient dungeon moving, you felt her pressure on your body release slightly. For a split second, she forced down even harder, coming horrifically close to squashing your insignificant body into her leather sandal. Then, you felt her body fly upwards, and - THUD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, that wasn't her titanic foot landing this time; you didn't know how much more punishment your body can take. There was a ringing in your ear, like a warning alarm. It seemed Tetra plopped her globe-like rear end on a chair. The impact sent a vibration through your body, shaking it to the core. But at the very least, The Hero of Winds no longer had to carry the weight of an massive girl on his shrunken shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou used the opportunity to call up. This left you with another mouthful of Tetra's salty skin. Spitting out, you rolled to the side slightly, shouting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, the motion froze. Did the colossal captain hear you? Did she feel your little body wiggling below? Suddenly, you felt your worn platform shift at a sharp angle. You slid past the ball of her foot; you glanced back to see her heel lifting; finally, her toes stop you, the middle one pinching your body against a perfectly-matching indent in the leather below. It slips over your torso slowly, as if trying to identify you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The young woman mumbled above. You kept your ears up and hold your breath, hoping she might have noticed you. The words thundered: \"How the heck did a pebble get down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pebble. That's what you were now. Your hopes sank to the undersea ruins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTetra's toes began moving slowly, pushing against your body. You can feel the folds in them curling and uncurling they squeeze your body into the smelly ball of her sole. Crap - was she playing with her footwear? Her ankle gradually, almost teasingly, shifted upwards. It pulled back out of the sandal, the slender digits dragging you along for the ride. Your body rolled against the brown landscape, alternating between facefulls of smelly, moist indents, and the tanned sole that shaped them. How long had she been wearing these?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot pushed back in. This time, the ball just rubbed against you, without pulling forward. The sigh you hear above would be gentle and sweet, were it not so loud. You barely have any time to react before her heel crashed down, knocking the wind from your body. It's all you can taste, smell, touch, or see. And she's still moving her foot - quite literally rubbing it in your face. All your attempts at motion are losing their vigor in the warm embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbrace? Yes, that word was the first to pop in your cranium. There was something undeniably intimate about the bare skin surrounding you, giving a close-up view of each individual wrinkle and fold moving in uneven waves. Your body started heating up, and it was hard to tell how much of that is from the pirate's own body temperature. It was breathtaking - and not just in the sense that you had more and more trouble breathing every second underfoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Tetra's idle fidgeting brush your hair back. Slowly, her leg lifted again. Your shrunken arms hurt too much to move - and both your ringing ears and intense heat are twisting your mind. But for once - and maybe for the last time - you could see the mountainous figure of your tormentor in full. The blonde swirl in her hair like unreachable clouds; the red bandana bobbing slightly as her back leaned forward; the little twinkle in her beautiful, deep eyes as they follow the motions her pillar-like arms make while jotting notes on a paper...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you paused on your own thoughts. Beautiful? That didn't do it justice. When those bronze toes wiggled above you like meteors waiting to crash... When you find yourself dazzled by the sheer scale of each limb, and ease with which they move...and she can't even bother to peek down at the green \"pebble\"... At this moment, Tetra inspires more fear in your heart than the three goddesses, or the beast that brought Hyrule to its knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, the slight, graceful flick in her gigantic wrist as she wrote... It might be your mind slowly failing, but there was something more there. She was sliding her foot back in - no, now the tip of her large toe was just slightly touching your nose, twirling around softly. Staring into the whorl as it paws you around was almost hypnotic, especially with the short hums that let loose from her lips above. They're slender, but not lanky; the arch rests high, the curves in her sole above like hills and valleys. And without the impossible pressure it once exerted on you, they felt soft, supple. Dainty. No matter how long she's worn these sandals, no matter how effective pirates' hygiene could be, and no matter how much the seas had trained and shaped Tetra's body... This foot belonged to a princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the boulder of a digit wrapped around you, compressing your body in the tight space between her toes and her foot's ball. This was where the odor was at its strongest - once again, this girl was all you could experience. Memories keep floating in your head, different faces showing up. Aryll. You feel your body lift from the ground, as your captain moves it to scratch an itch on her other foot. Grandma. The grinding motion scrapes you harshly against both surfaces, and even though you feel something tearing, you've lost the energy to scream. Tingle... Would he ever find those fairies?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe motion and pain were so intense, it felt like her simple motions were causing a second apocalypse. But somehow, the touch feels... It's like you're drifting deeper into another world with every twitch and breath, and it's not unpleasant. Somehow, you had a feeling you'd die in this pirate girl's service... You just didn't expect said service would be acting as her... massage bead... foot toy... pebble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFamiliar. That's how it felt. Seconds before falling to the welcoming void... right before your consciousness blew out like stray dust... that was your final thought: it's familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HYAH!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour spine shot up as you began panting. The floor under your rear end was hard, sturdy. There wasn't any pressure on you. A dream? No, that was impossible - you could still see the cabin's walls stretching out miles into the distance. Your green tunic was damp, and smelt of... well, Tetra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fluttering sound crossed your ears. When you gazed up, a fairy waved to you before flying away. The one you caught not long ago! She must've restored you to full health, just after Tetra killed you! Without a word, she disappeared; leaving your shrunken body standing...</span></div></div>",

Too much rumbling and shaking, for some odd reason, had kept you in a half awake daze all night. As you rubbed the grogginess from your eyes, you opened them to find that you weren't in your room anyway. The floor was still solid, but it felt somewhat sweaty and foam-like. The air was persistantly muggy and smelled of feet. You seemed to be in a canyon, two walls, rising to an unknown height, were on either side of you. They were colored of an odd, peachy skin tone, and wrinkles which you could fit in were in vast multitudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I?\"Who ask yourself, puzzled. The night before, all you had done was play a few Dead or Alive games on the consoles you owned. Besides that and chowing down on some snacks, nothing. A blank came to mind as what happened in your sleep. An earthquake out of nowhere rocked you from your sitting position to flying through the air, landing on your back with a heavy thud. The entire world seemed to be moving in sequence with the earthquake. Up and down, as if walking. You stumble back up to your feet, steadying yourself in the rocking and swaying landscape. You approach one of the canyon walls, gripping onto it for dear life. Surprised you were when it felt just like skin, soft and smooth. You rubbed your hands up and down it, perplexed. The earthquakes stopped, but a deafening, roaring noise came afterwards. Oblivious to this connection, you continued to somewhat massage the wall. The noise began to sound like laughter, but magnified to god like proportions.\"Stop it! That tickles!!\"A female voice thundered along with the giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?!\"You immedietly stop rubbing, looking around for the source of the voice.\"Me, Ayane.\"The female voice replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayane....Ayane....\"You've heard that name before. A character from the Dead or Alive videogame. She was your favorite female character.\"Where are you? I can't see you!!\"You shout, still vainly searching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's because I'm too big for you to see me! You are just a tiny speck between my toes,\"The unknown voice of Ayane said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\"You look up, the reality of the situation finally settling in. Ayane, in her shinobi outfit, towered above you, her legs monolithic pillars that made skyscrapers seem run-of-the-mill. Her face could scarcely be seen past her titanic breasts, which were considered one of the biggest pair in the series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found you on my travels...by accident.\"Ayane explains.\"I stumbled down a hill, and found you, all defenseless and tiny, curdled up in a sleeping position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't just leave you there to be squashed or eaten, so I put you safely on my sandal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blushed at the kindness.\"Thank you...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was dark, a room with little to no lighting in it; in the center sat a spiky figure huffing. His eyes were filled with pain, his eyes red as the streaks that designed along his black body. Around him were bodies, bodies of other beings like him, his friends; Rouge, Omega, Knuckles, Amy, and even Sonic. They all bore deep wounds, impalements really. Only Shadow was unharmed, but his friends were all dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...couldn't save anyone...again.\" He muttered with a tear sliding down his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow opened his eyes to a gloved hand smacking him on the forehead, eyes filled with surprise. The gloved hand retracted after its blow, going back to the side of who had it, Rouge the Bat. Typical of her Rouge was in her outfit which seemed to be a black jumpsuit with a heart design for her nice cleavage, and a pair of white boots and gloves to match. One would never guess that she's a world class thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" The hedgehog muttered, his head throbbing slightly from Rouge's smack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe batgirl shook her head with a sigh, \"You were moaning in your sleep hun. Must've been having a heck of a nightmare. Had to make sure you were okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow's eyes narrowed, he didn't recall falling asleep, or even where he was. Looking around he seemed to be in the middle of the woods, a campfire weakly shining before him and Rouge. \" Where...are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning loudly again Rouge smacked Shadow on the head, \"Man that was some nightmare. You don't remember GUN's mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN\" A robotic, inhuman voice rang out loudly. From behind Shadow and some trees came another of Shadow's dearest friends, Omega the robot. Omega was a bit of a pyschopath but he was none the less a strong friend and a trusting ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog remained silent, gesturing for Omega to continue. The robot took another step forward, his electronic eyes seemed focused on the camp fire. \" GUN ASSIGNED ROUGE,SHADOW, AND MYSELF TO INVESTIGATE A MYSTERIOUS ANOMALY IN THE DESIGNATED AREA. BELIEVED TO BE CONNECTED TO DR. EGGMAN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaping up next to Omega Rouge conked him on the head, \"You idiot! Keep it down! Turn down the volume or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEGATIVE, AND YOUR NOISE OUTPUT LEVELS ARE HIGHER THAN MY OWN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGritting her teeth Rouge appeared as if she was about to leap at Omega but Shadow brought forth a gloved hand and held her back. \"Tell me Omega. Do we have any information regarding this anomaly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine was silent for a moment, \" ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS THAT IT INVOLVES HIGH LEVELS OF ENERGY. ALSO A RECENT STREAM OF DISAPPEARANCES ARE BELIEVED TO BE LINKED. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEGATIVE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow sighed, \" So we're studying a mystery basically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully smiling Rouge winked at Shadow \" Yeah but no worries. We're bound to find some nice jewels! Or if we find the missing people we get rewards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the others seemed to roll their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ERROR\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge fumed, \"Not nice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether the trio laughed, even Omega although his seemed more...forced; robots weren't exactly programmed to laugh. With this enjoyable time they relaxed, for it was getting late and tommorow things were going to probably be rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before everyone was resting, Omega turning on \"Sleep mode\", Rouge sleeping in an extravagant and overall uneeded tent, and Shadow leaning against a tree lost in his own nightmares again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dreams were hazy, nothing like they were before; it was nothing but a blurr that Shadow barely acknowledged. What his focus was on was that despite being asleep, something seemed horribly amiss. Shadow shrugged it off though, or at least in his sleep filled state he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed but through sleep it felt like moments, Shadow opened his eyes weakly, quickly widening them to their fullest. The area all around him...it was unreal...gigantic, the world around him was over a thousand times bigger than before! Somehow, someway he must've shrunken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was amazing, Shadow was at....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shadow recognized his surroundings after a few seconds of staring at the giant surroundings. He\u2019d been here several times before, when he wasn\u2019t tiny. Pink wallpaper, with pink curtains and pink carpet decorated the room. Pictures of a smiling blue hedgehog were hanging all around. Some with had him all alone and several were with him standing with a pink hedgehog. This was the home of Amy Rose, Sonic\u2019s girlfriend and usual damsel in distress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had invited him in several times, but he never stayed long. He found that when he was in her home he always felt very uncomfortable. Amy had a warm and inviting home, which made Shadow uncomfortable. He was used the dirty depressing places that matched his mood, not the happy little home of Ms. Rose. However, right now he\u2019d love to be feeling that uncomfortable sensation. Amy\u2019s giant house was giving him the creeps as he didn\u2019t know how he got there or why he was so small. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe this is a dream,\u201d he mumbled to himself as he walked around. The carpet fibers reached over his head, making it only possible for him to stare far above him. He could see towering tables and walls that seemed to go up for thousands of miles. He had no idea how small he was, but he\u2019d guess he was about as tall as an ant. It was so insane to wake up the size of an ant that Shadow was convinced that he had to be dreaming. He reached over to pinch his furry arm, when a sudden earthquake followed by a loud boom drew his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around desperately for where the sound was coming from, he saw something huge moving miles away from him. The earthquakes became stronger and the booming louder. Shadow backed away, terrified about what could possible be huge enough to make such a noise. Imaging some giant monster, Shadow nearly collapsed as Amy Rose, seemingly hundreds of miles high enter the room. He had been wrong. He wasn\u2019t the size of an ant, he was much, much smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city sized girl walked slowly into the room, but to Shadow it seemed like she was traveling miles every time she took a step. She was walking right towards him, he could see the bottom of her red sneakers lifting up and stomping back down on the rug. Running as fast as hover skates would let him, Shadow tried to find safety, but he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off Amy. The cute pink hedgehog looked absolutely terrifying at her size, like a whole mountain walking towards him. Shadow knew this couldn\u2019t be a nightmare. His guilt-induced dreams could never come up with the thought of this titanic girl looming over him. He was running as fast as he could, a speed that would normally match mach-5 speeds. But the carpet was slowing him down and even if he was running on a flat surface, he was only going a foot a minute, not a speed that could match the leisurely walking girl behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head back to what was in front of him and not the approaching mega-giantess behind him, Shadow saw his salivation. There was a couch only a few miles away from him. Anyone normal would never make it, but Shadow was far from normal. Depressed, but not suicidal, Shadow ran as fast as his furry legs would go. Every second mattered as Amy got so close that Shadow was running under the shade of her short red dress. Looking behind his back, he saw her giant feet lifting up again and coming down where he had been standing a second ago. The carpet was flattened under the treads of her sneakers and Shadow knew he\u2019d be finished if he was under those massive feet. Sweat running down his face, he leapt forward, arms outstretched for space under the couch. He disappeared into the safety under the couch just as Amy\u2019s foot came down. Lying in the darkness, he lay only a few feet from the giant shoe. He watched it lift up again, bits of dirty and dust dropping from the bottom as Amy moved. That had been close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRelaxing, he watched as Amy continued moving. All he could see were her feet as they stomped down onto the ground. Above him, he heard a screech of steel coils as Amy sat down on the couch. He heard her voice, booming loud, yet still sounding sweet. \u201cWhat a day I\u2019ve had. I slept in, missed breakfast and Sonic hasn\u2019t called me yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think your day was bad? What about mine?\u201d Shadow grumbled, wondering what he had done to deserve this fate. Oh, that\u2019s right. He failed to save Maria.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could go into another fit of remorse, Shadow focused himself in the dangerous situation he was in. He had someone been shrunken and ended up in Amy Rose\u2019s house of all places. Staying under her couch wasn\u2019t going to help him, he\u2019d end up getting crushed under a dust bunny or eaten by a bug the size of small house. Walking over to the edge of the couch, he stared at the tall red wall of rubber that was Amy\u2019s shoe. She was the only one that could help him, but how could she get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow wasn\u2019t just fast and strong, he also had a genius intellect. He wasn\u2019t called the Ultimate Life Form because he could outrun a cheetah. But even his mind could come up with no way to contact the oblivious giantess without putting him in immediate danger. He needed to get closer to her face and the best way to do that was to travel up either her feet or the couch. It would be easier to get onto her shoe and wait for a chance to get her attention, but it was safer if not slower to climb up the couch. Knowing that he had to do something, Shadow decided, only hoping that luck was on his side for once.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Beneath Amy's mountainous couch Shadow made his choice. It wasn't a particularly hard choice to make really, Shadow needed to be found ASAP and Amy would likely move after a while so he had to hustle. So using the fast route and climbing up Amy starting from her boot was easily the best thing to do. There was an increased risk but nothing in this life came free, at least that was what Shadow told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wasting even a milisecond of time Shadow vanished in a puff of smoke, his slender black and red frame little more than a blur to nearby bugs and anything around his height. The giant pink hedgehog didn't see a thing, her head was tilted back as she seemed to focus on the clear blue sky; no doubt thinking of Sonic. After about thirty seconds Shadow found himself right before the tip of Amy's boot, its gigantic size unbelievable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow was literally the size of a speck of dirt compared to the vast rubber tower, heck even the rubber treads of it rose over a dozen times his height! Every little bone in Shadow's body seemed to reconsider, his base survival instincts roaring at him to turn around and run, but Shadow effortlessly fought the feeling and placed a gloved hand on Amy's boot. It's surface was smooth like glass with no holes or notches to grab onto, climbing it was going to be no easy feat but then again nothing Shadow ever did was easy. At least... it wouldn't have been easy for someone like Sonic who actually ran but Shadow had a slight advantage in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising a foot the black hedgehog placed her sneaker on the massive boot, activating its jets. His leg no longer felt like it was raised, instead it felt like he was standing on solid ground on both feet. Smirking slightly Shadow placed his other foot on the boot, while he first one was still midair! Like the first the other foot's jets roared to life, now Shadow was literally standing sideways!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really like these Skates\" Shadow chuckled to himself, his body bending over like he was about to sprint. Focused solely on running Shadow took off with a sonic boom, his black body again naught but a blurr as his speck sized self ran along Amy's boot. The black hedgehog was amazingly fast but his size heavily hindered the distance he traveled. At the speed Shadow traveled he would probably cover six to nine inches per minute which while amazing for his size still provided a huge danger in itself. Amy was about four to five feet tall, meaning Shadow would take about seven minutes at least to reach her ear; a lot could happen in seven minutes. All Amy would have to do is a slight act, kick her feet, get up, even sneeze and Shadow could easily die or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow knew all of this before he even started, to any other person it would have likely made them reconsider but for Shadow it only fueled his determination. Like a bolt of black lightning he thundered his way across Amy's massive foot. It had only been a few seconds and already he cleared the rubber treads that easily dwarfed him, now he was running along the red which while progress also meant now he stood out on Amy's boot, should she see him Amy would likely treat him like a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face held the same apathetic expression it usually had but on the inside Shadow was in complete awe. He, one of the strongest and probably most feared beings on the planet was naught but a speck of dirt on Amy's boot. In a fight with an ant, he might actually lose. It was tough to absorb this newfound weakness, but Amy seemed to make coping easier. She was a cute girl to be sure but Shadow always found her kind of annoying, deep down he truly respected Amy though; for her likeness to Maria if anything. But at this size....that cute appearance had manifested as total beauty and a god-like sensation. Everything about the giantess was magnified, her pure eyes, pretty features, even her....assets. To an extent Shadow enjoyed the sight, not that he would ever show such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...WHERE IS SONIC?!\" Amy shouted, her voice actually bringing a level of pain to Shadow. For a moment Shadow was nervous, Amy almost seemed to prepare to move which luckily she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta hurry.\" Shadow thought aloud, trying to go even faster. It had now been a couple of minutes and Shadow was nearing the opening of Amy's boot and the beginning of his run up her leg. Amy....</span></div></div>",

Not the Faker's sister! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow felt like ripping his quills out, if Sonia found him like this...the ultimate lifeform shuttered. It wasn't that he minded Sonia...she was actually pleasant company, but it was like there were two Amys with how much she liked him. It didn't help that she had a second brother, a street-wise green hedgehog named Manic. He was just as annoying as Sonic AND twice as loud if it came to the idea of Sonia dating. Seeing as he considered Shadow \"The God of Brooding who wouldn't stop ranting about being the ultimate lifeform and Maria\" he was especially irritating about her social life in the regard to who'd she'd like to date...thing was, Shadow and Sonia hadn't even dated one time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hopped to her feet, causing Shadow to slid down her leg and he grabbed the opening of herr boot. He struggled to hang on as Amy walked over to the phone and called Sonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sonia, its Amy (pause) Yes, its good to hear from you too (pause) Well the thing is, I was wondering if you could come over, we haven't been able to hang out in a while (pause) You can?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was almost too easy, with his ungodly level of speed Shadow was making great progress on the Giantess Amy's boot. Already he was nearing the tip and at best it had been two minutes since his take off, and thankfully Amy still hadn't done a thing other than occasionally moan about Sonic. Inches away from the boot's opening Shadow couldn't help but sneer, \"Too easy.\" With a quick acrobatic leap Shadow had leapt away from the Amy's skyscraper sized feet and landed on the pink fur of her thin leg. For an instant Shadow had a sudden worry, would the jets on his shoes cause some sort of ignition? Shadow climbed a lot of things, furry giantess friend was not one of them; this was a whole new experience and there was no telling what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moments hesitation almost caused the hedgehog to fall, but in the last instant Shadow damned the risk and forced his body to land. It was a bitter sweet moment when he landed. Sweet because he hadn't harmed Amy in the least and could safely proceed. Bitter because it crossed Shadow's mind that he was probably <i> too small </i> to actually ignite; not the proudest moment of his life. But this was not the time for pride, later when he's normal he would dwell on the fact that even for a small amount of time Amy was basically a god to him. His fate was in her hands....or currently legs given the situation. Oh boy did Shadow think that too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yawn escaped Amy as her whole body stretched, \"So BORED! I can't believe Sonic stood me up again!\" She had specifically told Sonic to come at three P.M sharp! What was taking him so long?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's legs stretching was a...unique challenge if ever there was on. The sudden movement of hundreds of muscle layers made the entire footing of Amy's leg unstabe and even with his skates Shadow had a rough time keeping his balance. It was only a mixture of pure skill and luck that Shadow didn't plummet to God knows where. He took a look over his shoulder to see what could have been...the possibilites were unfortunate. The floor, sent across the room, collision back against the boot, falling <i> IN </i> the boot was the worst and sadly most likely to occur. But thankfully Shadow was safe, he would climb an-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nyeeeh!!! SONIC WHERE ARE YOU!!\" Amy flailed her limbs around in frustration, \"I specifically said three! When I see that hedgehog I'll hug him til it hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the worst possible thing Amy could have done to Shadow at that moment. If merely stretching nearly made him fall then her childish flailing definitely sent Shadow flying away. And where he went...Shadow cursed every sort of God known to man for allowing it to happen. With nothing to grab on to Shadow fell into the small opening of Amy's mountainous boot. Dammit all if he didn't try to stop it though. Ever level headed Shadow placed a gloved hand on the rim of Amy's boot, hanging on as if it were a cliff and the interior was the chasm of death; and it might have worked too, if Amy's flailing had stopped. The giantess' ankle slammed against Shadow and in a moment of dazed pain, he released his grip on the boot and fell further. It wasn't a pleasant journey either, the chasm of death Shadow imagined moments ago might have been preferable actually; at least with the chasm there weren't surfaces Shadow would collide against. In Amy's boot...there was one big surface and it both embarassed and disgusted Shadow to no end to land on it; Amy's bare foot. The first landing sent Shadow face first into the top of Amy's foot, and with a gasp of pain Shadow literally had a chunk of foot in his mouth, naturally he spat it out in a milisecond. This would have normally been the end of the journey but oh no, Amy was still flailing around and whining, so Shadow was airborne once more. He felt like he could actually fly too, from the sheer power of Amy's foot jerking around; but that only lasted about a second before Shadow made contact with the interior of Amy's boot, not a soft impact either. Then another jolt sent Shadow flying downwards again, once again making contact with Amy's foot, this time only further down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd again the process repeated, Shadow bouncing against the boot, and a lower part of the foot. And as unimaginable as it was things were getting worse. The further down he went, the more sweat seemed to populate Amy's feet; and with his gasps of pain Shadow occasionally swallowed it. The smell too....Shadow had never once experienced the smell of feet, but with modern media he had a natural impression of a bad smell. This was the worst possible way to introduce him to it. It was strong enough to water even his stoic pain-filled eyes. The source was fairly obvious given it got worse as he got lower, Amy's gigantic toes which were over twenty times Shadow's height. And still Shadow headed towards them Fate was kind though, Shadow stopped by landing on Amy's big toe nail; he child-like tantrum appeared to finally be over. Shadow was so happy he would have kissed Amy's toe nail if his lips hadn't already experienced more than enough feet for a life time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, this was no time for rest. Amy's tantrum just further proved the point of the power she wielded over him, if she decided to start walking Shadow would find a new definition for the term hell. Still woozy Shadow punched the nail, not much but better than nothing; just the best he had at this moment. A couple seconds of rest and he would hit again, <i> MUCH </i> harder. But Shadow didn't have that chance.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m gonna find that man and give him a piece of this girl\u2019s mind!\u201d Sounded like a mad lover normally; but to Shadow she might as well have signed his death waver.  In the simplest of motions Amy rose off her couch and stood up; and yet it literally rocked Shadow\u2019s world. The various contractions of every muscle in Amy\u2019s body allowed her to move, and while usually unimportant; to Shadow it just made hell a little bit worse. The muscle holding Amy\u2019s foot still reacted to the body rising, or in simpler terms, her foot moved to accommodate her body. If Shadow had something to hold on to the motion would have had no effect, but Amy\u2019s toe nail was as smooth as can be; without anything to help him out Shadow was soon knocked into the smelly air once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe only flew an inch or so, but it felt like damn near a mile before Shadow smacked against the top of Amy\u2019s boot. The disgruntled feeling of slamming against worn, sweaty leather was not something Shadow wanted to repeat; but he\u2019d have to get used to it if Amy followed through what she meant. Another motion on Amy\u2019s part caused Shadow to fall, and to his dismay it wasn\u2019t the toe nail he landed back on. It was the insole of the boot, specifically between Amy\u2019s toes. The absorbed sweat reduced the impact but it didn\u2019t stop the breath from getting knocked out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother movement by Amy; maybe her foot going back down, whatever it was it seemed to tilt Shadow\u2019s world to the side. To the hedgehog\u2019s dismay he could feel his body sliding towards the rest of Amy\u2019s toes, not if he had anything to say about it. Stubbornly Shadow clawed at the insole, gripping some loose leather and holding on for dear life. But it wasn\u2019t helping, Shadow\u2019s gloves and the sweat the insole held were not working well together, his grip was slipping. \u201cDammit all to hell!\u201d Shadow cursed, swallowing his pride and biting Amy\u2019s insole. If his hands wouldn\u2019t be enough then he\u2019d use his mouth! No matter what foul fluids slid down his throat, no matter how humiliating it was. And boy was it humiliating; Shadow was struggling for his life in the boot of a girl not even half his age, and she wasn\u2019t even out of her home yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow\u2019s struggles soon proved futile, his will was certainly strong enough; but against Amy and her boot it simply wasn\u2019t working. He was getting defeated by a boot of all things! His hands began to fail him, and soon lost their grip; he was now literally hanging by his teeth. It was not looking well for that either, Shadow did not count on foot sweat soaked leather to taste so\u2026so bad. He had forced down some disgusting gunk before but Shadow had never experienced something like this! Even with all his will his teeth were starting to loosen their grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it mattered; Shadow\u2019s struggles were doomed from the beginning. Amy rose her foot again, and in the moment her foot readjusted itself. Maybe a centimeter to her, totally unimportant, but to Shadow\u2026it was enough for her big toe to loom over him. In that one instant, in the darkness Shadow looked up at the pink toe of the hedgehog, and he lost his teeth\u2019s grip in a rare moment of fear. He could see his fate beneath that foot. Literally dying like a bug, a red splatter against pink fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next second came and Shadow had already wished his struggles moments before never ended, Amy\u2019s toe held the weight of several cities, all of it focused on one, miniscule, black speck. Hundreds of miles away the loud sound of metallic clinking caught Shadow\u2019s attention, seemed like keys. Shadow never saw Amy drive but he prayed that\u2019s what the keys were for. A couple foot steps later Shadow felt his bones beginning to crack from the pressure, as well as his eyes beginning to sting from the sweat seeping into them. Would this really be his end? Beneath the toe of Amy Rose? Doomed never to even be found? It was depressing, and more importantly, beyond degrading. He could feel his pride dwindling, at this rate he started wishing he chose to live his life like a bug. Compared to this fate it seemed...pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while Shadow had his plight, Amy was humming a soft tune to herself, a tune that seemed to mock the speck at her toes. With her keys Amy opened her door, and sealed it on the other side. Turning to the bright world around her Amy let out a content sigh, \"Ahh...what a nice day!...Little hot though. Ah well, I'll get used to it.\" That slight heat, unknown to Amy, was making her feet start to make<i> fresh </i>sweat...and Shadow did not like how it felt. Amy looked around her, a slight breeze, people going about their daily lives, it was nice to see. But she had to focus! There was a certain blue hedgehog who was gonna get a piece of her mind! But where to look? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The black hedgehog briefly looked over his options; climb Amy's gigantic boot or climb her couch then her. Either way it was going to be extremely risky, possibly even more so than any of Shadow's previous battles. The slightest movement, a wiggle of the foot, a sneeze, even just shuffling around slightly could easily end up with Shadow getting crushed under what was possibly the weight of an entire city. Shadow grunted in annoyance as he let himself fall to the floor, eyes closed as he thought intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe overlooked the possible outcomes of each option, obviously the positive one was getting found and returning to normal, the negatives however were far worse than that. There was a chance Amy would sit on him, a chance Shadow would fall into her boot, a chance she would actually keep him as a pet of some sorts and maybe even torture him! In this bleak situation his two choices had pretty much one positive and roughly thirty negatives. Odds didn't bother Shadow at all though, if anything he worked best when he had little to no chance of success but he was no fool. Although size would beg to differ Amy was not a mountain, she was a living creature and like all living creatures she would move and do things. Shadow would probably take a couple hours at the least to climb her and in that time she would almost certainly go eat, move, go to the bathroom, something that would most likely kill Shadow should he be climbing at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing this logic Shadow for once in his life chose not to act, despite how much he personally disliked it. There were too many risks, not to mention too many unanswered mysteries. How did he shrink and more importantly how did he end up in Amy Rose's house of all places? He was halfway around the globe before he fell asleep! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow thought over what he was doing before he fell asleep, investigating a mysterious anomaly that was possibly linked to disappearances. Minorly uncertain Shadow took another look at the massive treads of Amy's boot, if the disappearances were linked to all this then how many people met their end underneath that rubber? How many people died with nothing but the image of the beautiful pink hedgehog going about her day as the last thing they saw? It was almost enough to make Shadow sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, he didn't have time to wallow in possibilities like that. He needed to think, think of how he had shrunken, how he could get someones attention, how he could do so safely. It was all frustrating. The mysterious anomaly....if it was connected to Eggman as Omega suggested it would help explain why Shadow was with Amy; the Doctor would probably look at it as lovely irony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea made the hedgehog's fist shake in anger, \"If he did this to me he is a dead man..\" After a few moments Shadow took a deep breath and calmed down, getting fired up would not help him in the least. He racked his brain, thinking over so many possible things he could do; but none of them were safer or even as effective as Shadow's main two ideas. Again Shadow looked at Amy's unrealistically large boots, noticing all the dirt and grime he had never before seen on her shoe at his normal size. Almost transfixed, Shadow stared at the boot, thoughts slowing to a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus!\" He yelled to himself in minor frustration, trying to bring his mind back on topic. Again he racked his brain, still coming up with nothing. Shadow thought long and hard, and before he even realized it he was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dream was clear, vivid, as were most of Shadow's nightmares; the pleasant ones were usually blurry. However this seemed more pleasant than a nightmare, it was almost like a slideshow; various memories of Shadow together with his friends Rouge and Omega. Doing their jobs, fighting, helping one another, the typical things Team Dark did. It was all nice, until it came to the final bit, not memories but horrific scenes of both Rouge and Omega dead. Rouge literally was a splat of blood with sprinkles of white fur, and Omega was wires stuck against a large rubber surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a jab from a knife it hit him, \"Rouge! Omega!\" the concern came out in a loud shout of dismay as Shadow awoke and leapt into the air. If he was shrunken then chances were his comrades were too, which also held a possibility that they too were somewhere inside Amy's home. Somewhere inside the unaware hedgehog's nausiating home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow didn't have to think for a moment about what needed to be done, his friends could be in trouble and that was all that mattered. Still he had no idea how much time had passed, Amy's boots no longer occupied most of Shadow's vision and he couldn't detect any traces of her nearby. It was still light out from beneath Amy's couch so it was at the least still daytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally Shadow pictured the house's structure, thankfully it had only one floor so Shadow wouldn't have to worry about a struggle with stairs. Two bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, a dining room, and two bedrooms; each a fair size. At Shadow's possibly millimeter height however each room would likely take at least a couple hours to investigate, each. And that is if only is they had solid flat floors, assuming that each room had the jungle of carpetting Shadow had to navigate through to get where he was he could very well spend eight hours per room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought wasn't exactly a morale booster, already Shadow felt his mission was looking futile. He could easily spend the next week looking through Amy's home, but if he were to go with his original plan and get the giantess's attention then things could go far faster. Putting some thought into it Shadow......</span></div></div>",

Shadow shook his head, trying to regain his composure. He was always the calm and collected one, he may have come off as silent and unemotional at times, but it allowed him to keep a cool head in any situation.\"Let's just regather everything...\"He spoke to himself, pacing back and forth, trying to ignore the specks of dirt as large as mountains around him.\"I'm.....small. Very small. But I'm in the same area...so Rouge and Omega must be nearby. And...\"A conclusion was made.\"The anomaly. The energy...it shrank me.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silver the Hedgehog panted slightly as he finally caught up with the young hedgehog known as Amy Rose. She had been running about the areas around Soleanna, the City of Water, for hours now. She was just slowing down in the nearby jungle, just south of the city. He couldn't have been more relieved. It was clear that he had no idea on how to deal with energetic females. Blaze was nothing like the spunky pink hedgehog that had literally dragged him around searching for this \"Sonic\" character. How did Silver get himself into this anyway? The mission was supposed to be simple: travel to the past, then find and destroy the Iblis Trigger. He hadn't been expecting the task to be easy, but he hadn't expected to become distracted by something as small as a love-struck female either. Silver had to stop himself from laughing at this scenario. Amy finally stopped her search momentarily when she ran into a cliff, It went up about thirty feet, and Amy didn't really want to try and jump that. She turned to her companion behind her and saw he that he was gasping for air.<br>\n<br>\n\"Are you all right, Silver?\" Amy asked, Silver caught his breath and gave her a small nod. She made note of his exhaustion. <br>\n<br>\n\"Why don't we take a break for the night? It's getting late.\"<br>\n<br>\nSilver just gave another nod, glancing around the surrounding trees. To his left he spotted a cave entrance in the cliff, next to a small river. Amy followed his gaze, and with a smile sprinted towards it.The cave entrance was a small tunnel, and Amy couldn't tell how far into the cliff it went, the two hedgehogs entered the cave to get some rest. The cave led to a small niche that made a circle about twelve feet in diameter and six feet to the top, leaving plenty of room for the hedgehogs to sleep for the night. Amy set up two \"beds\" from leaves she had collected from outside, then went on to build a small fire. Silver jumped just a little when she finally got the flame going, his survival instincts against Iblis coming out, but he calmed quickly at the sight of Amy relaxing by the fire. <br>\n<br>\n\"So, Silver...\" Amy scanned her brain trying to think of something to make conversation with. \"Who are you looking for anyway?\"<br>\n<br>\nSilver was quiet. He sat himself across the fire from the female and debated with himself about exactly how much he should tell her.<br>\n<br>\n\"I'm searching for the Iblis Trigger,\" he said. At her puzzled face he continued. \"In the near future, the Iblis Trigger will destroy...where I'm from. I've been sent to stop him.\"<br>\n<br>\nHe felt he had to choose his words carefully. Amy just thought he was from some other location in this time period. It might complicate things if he tried to explain that he was also from the future. Silver wasn't sure if time travel was possible in this era, and if it wasn't then she might think he was crazy for suggesting otherwise.<br>\n<br>\n\"Sort of like a prophesy then?\" Amy asked. Silver nodded. He guessed that was one way to put it.<br>\n<br>\n\"Pretty brave of you, going off on your own to save your home.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"I wasn't alone,\" Silver explained, though he felt slightly elated at her words.<br>\n<br>\n\"I got separated from Blaze. I'm looking for her too, I suppose.\"<br>\n<br>\n\"Well, don't worry.\" Amy gave him a wide smile, though this concealed a flash of jealousy. Who was Blaze? The name sounded familiar, but she couldn't place it.<br>\n<br>\n\"Like I said, you help me find Sonic, and I'll help you find the Iblis Trigger and this Blaze of yours.\" While Silver was in high spirits at Amy?s offer to help him his happiness faded, as he also felt rather annoyed that whoever Sonic was took up so much of her attention. He couldn't exactly place the reason for his annoyance though.<br>\n<br>\n\"I think it's time for bed,\" Amy said with a yawn. In truth, she wanted to get away from the subject of his female friend. She laid herself down on one of the leaf beds, across the cave from Silver's. \"Don't worry about the fire. It'll burn itself out. Good night, Silver.\" <br>\n<br>\n\"...Night, Amy.\" Silver replied quietly. He placed himself on his own bed, facing Amy. Unfortunately that direction also faced the campfire. \"Don't worry about the fire...it'll burn itself out.\" he repeated.<br>\n<br>\nSilver still instinctively felt tense because of the fire, but those thoughts didn't last long once he caught sight of Amy's serene sleeping face. He kept an eye on that until he fell asleep himself. <br>\n<br>\nFire...smoke...rubble...heat...a roar and a scream from Blaze...!<br>\n<br>\nSilver sprung awake, shocking himself out of the nightmare about Iblis. Could he not escape that monster even in his dreams?! He let out a groan and slammed his palm to his forehead.<br>\n<br>\nWait a minute...why was everything so big? He looked to Amy and yelped, she'd tuned into a giantess!<br>\n<br>\nNo...that wasn't right... Silver reasoned after he'd calmed himself. If everything was bigger...than that ment...<br>\n<br>\nHo-no...<br>\n<br>\n\"I've SHRUNK!\" Silver exclaimed at the top of his voice, his shout sounded like a chipmonk on helium.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silver gritted his teeth and pondered over what could've happened, how did he shrink? Was it Amy...no she was too nice. Maybe one of the many machines he had seen around? It was even possible that this was correlated to the Iblis Trigger, with the way Iblis devastated his world it definitely seemed possible. He looked at Amy and felt his rage calm, she was...beautiful while giant and asleep, but Silver was on a mission and he was going to see it through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis first plan of action was obvious, get Amy's attention; right now Silver couldn't best one of the lousy robots he's seen around let alone the Iblis Trigger. But...there was a complication, this cave while an ideal resting spot had a small little river flowing down the middle, soothing and nothing to the normal sized but to Silver....it was chasm that went on for at least a couple miles, filled to the brim with roaring water. Even with telekinesis getting across was going to be difficult. But this was nothing compared to his mission, if anything it was a test to see his determination so Silver was determined to go for the challenge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started by lifting a few boulder sized pebbles via telekinesis and throwing them into the water....didn't help much since the water flew them away with ease. It meant making a bridge was out, so Silver had one other option...he would have to glide <i> all </i> the way across the river. He didn't just rush into it though, Silver played it smart. With his telekinesis he lifted multiple pebbles again, but instead of throwing them into the river he stacked them on top of one another, until he had a wobbly tower that seemed to be at least twenty feet tall. With ease Silver climbed to the top and looked over the landscape, if he messed this up that water was going to wash him away to god knows where, but if he succeeded he could get Amy to help him. He took a deep breath, visualized Blaze encouraging him, focused on reaching Amy and finally...Silver leapt into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair-like spikes flew along with the air as he seemed to plummett towards the water but Silver used a short burst of telekinesis to sort of glide over a little bit, then he allowed gravity to take over, and then he used a short burst again. It seemed unneccessarily complicated but Silver was doing this for maximum range, years of fighting Iblis taught him much regarding how his powers could best be used. More than once Silver eyed the cave with a slight horror, if he messed up...the river would send him anywhere maybe even kill him, he might get killed by one of the sharper rocks, or god forbid he lands somewhere where Amy would unconciously crush him! It dazed him slightly but the hedgehog stayed focused and kept with his plan, but his mind was getting weak...he didn't have much strength left. He was almost there...just a couple inches to go...and...he did it! He was now safely gliding over land! All Silver had left to do was let gravity take over and use telekinesis one last time to ensure he landed safely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least...that's how Silver <i> wished </i> things played out, but fate was cruel. For some reason a sudden burst of wind tore through the cave, and being as small as a fly Silver was sent flying back towards the water, over halfway back through his journey. And to top it off, his strength finally gave out and he fell into the chilly water with a splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swam up and gasped for air, the current knocked any physical strength out of his body. His mind was tired, his body too weak to do anything, still Silver attempted to swim far enough for shore, but the tide was against him...literally and when his back was turned to the water fate struck again; a pebble dislodged due to the current and smacked directly into Silver, in his weakened state he passed out almost instantly and sank into the water where the current dragged him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven unconcious Silver got no rest, he honestly preferred his fate in the river than what his dreams held...Iblis, images of the various incarnations of the beast destroying his city, his friends, everything Silver loved Iblis attacked. Then the dream switched to Mephiles, who looked at him and reexplained the story regarding Iblis, a reminder to Silver and his mission...it filled him with vigor and courage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iblis!!!!!\" He roared as his body stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow Silver lived...and he washed somewhere, he was less than ten feet away from a water source, but tides carried him to land, he had to look to see where he was.....</span></div></div>",

The telepathic hedgehog wasted no time in scrambling to refuge under a beach lounge chair. Free of the threat of getting washed away, Silver took a moment to admire the ocean mirroring the blue sky, the white froth as it broke and receded agains the white sand from the movements of the tide, how the sunlight reflecting off the water's surface causing the surface to shimmer beautifully. The sight only furthered 's resolve. He HAD to end Iblis before it began.  However, he had more immediate concerns, where was he?<br>\n<br>\nHis thoughts were cut short as a shadow covered his hiding place. Silver looked up and saw who had decided to relax on the lounge chair he was under and saw it was a very attractive bat. She wore thigh-length white boots that had small hearts at the toe area, a black leather bodysuit with a pink heart at the chest to make room for her cleavage, and nearly elbow-length white gloves. She stretched out and enjoyed the warmth of the sun.<br>\n<br>\nSilver knew this was his chance and rushed to her boots and leapt for one, using his powers to give himself an extra boost and was able to grab onto the edge of her boot's heel before pulling himself up, he wasn't particularly fast like he'd heard this pain-in-the-butt Sonic character he'd heard about from Amy was, but survival with Iblis running amoke ment Silver's physical ability level was excellent. He then began to climb the boot's sole, using his telekinesis whenever he could. After hours, he made it to the toe of the boot and simply slid down it. After that, he ran up her leg, however, Silver had failed to realise one thing: the way his body glowed  witha neon blue-green outline hadn't escaped the notice of the she-bat. Silver felt the \"ground\" under him shift and he looked up to see a giant hand heading straight for him. Silver turned and bolted but it was no use, he jumped off the she-bat only for the massive hand to reach out and close around him. The world shifted as she moved and then Silver founde himself blinded as the hand he was in opened and light poured into his field of vision.<br>\n<br>\nAs he rubbed his eyes to clear the blurs away, he heard someone speak.<br>\n<br>\n\"Nice try, whatever you are, but nothing escapes the notice of Rouge the bat.\"<br>\n<br>\nAs Silver's sight returned, he fell backwards with a yelp as there was a near plant-sized eye inches from him. Rouge, if he'd heard right, looked him over, examining him. <br>\n<br>\nWhen she had deducted whatever the tiny creature she'd captured was indeed alive, Rouge...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a playful snicker Rouge closed her hand around Silver, her massive fingers squishing the puny hedgehog into the soft skin of her palm. \"I'd recognize those spikes anywhere, you're another hedgehog like Shadow. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver had to scream his answer out for it to be heard by Rouge's amazing ears, \"Silver! Silver the Hedgehog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge unfolded her hand and eyed Silver with more interest, \"I can see why your name is Silver...\" She pointed to his silvery fur. \"What's up with the size? Is that how it works for hedgehogs, some are fast others are smaller than dirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver's temper got the better of him for a moment, \"No you stupid bat! I use telekinesis! I have no idea why I'm small!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Rouge's eyes flickered with annoyance but she quickly replaced it with a playful allure and leaned forward so her lipstick covered lips were just inches away from swallowing Silver up in their grasp. \"Be careful what you say little Silver; it looks like you are only about a centimeter tall. At that size you couldn't even beat up my pinky, let alone yell at me like you're stronger than me. Now, what do you have to say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach word Rouge let out made her breath caress Silver in an oddly pleasurable way, it smelled of fresh berries mixed with a hint of mint...an odd combination but it was nice. It made Silver's spikes blow with each syllable, like a heavy wind was blowing around him. He knew what Rouge wanted, and he knew she was probably his only source of help at the moment so Silver bit his lip and apologized, \"Sorry...I'm just frustrated at being little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge shrugged, \"No problem hun, if I had to guess I'd say Eggman did this to ya. Seems like the kind of thing he would come up with. Although why you and not Sonic or Shadow I have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain with Sonic...Silver really had to meet this guy. But more importantly Rouge explained someone who could've done this...and if he did it...he could undo it. Silver could get fixed and go back to his mission! \"Hey..uh Rouge right? Can you take me to this Eggman guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant bat shook her head and leaned back against her sun chair oddly relaxed, \"Not a good idea, me and Eggman...aren't exactly buddies if you catch my drift. Me, I'm more of a jewel kinda girl. If there's jewels in it I'll team up with someone. Only exceptions are with Shadow and Omega and that's cause they're my buddies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver paled a little bit, \"Can one of them help me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge laughed like it was a huge joke, \"Probably not. Shadow isn't exactly friendly and Omega's even worse about it. Although there isn't anything to help, nothing at all.\" This last sentence seemed to carry a hidden depth in it but Silver didn't catch it...at least not then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing to help!? Look at me! You said so yourself, I'm a flipping centimeter tall!\" As if in demonstration Silver angrily kicked at Rouge's palm, not that she felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge didn't break he cool demeanor, \"Exactly, perfect size for a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PET?!!?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver's reaction made Rouge chuckle, \"Of course sweety, came to mind right when I saw ya. I always wanted a pet, oh the heists we could do, the activities...man. It's more like partners than anything.\" Rouge's eyes seemed to gleam with menace for a moment, \"But partner can mean slave real quick you got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden moodswing made Silver gulp, \"Y-yes mam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Rouge sounded normal again, leaning back into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver never saw such an activity in his future so it seemed odd, \"What are you doing Rouge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanning of course, a girl has to keep her looks up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver eyed Rouge's outfit skeptically, \"You're...fully dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's eyes flew open like this was a sacred truth, \"Oh my god you're right! God I must seem like such a ditz right now!\" Before anything else could be said Rouch hid...no more like flung Silver into her cleavage. \"Stay there while I undress!\" Silver.... couldn't reply he was blushing too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Future Silver never had any time for romance or anything like that so the feeling of a breast...it was new; and Rouge's massive mammeries at his size seemed absolutely ungodly. It was hot inside her cleavage...but something made Silver not care. He tried not to move for fear of coming out like a pervert...but it was hard not to, suddenly he had the impulse to do every little movement imaginable...and his position brought forth a very unfamiliar feeling, arousal. A part of him never wanted to leave...it felt...good in a way he never quite felt before. But just as that feeling started to grow the familiar feeling of Rouge's fingers snapped him back to himself as she pulled him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed at Silver as soon as she saw him, \"Silver huh? Might wanna go with Ruby next time!\" Silver could see reflected in Rouge's massive eyes what she meant, he was bright red.... <i> very </i> noticable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" He muttered as he averted his gaze. Beside Rouge and her chair were her clothes, neatly foled and placed on a towel, he boots stacked on top. Just from seeing them Silver felt a weird paranoia regarding the smell, although he was blessed with not having to experience it. Passerby oggled at Rouge but she payed them no mind. Curious about this Silver's eyes trailed to Rouge's body which was laying down again. Her skin was all perfectly tan, from her shoulders all the way to her soles. Her swimsuit was a two piece designed like glittery gold on top and silver on the bottom...normally gaudy but it looked kind of fitting on the bat. Her toenails as Silver noted were painted black with pink almost heart shaped diamonds dead in the center, again oddly fitting for her. His eyes trailed over her well toned body, her soft calves to her muscular thights, voluptous waist (Which Silver stared at for an extra moment), her flat stomach with a faint sign of muscle, and finally her massive breasts which Silver seemed hypnotized by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge saw it quick and flicked the hedgehog out of his daze, \"If you just stare you're gonna be a bad pet Silver! Keep looking at I might just give you so much of it you would get sick of it. And then you gotta pay for touching the girls.\" Rouge winked to finish causing Silver vaguely imagined what Rouge could've meant...it was oddly <i> stimulating </i> but not something he would want to go through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot sure of how to respond though Silver replied with a very stupid comment that would undoubtedly make him appear like a pervert. \"Well I have to something! You have a better idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge responded without even having to think. \"Well my pet...</span></div></div>",

She already threw the words \u201cpet\u201d and \u201cslave\u201d multiple times his way, probably a careless mistake on her part; but Silver knew the truth due to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast the analysis, the hedgehog hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what Rouge was implying. In his desolate future Silver had no knowledge of the things Rouge took for granted, in this instance, suntan lotion. This ignorance showed itself quickly, \u201cWhat do you want me to do then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge\u2019s eyes looked as if she couldn\u2019t believe Silver had to ask, \u201cYou don\u2019t get out much do ya hun? See that bottle of suntan lotion?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver looked at it, blushed, and further showed his ignorance, \u201cWhat about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant bat-girl face-palmed herself, \u201c<i>Dear Lord\u2026</i>I want you to spread it! That stuff helps me tan, and at your size you can spread it real evenly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver looked surprised by such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing Rouge sat back in her lawn chair, reaching a hand for the bottle. With a simple twisting motion the cap came off and Rouge placed Silver on the edge of her chair, directly beside her thigh. \u201cJust get started Silvy, I think I\u2019m getting a headache.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the nickname Silver focused on the large bottle before him; one perk of using telekinesis, it really eased the work load. With the sheer power of his mind Silver had tons of the lotion out into the open, simply floating towards Rouge. The bat saw this in mild amazement, recalling how Silver spoke about his usage of telekinesis before. The shimmering brown liquid soon hovered over Rouge\u2019s ankle, and with it in place Silver released his mind\u2019s hold on it. As expected, gravity took its course and brought the lotion all over Rouge\u2019s ankle, as well as the area of the chair around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver felt he was off to a good start, Rouge corrected him. \u201cWhat are you doing?! At this rate you\u2019re gonna ruin my chair, and my tan! That isn\u2019t even close to evenly spread out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver looked back at his handiwork, only just noticing what Rouge meant. \u201cOh! I\u2019ll fix that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better! But to be safe, no using that tele-whatever to do it. You can use it to bring it out of the bottle, but you better apply it by hand! And keep it off my chair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver grew an annoyed expression as he floated himself to the unevenly spread suntan lotion and did as commanded. The smell\u2026ugh, Silver would end up lightheaded by the end of his task, he knew it. Not to mention how the liquid was sticky and got everywhere, soon Silver would end up brown; but at least he was evening out his mistake. Were things a little more\u2026fair Silver might have argued this whole thing, but in the short time he\u2019d known Rouge he knew one thing, never piss her off, and that was his only reason he was complying. It wouldn\u2019t be too bad anyway, surely Amy, or, if he got lucky, Blaze, would come and find him. But, while in Rome\u2026Silver might as well be a good pet; he sighed as he began to spread the extra lotion from his spill along Rouge\u2019s feet, the gigantic toes larger than Silver wiggled as he rubbed the lotion on them. Up close the hedgehog couldn\u2019t help but feel a twinge of admiration at the detail Rouge put into her toenail polish. The heart-shaped diamonds, they honestly looked like real diamonds from this perspective, and they matched Rouge perfectly. Silver didn\u2019t focus on it too long though as he finished up both feet and got more lotion. He had a long way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeauty was a foreign thing to Silver, hell it wasn\u2019t even a word he knew until he came to the past. But if there was a word to describe Rouge it would have to be that, beautiful. Her feet were\u2026well perfect. No dirt, no smell, no issues whatsoever, same with the rest of her body. Rouge\u2019s curvy, yet toned, form amazed Silver to no end. The amount of work this girl did to keep herself like this, it was impressive to say the least; and judging from her curves, she was made for it. In all honesty, Silver had no complaints about his task. He\u2019d never known the touch of a woman, the feeling of their bare body, and\u2026put simply this was a great first time. As Silver applied lotion to Rouge\u2019s breasts and waist, a part of him wished it would never end; a larger part knew he couldn\u2019t enjoy such things for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n             After Silver began to get the hang of things, Rouge leaned back and let the hedgehog get to work. She was only kidding\u2026<i>slightly </i>about the whole pet thing, but Silver just ran with it. Hey, if he wanted to service a catch of a woman like Rouge, who was she to stop him? She was getting her suntan lotion spread, and from the feeling of Silver\u2019s hands\u2026a massage on top of it. She was quickly growing fond of the hedgehog; he was going to make a great pet. In fact, Rouge may have to reward him after this task. She began planning just how to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn\u2019t much longer now; Silver was nearing Rouge\u2019s head where the last of the suntan lotion would be applied. The bat insisted it wasn\u2019t necessary, but if Silver was going to do a job, he was going to do it thoroughly. After a small application there Silver was done, or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers wrapped around Silver as the gigantic bat rolled onto her stomach, \u201cNot bad Silvy, but now you have to do the back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed real obvious now, but Silver didn\u2019t reveal he didn\u2019t know about that. He just got right back to work. Oddly, it didn\u2019t seem nearly as enjoyable this time; maybe he missed Rouge\u2019s smirk as she looked down at him; he chuckled at the idea. But he did rather enjoy doing Rouge\u2019s butt for some odd reason. Regardless, in time all of Rouge was covered evenly in Suntan lotion and Silver, both physically and mentally, was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge lifted the hedgehog from her calves as he finished, \u201cGood job Silvy, I\u2019m quite impressed. In fact, since you got so into it I think you deserve a reward\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilver put on a straight face, but in truth he was quite eager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The members included: Cammy, Chuni-li, Crimson Viper, Ibuki, and Sakura lead by the sinister Juri. Lately the Fem Fatale had been wreaking havoc and needed to be stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring an unsuccessful attack on the evil S.I.N. organization, Juri had managed to enthral these five other women with mind controlling powers. Since then, no one has been able to defeat them until now. Ryu stood patiently outside a set of large double doors leading into Juri's chambers. He had to remember to be careful when battling this one. Who knows what else that device in her eye could do? With a heavy sigh and a tremendous push on the double doors, they swung open to reveal a beautifully decorated japanese style room with thatched walls, flowers and floor pillows. Laying comfortably among the pillows was Juri, \"I was wondering when you would finally reach me Ryu\", she breathed in a confident manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up Juri, I don't know what you are planning but this Fem Fatale thing is over. Give up or I shall be forced into making you surrender.\"<br>\r\nRyu had said with all seriousness. \"You speak confidently Ryu. I admit that I am impressed that you have managed to find your way through my large dojo lair and that you defeated Cammy, Chun-li, Crimson Viper, Ibuki, and Sakura... But I assure you that I am no easy target\". With that, her left eye began to glow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of panic swept over Ryu. He had remembered that this same device has the five other women under control. What could she possibly be up to now? A barrage of mental intrusions assaulted Ryu's mind. He struggled mentally not to give in to her controlling effects with every ounce of his being. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there struggling to even stand at some points, Juri lay comfortably and patiently among the pillows with her arms out wide and her legs crossed, foot dangling in the air playfully. \"Give in Ryu, I think you will find it it quite nice under my control\", she said with a twisted grin. Ryu fell down to his knees then under the overwhelming power of this device. \"grgghhh... Never!\" he yelled in defiance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the assault ended and Ryu was left extremely taxed both mentally and physically. \"tsk tsk Ryu. I'm disappointed in you. If you refuse to join me under my control, there is always 'other' ways I have of controlling you\". Ryu looked up at that moment as Juri's eye began to glow again, this time the intrusion felt different from the last. He tried to fight it this time, but he was far too weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arms and legs buckled as the mental power snapped into effect and a blur of energy washed over him as everything started becoming more far away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... happening... to me!?\" he struggled to say as the curse was complete. Looking around now Ryu couldn't believe was he was seeing. Everything was huge! Ryu had shrunk to roughly three inches tall! Ryu looked around in a panic as if looking for an answer when heavy footsteps came baring his way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere stood a seemingly enormous Juri in front of him, standing there with her arms on her waist. She slammed her arched foot down beside tiny Ryu in a dominant fashion and then purred, \"Now my pet, the question is: <i>what</i> to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He struggled with all his might but was ultimately powerless against her hold. She sat down on the largest central pillow and began stroking his head with her other fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to do whatever I want to you and there is nothing you can do about it.\" she said as she continued her stroking. \"And then, When I am tired of playing with you, Im going to let the other Fem Fatale ladies have their way with you for humiliating them\". Ryu's eyes had opened widely at that last comment. Who knows what they would do to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri dropped Ryu onto the pillow and quickly clamped her large powerful feet around Ryu's body, constricting his arms to his side so that he couldn't go anywhere. \"I just love my feet, don't you?\" she said rubbed her feet back and forth together causing Ryu to shift and grind against her arches. \"You can't do this Juri\" Ryu said and he struggled to break free<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, but I can my little foot toy\", she said as she applied some more pressure to his body causing Ryu to let out a heave of air. Her feet were so soft yet powerful. Not to mention sweaty and a little smelly. It was all too much to take from Ryu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly dropped Ryu. He lay o the pillow catching his breathe when her left foot came swooping in and she clamped her bid and index toe around his body to ensnare him once more. She began to squeeze with more and more pressure as she said, \"Tell me Ryu, did you honestly think you could beat me? How does it feel to be powerless and at the mercy of my feet?\", Juris right foot came gliding over and stopped in position in front of his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not match for my feet, let alone me\", she said as her right big toe moved in and began caressing Ryu's crotch. Ryu protested every moment of it with a futile struggle. \"unghh.... uhh. Let go... of.. me! You're sick and twisted!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" she balked. \"You don't have to tell me twice. I know full well what I am and I am proud of it.\" She continued to rub his crotch with her giant toe while Ryu was trapped and suspended by her other foot helplessly. Ryu couldn't help but feel a little turned on despite the circumstances in the grasp of her large sweaty, soft feet with purple painted toe nails. He felt and erection coming on and fought back the urge to let it happen, but it was utterly pointless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri Didn't miss it either. \"Oh my, my little foot toy. Are you getting excited form this?\" Ryu blushed and turned away while still continuing his struggle for freedom. She began a circular stroking motion with her toe to his crotch and in seconds, Ryu had a full erection. \"Well, well, well... Looks like the mighty Ryu has a weakness after all.\" she purred with an evil twisted grin on her face. It was against his oath as a warrior to give himself sexually to a woman. Such a breach was seen as a severe weakness and Ryu upheld to that cold strongly and strictly. He felt very violated and outraged that she could force him to break that oath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\" Juri responded as if reading his every thought. In fact, that is exactly what she did as her glowing eye returned to normal. \"The things you can find out about people with this device\". Ryu was very panicked now. He felt he had released information to the enemy though there wasn't much he could do about it. \"Looks like I know exactly how to torture you now\" she purred in an erotic yet maniacal way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile still suspending Ryu in the air between her toes with her left foot, she summoned the dexterity of her right foot and clamped her right toes around Ryu's pants and pulled them right off, revealing his lower half completely. Still holding the pants in her toes grasp, she flung them off to the side. Ryu began struggling more urgently, breaking more than just a sweat as fear began to well up in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri's right toe returned to its previous work of stroking Ryu's crotch, He couldn't fight back a groan that he let loose at the sensation of her giant, soft, sweaty toe caressing his crotch. It felt good he admitted but was stronger than to give in to the pleasure. Ryu felt a lot of pressure building up in his loins although he was unfamiliar with what that entailed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri began rubbing faster and faster as Ryus body began to tense up. Every muscled in his body corded and stretched the feeling swept over him. involuntary sounds of pleasure escaped his mouth until finally, he let loose a very large load of semen onto Juri's giant toe nail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my!\" she exclaimed as Ryu panted breathlessly during his futile struggle whilst still in the toe hold of her captor. \"How does it feel to have been dominated and forced to break your little warrior oath?\" she mocked him as she lifted her cum covered toe up to Ryus face and began smearing his fluids on his face and clothes. \"Go to hell!\" Ryu defiantly shouted in response as he tried to wipe off his own cum from his face by rubbing it against his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you will find your time with the Fem Fatale enjoyable if you would only learn to give in a let loose\" She said as she clamped her right toes around his lower half and began playing with his entire body, stretching and scrunching him like an accordian which produced a maniacal laugh from juri at the sight of Ryu helpless to her foot play. \"What shall we do next my toy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt so ashamed of himself as well as violated. He had broken his warriors code and could already feel power leaving his body. He cared nothing for whatever sick and twisted 'play' she had in store for him. All he cared about was escaping her grasp which was not easy. Juri had her left toes clamped around his torso and her right toes clamped around his legs continuing to toy with him at that very moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuri tapped into her extreme leg flexability at that moment bringing both her feet up high positioning Ryu a mere inch from her face. \"You hold your words warrior, but i know the truth. I can see right into you. Not only do you have more in you, but I am going to extract it once again.\" she finished with licking her lips. Ryu attempted to struggle some more as he had done earlier but felt far less powerful this time. Panic rushed through his thoughts as to just how much power she sapped from him the last time by causing him to break his oath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it right here\", she said pointing to her eye, again reading his thoughts with her device in her left eye. Ryu stared at her giant evil face confused. \"That's right, when you broke your little oath your power left you. Luckily for you, I absorbed it, I already feel <i>much</i> stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me back my power and my freedom!\" Ryu demanded from his seemingly helpless position. \"Ha!\" he mocked and broke out into laughter soon after. \"I can only give it back if I so choose to. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to happen.\" she breathed. \"Now... Where were we?\" Juri moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dominant vixen licked her lips again, slowly as she narrowed her eyes at Ryu who was still held suspended infront of her face by her feet. \"I'm going to need you to be hard again. I think I can fix that.\" Juri purred. To Ryu's shock, Juri's tongue started to slowly stretch toward him. He tried again to break free, but to no avail. Ryu let out a big \"Unngggh!\" as her tongue licked between his legs. Ryu did not mean to let out that sound but he could not help it. Nor could he help the erection he was already forming again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just too much fun!\" she jested as she began licking his crotch again. Her licks were slow and playful, her intension was just to tease for now. And that's precisely what she was doing. Juri let go with her right toes which were previously holding his legs still keeping a firm hold on his torso with her left toes. \"I'll need more leverage for this flexible trick\" she said with a wink to Ryu's horrified face as she opened her mouth wide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her firm toe hold on Ryu, she lowered his lower half into her mouth and tightened her lips around his waist as she began sucking off the entire lower portion of his body. It was so very warm and slimy. Her tongue danced and twisted between his legs, utterly soaking his legs. It seemed no matter much he struggled and kicked his legs, her tongue always managed to slip past his defences and do its dirty job. <br>\r\nThe sensation was unbarable! He broke his oath once already, he did not intend on going any further. He fought the intense pleasure of her giant tongue swishing around on his genitals but it all see,ed hopeless. He tried to utter words of defiance to Juri but all that came out were sounds of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe established a firm suction on his body as she slowly began to pull him out of her mouth with her toes. She made a loud suctiony \"Muah!\" noise as she pulled the rest of his lower half out of her mouth. Ryu was panting for some breath and strength for only a mere moment before Juri returned to work. She clamped her right toes around Ryu's lower half once more as she pulled him all the way up to her mouth. She looked down quickly to his obvious erection as she licked her lips once more. \"What do you say we break that oath one more time?\" Juri rhetorically asked. Before Ryu could protest, Her lips tighlty wrapped around his penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu could not even begin to describe the sensation he was feeling. Her giant wet lips scrunching and pulling and sucking away. It was coming way faster this time Ryu could sense. He just couldn't help it. There was nothing he could do against all these elements stacked against him. Her giant feet firmly clamping him in a helpless position while those huge lips sucked away at his penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips viciously worked a pattern back and forth now while her tongue did wonders from inside her mouth. The feel was welling up in his loins again. His muscles tensed up as all air left his body. He shouted straight up in protest and pleasure all at once as he let loose an even larger load this time that seemed to last much longer as he squirmed in her grasp from the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu's body went limp at that moment from the intense release. \"Mmmm... Tasty.\" she purred to his face. Ryu felt much more powerless this time around as all consciousness seemed to leave him and a wave of black rolled over his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better let you rest a while if you are to have enough energy for the rest of the Fem Fatale\" she whispered to his unconscious body as she carried him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Where does Ryu wake up?*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He remembered then that the reason was because he was still three inches tall. He had a sudden full body chill as he realized he was completely naked now. Panicked, he sprung up, or at least that is what he attempted to do. He appeared to be fastened down to a surface with twine. After looking around in all possible directions his current predicament would allow, he came to the conclusion that he was tied down to the surface of a woman's sandal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu looked around at the room he was in. It was a familiar room similar to Juri's chambers. He was positioned next to a different sandal located at the base of a giant chair. At least, it seemed giant to him but was actually normal size. He did not like the implications of his current position. Also, it appeared that no one was here. If there was a time to escape, it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs luck would have it for Ryu, that's when he heard the heavy footsteps of what sounded like boots approaching the door. His struggle to escape from the twine binding him to the sandal was no good. The door swung open. Ryu looked over in the direction of the door to view his new captor. There stood Cammy in her usual thonged, one-piece commando suit outfitted with her heavy high boots. From this angle and size, her legs seemed even longer and more defined than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Ryu thought her <i>legs</i> were quite the sight, Cammy turned around to close the door behind her to unveil her giant, cushiony yet perfectly sculpted ass. His jaw nearly fell off at the sight. This wasn't good. Ryu felt terribly weak and these bonds were doing their job of keeping him in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy walked straight toward Ryu and looked down at the tiny warrior staring back up at her. \"You're awake\", she said hovering above him. \"Looks like now I will be able to continue my mission.\" Cammy, along with the other members Juri had brain-washed, was not herself at all. Much more sinister and obedient to Juri's commands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cammy! It's me, Ryu. You have to stop this. What ever you are going to do - don't!\" he plead to the giantess. \"Shut up! You will speak when spoken to, understand?\" Ryu decided not to answer in case it was trick question and he would be punished for answering. \"Now, my mission, as instructed by Juri, is to sufficiently torture you until you... 'break your oath' \". she said, finishing that last statement with a sly grin on her usually stern face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu's stomache sunk at that implication. \"I have a few tortures ready for you, my little play thing. The question is: what to start with?\" She said sitting down in the chair stepping down with her boots on either side of Ryu.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryu tried desperately to break free from his bonds, but they were just too strong. Cammy bent over down to her boots and slowly began to untie the laces. \"I have been walking in these boots for hours. Fighting you earlier worked up <i>quite</i> the sweat.\" She said with a stern yet erotic tone. What was she getting at exactly? \"After wearing them for so long and working up quite a sweat, they can get very... <i>smelly\"</i> she stated, punctuating that last point with a swift pull of a lace, undoing her left boot completely. Now it was time for the other boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cammy, this isn't like you. Stop this madness, we need to work together to stop Juri!\" he plead again to his captor only to feel ignored as Cammy continued talking as though she never even heard him. \"And now...\" she said, purposely letting that last point dangle as she began untying her right boot, \"You will receive the <i>pleasure</i> of smelling and tasting them\" she breathed, ending with a twisted smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No! You can't do this to me!\" Ryu demanded, to which Cammy responded, \"Oh yes I can. And I will.\" she sharply ended with another lace pull to free her right foot now. \"Ooo, it is going to feel so good to air out my sweaty feet.\" she said lifting out of her boots to reveal her giant sweaty feet. Ryu could already smell them from his trapped position on the sandal and the smell was strong! She stared down at the tiny trapped warrior with intense silence and she watched him struggle at the approach of her advancing feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy made her toes do a seductive walk slowly toward Ryu. Alternating her big and index toe simulating a pair of mobile legs. Her toe nails were painted a radiant natural green colour to match her outfit and leg camo markings. Both feet had reached the heel of each sandal and Cammy slid her right foot into the sandal next to Ryu. The smell was becoming stronger now. The air was full of a palpable, salty, humid odour. Ryu was positioned on the adjacent sandal where her left arch would stand right below the ball of the foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets begin with some mild smell torture, shall we?\". Ryu tried once more to break free of his bonds but he was soon pinned under Cammy's giant left foot as she slowly slid her left foot into the sandal. She didn't put down too much force to crush or suffocate him, but enough to firmly press against his body. The smell was so strong and potent! And the sweat! It may have been due to his size, but it felt as though her foot sweat was coming off in pools of water. Being under her foot for only a short time covered his entire bare body with a oily, sweaty mixture which seeped all over his body. Ryu tried to hold his breath for as long as he could which only made matters worse because when he had to take in a big breath, her foot odour was ready and waiting to be sucked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy lifted her left leg up and crossed it over her right knee. Then she arched her left toes backward to let the sandal dangle off her foot, allowing a moment to breath some slightly better air for the trapped warrior bound to the foot wear. Ryu used the opportunity to take in a deep breath though it wasn't long before she flexed her toes straight out to pin the sandal, along with him, against the bottom of her foot once more. She repeated this pattern rapidly of flexing her toes to torture and toy with Ryu. \"Are you enjoying yourself Ryu?\". A question that would go unanswered as he was preoccupied with finding the better opportunities to take in a breath, although he found her pattern to be very random and rapid. Often he found himself inhaling large breathes against the bottom of her foot by accident which would cause him to take in a large amount of foot sweat into his mouth, throwing him into a frenzy of coughing and hacking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your silence as a yes\", she jested as she continued through the smelly torture. She brought her foot back down again and removed the sandals back into their original position in front of the chair. \"I hope you aren't too worn out my little toy. That was only the easy part\". Ryu was utterly disgusted with what he had just endured as he tried to spit out as much of the foot sweat that had found its way into his mouth. There wasn't anything he could do about the copious amount of foot sweat covering his body as he could not move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you may find me to be much more aggressive and stern than Juri. any act of defiance from you will result in pain, understood?\". Ryu turned his head and kept silent. A mistake, apparently, as she brought her arched foot down upon his body and began to press down on his torso. The power of her foot was forcing all the air out of his chest. Juri continued as Ryu struggled for air, \"I said, understand?\". Ryu obediently shook his head 'yes' and to his relief, she lifted her giant foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now comes my favorite part...\". Ryu looked up with a face of fear and confusion. \"I believe my mission, as Juri mentioned, was to get you to, once again... break your oath, was it?\" she said with a sly wink and a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What happens next?</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cammy placed her giant green painted toe over Ryu's crotch and began rubbing his genitals. \"Unnghh!\", Ryu let out while Cammy's toe as well as the sweat and smell assaulted his senses. It didn't take long for an erection to form under her toe. \"There we go.\", she said with a smile. Cammy, in an amazing act of toe dexterity, clamped her right big and index toe around Ryu's penis. She applied a firm amount of pressure  and began pumping her toes. \"Aaaghh!\" Ryu was about to say a word of defiance but remembered Cammy's earlier threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy glided her left foot over above Ryu's face and placed it down so that his face was only barely visible between her toes. That incredibly potent odour again! Now there was no escape. But at the same time, Cammy's right foot was clamped around his penis and pumping and tugging gently away which provided a surprisingly good sensation. \"Now, take in a BIG breathe... Do it or I will not be so gentle with my other foot!\". Her feet were sweating profusely again onto his body, drenching his face and crotch. Cammy tightened the grip around his penis more and began pulling away from his body slowly. Ryu let out a groan of pain. \"See how much that hurts? All you have to do is take in a BIG breath when I tell you to\". She eased the pressure and began her normal gentle pattern again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow, did it ever feel good! But Ryu was not enjoying himself in the slightest. \"Now, like I said before. BIG breath my foot toy\". Ryu, with a sigh of resent, took in a big breath followed by a series of coughs. \"See how it works? Now I am going to make it a little more interesting. My right foot will only do its work when you are inhaling\". Ryu thought to himself at that moment. Why bother inhaling at all then? \"And if you don't continue to take in deep breathes, I will pull it off\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror was but one expression that took form on Ryu's face at that moment. \"Now, begin. Big deep breath\", she commanded. Ryu, without hesitation, took in a large breathe and as Cammy had promised, commenced her fancy foot work with her right foot on Ryu's penis. Ryu continued to cough and hack after every deep inhale. That smell of her sweaty feet was so strong! This sight was very pleasing to Cammy. watching him moan in pleasure and then gasp for breath soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now lick my feet\", she commanded. Ryu couldn't protest if he tried. Even if he wanted to, his mouth muffled by her left foot. \"Lick my feet!\" she commanded once more. Ryu stuck out his tongue and licked her foot. All that salty sweat that had pooled up in her feet, he was now tasting. It was extremely bitter and salty to say the least! \"I didn't say stop\", she said with a stern, erotic grin baring down on Ryu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ryu continued licking. He couldn't help but squirm in his bonds at the immense amount of pleasure her right foot was enducing. He felt an orgasm coming on but fought with all of his might to hold it back. He continued to squirm and wriggle in his bonds as the pressure amounted in his loins once again. \"Don't forget to take in deep breathes now?\" she reminded from her commanding position. Ryu took in deep gagging breathes and her foot began to smother his face and muffle his moans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was coming. Cammy's sweaty foot pumped and tugged faster and faster. He struggled as he fought for air, all the while feeling incredible pleasure from her giant sweaty foot. Ryu's little body tensed up and spasmed during his muffled screams during his orgasm. Muscles tensed and he squirmed about while a fountain of cum seemed to endlessly erupt and cover her right toes. He had done it again, exactly what he vowed never to do. Like before, Ryu felt much of himself seemingly float away. He had wondered how many more times he could endure these tortures and what would happen if it happened too many times?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm. Mission complete\", she said smiling as she lifted her right foot up to mouth and liked the tiny amount of cum off of her toes. Ryu laid there in an emotionless daze contemplating his recent events. \"But I am not done yet\", she added as she stood from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cammy stood towering over Ryu who was still tied to the sandal. \"You had to know that this was coming too\", she finished with a quick slap to her own ass. The jiggle of her ass lasted a mere moment and tensed up its firm state soon after just to illustrate how well it was perfectly sculpted. \"I am going to cut you free now. If you try ANYTHING funny like running for the door, I will crush you\". With that, she fetched a knife from a near by table and cut him loose. Ryu wouldn't have put up much of a fight anyways in his current drained state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy picked him up in her hands and carried him over to her bed. \"Don't you just love my ass?\" she asked, positioning him with a good view of her rear. \"...Yes\" he said with only slight hesitance. \"Would you like a closer look?\" Ryu didn't know how to respond to that question. He really didn't want to do anything more but what might she do if he said no? after a brief moment, Ryu answered \"... Yes\". \"Oh good!\" Cammy exclaimed. \"You didn't have a choice in the matter anyway so it would seem you answered correctly\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid down on her bed face down and arched her ass up in the air to spread her cheeks apart a little more. She brought Ryu high into the air above her ass. He definitely did not like where this was going. She placed Ryu between her cheeks as he tried to struggle but he was much too weak. Once between her cheeks, she brought her ass back down to level position with her body to close her firm buttocks, encasing the little warrior completely up to his shoulders with his head barely peaking out above her ass crack near the top of her behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer ass was not as sweaty as her soaking feet but still very sweaty. \"How does it feel to be powerless to my ass, Ryu?\" Cammy asked. He struggled but the hold she had on him was much more difficult and constricting than the previous binding. He was surrounded by toned muscle. \"When you show off your rear as much as I, you must take care to make sure it looks its best. Do you agree that it looks great?\" she asked as she began to clench her gluts together. Ryu let out a struggled moan in a futile attempt to answer. \"I think you do like it\", she answered for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feelings of her ass clenching and compressing against his entire body was... incredible! It was so impossibly smooth and round. Without any warning, Cammy rolled over onto her back, utterly smothering Ryu in her ass against the bed in the process. Even in his completely helpless state, she upped the torture by clenching tightly in a pattern. Not only could Ryu not breath, but any little breath he could manage to catch was quickly pushed out of him with every clench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy suddenly rolled back over, face down, followed by the sound of Ryu gasping for breath. Ryu tried to struggle free once more. If he could just get an arm free he might be able to pull himself out and make a break for the door. But it was like being burried in the earth itself. He could not even gain an inch in progress versus the muscle power of Cammy's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel that erection again\", Her voice came from afar it seemed. Ryu hadn't even noticed this time, possibly because he was partially numb from the constriction. But he did indeed have an erection. \"Tell me, how does <i>this</i> feel?\", she purred. Cammy, in a display of great ass control, alternated clenching one cheek at a time, jostling Ryu left and right each time. She picked up the speed of alternating her clenches which was creating serious friction around his body AND his penis. Since her ass was completely surrounding him, filling in every space like water, his penis was also surrounded by her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow is she doing this!? Ryu thought to himself. She is getting me off with her ass! Ryu let out more than just a moan of pleasure this time as the pleasure was immense! The sensation of being incased between her giantess ass while her alternated clenching of her left and right cheeks exually tortured him. But Ryu could not give in so easily no matter how good it felt. He continued his futile struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my. I wonder if I can accomplish my mission with my ass as well?\" she wondered herself, although Ryu knew the answer already. If she continued in this manner, he was going to explode. \"It sure sounds like you are enjoying it. I think I will continue for a little while and see what happens\", she purred in her signature erotic, stern tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd continue she did. Ryu jostled about in the entrapment of her ass as each cheek alternated their clenches while her ass sweat was providing more than enough lubricant in the process. He felt it in his penis as well. The cheeks encased his genitals and rubbed and rubbed together. Occasionally, she would throw in a full butt clench to add another erotic element to the pattern. The giant sweaty ass cheeks rubbing around his penis was getting to be too much! Left, right, left, right, left right! It felt so incredibly good! \"Please... Not... Again!...\", he whispered to himself in his struggle, but his last word barely left his mouth when his flow of cum began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu's body wriggled, tensed and spasmed as he began letting his fluids erupt everywhere. Cammy could feel it too and it only seemed to encourage her to go faster and harder... Which produced more cum than Ryu knew he had in him. The pick-up in her speed and technique seemed to summon more and more juices from Ryu on the spot. His orgasm was so long and good that it was quickly becoming too much and unbarable. \"Aaaaaagghghhhghh!\" Ryu let loose as Cammy's sexual ass assault continued. \"How much do you have in you, my toy?\" she teased as she furiously continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu struggled and squirmed as more and more fluid erupted from his immense pleasure. Cammy ended it with the grand finale of squeezing him with a good clench which produced one more spray from his penis. \"AAAuughgh... ungh...\" Ryu shouted out, then collapsed. His lower half and a LOT of Cammy's ass was covered in his own semen. It looked like a regular amount that a normal size man might produce. Ryu panted and breathed heavily from his thong assed prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done with you now. My mission is complete once more\", she said giving her own ass a good smack which jostled Ryu about a little more in the jiggle. Ryu, feeling weaker from his last release, simply passed out and faded into blackness once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCammy rolled to her side and released Ryu's limp naked body onto her bed. \"I had better clean you up for your next play date\" She whispered, scooping him up and carrying him away. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Feeling a great wind rush them, the Bros clung to the porous orange wall as Daisy raised her foot to walk, each step a shattering boom,threatening to send them both flying. With great determination, they continued on and up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn half an hour, they had just made it past the first ridge, reaching the tip of the shoe. A barren land of continous orange greeted them. They loked at each other, and went on, their incredibly small selfs trekking across Daisy's shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach and Daisy sat at a table from across each other, worriedly pondering about their missing plumbers.\"What did that mushroom do...\"Peach shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn came the gardener toads, all of them nervous.\"Your highness...\"One piped up.\"Those were the wrong mushrooms!

The climb would be steep and physically exhausting, but they knew they had to press on. Their very lives depended on it. As Mario made a motion for Luigi to get ready, the ground beneath them shook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH!\" Luigi screamed. He crouched down until he he was the height of a pancake and hid himself within the security of his cotton green hat. Mario contained much more courage, however, and wouldn't be phased by a small earthquake albeit it wasn't really an earthquake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy extended her knee and stretched it out to examine her ankle. She felt a small presence there that wasn't great enough to warrant scratching, but at least warrant a small examination. She moved her head towards her right ankle and stared closely at the pores of her brilliant tan skin. She gasped in shock once she made her discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario had stood his ground throughout the entire ordeal. Once the ground below him stopped, he looked to his brother to see if he was alright. Luigi slowly peaked out form underneath his hat and grew back to his original height. Mario could tell that his younger brother was still nervous, due to the persistent shaking of his knees. It was a completely mystery to Mario how Luigi had ever rescued him during those faithful years that had passed long ago. He would not ponder this thought too long however, as Luigi had gone back to recluse underneath his hat. Mario would soon find out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario's vision was soon filled by a giant eyeball. He took a step back. It was Daisy! Quickly reacting, he jumped up and down, waving his arms like a bird flying for the first time, trying to the giant princess' attention. It worked. The giant eyeball was replaced by a giant white finger which slowly scraped Mario and his cowardly brother up and into the hand of the Princess Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mario! Is that you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario covered his ears in and bent down, wincing in pain. Daisy realized her mistake and apologized in a much softer voice. Mario got up and answered Daisy's question with his familiar catchphrase, \"Yes, it's-a-me, Mario! I'm glad you found us Daisy. This makes our job much easier. Can you help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy thought for a moment. She literally had two people's lives in the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mario gulped. He had stories like this all across the Mushroom Kingdom, where a tiny man would be subject to a woman's complete whim, but he thought they were all fairy tales. Granted that Mario had been through and had seen much worse and much more believable stories, it just didn't ever occur to him that a giant woman would completely take control over small man without any motive. Yet, here he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fun were you thinking of having?\" Luigi whispered as he slowly came out of the shelter of his green hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing really. Maybe we could play hide and seek or maybe I can see how you guys taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario would not let this stand. He was a respected hero across these fabled lands; a living legend. He would be subject to be some toy for some preppy, tomboyish, over-pampered Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Daisy! My brother and I have gone through great lengths to save you and this entire kingdom all of these years. We will not be treated like toys! Now get Princess Peach and help us return to normal, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside Daisy snapped. Perhaps it was the tone that Mario used or perhaps it was just anyone telling her what to do, but when Mario finished his rant, she knew she would do everything in her power to make sure Mario stayed this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you little shrimp. You wanna play that way? Fine. I'll show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy plopped both plumbers inside her mouth and began to assault them viciously with her slithery and slippery pink tongue. She tasted every nook and cranny of their tasty bodies fully absorbing their delicious flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plumbers on the other hand weren't experiencing a feeling Ecstasy. They were tossed around the dark, wet slimy cavern with no more remorse. Their bodies slowly became drenched in saliva. Mario tried to grab a hold of Daisy's teeth, but found out that Daisy's tongue was just way to powerful for him. He eventually went into complete submission like his brother had already done long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Daisy finished, she spat out the two plumbers and without hesitation placed them within her brassiere in between her giant breasts. She adjusted her bra slightly and gave her breasts a slight slap. She patted them comfortably and made her way outside of Princess Peach's castle. She would make Mario and his brother pay when she got back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The soft supple warm skin of Daisy's breast provided much comfort for the displaced brothers. Lugi took this time to gather his courage. This was going to be a long day and it was important that he would remain strong throughout it all; for he and his brother's sake. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Daisy smiled triumphantly as she felt the two warm bodies bounce around one of her more tender areas. She felt an amount of unbridled power that could not be put into words. These little insignificant plumbers were nothing, but ants at her feet or to be more accurate, small humans in-between her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy arrived at her castle and ran to her private room, ignoring all of the Sarasaland toads and royal subjects. Once she got inside her room, she locked it and made her way to yellow table and the golden chair that was on the right side of the room. She placed her hand within the confines of her lacy white bra and pulled out the two brothers, their clothes still wet from their prior engagement with Daisy's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you little runts, I'm in charge now and if you want to go back to your run down home in the Mushroom Kingdom again, you'll do what I say! Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy slipped off her golden shoes and pulled down her yellow socks and slammed her giant bare feet in front of the plumbers; Luigi got the right and Mario got the left. Mario couldn't help, but notice that Daisy took her yellow/golden scheme as far as she could as even her toenails were painted with the unmistakable color of yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...rub my glorious toes. That is if you don't want to end up underneath them.\" Daisy capped off the end of her sentence by wiggling her toes from biggest to smallest, like a musician playing the piano from key to key in descending order according to sound. Mario looked up at the smiling giantess and realized there was no use trying to resist. He grabbed a hold of her pinky toe and began giving the toe throughout rubbing. Luigi was already on the second to last toe, however Daisy quickly commanded him to start over and go much slower. He obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure you get in-between the ridges too.\" Daisy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rubbing continued for about an hour. Daisy used this time to get comfortable in her gold-diamond encrusted chair. Mario's words had carried some weight, but she wouldn't let the words of a squeaking bug get to her. She fell asleep, thinking of all types of ways to torture the small bugs once they got done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario quickly alerted Luigi once he confirmed that Daisy was indeed asleep. Luigi carefully ceased rubbing and joined his brother in the middle of the bright yellow table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to get out of here, bro.\" Luigi squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, here's how. We're still small enough to squeeze through the crack in the door. All we have to do is get down from here and make our way to one of the royal advisory's rooms. They'll surely help us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright, bro. Whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario and Luigi climbed down the legs of the table, fully utilizing their physical skills they had used all of the years before. Once they landed on the yellow carpet, they made their way to the golden door. Luigi jumped for joy. He could barely contain himself until...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the three days since Mario and Peach had returned from the Mushroom Kingdom, she had been feverishly searching for any information that might lead them to the new treasure that Peach had heard about. Since then, the book had been unhelpful in revealing information, but at last, she came across a passage that described something new. She hopped excitedly off her chair and rushed out the door, turning toward Prof. Frankly's house. She knocked on the door and waited for the professor's answer. <br>\r\n\"...Hurry it up, Professor...\" she muttered after a few seconds had passed. Finally, the door began to open, and before it had even fully opened, she pushed inside. Mario and Peach were sitting at the table, and turned to greet her. Peach had just opened her mouth to speak when Goombella interrupted her.<br>\r\n\"I know, I'm here. That's not important right now. Take a look at this!\" she exclaimed, slamming the textbook onto the table. Peach and Mario leaned over it to read. After several moments, Peach spoke up.<br>\r\n\"So, this hidden tunnel is just next to the site of the Thousand-Year Door?\" <br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Goombella answered. \"There's a seal holding it closed that nobody's ever been able to open before, but I'd bet we can do it!\" Peach smiled and stood up. <br>\r\n\"Well, there's no sense wasting time here, then. Let's get going.\" She walked over to and out the door, followed by Mario, Goombella, and Frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, the group arrived at the huge room that contained the Thousand-Year Door. <br>\r\n\"It should be somewhere around here...\" Goombella said, moving along the wall. <br>\r\n\"Really, now. How are you going to know if you've found it?\" Frankly asked. Goombella ignored him and continued to press along the wall. <br>\r\n\"There's a huge crack in the wall here, but it buts off around....here! Aha!\" she stopped and stepped back from the wall. \"When we opened the Door, the cracks must have broken the seal!\"<br>\r\n\"That's perfect!\" Peach said, joining Goombella next to the cracked area. <br>\r\n\"Mario, give us a hand with this!\" Goombella called. Mario rushed over, Hammer in hand. Leaning back, he took a massive swing a the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resounding <i>CRACK,/i} the wall caved in. Goombella began to hop on the spot.<br>\r\n\"Yes! I knew we could find it!\" she yelled happily. The group walked into the newly-created doorway, and looked around. They were in a short tunnel that let off into a small atrium. In the centre of the room, there was a large chest.<br>\r\n\"Fascinating!\" Frankly said, rushing over to inspect it.<br>\r\n\"That was easier to find than I expected.\" Peach said, smiling. <br>\r\n\"Well, Mario? Let's get this thing open!\" Goombella yelled, dragging Mario toward the chest.<br>\r\n\"Stand-a back.\" Mario said to Frankly and Peach, grabbing the edge of the lid. He pulled on the lid and with a loud creak, the chest opened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Mario leaned over to inspect the inside, and Goombella hopped onto the rim to do the same. Suddenly, a blinding flash filled the room, and a powerful force pushed everyone in the room over, unconscious.</i></span></div></div>",

As she looked around, she immediately noticed a massive difference. She was back on the ground in front of the chest, which now seemed to tower miles above her head. The entire chamber seemed to have expanded in all directions. She noticed Mario lying on his back several yards away, and rushed over. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Mario...\" she said, nudging her friend. After a few moments, Mario's eyes opened, and he sat up. Glancing around in shock, he noticed the difference in the room as well. <br>\r\n\"What-a happened?\" he asked in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Don't ask me,\" Goombella responded, \"I'm just as confused as you are.\" The two of them stood up, looked toward the back of the chamber, and simultaneously gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the vast floor of the hidden chamber, they saw Peach and Frankly, unconscious. But, more importantly, it appeared that they had not been shrunken down by the flash from the chest. Both Peach and Frankly seemed to be at least a hundred feet tall, even as they were lying down. Mario and Goombella began to rush toward them, but at their new, tiny size, it took nearly a full minute. Reaching Peach's side, they looked upward. Her dress was like a massive wall of solid pink, its folds like huge ridges in a cliffside.<br>\r\n\"We've gotta wake her up so she can help us, Mario!\" Goombella said, hopping on the spot. Mario nodded, grabbed a hold of Goombella, and gave his customary leap, landing himself on one of the thicker folds in Peach's dress. From there, he repeatedly jumped to higher and higher ledges, finally reaching the top of what felt like Peach's leg. The pair started to run in the direction of Peach's face.<br>\r\n\"Did-a your textbook say anything about-a what was in that chest?\" Mario asked. <br>\r\n\"Nope. Only that it was a mysterious and ancient treasure of some kind.\" his partner responded.<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll-a have to figure that-a much out for ourselves.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a much shorter run than the first, the pair stopped. They had reached the underside of Peach's chest area, and her breasts stood before them, like a towering wall. Peach's rhythmic breathing caused her breasts to bob slightly, only seeming to increase their height. <br>\r\n\"I doubt even you'd be able to jump those, Mario.\" Goombella said, staring up at the organic mountains.<br>\r\n\"We'll-a have to try.\" Mario said, grabbing Goombella again. He planted his feet and gave a powerful jump,nearly reaching the peak of Peach's chest. At the apex of his jump, he swung Goombella upward and threw her toward the top. Goombella sailed through the air and landed, with a light thumping noise, on top of Peach's right breast. She immediately began to ruffle the fabric, and managed to create a fold large enough for Mario to climb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom their new vantage point, Mario and Goombella looked over at Peach's face.  From this perspective, it looked like a vast plain. Mario once again grabbed Goombella, stepped backward, and ran toward the other edge of Peach's breast. With a great flying leap, he just barely managed to land on the princess's chin. Mario and Goombella finally stopped to catch their breath, but to their immense misfortune, Peach suddenly began to stir. Her eyes fluttered open and she inhaled sharply. <br>\r\nIn a sudden panic, Mario yelled, \"Grab onto her hair!\" He and Goombella dove for a few loose strands of Peach's hair that were lying across her face, and grabbed on at the very same moment that the princess sat up. The motion caused the hairs to sway violently.   <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She leaned forward and began to shake the old Goomba. <br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Professor?\" she asked in concern as he began to move. Shaking himself back to his senses, Frankly looked up.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm fine, young lady. Are you?\" Peach nodded. Frankly turned toward the raised platform to look for their companions, but saw only the open chest. \"Now, wait a minute. What happened to Mario and... what's her name? Elizagoom?\"<br>\r\n\"It's Goombella, Professor.\" Peach said, looking over as well. She stood up and stepped toward the platform, but saw no sign of Mario or Goombella. Becoming very concerned, she looked into the chest, but found that it was empty, except for an odd symbol carved into the bottom. <br>\r\n\"Professor, we need to look for them!\" she said, rushing back and pulling Frankly to his feet. <br>\r\n\"Indeed, young lady.\" he said, \"Perhaps we should check outside the chamber.\"<br>\r\nThe two of them walked back to the opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Peach had been moving gently from her perspective, it certainly didn't feel that way to Goombella or Mario. The instant she sat up, the hairs they were clinging to shook violently. <br>\r\n\"Wuh-oh! Mario! Help me!\" Goombella yelped as her grip loosened. Mario couldn't risk removing one of his hands from the hair strands to reach down, or else he would lose his grip.<br>\r\nGoombella struggled for a moment, but slipped off of the hair.<br>\r\n\"Mariooooooooo!\" she shouted as she fell.<br>\r\n~WHUMP~<br>\r\nGoombella landed headfirst and with a thump in what seemed like a large canyon. She struggled to free her head, and pulled herself out onto her back. Breathing heavily, she realized that she had landed in Peach's cleavage. She only just had time to regain her bearings before her entire world thrust forward. She let out a scream as she slid forward, along the gap. Far ahead of her, she saw Peach's arm shaking Professor Frankly awake, and Peach's booming voice echoed around her. She couldn't make out the words over her own scream, and her attention snapped back to her immediate danger. She frantically kicked her legs to slow herself down, and narrowly avoided flying over the edge of Peach's dress. Planting her feet on the edge of the fabric, she looked up at where she and Mario had been hanging. High above, she saw Mario, still clinging to the swaying hairs. She sigh in relief, but once again began to panic as Peach moved to stand up. The giant princess's motion caused a small gap to open up between her dress and her chest, and with a scream, Goombella slipped forward into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother moment of sliding brought her to a stop an top of a firm strip of fabric, which she grabbed onto with all her strength. She was glad that nobody was around to see her cheeks redden as she realized that she was firmly clinging to Peach's bra. Even so, she finally had a moment to gather her thoughts. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peach stepped out into the cavernous chamber that housed the Thousand-Year Door, followed be Professor Frankly, and glanced around. There was no sign of Mario or Goombella, and she became even more worried.<br>\r\n\"Professor, what could that chest have done to them?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Your guess is as good as mine, my dear. Perhaps there was another section in Goombella's textbook that explained it in greater detail, but Goombella had the book with her when she and Mario opened the chest.\" Frankly responded with a sigh.<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll have to find another copy and research it for ourselves, then.\" Peach said, \"Do you have any in your house?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not. That book is terribly out of date, and all the new editions remove that entire section.\" Frankly said, shaking his head. Peach gave a small groan and began to walk toward the chamber's exit. <br>\r\n\"We're not going to get anything done standing around down here, let's get topside and see if we can find anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Young lady, it's very late by now. I'm just as concerned for our friends as you are, but it would be best for us to get some rest before we begin our search.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario had been in some bizarre situations since his first arrival in Rogueport, but none could hold a candle to this. As he dangled over Peach's chest, still supported only by the few strands of hair that still remained in his grasp, he thought the scenario over. He could only hope that Goombella was relatively safe, as he had last seen her tumbling along in Peach's cleavage and disappearing into the interior of her dress. His thoughts were interrupted by the echoing sounds of Peach and Frankly's voices, magnified to a hundred times their usual volume. They were too deafening for him to make out words, and he only hoped that they would stop talking soon. Without any particular warning, Peach suddenly swung around and began to walk again, this time toward the chamber's exit. The last thing he wanted was to fall, but at the same time, he wondered whether it might be best to drop down and make sure that Goombella was unharmed in her current location, wherever that was. He pondered this for a moment, but one quick look downward was all it took for him to decide that he would be better off holding on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Goombella was finally beginning to relax. Having secured herself into a stable position on the edge of the giant princess's bra, she was fairly safe from the effects of her movement and could finally take some time to think about what she had read in her textbook. She thought back to every detail she could remember from the passage, but nothing with any discernible connection to her situation came to mind. The book had said nothing even loosely related to shrinking, and she doubted that she had missed anything else in her weeks of searching. <br>\r\nShe was snapped out of her thought by a light suddenly appearing in the opening high above her head. It appeared that Peach had left the sewers and returned to the surface. A brief time later, she saw what looked like the ceiling of the Rogueport Inn miles above her. Watching the direction that Peach was moving in, she tried to determine where the princess was heading to. She saw Peach passing through a familiar doorway.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Oh, no.\" Goombella muttered, her eyes widening. She recognized the door way that Peach was passing through. It was the inn's bathroom. \"Oh, no no no, this is not a good time for a bath, princess!\" she yelled pointlessly. There was no way that Peach could hear her. For the first time since she had fallen down here, she returned to her state of panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario hadn't been properly calm at any point since he and Goombella had been reduced to their new height, which couldn't be any more than a few millimetres. Now was no exception, as Peach walked into the bathroom of the Rogueport Inn and closed the door. He saw her enormous arm reach up above him, before lowering back down, holding her crown. Next, she placed the crown on the edge of the sink and reached around to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach had initially disagreed with the professor about waiting until the morning to begin their search, but after a short conversation, she saw his point. So, here she was, back in her room in the Rogueport Inn. She turned on the bathwater, and reaching around to her back, she began to unfasten her dress. All things considered, it wasn't a very practical choice of clothing for the frequent travel that came with visiting Rogueport, but she hadn't been able to convince Toadsworth to let her bring very many of her other outfits. She was rather fond of the dress, but she would have much rather worn one of her athletic suits for mobility. Pulling off her dress, she placed it on the rack, and looked into the mirror. While she didn't look terribly dirty from their excursion, she certainly felt that way. Tucking a few loose strands of hair behind her ear, she removed her earrings, and placed them next to her crown. She gave one last glance in the mirror before reaching back around herself to remove her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs panicked as Mario was, it was very hard for him to avoid staring into the gigantic mirror as the princess inspected her body. He tried to remain focused on the danger he was in, but it proved to be quite a task. Even so, his mind was snapped back to attention when Peach's hand suddenly reached up and pushed on the very hair strands he was clinging to. The hairs swung back past Peach's ear, and Mario finally lost his grip. He landed on top of one of Peach's crystal earrings, but was only safe for a brief moment before Peach once again reached up and removed the earring. With nothing to grab onto, he flattened himself to the surface of the crystal and waited for it to stop. He looked up again as Peach stepped back, and again found himself mesmerized by the giant princess, particularly as he saw her reaching back to undo her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella, on the other hand, had nothing to distract her from being right back in danger, as the dress that had been shielding her from everything around her was suddenly removed. She saw that Peach was in the process of undressing for a bath, and she tried to think of how best to keep herself out of danger. Before she could think of anything, her vantage point suddenly jolted and began to move away from Peach's body. She had lost count of the number of times that she had cursed being a Goomba, and thereby lacking the utility of arms, and now was yet another. She dropped off of Peach's bra, letting out another drawn out scream of terror, but, once again, it was cut off her her making a landing. She shook her head and looked at what she had fallen onto.<br>\r\nIf Goombella had been embarrassed about being on Peach's bra, it was nothing compared to this. She felt her face turn the brightest red as she looked at her new seat. Goombella dearly wished that she had been able to hold onto Peach's bra, which would have left her in safety on the vanity, but instead, she found herself sitting on Peach's firm nipple, which stiffened slightly in reaction to her presence. It also served to indicate to her just how tiny she and Mario really were, as she was now dwarfed by Peach's nipple alone. Looking at it, she guess herself to be about one millimetre in height, which made the chances of being noticed by the princess quite slim. Before she could finish thinking this over, she realized that Peach had removed her panties as well, as the giant princess was stepping into the bath. As she tightened her feet around Peach's nipple, she found her face somehow heating up even further, and braced herself to hit the hot water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach gave an immensely satisfied sigh as she lowered herself into the bath. The water pooled into all the usual places, and she felt the grime of the sewers washing off immediately. She began to idly hum to herself as she sat in the water, and, in spite of her serious worry over Mario and Goombella, found herself relaxing and sinking deeper into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief moment, Goombella was submerged as the nipple she was clinging to entered the warm bathwater, and she released her grip to swim upwards. She surfaced, her hair hanging out of her pith helmet, and she shook the water out of her eyes. In front of her, she saw Peach's neck and face, her eyes closed. She scanned the bath for any part of Peach's body that might being poking out of the water, but was surprised as Peach adjusted herself, causing the tops of her breasts to resurface. Goombella sat down next to Peach's nipple as goosebumps quickly formed on the giant woman's skin. She pulled her textbook out of her satchel, and let the water drip out. Looking in the book, she saw that the old, faded ink had run out of the pages, and she threw the book aside, back into the water. She felt, for the first time since waking up at this size, not fear, but worry and sadness. Without any information on whatever had been in that chest, how would she and Mario restore their original size? <br>\r\nFrom ahead of her, Peach began to hum a soothing melody that calmed Goombella's nerves. The initial sadness faded, and she felt reassured knowing that, once they got Peach's attention, they would be relatively safe.<br>\r\nWithout warning, a shadow passed over her, and she looked up. Peach's hand was coming down toward her breast, and the impact caused the entire surface to jiggle slightly. This served to remind Goombella that, in spite of Peach's kindness and good intentions, she was a major potential threat, as long as she remained unaware of Goombella's presence on her mammary. Peach's massive hand began to move, and Goombella gasped, as once again, she was forced into a hazardous situation.    </span></div></div>",

The massive digit collided with her and shoved her backwards into the soft skin of Peach's nipple. Her entire body was completely immobilized by the heavy force pushing in around her. Peach's finger began to move around, massaging the nipple, and it began to stiffen and expand slightly. Goombella felt he pith helmet slip off of her head and away from her, leaving her even more unprotected  than she had been before. After several long moments of this, Peach's finger finally lifted away and Goombella was able to see again. She dropped off of the side of Peach's nipple, which was now noticeably larger, and looked across the water to Peach's other breast. The princess was new playing with the other nipple, and giggling to herself. Goombella groaned, trying to shake off the considerable pain that she had been in.<br>\r\nIf something as tiny as Peach's nipple and fingertip could be that dangerous at this size, she didn't want to know what larger hazards could do.<br>\r\nShe scanned the bathwater for any sign of her lost helmet. Peach's movement was causing the water to churn and splash around significantly, but she finally spotted her helmet amidst the waves, floating near Peach's neckline. Deciding that she'd rather not be anywhere near Peach's more sensitive areas while the princess was still playing with herself, she dove back into the water and started toward the floating helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach gave a self-satisfied giggle and removed her finger and thumb from around her nipple. It was uncommon for her to have any opportunity to have a bit of 'me-time' when at home in the castle, as she usually had one or two servants assigned to bathing her. She stretched out in the bathwater, and ran her fingers through her hair for a moment. She picked up the shampoo bottle from the edge of the bath, and started applying it to her long hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella retrieved her helmet and placed it back on her head. The giant princess was now washing her long hair, something that Goombella wished she could take the time to do. She decided to swim toward Peach's face, hoping to draw her attention again. As she reached Peach's neck, she saw that she wouldn't be able to get up to her chin from here, and kicked her way over to Peach's flowing hair. <br>\r\nThis jogged her memory, and she quickly looked around.<br>\r\n\"Mario! You in here?\" she called. No response. Sighing, she grabbed onto a lock of Peach's hair and secured herself into a stable position. This would, at least, be a better seat than the edge of the princess's bra, or her nipple.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Goombella temporarily left her spot in Peach's hair as the princess began to rub shampoo into it, and returned as soon as she had rinsed it out. A moment later, Peach sat up and climbed out of the bathtub. She took a towel from the rack, and began to dry herself off. As she did his, Goombella looked over toward the countertop. She knew that Mario had made it into the inn with them, but wondered when he had finally left his previous spot in Peach's hair. She scanned across the objects on the countertop. Peach's blue earrings were sitting next to her crown and gloves. If Mario was there as well, he was too small to be seen from this distance. <br>\r\nBy now, Peach had finished drying her body off, and she reached for another towel. Goombella let out a small gasp. In her distraction,she had forgotten that Peach would be drying her hair, too. She didn't have time to move. Peach began to vigorously rub the towel over her head, and Goombella was tossed into the depths of the dense tangle that made up Peach's long hair. The constant motion caused her to very quickly be tangled into the endless forest of hair around her, and she found herself again unable to move. She was in complete darkness. She couldn't see or hear anything, and was left with only the powerful smell of Peach's shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario had originally thought to use the time that Peach spent in the bath to think up a plan of action for finding Goombella and catching Peach's attention, but his on attention had finally been completely overtaken by the sight of the towering princess once she had removed her clothes. He had ceased moving entirely, and simply stood on the counter and stared. He gave complete attention to absolutely everything Peach did throughout the bath. It was only when she had finished drying herself off that he finally snapped back to reality. The gigantic princess was walking toward the counter to retrieve her clothes, and Mario saw his chance. Peach placed her hand on the counter as she picked up her dropped panties, and he hopped onto her index finger. Grabbing on, he was lifted through the air and was able to see several key areas of Peach's huge body up close as she went about pulling her undergarments and pajamas on.<br>\r\nHe had to force himself to resist the urge to dive into Peach's panties as she pulled them on, and instead made a leap onto her shoulder as she adjusted the neckline of her top. Peach walked out of the bathroom and over to her bed to sit down. Once there, she picked up a hairbrush from her bedside table and began to run it through her flowing hair.<br>\r\nMario gave a moment's thought, before deciding to wait it out and look for a chance to get closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella had now spent several minutes trapped in the depths of Peach's hair, but finally, the strands around her began to loosen. Once some fell away, she was able to see slightly. It looked like Peach was brushing her hair, which made Goombella's situation much better. She saw Peach's bed far below, and began to lower herself down through the long, blonde hair to reach the blanket. <br>\r\n\"You know, princess, I've always admired your hairstyles, but I really could have gone without getting this familiar with them.\" she muttered to herself as she descended. It was lucky that Peach let her hair grow so long, or it wouldn't have reached the bed. Goombella dropped down and looked up at the princess. Peach, of course, towered over her, completely oblivious to the tiny Goomba's presence. From down here, she had no chance of getting Peach's attention, so she sat down to watch her brush her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach, at last, finished the lengthy job of brushing her long hair, and put the brush back onto the table. She turned herself around, stretched, and leaned back onto her pillow. She gave a quiet sigh. Even if she could relax here, she was terribly worried about Mario and Goombella. Who knows what that mysterious chest could have done to them? She closed her eyes, and gradually drifted to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that Mario just couldn't catch a break. He had been so focused on watching Peach's hairbrush that he failed to notice her moving to turn and lie down. The rapid motion she made to turn threw Mario off of her shoulder. He yelled as he fell what seemed like miles down toward her bed before landing on the blanket. It seemed as if his tiny size affected the force of his impact, as he felt relatively unharmed by the crash landing. There was no time to relax, though, as he looked back up and saw Peach leaning back down, right toward him. Under her weight, the mattress sagged and became a steep slope. He rolled helplessly down, and finally came to a stop against Peach's body, only to be immediately flattened underneath her. The stitching of the mattress left holes just large enough for him to breathe, but wherever he was under Peach, he couldn't move at all. This was going to be a long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella had watched, her eyelids drooping, as Peach placed the hairbrush onto the table and turned herself around. She was on the verge of tipping over and falling asleep until she saw a tiny, red speck falling from Peach's shoulder. A familiar yell suddenly reached her ears, and she jumped to her feet. At least she finally knew where Mario was. She watched in shock as Mario rolled along the sagging mattress and vanished under Peach's enormous rear end. In spite of the danger Mario was in, she broke into a giggling fit. The laughter, combined with her exhaustion, prevented her from whipping herself into a panicked frenzy, and she dropped onto the blanket, her eyes closed. As her laughter slowly receded, she muttered, \"Hope you've always liked your girlfriend's butt, Mario.\"<br>\r\nMoments later, the minute Goomba was asleep.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The moments shortly after Peach's alarm clock went off were a jumbled mess for Goombella. The deafening noise of the alarm jolted her awake, but before she could react, the ground under her seemed to jump upward, and she was tossed into the air. The other end of Peach's vast blanket drifted down onto her and surrounded her, once again, with darkness. Giving a tired groan, she began to push along under the blanket to find her way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant the alarm woke her up, Peach sat bolt upright, tossed her blanket to the foot of the bed, and spun herself to the side. She practically jumped out of bed, and rapidly dug through her suitcase for another dress. She was still slightly annoyed with Toadsworth for only allowing her to bring several duplicates of her usual 'public appearances' dress. Deciding that it didn't really matter which specific one she wore, she pulled one out and walked into the bathroom with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario had been through a truly uncomfortable night. Whatever area of Peach's body he had been trapped under had pinned him down for the entire night, completely immobile, and he felt as if he needed several hours worth of stretching to work it out. Unfortunately, what little sleep he had gotten was aggressively interrupted as Peach flung herself out of bed. Mario was, for a moment, pulled into the air, stuck to Peach's body, but had to grab onto the fabric of her pajamas as soon as he began to slip. He looked at what little of Peach's body he could see, and groaned loudly as he deduced that he had been stuck under Peach's rear all night. She stopped moving for several moments, and Mario took the time to scramble up the back of her buttock to reach her waistline. <br>\r\n\"This is the worst idea I've-a had in weeks...\" he mumbled to himself, pulling aside a tiny portion of the fabric on Peach's waistline. He slipped his lower body into the gap, and let go. As he had expected, the fabric held him tightly against her body, and he finally had a few moments to relax, before Peach began to move again. He glanced at the fabric around him, worried that it might not hold during the movement, but it seemed stable. The last thing he needed at the moment was to find himself trapped in Peach's pants. The giant princess walked into the bathroom and pulled her pajama top off. Mario's eyes suddenly widened. He had been too tired to think about it, but he very quickly realized that Peach would be taking off her pants in a moment as well. He struggled with the waistline, but it was much tougher to move from this position. <br>\r\nFar off on both his sides, Peach's hands closed around the waistline of her pants, and she pulled them off. The motion was so rapid, Mario was left behind, and he flailed his arms for something to grab on to. He scrambled onto the edge of Peach's panties, and mentally slapped himself for getting stuck in this position. <br>\r\nUnexpectedly, Peach took a hold of the sides of her panties, and sharply tugged them upward. Mario was again left behind by the rapid motion, but this time, found himself suddenly in complete darkness, surrounded by a combination of rough fabric and soft skin. The motion stopped as suddenly as it had begun, but the damage was done.<br>\r\nMario slid to a stop on the fabric below him. <br>\r\n\"Mama mia...\" he groaned as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. He was sealed into Peach's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella, meanwhile, finally got herself out of the blanket. She looked around the endless hotel room, and saw Peach in the bathroom. The princess was putting on her usual dress, and she hoped Peach would be walking back over to the bed, so she'd have a chance to grab onto her and be taken along to wherever she was heading. Something clicked in her memory, and she jumped up.<br>\r\n\"Mario!\" she called, \"Are you still on the bed?\" Mario didn't respond. Goombella looked over the vast folds of the blanket, but saw no sign of him. She turned back to Peach, and to her relief, the princess began to walk back over to the bed. As Peach reached down to pick up her crown and earrings, she placed one hand on the edge of the bed. Goombella dove onto her glove, and held on. She scrambled onto one of Peach's fingers as she lifted her hand up to reattach her earring. Goombella jumped back into her hair, and secured herself back into the same spot as before.     </span></div></div>",

How was your rest?\" she asked, giving Peach a bright smile. Peach smiled in return.<br>\r\n\"Lovely.\" she said. <br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it. If you want some breakfast, I've already laid out some things on the table over there.\" The girl said, gesturing to the table in the corner of the room. \"You look like you're in  hurry today, Princess.\"<br>\r\n\"You're right about that.\" Peach responded, walking over to the table. \"I'll just take something for later.\" <br>\r\nPeach picked up a few things from the table, and dropped them into a bag. She waved to the Toad girl as she stepped out the door. She made a beeline for Frankly's house, and knocked on the door. A few moments later, it swung open.<br>\r\n\"Good, you're here, Princess.\" The elderly Goomba said, stepping aside. Peach entered the house, and sat down at the table. Frankly, it seemed, had been researching for at least an hour already. \"I'm sorry to say that I haven't found anything of use yet, but we might pick something up if we work together.\" Frankly said, taking his seat.<br>\r\nWithout another word, the two began to scan through the stack of books on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella had only begun to realize how very hungry she was as she looked down at the breakfast table from her vantage point in Peach's hair. As Peach walked toward Frankly's house, Goombella hoped that she would have an opportunity to retrieve some of the food for herself and Mario. She knew that Mario must have secured some sort of position on the giant princess's body, and wondered when they would be able to reconvene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario, meanwhile, was not having such a peaceful time. He was just barely able to see in his latest prison, but it wasn't much help. He was constantly being jostled around by Peach's movement, and could do very little to adjust his position. A ways above him were three things that he dearly wished he wasn't so close to at this tiny size. The openings that were Peach's anus and vagina were the two that he most strongly hoped to avoid, as there was no guarantee that he would be able to escape from inside Peach's body if he were pulled in, especially if his presence cause her to become aroused. Just above Peach's relaxed clitoris was a small tuft of blond hair, which might have made a probable escape route, if it were not so densely tangled. At long last, Peach stopped moving for several moments, and Mario pushed himself to his feet. The mixed smells permeating the air in the confine of Peach's panties were nearly overpowering at his tiny size, and he knew he needed to get out as soon as he could manage it. As he began to climb up the fabric that made up the front, he heard a muffled voice that sounded like Professor Frankly's. He grabbed a firm hold on the fabric as soon as Peach began to move again, but panicked as she suddenly lowered down. She seemed to have sat down on what was probably a chair, and Mario was glad that he had moved away from the centre of her undergarment when he did. Looking down, he saw that Peach's vagina would have completely engulfed him, had he neglected to move to this position. Peach was sitting completely still, and Mario braced himself to jump to the patch of hair that clung to Peach's groin. He threw himself from the fabric, and swung his arms wildly, trying to secure a hold on one of the many hairs.<br>\r\n\"Aha, yes!\" he shouted as he hooked one of his arms into a tangle of hairs. He swung his other arm up and grabbed another cluster of hairs, followed by another. It was slow work, but he was gradually reaching Peach's waistline.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After several tense moments of climbing, Mario latched a hand onto Peach's waistband. Forcing his arms under the fabric, he slowly pulled himself up and out of Peach's undergarment. While her dress still blocked out most of the light in the area, it was still noticeably brighter here than it had been in the confines of her panties. Peach's legs were hanging off of the edge of the chair. Mario walked to her knee, and looked down toward the floor. He wouldn't be able to get back up Peach's body easily if he started downward, so he turned back and approached her midsection. The loose fabric draping over his head would be a much more effective handhold than her panties had been.<br>\r\n\"Let's-a go...\" Mario muttered grimly, grabbing the pink fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella glanced up toward Peach's face. The princess was completely immersed in the large book she was reading through, only looking up occasionally to ask Professor Frankly a question. A plate was sitting next to the book, and was covered in the various food items that she had brought from the Inn. Judging by Peach's preoccupation, Goombella surmised that it would be safe to slip down and take some of the food for herself. She loosened her grip on Peach's hair and slid downward to her shoulder. From there, she scampered along the princess's arm and onto the tabletop. There was a small stack of bread slices on the edge of the plate, which Goombella started toward. She made several jumps from the tabletop, grabbing crumbs from the bottom slice as she went. After hungrily tearing through a few for herself, and tucked the rest away and ran back to Peach's arm. Sitting down, she looked around for any sign of Mario's presence. He didn't seem to be anywhere on the table or the outside of Peach's clothing.<br>\r\n\"He'd better get here soon...\" she thought to herself, leaning against Peach's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProgress was going much more smoothly by now for Mario. He had easily made it up the height of Peach's stomach area, and now looked up at what remained of his climb. Peach's breasts loomed over him, tightly secured by her bra. Now that he wasn't in immediate danger, his thoughts began to drift as he stared at her enormous body. Shaking his head, he chose his next course of action. Making a jump onto the center strap of Peach's bra, he continued his ascent. Grabbing the firmest hold he could manage onto the harder fabric that made up the bra cup, he began to shimmy upward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella stood up, finished with her brief rest. Mario hadn't appeared as of yet, so she climbed back onto Peach's arm to look for him herself. She moved back up the princess's arm and onto her shoulder, looking around again. After several moments, she groaned and began to gather up the nearby strands of hair to secure herself back into her usual position, but just as she started, a red dot finally appeared in her vision. She couldn't suppress a fit of giggles as she watched Mario climb onto the top of his girlfriend's right breast. She dropped off of Peach's shoulder and slid down to meet up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario finally stood up, groaning and looking around, just in time to see Goombella slide to the surface of Peach's breast in front of him.<br>\r\n\"Finally caught up, have you?\" she called, with a cheeky grin crossing her face. Mario simply adopted a thoroughly annoyed expression and walked forward to meet up with his friend.<br>\r\n\"Not really in-a the mood to joke around.\" he said, as he neared Goombella. The Goomba shook her hair out of her eyes, and jumped upward to give Mario a teasing kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n\"Come on, grouchy. We need to decide on what to do next.\" she said, still grinning. Mario opened his mouth to respond, when a loud thump sounded behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach frowned at the book she was looking through was she reached the last page. <br>\r\n\"Nothing in here, professor.\" she said, looking up at Frankly.<br>\r\n\"I found a few others last night, princess. They're just in the box over there.\" the old Goomba responded, motioning toward a box opposite the table.<br>\r\nPeach closed the book with a fairly loud thump, and got up to retrieve another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella let out a frightened yelp as the ground beneath the two of them lurched. Peach was crossing over to the other side of the room, and her movement knocked Mario and Goombella off their feet. They attempted to regain their footing, only managing once Peach stopped walking and stooped down. <br>\r\n\"We should-a get back into her hai-\" <br>\r\nMario's instruction was cut off as Peach leaned forward to search the box. Her chest pressed against the box, and the impact tossed Mario and Goombella forward. They tumbled helplessly, once again, this time landing together in the valley that was Peach's cleavage.<br>\r\n\"No more-a sudden moves...\" Mario said desperately. Unfortunately, his hope was not fulfilled as Peach pulled another large book out of the box and stood up. Her breasts had been compressed slightly by pushing against the box, but they now bounced back to their original position. The gap beneath Mario and Goombella opened up just enough in the movement to cause the two of them to slide downward before sealing again. Goombella heard a particularly angry series of muffled yells as she struggled to free herself from the firmly pressing walls of flesh on both her sides.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The minutes of searching dragged into hours as Peach and Frankly sat in relative silence, scanning through the stack of old books. Nothing seemed to jump out at either of them, and Peach's worries about the safety of Mario and Goombella only continued to get worse. She had long since eaten the food that she had brought over, and it was getting to be the mid-afternoon. <br>\r\n\"Professor...\" she mumbled, closing another book and staring down at the table.<br>\r\n\"Yes, princess?\" Frankly answered, sounding only half-awake.<br>\r\n\"It's been almost a whole day since Mario and Goombella vanished,\" Peach said.<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to keep hoping that they're alright, princess. There's not much else we can do until we find some information that might help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario and Goombella were, of course, in one of the safest positions they had yet discovered since their shrinking. However, neither were feeling particularly good about the situation, as they both sat still, no longer making any effort to escape from Peach's cleavage. Her breasts were like massive soft mountains, holding both of them firmly in place, and they were completely unable to escape. Both had gotten some very uncomfortable sleep in their prison, but it did very little to improve their moods. It wasn't until the late afternoon that Peach finally stood up to leave Frankly's house. Her rhythmic movements jostled the two of them back and forth slightly, but they still didn't have any chance to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach sat on the edge of her bed, back in the hotel. Her mind was still filled with worry; neither she nor Frankly had been able to find anything even remotely helpful in a full day's searching. She felt slightly better when she thought about all the dangers that Mario had survived in the past, but she wasn't completely confident, seeing as she still had no idea what had happened to her two friends. After thinking these things through for a while, she stood up again, and walked into the bathroom, hoping that a shower might clear her head. She started the water and removed her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaa-!\" Goombella yelped as the walls on either side of her lurched for the first time in the day. Unbeknownst to her, Peach had just removed her bra, causing her breasts to bounce as they were released. She found that she had a tiny bit more space to move, but still couldn't seem to pull herself free. Mario was experiencing the very same thing next to her. They felt their prison shifting, unaware that Peach was lowering herself into the bath. They suddenly became aware of this, however, as the narrow crevasse they were in suddenly began to fill with warm water. Finally, Peach's breasts separated just enough for both of them to escape, and a moment later, Mario and Goombella surfaced in the shifting  bathwater. <br>\r\n\"Another... bath...?\" Goombella gasped, taking in several deep breaths of the steamy air. Mario looked around them. In front of him was Goombella, with the tops of Peach's breasts just out of the surface of the water behind her. Behind him, naturally, was Peach's head. The princess had her eyes closed as she hummed another relaxing tune.<br>\r\n\"Should we... go to her-a face?\" he asked, turning to Goombella.<br>\r\n\"Anywhere other than her chest, Mario.\" the Goomba answered.<br>\r\nThe two of them began to swim toward Peach's neckline in the shifting water. As they passed through her tangled hair, which floated gently on the surface, Peach stopped opened her eyes. Mario noticed that she looked rather nervous, and he could only guess that she was worried about his and Goombella's well-being. They reach her neck, and pulled themselves up toward her face using several loose hair strands.<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Mario said, grabbing onto Goombella. He planted his legs firmly against Peach's shoulder, and jumped, still holding her hair. He swung the strands toward the princess's chin, and with another strong jump, he and Goombella landed safely on it.<br>\r\n\"Think we'll be able to get her attention?\" Goombella asked, looking up at the massive face in front of them.<br>\r\n\"It's-a worth a shot.\" Mario answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Mario and Goombella, it seemed, were not allowed to be lucky. Just as they had been nearing the upper half of Peach's face, the princess shifted her shoulders back and leaned forward, sitting up in the water. If she hadn't been thinking to herself, she might have heard two tiny yells from just in front of her. She reached for the bar of soap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario and Goombella, yet again, crashed down onto Peach's breasts. They slid along the wet skin, still yelling in a combination of frustration and terror.<br>\r\n\"Grab it! Grab iiiiiit!\" Goombella shrieked as they neared Peach's nipple. Both of them gave a tremendous push toward it, grabbing a shaky hold on the wet surface.<br>\r\n\"She's-a going to clean herself off now...\" Mario said, struggling to maintain his hold.<br>\r\nGoombella grunted loudly, pulling herself onto the top of the nipple. \"Trust me. The princess's nipple is NOT the place we want to be right now.\" she said, pulling Mario up.<br>\r\n\"But, we can't-a get to anywhere else!\" Mario replied, watching Peach's hand as it ran the soap over her torso.<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Goombella said, \"we're just gonna have to hope that we can hold on.\"<br>\r\nPeach's hands were now both running along her skin, layering soap onto her body. As she ran them over the surfaces of her breasts, Mario and Goombella raced for the impact.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mario took the best grip he could of Peach's soaked skin with one hand, tightly holding Goombella with the other. A moment later, a crushing force slammed into both of them as Peach's massive hand slid over them. Once it passed, they found themselves pinned to the giant princess's nipple, coated thickly in soap. Peach had moved onto her neck and back as Mario and Goombella shook off the excess soap. Both groaned in frustration as they noticed that both of their hats has been dragged away by the impact. Goombella's blond hair, free of her pith helmet, hung limply on the back of her head. <br>\r\n\"Well, it could've been worse.\" Goombella offered. They sat on Peach's nipple for a fair while longer, as the princess finished applying her soap and shampooing her hair. Finally, Peach lowered herself down into the water to rinse off. Mario held onto her and Goombella again, both of them holding their breath as they were submerged. Moments later, they burst back out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach slowly stood up, letting the water fall from her body before stepping out of the bathtub. She pulled the drainplug, and began to towel herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Mario held his firm grip on Peach's nipple as the towel rubbed over their heads. From there, Peach made her way back into her room with her clothes. She pulled her panties on, along with a set of pajamas, before dropping onto her bed.<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Mario asked, as they stood on top of Peach's slowly bobbing breast. <br>\r\n\"We could just get some sleep, I guess.\" Goombella said. \"It's not like we'll be able to wake her up, anyway.\" <br>\r\nMario nodded, and sat down, lying next to Peach's nipple, which towered over them at their tiny size. The two of them fell asleep quickly, as Peach's chest rhythmically raised an fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Peach's movement shook them both awake. As she sat up, they fell against her nipple, which twitched significantly on impact. <br>\r\n\"We should get-a out of here.\" Mario said, reaching up to the fabric of the pajamas. Just as he did so, however, it was pulled upward rapidly as Peach took off the garment. Goombella gasped, taking Mario's attention.<br>\r\n\"...Why don't we ever think these things through?\" she asked in a moaning voice. Mario turned to look in the same direction, and his eyes widened.<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" he mumbled, as Peach's titanic bra seemed to fly toward them. They were both far to sleepy to react in time, and Peach's bra flattened them against her skin, pressing them firmly into her nipple. Mario was well beyond the point of embarrassment, and was only getting to feel more and more defeated as Peach continued to accidentally throw them into danger or entrapment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach adjusted her bra, giving her breasts a light slap. She put on her usual dress, and left the hotel room. Taking some food from the breakfast table again,she left for Frankly's house. The professor, however, was not there. There was a note pinned to his door, stating that he had gone down into the underground to inspect the room in which Mario and Goombella had vanished. Peach was just turning to walk toward the entrance pipe, when something caught her eye. As she had pulled the note from the door, she noticed a tiny red speck on her forearm. Thinking that she had accidentally cut her arm on something, she rubbed a finger against the spot, but only saw it move along with her finger. Confused, she moved her arm closer to her eye, inspecting the tiny dot. <br>\r\nShe gasped as she observed the miniscule object. It looked shockingly similar to Mario's hat, but far, far smaller. Carefully picking it up, she held right up to her eye.<br>\r\n\"...Mario?\" she mumbled, staring at the near-microscopic hat. She quickly looked at her arms again. On the other, she spotted another tiny object. Inspecting it, she gasped again. It was, quite clearly, Goombella's pith helmet. Her mind reeling, she slipped both hats into her glove, and rushed off toward the pipe leading into the sewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found Frankly staring at the mysterious chest that had caused Mario and Goombella's disappearance.<br>\r\n\"Professor!\" she called, rushing toward him. He turned. \"I found something!\"<br>\r\nShe held out the two tiny pieces of headwear.<br>\r\n\"They're Mario and Goombella's hats, Professor!\" she said urgently. \"Do you think that... the chest might have...\"<br>\r\n\"Shrunken our two friends down? That seems like the most likely possibility.\" Frankly said, nodding. \" Where did you find these?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"They were... on my arms. Stuck there, I mean.\" Peach said.<br>\r\n\"Interesting. We must go back to the hotel. If their hats found their way there, then Mario and Goombella must have as well.\"</span></div></div>",

Frankly glanced around.<br>\r\n\"Nobody else has been in here today?\" he asked, moving toward the dresser.<br>\r\n\"Not since I left.\" Peach said.<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Good. Hopefully, our friends will be here, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario could barely make out Peach and Frankly's voices from within the tight confines of the princess's bra. He could tell that they were deep in discussion, but from how much Peach was moving, he guessed that they weren't in the professor's house. He couldn't make a sound loud enough for Goombella to hear, so he attempted to move the arm nearest to her. It was barely movable, but he managed to shift it enough to nudge Goombella a few times. She gave a twitch that he supposed meant that she was paying attention. He began to move as much as he could manage, wriggling in place. Goombella took the hint and began to do the same. They continued this, hoping that they might catch Peach's attention.<br>\r\nAfter a short time had passed, the massive nipple that pinned them in place began to stiffen at the stimulation they caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...!\" Peach squeaked as she felt the light sensation on her breast. She adjusted her bra quickly, hoping that Frankly wouldn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Peach's nipple hardened, it became more difficult for Mario and Goombella to move. Suddenly, the fabric pressing against them shifted, pushing them together. As it settled, Mario found himself face to face with Goombella. The new placement gave them just enough freedom to speak.<br>\r\n\"You think she's noticed yet?\" Goombella asked, one side of her face still being flattened.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully. Let's-a keep trying.\" Mario replied. They carried on with wriggling to the best of their ability, waiting for another response from Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach blushed as the stimulation on her breast continued. <br>\r\n\"I-I'll check in the bathroom...\" she muttered, quickly moving away from Frankly.<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" the professor answered.<br>\r\nPeach moved into the bathroom, closing the door behind her. She reached around to her back, unlatching her bra strap. She pulled off the undergarment and slipped it out of her dress. Holding it up to her face, she checked the inside of the cup for any loose threads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario and Goombella were abruptly interrupted in their effort as the immense weight on them lifted away. They dropped down a short distance, landing on top of Peach's now-stiffened nipple. Above their heads, they saw the bra being pulled out of Peach's dress.<br>\r\n\"C'mon!\" Goombella said, jumping to her feet. She  jumped up and took a hold of the fabric, Mario following behind. They made their way up the interior of the dress, stopping at the neckline. Peach was inspecting her bra, her eyes flicking back and forth. Goombella ran toward the princess's hair, climbing back up into it. As they reached her face, Peach was running a finger along the inside of her bra cup. <br>\r\n\"Now-a what?\" Mario panted, hunching over. Goombella paused.<br>\r\n\"We jump, I guess.\" she said after a moment's hesitation. Without any other warning, she grabbed Mario and leapt out of Peach's hair. They fell through the air for a moment, landly softly back in Peach's bra cup.The princess was still running her finger over the fabric.<br>\r\n\"Grab on!\" Goombella shouted as Peach's massive digit slid toward them. The two of them took a hold of Peach's glove as it passed by. A few seconds later, Peach removed her finger from the bra cup. She tossed the bra into the nearby laundry basket.<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm going without it.\" her loud voice muttered. Mario and Goombella held onto her finger as tightly as they could.<br>\r\n\"Wait until we get close to her face again!\" Goombella said.</span></div></div>",

He reached a hand up to grab onto the edge of Peach's waistband, when suddenly, the cluster of hairs he was holding onto split apart. He let out another frightened yell as he fell back downward. The fall was short-lived, as he landed on a soft, fleshy surface, face-first. Quickly jumping to his feet, he groaned in frustration. His escape attempt had only gotten him into what a arguably an even worse position. He was still trapped in Peach's panties, but now, he found himself standing on her clitoris. Until a moment ago, it had been calm, but it reacted to the sudden contact and movement. The organ began to move very slightly, extending out from its hood.<br>\r\n\"Mama mia...\" Mario muttered, watching his makeshift platform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was just reading through a section detailing the history of wars in and around Rogueport and sampling her breakfast when she felt a sudden stimulation. Her cheeks reddened, and she looked up at Professor Frankly. <br>\r\n\"Er, excuse me for a moment.\" she stuttered, standing up and shuffling toward the door. She crossed back to the Inn and rushed up the stairs to her room. There, she sat down on the bed, pulled her glove off, and slipped her hand under her dress and into her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario had to throw himself onto his stomach and the skin of Peach's nether regions to hold on as she began to move rapidly. Once she finally stopped, a light appeared above his head. Her giant fingers descended into the interior of the undergarment. Mario didn't give it a second thought. He jumped onto her finger and held on to her fingernail ad tightly as he could manage.</span></div></div>",

The princess seemed to be experiencing some kind of irritation, but she couldn't tell what it was. Holding firm to her position in Peach's hair, she watched the scenery fly by until Peach stopped in her room in the Inn and she dropped onto the bed. Goombella gasped and looked averted her eyes as Peach tugged her glove off of her hand and forced her hand into her panties. After a moment, Peach's arm began a slight rhythmic motion, and the princess began to utter a series of low moans. Trying to distract herself, Goombella again wondered where Mario was, but gasped again as a thought occurred to her.<br>\r\n\"It couldn't be Mario down there...\" she mumbled, her mind slowly sliding into a state of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that this was not Mario's day would be a criminal understatement. He had grabbed onto Peach's finger without a second thought when it had descended into his prison, but within a mere few seconds, he was regretting it. Peach's hand had continued to lower for a very brief moment, and suddenly she began to gently massage the exposed lips of her vagina. The smell was far too much for Mario, and his vision began to fade. The motions became increasingly aggressive, and he felt himself slip off of Peach's fingertip. Far above him, he vaguely heard the princess moaning as she continued. The sound began more and more muffled as he slowly slid from his position. His mind was moving agonizingly slowly, but he managed to make one judgement. Peach was unintentionally shoving him far into the depths of her vagina, and he had no energy to stop her. The muscles around him were endlessly pressing in on him from all directions at once, and the tight prison was rapidly becoming damp. Just before he lost consciousness, he heard what sounded like a poorly contained shriek of elation from Peach, and he was suddenly forced out of the flooded organ and into the fabric of Peach's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoombella had wasted no time in rushing down Peach's body when she realized that he was probably the reason behind her sudden surge of sexual energy. In half a minute's time, she had reached Peach's waistline, and from above her, Peach let out a deafening moan, before her arm motion slowed down and she slumped back onto her bed. The tiny Goomba practically threw herself into the princess's panties, with little to no regard for her own safety. Finding Mario was the only thing on her mind. She quickly spotted a red patch at the bottom of the undergarment, and dropped down to it. <br>\r\n\"Mario! Are you alright!?\" she yelled, struggling to move toward him on the soaked fabric. Mario didn't move or respond. Goombella gave a forceful lunge and stopped next to her friend. He was utterly drenched in Peach's unmentionable fluids, and she quickly attempted to hoist him onto her back. This, naturally, proved to be very difficult, but she knew that she absolutely needed to get Mario out of Peach's panties and to safety. She gave her best effort, carrying him up Peach's still-resting hand and arm, and slipped down onto the bed.<br>\r\nPeach, after some time, removed her hand from her undergarment and got up from the bed. She undressed and tossed the panties into the nearby laundry basket before taking a fresh pair from her suitcase and walking into the bathroom. Goombella looked down at Mario. He was clearly alive, although still unconscious.<br>\r\n\"That's right, Mario. Just get all the rest you need.\" she said, shuffling away and lying down herself. Neither of them had gotten all the sleep they needed the night before, and this was probably the only opportunity they would have for a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sly blinked several times as he stared at a giant brown boot in front of him. This was not something he usually woke up to see. Wondering if he had bonked his head, a dry cough from above him got his attention. Looking up, he stared along a tight pair of blue pants until reaching a furry bare midriff and then paused at the sight of two massive breasts tightly packed into a blue top. He probably would have stared at those lovely goodies all night if the towering beauty didn\u2019t bend over and Sly found himself now looking at the gorgeous if not slightly abrasive face of one inspector Carmelita Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose telling you you\u2019re under arrest would be pointless right now,\u201d Carmelita said down at the tiny thief at her foot. She had gotten to her apartment and put Sly on the ground for only a minute so she could put away her coat. She had been shocked to come back and find the raccoon had lost nearly eleven inches. He was only one inch tall now, which put him off his game at first, but Sly didn\u2019t get his name just form being sneaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA pleasure Inspector Fox. Are you wearing heels this evening, you look taller?\u201d There was always this game they played, Carmelita tried to arrest him, he flirted and then escaped. The first two parts seemed to be happening, but he had no clue how he was going to do the third. He then looked down at himself and tuned back to Carmelita with a wolfish grin on his raccoon muzzle. \u201cAnd I\u2019m naked too. Am I in for an enjoyable evening?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan it Cooper, I\u2019m in big trouble and it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d Sly was curious what he could possibly to be blamed for other then the obvious, but he wasn\u2019t allowed to ask because Carmelita was reaching down to grab him. Sly stumbled back at her tree trunk like fingers came down towards him. He was helpless as she pinched her fingers around his waist and lifted him up. Sly relaxed, letting himself be carried up. He didn\u2019t like being shrunken, it was very frustrating being so helpless. He was brought right in front of Carmelita\u2019s beautiful face and he had to smile despite the situation. At least he was shrunken with a gorgeous fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know what I had to do to catch you Sly?\u201d Carmelita sighed as she sat back on her couch. Sly was jostled around in her grasp, spinning his arms around as he was dropped into the sitting inspector\u2019s palm. Sitting on her furry palm, he sat down to listen to the Inspector bemoan her bad fate. \u201cI used an unregistered firearm against a suspect, which is against Interpol\u2019s weapon\u2019s policy. I thought if I handed you over unconscious no one would ask how I caught you, but there is no way I can hide the fact your one inch tall. I\u2019ll lose my badge for sure if anyone finds out about it and it\u2019s all your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere, there, it\u2019s alright,\u201d Sly calmly said, patting the side of Carmelita\u2019s hand comfortingly. He knew that he should be getting upset about the situation he was in or the fact that he was being blamed for everything, but a Cooper is always a gentleman and never likes to see a lady hurt. Honestly, he was too busy looking for the escape routes and exits in the apartment to bother to get upset. Being small was certainly not fun, but it opened up a lot of places to hide and run too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not alright. I wanted you arrested Cooper, locked behind bars, never allowed to see the light of day. I never planned to turn you into this,\u201d Carmelita sputtered and pointed at the miniature thief in her hand. Sly nodded sympathetically. The only reason that he was at odds with Carmelita was because they believed in very different things. Carmelita believed fully in law and justice. While he was more inclined to believe in stealing anything that he can get his hands on and having fun doing it. If she wasn\u2019t a member of Interpol and he wasn\u2019t a thief, they could be great friend or maybe more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what would make you feel better, a nice foot rub. I\u2019m sure your feet have to be killing you from running around all day after me. I\u2019ll give you a nice foot rub, we can talk and later you can call me team to come fix me so I\u2019ll be back to normal size to go to jail.\u201d Sly knew the last part was stretching it a bit, but he had to try. He only knew one person that could help him and he worked for the thieving raccoon. If he was going to get fixed, Carmelita had to make the call, it was his only hope.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Silence hung in the air, time seemed to slow to a crawl as Sly awaited Carmelita's response. This was perhaps his best if not only means through which he could return to normal, although truth be told if he had to be shrunken Carmelita was the best person to be with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see, it depends on how good this foot rub is gonna be Cooper.\" Carmelia smirked, eyes locked on the coffe table across her couch. A couple of loud thumps caused Sly to turn back and look at the table himself, there laid Carmelia's boot clad feet resting firmly on the wooden surface. Leaning forward a small bit the giant fox carefully placed Sly at the farthest point she could reach without rising from her busom, her lower leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I trust you can make the rest of the way to my feet without making a break for it Cooper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken thief turned his head back and smirked, \" I dunno, I'm pretty tempted to see how our little game of Cat and Mouse plays out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With you under the boot.\" Carmelita laughed. \" Unless you wanna see what that's like I suggest you hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJokingly Sly did a salute, \"Yes Inspector Fox!\" Then he turned around and started running towards Carmelita's boots; all the while mentally plotting his ineveitable escape from the fox. It was sort of like Dejavu, not too long ago Carmelita was a giantess due to...unusual circumstances and Sly traveled along the same pants he now ran along. Thanks to his thief agility Sly soon arrived at Carmelita's bare ankle where he leapt off and calmly walked his way to the sole of her boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As nice as your boots are I can't sit here looking at em all day Carmelita!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita closed her eyes uncaringly and shrugged, \"Then I guess you better start working on taking em off then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.....\" Sly looked at the boots that rose over a dozen times his height. \"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant fox replied with a slightly annoyed tone, \" Figure it out, you are a thief after all. Tell you what, do it in ten minutes and I'll take one off for ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm used to stealing jewels not foot wear.\" The raccon complained under his breath. He thought for a moment, how could he remove Carmelita's boot in ten measly minutes? The answer Sly came up with was simple, undo the knots and do your best from there. It was a little bothersome having to reclimb Carmelita's shoe from the sole to the tip but Sly did it, all the while worried that Carmelita would suddenly crush her little lovable nuisance. Upon arriving at the tip of her boot Sly leapt gracefully into the air, falling far and ending up over halfway towards his target which he started running to upon landing. In a mere couple minutes Sly arrived at the base of Carmelita's boot laces which were tied in a very fancy and complicated knot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly rubbed the back of his head with a nervous laugh, \"My cane could really help about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the thief could plan any further Carmelita's booming god-like voice rang out from afar. \"Times up Cooper and you didn't even do a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly twirled around and faced Carmelita with a devilish smirk, \"Can you blame me? A womans feet have to be treated with care you know. Gotta prepare somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita chuckled as her lips twisted into a smirk, \"Such a gentleman, I think a reward is in order.\" Slowly the giantess began leaning forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hands began nearing Sly he smirked, \" Please say it's a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. But the boots will be coming off.\" Despite minor disappointment Sly watched as Carmelita worked her boots off, undoing the knots and slowly sliding them off. Instantly the air seemed to change, seeming to mix with the weak smell of feet. Once the boots were off Carmelita gently flicked Sly from it and tossed them aside. The shrunken thief fell and softly landed between Carmelita's big and second furry toes. \"You're welcome, now get to rubbing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediantly Sly complied, rubbing his two palms in circles he began the arduous task of massaging. \"My my, I was expecting an odor to die for... literally but this isn't bad at all. Carmelita, you've been taking good care of these babies haven't ya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita shrugged and seemed to avoid her gaze, \"So what if I do? A girl can't have nice feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that, it's just a pleasant surprise.\" The giantess didn't seem to respond so Sly simply continued with his massaging. Carmelita's foot was like the rest of her covered in fur, orange on the top and sides with a bright yellowish tan for her soles, it was soft to the touch and didn't exactly hinder Sly's massaging. The smell was kinda bad, but only because of Sly's size; to a normal person unless their nostrils were directly between her toes Carmelita's feet would have held no odor. It didn't really bother Sly though, even if it was at her feet he was with Carmelita; granted she was silent as a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.......\" Sly began as he worked his way to Carmelita's sole, \"This is technically a date, a first date at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" Carmelita replied, eyes shut as if she was either very angry of thoroughly enjoying the massage. The shrunken raccoon shrugged and continued his massaging, soon losing track of time in every sense. He massaged every little area, the ball, the sole, the toes, between the toes, even the top of Carmelita's feet. Occasionally she would let out a pleasurable moan, something that let Sly know he hit a sweet spot which he massaged better than normal. It took a full two hours just to cover one foot and even longer to cover the other, not because Sly was getting tired but because climbing up to the toes was a heck of a lot harder than getting dropped there. Still Sly didn't complain and before he knew it he was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita let out a loud yawn as her eyes opened, \"Over all ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside Carmelita's foot Sly gave a gentleman bow, \"Afraid so milady. Now as much as I'd love to tend to your whims I believe I have a phone call to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To your gang right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly nodded, \"My my smart, beautiful and a good memory! That's right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita averted her gaze as if uncertain.</span></div></div>",

Interpol could have my phone bugged, people already think we have a questionable relationship as is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's questionable about it? You got two attractive youths locked in the battle of love.\" Sly replied smoothly, raising his eyebrows like he was hitting on Carmelita...again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantly Carmelita showed signs of aggression, rage even, but for a split second she showed a kind of...loving expression, which Sly noticed easily. \"Can it Cooper! My point is you're gonna have to do a lot more for me to risk my job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we wouldn't want that would we? Then how would prison be any fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe if it was my boot, you felt kinda nice between my toes.\" The fox replied with a stern yet playful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly shrugged and patted a hand against Carmelita's foot, \"As tempting as that is, something tells me I wouldn't exactly call that fun. Maybe if I my prison was a little higher up and more fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively Carmelita covered her chest and blushed, \"Pervert! I really should just step on you and solve this problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly still showed no signs of remote worry, \"Then go ahead Inspector Fox, or maybe we can discuss my next few odd jobs around here?\" Normal people would have been angry at Carmelita for breaking her word on the deal, angry that they would basically be used as slave labor, but Sly was far from normal and hey he was having fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita clicked her tongue and pulled her head back, obviously thinking. Before anything happened though she slammed her foot flat on the table and had Sly pinned beneath it, \"That's to make sure you don't run on me.\" Briefly showing a playful smile Carmelita rose her foot up and stepped again, \"That was just because it felt nice. Feel free to pleasure my feet some more as I think things over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly did just that, massaging yet again to pass the time, heck he was halfway tempted to plant a kiss on Carmelita's lovely sole, she was a hotty after all. But she might get the wrong idea so Sly would settle for a kiss on the lips later, for now he just massaged and plotted what he could do to help himself in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Carmelita was lost in thought about what to do, there were a ton of activities that were possible...but many of them bordered on cruelty and abuse...whereas others were too nice. She didn't want to be outright evil with Sly, yet at the same time he didn't deserve a kind caring owner either, he needed discipline and that made the whole process complicated. Some events were rather bad, like making Sly lick her feet, sitting on him and grinding him beneath her, tossing him in her mouth, whereas other activities seemed far too nice, having him rest in her cleavage, kissing him, ...adult things with him...being a cop like her was frustrating. But for the moment it seemed Carmelita's body told her what to do, her stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath the fox's foot came a slick statement from Sly, \"Sounds like someone's hungry doesn't it Carmelita? Maybe we outta head to a nice romantic restaurant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita leaned her head forward and watched her foot grind into the table as if to tell Sly \"No.\" but the thief did raise a point, she couldn't do much on an empty stomach could she? But what to do with Sly while she eats?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stew from yesterday and two day old bread was the dinner of Interpol\u2019s top agent Carmelita. With her job keeping her busy all day and taking her out of the country often, she didn\u2019t have much in her home to eat. She was too tired to go out and pick someone up and even if she did have the energy, her tiny prisoner might cause some problems. All she wanted was a meal to fill her belly, what it was didn\u2019t matter. The only thing she had on her mind was rather her dinner guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing like a beautiful woman\u2019s home cooking,\u201d Sly chirped as he dunked a crumb of bread into the swimming pool sized saucer of stew beside him. Carmelita didn\u2019t respond. She gave Sly a sour look and ate her stew, not sure how exactly they went from him giving her a foot rub to sitting down to dinner together. Denying Sly food seemed cruel and she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off him for a second. The only answer seemed to be to sit down together to eat like prisoner and keeper, but it was turning more into the one thing Carmeltia feared most of all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful dinner date Inspector. It\u2019s always a pleasure to dine with such a gorgeous woman,\u201d Sly politely commented as he took a big bite out of the bread and sat back to stare up at Carmelita. Scowling, Carmelita considered batting the minute thief away and wiping that smug look away. But she could, for the same reason she carried a shock pistol instead of a standard gun. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to intentionally hurt a criminal without good cause. The fact that she might be attracted to Sly had nothing to do with it.<br>\r\n\u201cMay I ask you something Sly?\u201d Carmelita said as she put down her spoon and stared at the tiny raccoon. The meal was hardly professional with Sly\u2019s flirtatious attitude, so she might as well use it as an opportunity to get something strait that had been bugging her since her foot rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsk away,\u201d Sly cheerfully told her, looking hard into her huge green eyes hanging directly above him. They almost looked like gems to the sneaky raccoon. He could look at them all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want to know why you\u2019re acting this way?\u201d Carmelita asked, getting a blank look from Sly. Sighing, she explained it, trying not to blush from her own words. \u201cWhat I mean is, you are shrunken and completely at my mercy. I could do anything to you and no one would know. I could keep you for the rest of your life, enslave you under my foot or something just as worse, but all you do is smile and flirt with me. Aren\u2019t you afraid about what I can do to you? I expected you to get angry when I refused to call your crew, but you just smiled. Why are you treating this like it\u2019s some kind of\u2026.of\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDate?\u201d Sly finished and Carmelita nodded quickly. The lure to do something to Sly in his weakened state had been tempting Carmelita all night. From doing something cruel to punish the thief for all the trouble he had caused her, like making him lick her sweaty feet or be crushed under her butt. To the more sultry desires to press her lips against his small body or let him roam over her naked body. These ideas had been going through her head all night and the more she was around Sly the less resistance she had. He had to see that and yet he was treating his situation like it was no big deal and looked at her with only affection. It confused the hell out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s simple Inspector Fox,\u201d Sly said and then his whole demeanour changed. He no longer looked laid back or jovial. He was dead serious now, no more games and no more jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s because I trust you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPardon me?\u201d Carmelita blurted out, not knowing what the raccoon was saying. She chased him half way across the world, fought him at every turn of his career as a criminal and was actually the person responsible for him being shrunken down. You don\u2019t trust a person that wants you locked away, it doesn\u2019t make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly ignored her, explaining it in detail for her so she could finally understand. \u201cI trust you to do what\u2019s right by your own moral code and by me. You\u2019re not the type of woman that would torture anyone, you may tease and maybe punish, but you have too much compassion to ever really hurt them. Also, we might have our disagreements, but you can\u2019t deny that you like me and I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel the same. Maybe you could muster up the indignation to hate me if I was committing a crime, but I\u2019m just a helpless raccoon right now. You won\u2019t hurt me and even if you do give in to temptation and abuse me, I can take it. Best case scenario we have right now, you take care of me and maybe we see if size really matters in the bedroom. Worst case scenario, I spend sometime under your feet or your rump, which isn\u2019t the worst thing that could happen to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPervert,\u201d Carmelita muttered under her breath and got a bright smile from Sly. The only part worse then the worst thing she could think of was something Sly might enjoy was that he was right. She didn\u2019t have it in her to do anything completely wrong to him. However, she refused to let Sly play with her anymore. He might think he had her completely figured out, but she would just have to put it to the test how far she could go. She might not have it in her to torture him, but she would wipe that knowing smirk off the raccoons face one way or another.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea was rather easy to come up with, and once it came Carmelita couldn't help but smile in Sly's direction. Sly noticed it instantly and calmly asked, \"What's with the smile Carmelita? Realizing how great the situation is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that....\" She replied, wiggling her fingers into the air as if toying with something. \"I just decided...that maybe I do need to give in to temptation once in a while. Enjoy myself for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here I thought our dances all these years <i> were </i> fun.\" Sly retorted smoothly. Still, despite his otherwise calm demeanor on the inside Sly was practically leaping around in joy. From the way the giant cop phrased her sentence it sounded as if things would be getting really good for the diminished thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling Carmelita gently lifted Sly away from the food, holding him in her palm once more. \"Maybe they were fun, but not quite on the same level as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisuals filled Sly's mind, each more tempting than the last. \"Why you naughty woman...I like that. Funny, I always thought I was the bold one here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita leaned forward just enough so her lips could tease Sly, \"Sounds to me like you were wrong. Still, I don't believe I ever said what sort of temptation I'm giving in to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly had already thought of that and his reply came swiftly, \"It's either some....<i> adult </i> temptations, which I wouldn't mind to be honest, or it's some of what you said before; something kind of corelating to slavery. Either way it couldn't be too bad, heck sounds kind of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cop's cool playful expression broke instantly, \"You...would like being some sort of a slave? What if I just decided to throw you in my boot and forget you ever existed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe visual of that entered Sly's mind too, not exactly pleasant but he kept his demeanor. \"I don't think you'd be so cruel, plus I don't think Interpol would exactly approve of that. And even if you did do it I'd get away and we could play some more Cat and Mouse.\" Either way Sly felt safe in all honesty, if Carmelita decided to....prove her womanhood Sly wouldn't fight her on that at all, if she went with the whole slavery deal...well the thief was always open to new things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Carmelita smiled at him, \"Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. Are you really willing to take that risk? We both know you're skilled enough to try your hand at running away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly shrugged, \"What can I say? It's rude to abandon a lady like that. But if you don't mind me asking, just what kind of temptation are you giving in to? The suspense is killing me, plus I need to know if I have to find some nice clothes for the occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you won't Cooper. And I suppose I can answer your question now. What I really want to do is....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carmelita was an officer of the law. Carmelita was a devote believer in justice. Carmelita was a compassionate person that believed in the goodness in people. But sometimes she forgot that along with all those things she was a woman and she had needs. She couldn\u2019t lie and say she didn\u2019t fantasize about Sly Cooper, the dashing thief she chased, but all she did was fantasize. She knew that she could never be with a criminal; it went against everything she believed in. When she held up the tiny raccoon however, she didn\u2019t see a thief and criminal, but the man she had wanted for years completely at her mercy. Sly showed his desires in the open, but Carmelita held them in, letting them build and build until they burst. The dam had ripped open and she wanted to have Sly so bad, she didn\u2019t even know if she could stop if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy Inspector Fox, I think you might be flirting with a known criminal,\u201d Sly playfully jested, but was cut off when Carmelita grabbed him and brought him closer to her face. She stared at him closely through her emerald eyes. He looked so adorable at this size, his tiny chest rising and falling, as he was held naked in her hand. She hadn\u2019t thought about the fact that he had been naked since he shrunk, that he had rubbed her feet and eaten with her without anything on, but now that she thought about it, she was really turned on. <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not flirting, Cooper,\u201d she sultrily whispered and then kissed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKissing a raccoon the size of her pinkie toe should have felt odd for most women, but for Carmelita it just felt right. She pushed the top of her lip into Sly\u2019s forehead and her lower one on his chest and puckered up. Her kiss was light, any harder and she could accidentally pull him into her mouth. His face fit snuggly between her lips, rubbing against the spongy flesh as she pushed him into her ruby lips. He didn\u2019t fight or squirm, not showing if he could breath or not. She felt comfortable and happy kissing Sly, much more so then she could say she felt when she kissed anyone else. At that moment, her mind settled on taking this all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kiss for Sly was unlike any other he had ever felt. When he had between pushed towards her lips an irrational fear that his beloved Carmelita was going to eat him rushed through his mind. He should have known better, but strange ideas go through your head when your staring down a mouth big enough to fit a car into. Instead of the hot, wet inside of her mouth, he got her soft red lips smothering his face. She sucked on his face, rubbing him against every wrinkle on her lips. He could smell her warm, spicy breath and taste dinner on her lips. It was very unusual for him, but he loved it still. He was finally getting a kiss from Inspector Carmelita Fox and he didn\u2019t even need to steal it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was smothered into her soft lips, Sly tried to kiss her back. He crushed his lips into the spongy flesh of her mouth, feverously sucking on the yielding lips. She didn\u2019t feel his tiny lips, only her mouth pressing against his upper body. Carmelita held the kiss for a few more seconds before breaking it. She pulled Sly away from her lips and smiled seductively at him. \u201cReady to take it further my tiny lover?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time ever, Sly had no witty response. After being enveloped in the biggest kiss ever, his mind was spinning out of control. He had expected Carmelita to open up to him after getting used to his tiny size, but he never thought she could be so randy. The cold Inspector Fox was no longer holding him, but rather the hot and seductive Carmelita. Honestly, he couldn\u2019t think of a thing to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeechless,\u201d Carmelita laughed. She lifted Sly up and put him on the top of her head. He snuggled up in her dark blue hair and held on as she started walking. He nuzzled her soft locks, breathing in the sweet smell of her shampoo. Carmelita walked slowly to her bedroom, swaying her hips as she walked. \u201cIt\u2019s alright if you have nothing to say, I have other things you can use that mouth of yours for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSly was trembling with excitement. He didn\u2019t know what had gotten into his former pursuer, but he liked it. Standing next to her bed, Carmelita threw Sly off her head by snapping her head forward. He was flung hundreds of feet in the air off her head and landed perfectly on his two feet in the middle of her bed. Carmelita smiled; her little Sly had such agility and flexibility, which would make tonight even better. She licked her full, pouty lips as she looked at her tiny lover in the middle of her bed. She flirtatiously winked at him and slowly grabbed the sides of her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy,\u201d Sly gasped as his eyes became as wide as possible as he watched something he had fantasized about a lot. Carmelita slowly tugged her pants down, allowing Sly to see only and inch at a time. His lips went dry as he saw her white cotton panties tightly stretched around her voluptuous hips.  She let go of her pants, letting them fall to her ankles and stepped out of them. Sly ogled her long, sculptured legs, her fur perfectly shaved around her luscious legs. His eyes fell to her cute little toes, which he had massaged not to long ago. He wanted to rub those lovely legs now and head up and see what was hidden under those tight, white undies.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoying the show?\u201d She asked as though she didn\u2019t know the answer. She did a slow spin, moving her hips as she turned to further entice the already god smacked raccoon. Her tight bottom wiggled for Sly, making him smile with pure joy. He added getting his hands on that tight derriere once he was finished with her legs. He wanted to touch every inch of Carmelita\u2019s smoking hot body and he hadn\u2019t even seen it all.  Carmelita delighted in Sly\u2019s expression. Now she understood why the raccoon always teased her, it was fun watching someone cute look flabbergasted. She asked then with a purr, \u201cready for part two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sly could answer she had one button undone from her top and then another. She leaned down, giving Sly a good view into the long valley of cleavage between her breasts. Sly stared into the dark crevice, realizing with delight that he could fit into there. Thinking about snuggling between those soft orbs had his erection standing tall. Carmelita stared at the tiny thing, knowing that if he was regular size she couldn\u2019t call it little. She didn\u2019t want Sly to see it, but her panties were getting damp. All those teasing had her so excited she wanted to start fingering herself right there. Her nipples pushed out her shirt as she felt herself ready to explode. She stared at Sly\u2019s erection and gave him a final wink before she did what she had wanted to do since she kissed his tiny body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Moving her fingers quickly, but carefully, Carmelita undid all the buttons to her shirt and pulled it off, leaving the sexy fix in only her bra and panties. The bra was silly white, just like her panties and clung to her swelling bosom tightly. She stuck several poses for her entranced prisoner, each one earning a wider, happier grin from Sly. Leaning forward, she moved her chest over Sly, allowing her giant breasts to hover over his awestricken face. Sly stared up at the huge mounds suspended above his head, a hundred times his size and looking as inviting as heaven. \u201cThis can\u2019t get any better,\u201d he told himself as he wiped the drool from his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to bet,\u201d Carmelita purred as she reached behind her back and undid her bra. Sly didn\u2019t move as her giant bra fell on him. The circus tent sized left breast cup landed on top of him burying him. Sly breathed in the rich, earthy scent of his long time pursuer. Sweat mixed with her sweat perfume filled his nose before the massive bra was pulled away. He would have complained, but he was too busy gapping at Carmelita\u2019s now naked chest. Her fur was a soft hazel, short and controlled like Sly liked his women\u2019s fur to be. The massiveness of her chest was overwhelming for Sly. So perfectly round and soft, he could see them sway as Carmelita breathed in. Her nipples remained in the middle of each jiggly orb, bumpy areolas broke from her fur with large, throbbing nipples that were bigger then Sly. The thought that he was ogling a pair of tits bigger then his whole body made him feel very faint. He had hit pervert nirvana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle pervert Raccoon,\u201d Carmelita chuckled deeply as she pinched Sly\u2019s tail between her thumb and forefinger and lifted him up. He didn\u2019t respond as she dangled him high in the air. His mind was focused on the sexy thing in front of him. Carmelita smiled sultrily, feeling so powerful not because of just her size, but for the first time she had cracked the cool exterior of the fearless felon Sly Cooper. It gave her such a rush and made her want more. From the looks of Sly, he was so mesmerized by her she could make him clean the inside of her boot with his tongue or drop him in the toilet to do backstrokes and he wouldn\u2019t fight. None of those things she\u2019d do now, what se wanted was much more pleasurable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want me to feel good don\u2019t you? You want to make me feel good don\u2019t you? You want to be a good little raccoon and not a bad old thief don\u2019t you?\u201d Carmelita cooed as she lightly swung Sly from her fingers as he nodded eagerly. Carmelita moved onto the bed, sitting down and staring at her tiny sex toy. She could do a lot of things to Sly, most of which would be against his will. That wasn\u2019t what would get her off. What really turned her on was seeing on quick and hard Sly was to please her. He would serve her faithfully and the fun she\u2019d have would rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTry to hold on to something,\u201d she told him quickly before dropping him right above her right breast. Sly fell from her fingers, hitting the soft top of her furry breast. He started sliding down, the soft fur to thin for him to grab. He whizzed by on her breast, seeing a sudden drop coming up. Also, he saw a large nub he could seize onto. Without thinking, he grabbed it with both hands, hugging it tightly to his chest as he dangled a hundred feet up by it. It was bumpy, warm and incredibly hard. Looking at the pink object that had saved him from a nasty fall, he recognized it as Carmelita\u2019s nipple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Carmelita moaned as she felt her tiny toy grab her titty hard in his small, but strong arms. She could feel his tiny fingers digging into it as he held on. Every nerve in her sensitive nipple flared up at his touch and she fell back on her bed with a gasp, squirming around as she got used to this new pleasure. She had never been an outgoing girl, the furthest she ever got with the boys was a prim kiss. Sly was the first man to touch her there and it felt incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRide em cowboy!\u201d Sly cried out as he held tight to Carmelita\u2019s teat, while she thrashed around on the bed. Her breasts shook as she thrashed, making Sly hold on tighter, which made Carmelita spasm even more. Eventually she settled down. Lying back, she relished the pleasure and power she got from having the tiny raccoon clasp her nipple. She watched him closely, a tiny furry bug that had once been the greatest thief holding tight to her nipple in fear she was going to start bucking again. The mere thought of it made her feel so naughty. But she knew how to be naughtier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke in a raspy voice, hoping that she didn\u2019t sound as depraved as she felt. \u201cPlay with my nipple. Make me feel good.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Sly didn\u2019t waste another second. He let go of her nipple and landed his paws on the bumpy pink areola surrounding her colossal nipple. He stared at his opponent. It was nigger, harder and tougher then he could ever dream of being. But he was a persistent raccoon and wasn\u2019t going to be intimidated. He reached out and took a side of the throbbing nub and started massaging it. He knew that no matter how hard her tried to squeeze Carmelita\u2019s nipple it wouldn\u2019t hurt her so he put all his strength into rubbing her nipple. His hands moved quickly over the warm, hard surface, stimulating as much of it as he could. Applying as much strength as possible to Carmelita\u2019s massive nipple, Sly slid his arms around it and embraced her titty, rubbing his whole body against it. His furry chest stimulated the teat, earning louder moans from Inspector Fox. He may have been small, but he had skills<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarmelita for her part had to struggle to keep herself from moving too much and throwing Sly off her breast. Her panties were soaked and she felt hot all over. She had never been so excited before in her life and she still wanted more. Her left traveling down her stomach, rubbing against her fur as her hand made its way to her crotch. Her breathing became steadily faster as she moved her hand into her soaked panties and rubbed her fingers over her enflamed labia. She rubbed her soggy lips for a second before pushing them in. She had to bite her lip to keep from screaming out as her sex pulsated around her fingers. Slowly she started pumping, wet slurping sounds following every time she pushed in. Her head was starting to get blurry so she focused on something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Sly on her nipple entranced her. She focused on his battle to please her giant nipple. He was practically hugging it now, rubbing his hands around it and moving his furry body against it. She couldn\u2019t feel it, but she knew his tiny member was pushing against the soft side of her teat. He was dry humping her nipple, never stopping his ministrations with his hands as he pleased himself. He buried his face in it, breathing it in as it enticed him to move faster and move harder. Sly really knew how to take care of a lady, no matter how big he was.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>S.D 10, the year of the journey of the SRF-003 Calnus; a ship whose journey is of the most vital importance, the year where man officially began his search for a suitable home among the stars. Originally one of several ships the Calnus is alone in its mission, guided by its capable, if not unusual crew; half of which weren\u2019t even from Earth. In charge of navigations, Reimi Saionji , Bacchus D-79, and Arumat. Meracle, Lymle, Sarah, and Myuria the rest of the crew who usually lounged around the ship, their talents more useful in the field than the ship itself. And lastly there was the captain, Edge Maverick; one of the youngest out there as well as one of the best. Since his mission began Edge had recruited his crew from all over the galaxy; a colorful bunch to be certain but they were the best, and more importantly; Edge\u2019s friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment the crew was more or less, boredly waiting. In the midst of light speed travel that was all they could do; the Calnus practically flew itself. Unfortunately this particular trip would take about a week to do; a week of being trapped in the ship. Lymle took to drawing her various symbols all over the ship, anyone who tried to stop her essentially gave up before long. Meracle and Sarah stayed in the lobby and played with each other to pass the time, while not even ten feet away Myuria enjoyed herself at the ship\u2019s bar. At the front of the ship Bacchus spent most of his time calculating various things; as well as making sure the Calnus didn\u2019t experience any issues midflight. Arumat did as he always did; hide himself in one of the cargo rooms and train. Reimi was the only one who couldn\u2019t seem to stay in place; she switched between playing with Lymle, to training, to simply wandering in boredom. As for Edge; like a true Captain he spent the majority of his time asleep. That is to say; until something quite different happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(I realize for snoring this sucks but bear with me.) \u201cHuaah\u2026.hooo\u2026huah\u2026hoo.\u201d The rhythm of Edge\u2019s snores had grown to a familiar, almost soothing, sound to any in the upper levels of the Calnus. Being Captain Edge worked harder than anyone and showed no signs of exhaustion; until it came time for warp travel, mid warp you\u2019d be lucky to find the young man awake. Being asleep, Edge did not notice his left hand, the glowing symbol donned on it. A symbol he knew of, but was not currently using. It was reacting to something. A symbol by one of the symbologists, one of the many inventions of Bacchus, whatever it was it didn\u2019t matter. What did were the results. It wouldn\u2019t be for the better half of a day before Edge would awaken and realize anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>15 Hours Later\u2026</i><br>\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Grunts escaped Edge as he sat up, still half asleep he stood up and started walking. \u201cFood\u2026.food\u2026\u2026.\u201d His stomach was essentially talking for him, he was dying for something to munch on! Maybe a shower afterwards too, something to wake him up a little bit. He couldn\u2019t sleep through the <i>entire</i> warp after all, a Captain has to show some example. Granted his crew more than understood he needed the rest. Edge started to scratch his rear, \u201cMan, kitchen seems awfully far, it almost looks like\u2026\u201d Edge\u2019s eyes widened in an instant, \u201c\u2026.like I\u2019m still on my bed. The heck? I\u2019ve been walking for five minutes! I should at least be out of my room.\u201d It was a few more huffed steps before Edge stopped again, his slowly awakening \u201cWait\u2026walk\u2026on my bed\u2026?\u201d It a took a moment before the full force of that to hit, but when it did Edge looked around with a full alertness in his eyes.<i> \u201cThe heck!? Why is my bed suddenly a great plain?!\u201d </i>Instinctively Edge reached for his sword; grasping only air<i>.\u201cDamn, forgot. I take it off whenever I enter the Calnus.\u201d </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully alert now Edge surveyed his surroundings, everything seemed the same\u2026just much larger than he\u2019d ever hoped to see. Heck, Edge felt like an ant! Wait\u2026an ant\u2026Edge thought he woke up somewhere else but\u2026what if\u2026\u201dWhat if I <i>shrunk</i>!?\u201d It seemed a ludicrous idea but with it in mind it seemed to fit perfectly, everything looked, felt and even smelled the same; just a different size. Either the Calnus went through a growth spurt, or Edge got downsized. The blonde young man racked his brain for how this could have happened, the Grigori? An enemy\u2019s Symbol? Just some freak accident in space? They all seemed likely, and all made Edge realize something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I\u2019m tiny then so must my friends! I<b> have </b>to help them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with resolve now Edge didn\u2019t continue with his calm collected approach, he took off running right to the edge of his bed. Thank God he didn\u2019t sleep with the blankets on; otherwise some mountainous creases would have made it much harder. Still took Edge a good ten minutes to reach the cliff though, man he was small! Once at the edge of his bed Edge faced a new issue though, how to get down. He didn\u2019t have time for anything fancy like a plan so he just did what he did best, Edge winged it. Grabbing a hold of the soft fabric Edge used it like a fire escape and slid himself down. It wasn\u2019t a perfect slide of anything but it worked and Edge got the floor safely. On the ground Edge felt even smaller, he landed near a crumb, a crumb which was bigger than him\u2026.a crumb he wouldn\u2019t even see at normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan am I glad there are no bugs in space, otherwise this could be <i>real</i> dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo threats in a clean environment like space though, Edge was in no danger whatsoever. But his friend\u2019s may have been, so he continued his rushed pace towards the door. Again arriving in minutes\u2026a lot of minutes\u2026the better half of an hour. But he made it; and encountered a new problem he didn\u2019t consider. The door wasn\u2019t opening. It was an automatic door, rigged to open through pressure plates and/or scanners, but Edge was too small to trigger either of them. He was locked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<b>DAMN!\u201d </b>Edge angrily punched the metal before him, \u201cIf I can\u2019t open this door I can\u2019t get to my friends! I have to get it open I have t-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wssh..</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door\u2026opened? Edge couldn\u2019t believe it! This had to be the luckiest break of his\u2026.his happiness stopped in a heartbeat. The door didn\u2019t open for him, there was something on the other side\u2026something big. The door came in from the side so all Edge could see  was\u2026well nothing, but as it opened further more and more became visible\u2026and soon Edge found himself staring at the biggest toes he had ever lain eyes on. Each one literally a mountain to him, heck he could see the body oils clearly! That was not a good thing! A slight smell wafted too, nothing too bad though. Edge was curious though, who was this!? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe strained his neck to look up, things got pretty blurry past the knee but he recognized the person instantly and he knew one thing\u2026his friend\u2019s were fine. That became dreadfully clear as Edge looked at\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Edge really don't have a choice but to get her attention one way or another. So he hurry towards Meracle's massive barefoot, he quickly jumps up and grabs a hold of her mountainous big toe skin. He was already assault by her foot odor but not too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeracle meanwhile, was hoping to find her favorite captain in his room, but he was nowhere in sight. \"Meow? Edge isn't in here either? Aww...What should I do now?\" She thought about it, tapping her foot with Edge on her big toe, he almost lost his grip during this earthquake, but he able to hold on. \"Oh, I know! I'll just wait for him until he comes back!\" She giggles. Meracle begins to walk towards Edge's bed, Edge is having a hard time climbing his friend's big time, but he wasn't about to give up just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeracle sits on Edge's bed and waits for her favorite captain, this is the perfect chance to resume his climbing. About minutes or possible an hour later, Edge was able to reach the top of her big toe and now he's standing a endless plain of toenail. He strained his neck to look up again...Still pretty far away to reach her ears. \"Damn it, at this rate I won't be able to reach Meracle in time...Unless I called name from here.\" He thought about it, Meracle does have a good hearing and it maybe possible she'll able to hear him, but if that doesn't work,its back to climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdge thought and thought, eventually he decided to...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Ne and I am a member of the Minanachy Tribe. I was born to Zal and Mani one hundred moons ago. I am a man now and alone, my parents were taken by the rat beasts many sunrises ago. My tribe lives inside the heart of a massive tomb, built by the giant gods many, many moons ago. A small lake flows beside our village supplying us with water, the food we hunt for. There are many beasts roaming our home, it is the job of the hunter to both kill these threats and take them back to the village to eat. I am a hunter and proud of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are only several hundred members of my tribe, with the lack of medicine and constant attack by beasts; my tribe is often thinned out. Most men and women don\u2019t live longer then me, especially hunters. But I am strong and fast, I have even avoided the dreaded fangs of the serpent. I have promised myself that I would live long enough to see the next generation be born and teach them the ways of the tribe. We are a proud people, every creature is bigger then us yet we have survived as we will forever and ever. Everyday we thank the giant gods for placing us deep in their tomb, safe from the even larger and more deadly beasts living outside. If we ever left the safety of the tomb, I\u2019m sure we would be doomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday I am hunting far from the tribe, going high up the walls separating out home from the outside world. The cracks make it easy to climb and I travel hundreds of feet within an hour. High above, the juiciest beasts have crawled into the cracks, waiting to be killed. I will catch a thousand leg beasts, cut off its head and bring it back to the village for a feast. That is sure to catch the eye of the chief\u2019s daughter, Zela. I have loved Zela since I was old enough to carry a spear. She is strong for a female, making me want her more then any other woman.  She is from fine breed and will provide me with many sons to become hunters. I have got my future all planned out, marry Zela, raise a family and die when I have seen another hundred moons. It is a good life any man or woman wishes for in the Minanachy Tribe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have been climbing for hours and rest in one of the cracks along the great wall. I can see my whole village from here, tiny from my point of view. I wonder if the giant gods saw my village this way, just a collection of tiny huts you can hold in your hand. I watch my home wistfully, dreaming of Zela and making her mine. I am always alert for danger, but I am still caught off guard when the world starts to shake. I am nearly thrown from my spot and sent crashing to the ground hundreds of feet down, but I manage to hold on and move back, going deeper into the crack until my back hits something solid. I watch carefully, afraid of what I can\u2019t understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I see it. The god door, the mile high door that sealed when the giant gods gave us this him, it was opening. For the first time ever it was being pushed open. I watch with terror. Not even the whole village could move the god door, what kind of beast could be strong enough to do it? Visions of giant beasties rush through my head as I clutch my spear to my chest. I might be nothing against whatever could move the god door, but I\u2019d be damned if I let my village be slaughter. I hold my breath as the beast walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have we got here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming human voice doesn\u2019t shock me as much as the creature speaking it. The words mean nothing to me, not that they were important, what walked in was. It didn\u2019t just look human, but also female. Soft white skin, so different then the dark tone of our own. Her shoes were longer then ours, going past her ankles halfway to her thighs. She wore the strangest loincloth I had ever seen; it clung to her bottom tightly like an extra skin. That was nothing compared to what she covered her chest with. I had never seen cloth that light blue or that tight before. It pushed against her bosom tightly, showing off every curve of the impressive chest. Her face was beautiful, much more then Zela\u2019s face which paled in comparison. Her hair hung behind her head in a braid, swaying around as she looked around. The woman was incredible, but her beauty was not what left me speechless but her height. She was over a mile high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was enormous in ways that seemed unfathomable to me. If I had been on the ground I would have never been able to see much higher then her waste. Her massive breasts were bigger then my whole village. Why she could cover half the village with just one of her earthshaking feet. I had heard stories of the giant gods, how their hands could cover the sun and their footsteps shake the Earth, but I never imaged that anything could be this big. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the giantess, her beauty as unmatched as her height. Truly, she was one of the giant gods, here to bring us to a better life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Lara, what have you found this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words mean nothing to me other then the second word she spoke. I think it\u2019s her name, Lara. Such a simple name, for such a divine being. I want to follow her, worship her, give my life for her. Wordlessly I watch her as she moves, my voice lost in wonderment. What is the divine goddess Lara going to do next. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was the same as every other ruin, carvings on the walls, dank atmosphere that reeked of age, and the apprehensive feeling like a trap could go off at anytime. It was making a thrilled smile come to her mouth, a smile that only grew as she reached for the gun alongside her hip to be safe. She took a single step forward before her well trained eyes saw something remarkable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess looked around with her perfect face, no doubt searching for our constantly migrating village. Her slender fingers, which were also covered with a second skin, grasped a most unusual object. Some sort of metal shaped like a curve with two holes at the end. Staring at it somehow I knew, I was staring at a weapon. But...the goddess...Lara....she was so beautiful...so perfect, it was no doubt a weapon used to defend me and my people!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcitement filled my body as I eagerly jumped up and down, \"Goddess!! Goddess Lara! It is I Ne of the Minanachy Tribe! Son of Zal and Mani! Please acknowledge me oh Divine Goddess!!\" I ended up on my knees almost bowing to her before I even realized it. Then Goddess Lara took a step forward, her thick leather shoes that were the size of all the previously felled beasts combined made a sound that I had never before encountered. It was....like a rumbling boom....that was really all I could've said to describe it. And right as her foot covered miles of Earth her eyes locked on to the place behind me, my village. I instantly bowed in appreciation and adoration of the Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara's thick British accent sounded absolutely astounded, she had to blink several times to make sure she wasn't hallucinating. Before her was one step, only one, yet clearly on the other side of the step was a small....structure, and through instinct Lara guessed what it was, and she guessed correctly. Fascinated she leaned over and eyed it closer, the structure or structures as it turned out was a village, a village that could fit on Lara's thumb. And at this close range she clearly saw another astounding sight; a man, a warrior judging by his attire, a man less than a centimeter tall, bowing to Lara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god....\" Was all Lara could say. Every explorer and archaeologist knew about this...this myth. The tale of the Minanachy Tribe. A tribe of people so small that by current metric standards they would be one or two milimeters in height. There were tales of them in various ancient Incan ruins. It was hard to notice but whilst the Incans worshipped in their depictions on the tombs, there were smaller beings worshipping <i> them. </i> People didn't know what to make of it for years, by unearthed tablets found roughly ten years ago managed to explain much. It gave the name of the Minanachy Tribe, as well as their practices regarding things such as survival and religion. They survived by hunting the smallest of the small insects, and constantly migrating to avoid something like a spider. And they worshipped average sized people as gods, and there were often tales of this being twisted into blatant abuse. Of course the idea of a race of milimeter tall people was considered fiction, emphasis on <i> was. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLara couldn't even think clearly, to think that not only the Minanachy Tribe existed, but still exist to the present day was simple astounding. They survived for over five hundred years in a world of war, pollution and famine. The tomb was the resting place of the Incans, and the fortress that defended the Minanachy. This would mean...new breakthroughs in science, historical facts uncovered, the very world could be altered by this find! And Lara would make the find of her career.... For a brief moment her eyes flashed with greed but it instantly vanished, she was not interested in money nor the fame, she only wanted to do this out of pure historical interest. Of course she would report the finding of the Minanachy Tribe, but she would also make sure they are treated humanely, lest they too become extinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bowing warrior regained Lara's attention, and more out of curiousity than anything she asked in pure English, \"Do you speak?\" The warrior stopped and appeared confused, obviously not understanding or too surprised to respond. So Lara shifted between all the languages from Spanish to Aztec until she knew that she had found something that might work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoddess Lara...up close she was even closer to perfection than I had imagined. Her voluptous curves were open to my sight, and....I wanted to jump in so badly. But it wasn't just that, I wanted...her...Lara. I wanted to live my life at her mercy, even if it meant my home would be something like her nostril of that odd shoe of hers. I wanted to live my life pleasing her. Even if I had met her less than a minute ago, all my village's religions and beliefs washed away in seconds. My life, my religion, my very being itself centered around the Goddess before me. I knelt my head down, I was not worthy to look upon such beauty for a second further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she spoke again, saying words that made little sense to me. I recognized one bit, she said God, apparently a sort of short prayer...while she clearly is God...nothing else could be so perfect so....unique. After a few moments I felt her gaze upon me, and she asked in one of my villages languages if I spoke. I looked up, amazed that Goddess Lara was even acknowledging the speck unworthy of her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe apparently thought I was unable to understand and began using different languages, many of which I knew. Various Gods have visited the village, and quite a few brought with them a new language. As a result me and the villagers all practice nine different languages. Her voice...was so elegant...so serene....I couldn't resist the urge to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goddess! I am indeed capable of speech!\" Goddess Lara appeared stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnreal...it was simply unreal that not only the Minanachy Tribe lived, but spoke in Spanish!? The tales behind such a marvel must have truly been great. He referred to Lara as a goddess, to which she couldn't help but chuckle a little bit. But she didn't correct him on it, at least not yet, \"Good day to you. My name is Lara, and you are?\" She queried in flawlessly executed Spanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Ne my goddess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was truly a most amazing discovery, Lara didn't know whether to converse with the man before her or bring him and possibly his village and consult her various textbooks back at her camp regarding this. The things they would know...the possibilities were endless.</span></div></div>",

She then said, \"Will you come with me to my camp?\"  She saw him nod his head and he yelled, \"Yes my goddess!\"  Then she carried him out of the temple and back to her camp.  Then she placed him on her table and started questioning him.  She was also writing down what he said.  She learned many things about those people and their life.  But the whole time she started feeling hot and had to occasionally stop and rub her pussy in pleasure.  After the interview was over, she could wait no longer.  She picked up Ne and brought him into her tent.  She placed him on the bed and started stripping.  She pulled her clothes off until she only had on a bra and panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNe looked on in amazement and awe as she showed off her perfect body to him.

She let her gigantic breasts jiggle freely and saw how turned on Ne was.  Then she decided to give him the grand finally.  She slowly pulled down her panties, showing off her un-shaved womanhood.  Then she, careful to not crush Ne, she layed down on the bed and said in a voice no man can resist, \"Pleasure me, little man.\"  She watched as Ne walked his way to her pussy.  She moaned as he struggled his way through her pussy hair.  When he finally made it to her pussy, she moaned as he touched her wet lips.  \"Go on, I want you in there,\" Lara said in pleasure.  Then he sat there, not moving.  She finally grew impatient and using her index finger, lightly pushed him into her pussy.  Then he started struggling, and this caused her even more pleasure.  She was so pleasured that she screamed as she orgasmed.  Then she remembered Ne and reached her hand into her pussy, searching around for his body.  Finally, she looked and saw his little body, still moving, laying there in her vaginal fluids.  She then grabbed his tiny body and placed it in between her gigantic breasts.  She thought to herself, \"they must be like mountains to Ne.\"\"  She giggled at this.  She slowly reached down and grabbed her bra, putting it back on but allowing it to sit loosely, so she didn't crush Ne.  Then she fell asleep.  Will Ne survive the night?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The year 21XX: an era where machines known as Reploids walked amidst the comman man. They looked like people. Talked like people. Acted like people. Apart from sheer ability and robotic designs, the difference between Reploid and Human was growing more and more minimal. Their very existence was remarkable. They were a revolution in technology; however, much like their human counterparts not all Reploids were good. There were the evil Reploids- the Mavericks, who wreaked havoc wherever possible. Thus came the ones who would stop them. If Reploids decided to go violent, it had to be Reploids who would stop them. Thus the Maverick Hunters were born. In such an organization there was a Reploid unlike any other. His name was Megaman X, a Reploid who's level of emotion was almost...human. He was a pacifist, he detested fighting. Yet not only was he one of, if not the best fighters of the Maverick Hunters. But he often times found himself forced to fight, for better or worse. All the while wondering why must there be violence? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question haunts him always....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>BOOM</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverhead the loud roar of an explosion jolted X's gaze to the sky where a large hole now laid within a building. Abel City had finally rebuilt itself after yet another Maverick attack, only for the latest Maverick to undo the hard work. \"Why do we have to fight?\" X asked himself with a sigh. Leaping from the newly constructed hole came a lightning fast Reploid designed off of a wolf. Fast as can be the Maverick landed on the ground before X, easily making a landing from a hundred feet high. Covered in an azure fur with a silver chestplate he stood on his hind legs bringing his height well over X's, arms outstretched with claws poised to attack and eyes full of a familiar madness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fearsome as the wolf Maverick looked, X could only look at the machine with pity. \"The Sigma Virus did this to you didn't it?.\" The Wolf only howled in response, but the look in his eyes was definitely the work of the Sigma Virus. X raised his X-Buster with a forlorn expression, \"I really am sorry...\" Energy began to build up in his arm and with a small grunt X fired a charged blast at the Maverick before him. With his speed the Wolf easily dodged, but X was right behind him not missing a beat. In response the Wolf kicked his legs and began to run, with X right behind him. More shots were fired, the Maverick was on the defensive. It had only been a couple minutes but already shots from the X-Buster were beginning to graze the Maverick, one nicked his leg, forcing him to slow down. X wasted no time in taking the chance to get in front of the Maverick and charge for the final shot. But the Maverick still had one trick left. The gaping maw of the Reploid opened to reveal a hidden gun aimed directly at X. X's eyes widened at the sight of the weapon but he couldn't let it stop him. He continued the final seconds of his charging before lighting off a shot from the X-Buster. Simultaneously the Wolf's gun fired off a laser that struck X directly on the gem in his head. It contained enough of a blast to daze X, but he was able to keep his eyes focused enough to see his shot strike the Maverick's weak spot, finishing him. Landing on the ground X felt his systems struggle to keep him awake. For a single blast to do this perplexed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What kind of attack was that? An EMP...? No...What was it...?</i> X's eyes began to close as a pair of feet began to walk towards him. Behind them was many more running in, shouting things like \"Secure the Area\" and similar phrases. The other Maverick Hunters caught up. X let his eyes shut, knowing he was in good hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why must we fight...?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX wasn't aware of how much time had passed, but soon he found himself awakening. Right away he knew something was off, the area looked unfamiliar. Immediately the Reploid leapt up and quickly looked around. He raised his X-Buster as a safety measure. Or- He would have, but upon trying X saw only an empty air where his X-Buster usually was. The part had been removed! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you up already?\" A loud voice echoed throughout the heavens. X looked over and saw someone entering this foreign area....Alia?! It was his fellow Maverick Hunter and friend Alia. And not only that, the female Reploid was a giant! She was easily the biggest thing X had ever seen in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alia?! How are you so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing a soft smile Alia gestured to the area around her, \"Take a look around before you say that I got big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX began to look again and noticed what his comrade was referring to. The terrain X took as a foreign land was in fact a Maverick Hunter's living quarters, apparently Alia's living quarters. It simply looked transformed by the sheer scale of it all. X stood atop a desk that rose hundreds of feet in the air and went on for who knew how long. In the distance was a resting pod, also gigantic. At the edge of the room was a window that showcased a city in the distance, but it was all too fuzzy given the sheer distance from X's perspective. And beside him was Alia's computer, once again enormous. He didn't have to be a machine to figure it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...shrank?\" X uttered in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia nodded, \"Yeah. After we recovered you from that battle with the Maverick you began to exhibit strange phenomena. By the time you got to base you were like this. We did what could to repair you but your X-Buster needed some extra work. And we needed someone to look after you because of your size so...Here you are. I volunteered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...\" X nodded, all of it a bit much to take in. \"What are we going to do about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a huge number of specialists working on that, and if it's okay with you. I'd like to do a bit of testing myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Test away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia nodded, \"I hope you don't mind, but I would prefer it if I were a bit more...<i>comfortable...\"</i> X raised an eyebrow at his friend's words when he saw her take a seat at the desk and begin to reach for her leg attachments. Or rather, boots as it would happen to be. Alia was removing her footwear to reveal a pair of well-designed, bare feet. Each toe seemed to wiggle as realistically as a human's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nX let out a surprised sound, \"Wow Alia. Not many Reploids have removable footwear, let alone feet. That's impressive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia smiled at the shrunken Reploid, \"Yeah I guess so. I never really thought about it.\" Alia stared at her toes, painted pink like her armor. Or rather, designed to appear painted pink. \"I was designed<i> very</i> thoroughly.\" There was almost a seductive tone in Alia's voice as she began to move her hands for her chest piece. X Could only stare in disbelief as that too began to slide off, revealing a feminine body type underneath, still covered with the black underneath though. Alia was designed so much like a regular girl X...honestly X wondered if he was aroused by the sight of her. She was so bare compared to normal, it was practically the human equivalent of being naked in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlia caught X staring and giggled nervously, \"Yeah, I was designed with a completely human appearance so all this other stuff is actually just robotic accessories. Kind of like clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really amazing Alia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic Reploid leaned over so her eyes were mischievously eyeing X, \"Oh you haven't seen nothing yet.\" Up close X stared into the massive pupils. He wondered exactly what Alia meant by that...</span></div></div>",

That night in camp she tested it, expelling a large amount of magic and focusing on the small bird she'd been studying she released the spell. There was a large drop for Morrigan as she fell to the ground, her new instincts activating just in time for her to flap enough to not crash to the ground. Looking herself over she was proud of herself for a job well done and cancelled the spell.

Hawke asked pointing to herself ''Oh, I did it, just like you asked'' ''I did what!?'' ''We came home and you were wasted, you wanted me to shrink you and do 'things' your exact words were 'make me small babe, i want to be wholey within you, I want to feel your walls contract around my entire being as you come undone from me squirming deep inside you''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke gaped and blushed, she hadn't expected Merrill to find out about her fantasy like that ''Are you sure I didn't want you in ME?'' she asked already knowing the answer ''Nope I asked you last night, you said you didn't want more control you wanted no control for a little while'' ''Ok, well how about you unshrink me and we forget all about this incident...''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuprisingly Hawke was grabbed roughly by Merrill, her fingers wrapped around her with her thumb pressed firmly on her breasts ''No! I've waited all night for this, all your touches as you shrunk, your little body so close to my face sleephumping our pillow. I had to resist your advances to protect you, but I wanted to badly to just take you! But I couldn't risk you shock sobering or waking up in an unfamilier place and though you know my body wonderfully, my vagina, ass and even my breasts are completely different at your size. You wanted less power my love, I'll take it all. So listen here Hawke, you aren't getting bigger until I say so, and I'm not going to even consider it until I have you inside me and you make me cum from your squirming'' Merrill ordered, smirking when she felt Hawke's juices dripping onto her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawke couldn't help herself this was a dream come true, sure when they were still new to Krikwall she'd imagined shrinking down and being swallowed up by Isabella's impressive cleavage but as she got to know and later love cute little Merril her fantasies had also moved to the beautiful elven mage; crawling inside her vagina, squirming feet first into her tight ass hole and sleeping contently between her unbeleivably soft, large breasts, even imagining Merrill putting her in her mouth and sucking on her from time to time.
