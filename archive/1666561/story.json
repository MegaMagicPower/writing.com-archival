Instead, she found only a single ring, a teal emerald encrusted inside.  Deciding to try it on anyways, the ring embued her with a new set of knowledge.  The ring was a Hypnosis Ring, allowing her to brainwash people into being her loyal minions.  Using this knowledge, Rogue flew off to recruit to first member of her new team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is her first recruit?</span></div></div>",

If only there was some way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Amy,\" Rouge said as she walked out from the shadows, \"I couldn't help but notice how down you looked.  I think I can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked up, surprised that Rouge was offering to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can help me win Sonic's heart?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about Sonic anymore,\" Rouge responded as she lifted the ring up and hypnotized Amy.  Her eyes closed as her mind was rewritten by the ring. Her cheery, fangirl nature was slowly replaced by Rouge's seductive, treasure-loving personality. Amy's thoughts filled with a devotion to her new mistress. Her feelings for Sonic remained, but supressed. It could be assumed that the next time Sonic and Amy met, Amy would attempt to seduce him like Rouge would. Amy's mouth shifted into a Rouge-like grin as her eyes opened, fully changed into Rouge's new minion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I await your command,\" Amy said in a seductive, Rouge-like tone.</span></div></div>",

Furthermore he explained that they would be having the next scheduled check up in the morning. With the information Amelia contacted Rouge over a specialized GUN communicator she was given before getting split up and explained that they would need to wait for her which Rouge actually was more than comfortable with as it would mean she could enslave the other two Rogues as she would be there with a machine designed to make the uniform Rouge uses within seconds that would match the body type of an woman that was last scanned. If a male is scanned the machine will not only change their gender but will make them match the same body type of the last woman scanned, Rouge planned on doing that after they are hypnotized because it wasn't immediate. She also expressed that they would need a few males on the team so only one of the two guys would be turned female which that would be decided once they were also hypnotized.</span></div></div>",

Long locks of purple cascaded down her back in a way that seemed more like liquid then hair and only added to her already immense appeal, and to top it off, she had the most gorgeous emerald green eyes Rouge had ever laid eyes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer outfit didn't take anything away either, comprising of a tight black tank top with a purple stripe which showed her mid-riff and a matching short skirt that showed of her legs perfectly. A pair of green and purple knee high boots and matching forearm bands with spikes around the wrists finished the outfit along with a green head band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it bluntly, Mina Mongoose was H-O-T HOT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Oh hello.

I think your the greatest pop star EVER!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia squealed in joy as she praised the mongoose while getting just a little to close and personal as her eyes sparked in awe. Mina on the other hand, was feeling a bit put out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Uuuuuh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe awkward moment came to an end as Rouge grabbed Amelia by the back of her cat suit and pulled her a more comfortable distance from the idol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Terribly sorry about that Hon, my friend here and I were in the audience to your concert tonight and once it was over she just <i>HAD</i> to meet you. She's a big fan you see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> The biggest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Oh no, it's no trouble. I love being able to talk to fans, it's my favourite part of the job, I just wasn't expecting her to be so passionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how she bought the cover story, Rouge moved onto the next step in the plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Pardon me Miss Mina, but may we continue this in your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned closer and whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Strictly speaking we're not supposed to be back here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later a look of realization crossed Minas face as she figured out what the fruit bat was alluding too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Oh! Ohohohoh, yes of course. Please, come right in, I'd rather not get you guys in trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door a bit wider to let her two fans in, Mina looked up and down the hallway to make sure no one had seen anything, all the while missing the dark smirks that crossed Rouge and Amelias faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident the coast was clear Mina closed the door before turning around to address the two visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> So what can I do for you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for the final step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Well ma'am, I was just wondering, if perhaps... could I get your autograph?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina smiled, it was an all to common request, but the look of hope and joy on Amelias face reminded of why she never tired of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Of course. Just let me find a pen and I'll get right on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to the desk behind her, and her back to her guests, Mina made her final mistake.<br>\r\nAll it took was a nod of Rouges head, and before Mina knew it the pink hedgehog grabbed her from behind and whirled her around to face her mistress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Hey! What the? What's going on?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Not to worry Mina. You'll soon know the answer for yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Rouge pointed her ring at Mina and let the red hypnotic waves flow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds the look of panic on Minas face faded into a blank stare as the ring slowly erased her will, then slowly, her eyelids started to drop, down, down, down, the second her eyes closed the ring began to rewrite her mind, personality traits that were always there were erased and filled in with Rouges seductive nature. Her sense of will was still there, but much less then before and over lapped with complete loyalty and devotion to Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the process was complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina opened her eyes immediately giving Rouge a seductive look. Mina Mongoose the pop star was gone, in her place, was something else entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> How may I be of use my Mistress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice now oozed sexuality and seduction, causing a shiver of excitement to rush down Rouges spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Oh don't worry, my little songbird, I'm sure I'll think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Mina turned her attention to Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Oh darling, you'll never get anywhere with such a loose hold. Put some weight in it, I wanna feel those hot little tits against my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Oh, you like this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking Minas advice to heart Amelia began to slowly grind her breasts against the sexy singers spine, bringing a smirk to her lips when she heard her new partner purr and moan as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Mmmmmmmm oooooooh yeah. That's it, harder, harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina reached back and grabbed Amelias pert little ass and began to thrust it against her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the two girls began a sensual dance. Constantly grinding against each other in slow, fluid movements as their faces became flush and there moans grew, all of which was on full display for Rouge.</span></div></div>",

Like you wouldn't believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina turned to Amelia to shoot her a wink to emphasise her point causing the pink hedgehog to giggle seductively in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Good, then I have some instructions for you. The second you have the chance, come to this address, tonight. And you'll have your chance to finish what was started here, and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge passed a small slip of folded paper to Mina, the singer listening to her mistresses word with rapt attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> And remember darling. Come alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo seal the deal, Rouge brought her lips to Mina in a passionate yet short kiss, the fleeting nature of the action leaving the bats newest thrall wanting for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Do you understand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Yes my Mistress. I promise, I'll be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Good. Then it's time for us to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge turned to the door and made for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Come along Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Yes Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia immediately turned to follow Rouge out the door, but paused to shot Mina a lustful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> See you tonight, Lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina returned Amelias look with one of her own, even licking her lips for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Count on it, you sexy minx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the door closed, and Mina was left alone with her thoughts of what was gonna happen later tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i><u>Later that same night</u></i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina lay in her bed at the 5 star hotel she was housed in for the night, glancing at the bedside table that held her alarm clock showed her it was 10:55 at night. Everyone was in bed asleep by now, the only one awake, was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was show time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping quietly to her feet, Mina quickly dressed in her usual tank top, skirt, boots and arm bands before grabbing a trench coat, sunglasses and hat. Wouldn't do for her to get recognized after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow ready, she quickly and quietly made her way out of her room, down to the ground floor, and quickly out the door into the streets. Then she turned, having memorized Rouges address long ago and made for her mistresses choice of dwelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all that came with it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just over an hour later Mina arrived at her destination. She had come a long way, almost to the other side of town, to area where the night gave life to some of the most loudest laughs, most enjoyable parties, and fondest memories. An area littered with clubs, bars, arcades and so on that was known only by one name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight Babylon, the city that never sleeps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, on most nights, yes on this night of nights, Night Babylon was as dark and quiet as the rest of town, not a late night partier or laughing group of friends to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out even the city that never sleeps took Sundays off... go fig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the young Mongoose was one of the many night clubs the street had to offer, three stories high and a trio of glass revolving doors acting as the entrance, mounted over said doors was a set of neon lights, currently dark from receiving no power, arranged to spell out the title \"Club Rouge\" and a pair of seductive eyes winking out upon the streets before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina felt a shiver of excitement shot up her spine at the sight, she was here, and now it was time to meet the one who brought her here, her queen and mistress Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she no longer needed them, she removed her coat and hat and threw them into a nearby dumpster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, after feeling one more thrill along her body, she stepped through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark and quiet as Mina walked inside, the lights were off and all was perfectly still. Glancing to her left revealed a small bar filled to the brim with various liquors and beverages of all makes.<br>\r\nTo the right was a set of black leather sofas of various shapes and sizes, some with tables, some without.<br>\r\nAnd ahead of her Mina could just make out the signs of a respectably sized dance floor, with various strobe lights and a disco ball hanging above it.<br>\r\nFurther up the young mongoose could just make out the silhouette of a raised platform, but in the pitch black darkness she couldn't make out what it actually was or even what it was for, if anything at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding it wasn't important and that she'd had enough site seeing Mina slowly, but confidently made her way across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHOOSH CRACK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Mina could only describe as the sound of a whip made the singer jump and whirl around in surprise, as she tried to located the source in the inky black that was around her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Welcome my little songbird, we've been waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of her voice, a spot light at the back end of the room came on to reveal that the silhouette from before was actually a stage for any and all the acts Rouge would book for the club, and along with it, Rouge herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina felt her breath leave her as her heart beat faster at the sight of her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on a well carved throne in the centre of the stage, Rouge had traded in her usual cat suit for something more fitting for the occasion. A black, skin tight, leather corset graced her torso pressing and emphasizing her firm breasts and succulent hips for all to see. Her arms were encased in a matching pair of gloves that hugged her arms snuggly and reached just past her elbows.<br>\r\nHer legs wore a pair of high-heeled, leather knee high boots that made her legs seem like those of a goddess not of this world as they shined in the light.<br>\r\nAnd to complete her image, a black domino mask was strapped upon her face, rather then hiding it, it only seemed to make it more attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina couldn't take her eyes off her as she felt a warm slick feeling well up between her thighs and her nipples stiffened and poked through her top, exposed for the world to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Isn't that right Amelia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>WHOOSH CRACK</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whips crack made Mina jerk around again as Amelia emerged from the darkness behind her, dressed in a perfect crimson replica of her mistresses choice of d\u00e9cor, and long bull whip in hand, and lustful gleam in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Oh yes Mistress. We've been waiting, for so very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelias voice was like warm honey to Minas ears as she felt another shiver pass over her.<br>\r\nAt last, she found her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> W-what's...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stuttered her question out before her voice died again, she was more aroused and confused then afraid.<br>\r\nBefore long, Rouge stepped down from her throne and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> It's quite simple my dear, since I recruited you, I wanted to make absolutely certain that I had made the right choice, that you were worthy of my attention like Amelia was. It was then, while waiting for you, I decided to put you to a test, an initiation if you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving come within arms reach of her subject, Rouge ran one of her leather clad fingers along her chin to raise Minas eyes to meet her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> So tell me Mina...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in closer her hand rubbing softly against Minas breast, and whispered softly into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Are you ready to prove yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina felt her face grow so hot she was sure she'd burst into flame.<br>\r\nHer mind clouded by lust she leaned towards Rouges ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b>... take me.</span></div></div>",

And the next the lights went out, taking Rouge and her warmth with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lights came back on again she was surprised to find herself in a completely different situation from a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still in the middle of the dance floor, with Rouge having returned to lounging in her throne on the stage, both of them framed by spot lights. But that was pretty much all that was the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing the mongoose noticed was that she was cuffed to a pair of long chains that hung down from above, forcing her to raise her arms and keep them there. A brief struggle made it clear that wasn't gonna change anytime soon.<br>\r\nBelow she found her ankles were cuffed to some kind of bar which forced her legs to spread out lewdly to all who could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then realized that her clothes were gone, or rather, replaced. In their place was an outfit she'd never seen, made from deep navy leather was a tight corset that unlike Rouges, left her pert breasts exposed and out in the open. A brief tickle of air between her legs revealed that her ass and pussy were equally naked. Her arms were sealed within elbow length gloves, and her legs in a matching pair of knee high, high heeled boots.<br>\r\nProbably most shocking however, was the rubber ball gag strapped to her mouth, ensuring that she could only make the faintest of sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Minas inspection of herself was interrupted when she heard the clinking of boots on the floor behind her. Turning her head back revealed Amelia, the pink hedgehog who used to be Amy Rose still dressed in her crimson Dominatrix outfit, strutting slowly towards her. A lustful fire burning fierce in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was within arms reach she glanced towards Rouge. The bat said nothing as she gestured for Amelia to begin what Mina supposed was her initiation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot needing anything more, Amelia unravelled the bull whip she had in hand, and slowly trailed the handle along the tight curves of he prisoners rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinas heart began beat a mile a minute and her body quivered, but whether it was from fear or anticipation, she could not tell.<br>\r\nShe didn't have long to think about it, barely a minute later Amelia stepped back and swung her arm to lash out with her whip against Minas ass with snap, forcing a groan from the mongooses throat loud enough to break through the ball gag, if only just!<br>\r\nNot giving her a second to recover Amelia lashed out again, and again, and again, before long the pink hedgehog had build up a tempo of whip lashes, one every two seconds smacking against the former pop stars ass cheeks leaving behind a faint red welt with every strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinas mind was a confused mess, she should've been afraid, she should've wanted to escape, to get loose and run as far from here as she could.<br>\r\nInstead she felt a familiar heat and slickness between her legs that just seemed to get worse the more she felt the whips bite, all thoughts off fear and escape were instead filled in with arousal and lust for more.<br>\r\nShe was effectively being tortured, and she LOVED IT!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long her yelps of pain evolved into groans of pleasure, she started to thrust her butt out to meet the whip as it swung around, her nipples had stiffened so much she could almost swear they would pop off, and all the while a large puddle of her feminine juices dribbled out from her weeping core to the floor making it impossible to hide her true feelings about her predicament. Not that she would want to by this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know how long this went on for, but all to soon, it came to an end and Amelia ceased her attack on the former singers, now sufficiently marked behind.<br>\r\nMina was a mess, her body hardly had the strength to stand anymore, leaving her hanging by the chains that held her arms fast, her face was flushed and sweat matted her fur as it glistened in the light while her body shuddered with arousal waiting to break free, her mind was filled with so much lust she could barely think straight, and all the while, the pile of pussy fluids continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, having discarded her whip, stepped in front of her and remove the gag. Her mouth free of obstruction, Mina gulped the air down in a desperate attempt to regain her breath and control, only to have the former stolen away again when Amelia brought her chin up and smashed a passionate kiss upon her lips, her tongue forcing it's way down her throat.<br>\r\nNot wanting to be left behind Mina soon found herself returning the action in kind, the two tongues locked in a fight for dominance.<br>\r\nBut again Mina found the activity ending far to soon when Amelia pulled back, shooting her bound victim a sultry look before applying a chaste peck to Minas forehead before moving to unshackle her charge at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cuffs came loose Minas legs gave out as she fell to kneel on all fours still trying to gain full control of her body, Amelia stepped beside her and nodded towards Rouge, prompting Mina to turn her gaze upon her mistress. What she saw made her pussy gush again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was still seated in her throne, her face was flush and her breathing was hard, sweat glistened in the spot light over head as she gazed upon her followers with a sexual stare. When Minas and her eyes met she raised her arm and made a \"come hither\" gesture, beckoning the mongoose to approach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding no further prompting, Mina slowly began to crawl her way towards her mistresses side. It took only minutes, but to Mina it might as well have been an eternity but she soon found herself kneeling before the bat, who in her eyes, was equal to a goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Minas eyes on her, Rouge slowly spread her legs open to reveal her corset had a hidden zipper placed directly in front of her women hood, of which she promptly pulled down to reveal her shining vulvar in all it's wet musky glory.<br>\r\nNo more needed to be said or done, without a thought Mina dived right between Rouges thighs and her tongue began to lavish the sweet lips before  her as Rouge moaned and yelped in ecstasy above her. Minas tongue was everywhere, it lashed left, it dashed right, it dove deep, it barely made contact, some times slow and long, others quick and short, she did all she could think of to make her mistress quake in pleasure, and if the yelps, moans and praises were anything to go by, she was doing a good job of it. Her focus was solely of the divine lips and sweet juices before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why she never noticed Amelia approaching from behind, or the 8\" two way strap on she was wearing, or even when she placed her hands on Minas hips, but she certainly noticed when the fake dong smashed it's way into her sopping cunny!<br>\r\nFor the third time tonight Mina found her breath stolen away as she let loose a pleasure laced scream that rattled the windows as Amelia ploughed the sex toy deep into her love canal, moaning wantonly with every thrust!<br>\r\nBefore she could recover Rouge grabbed her hair and forced her face back against her own pussy, moaning as lewdly, if not more, then Amelia, soon the three had formed a chain of ecstasy between each other, with every thrust Amelia sent a surge of pleasure up her and Minas spines, which in turn caused Mina to moan loudly, the vibrations of her tongue coursed through Rouges vagina propelling the bats ecstasy to new heights in it's own right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room echoed with a symphony of moans, yelps and cries of lust as the air grew hot and heavy with the scent of sex and debauchery, the girls became lost to the outside world, all that mattered was what was happening right there, right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo them, this was paradise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as with all things, even paradise had to end. Amelias thrusts grew steadily quicker and harder as time went on while Minas tongue lost all semblance of form and licked and lashed wildly without rhyme or reason as Rouge squeezed her thighs around the mongooses head while her moans grew louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like a spring winding to tightly, something snapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting loose an animalistic scream Amelia slammed the strap on deeper into Minas cunt then ever before as her body quaked and her pussy let loose a flood of fem-juice, Mina following close behind as her back arched so much she almost folded in two, her muffed cries lost amongst Amelias wails, and predictably Rouge ended the train of orgasms with her thighs latching onto Minas head like a vice as her hip thrust out of her control to pump her cum down the thralls throat, all while crying to the heavens as her mind went blank with euphoria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like forever, the pleasurable rush came to an end and the trio soon found their strength slowly fading as they collapsed in a heap of flesh and cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing what little she had left Rouge raised Minas eye to meet her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Welcome to the gang, my little songbird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Thank you... my Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the Rouge gang faded into a deep sleep, never to wake until morning, where there was sure to be more escapades to be had.</span></div></div>",

Wouldn't you say my compatriots?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one shed her suit in a flash to reveal Rouge the Bat, now dressed in her usual cat-suit with white gloves and boots and pink heart breast plate and boot tips.<br>\r\nA proud smirk stretched across her face while her ring gleamed in her sun from it's position on her finger.<br>\r\nIn her hand was a gold necklace absolutely flooded with jewels of all shape, colour and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>???:</b> Most definitely Mistress! I haven't so much fun in a while!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second follow suit to reveal Amelia the Hedgehog. Known once upon time as Amy Rose, Amelia used to be a sweet (if sometimes angry) young woman known for her bright red dress with matching boots and bubbly personality.<br>\r\nBut once Rouge had sunk her claws into her, Amy Rose was erased from the world, and replace by Amelia, a seductive and devoted servant to the fruit bats every whim, her personality almost completely rewritten to emulate the one who made her.<br>\r\nAnd with the replacement of her mind, so to was her dress, she now wore a replica of Rouges cat-suit, but with red hearts instead of pink, and her eyes and lips were painted violet and red respectively to complete the image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrasped in her hand, was a cut diamond that was bigger then her whole fist that sparkled when the sun hit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> And what of you my dear? Did you enjoy the first taste of your new life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>???:</b> Oh yes Mistress, I can't believe I was so na\u00efve to not know such a thrilling experience existed till now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last maiden shed her suit to reveal none other then Mina the Mongoose. Little more then a week ago, Mina was an up and coming pop star with the voice of and angel, then Rouge came along and now the young sweet mongoose was a seductive minx in sheeps clothing, and her voice became a force that could subjugate men and entice women with but a single word.<br>\r\nAnd just like Amelia before her, she had abandoned her old outfit for a perfect copy of her new mistresses cat-suit with purple heart in place of pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was holding a large blood red ruby that seemed to grow warm in the daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Well you do now sweetie, and I must say your very good at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia gushed as she slowly wrapped her arms around Minas body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Perhaps we should take a moment this afternoon to... celebrate your success. Don't you agree?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amelia spoke, her hands slowly travelled south to rest upon Minas supple ass before giving a brief squeeze, drawing a small moan from her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> I think that's a wonderful idea. And to think, we'll be doing a lot of celebrating in the future. Between the three of us, this city will be ours in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her speech was over Mina brought Amelia in close and the two girls soon started a full on make out session right there.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rouge was thinking over what Mina just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Only the three of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, half catching her Mistresses words broke off from her and Minas lip lock to address her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> What did you say Mistress?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> I was just thinking over what Mina just said.

There's still plenty of sexy ladies in our inner circle we have yet to claim after all, and I could always use some extra staff to help run the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then glanced back at the to lovers with a teasing smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> And some extra play mates to keep you two out of trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three broke into a small bout of laughter at that before Amelia spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> So, you plan to keep recruiting then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Indeed I do my right hand.

Now then, let's get back to the club! We strike tomorrow and have much planning to do before hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Rouges call Mina and Amelia snapped a quick salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina/Amelia:</b> Ma'am yes ma'am!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the girls were off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Next afternoon, Emerald Forest</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocated over 100 miles south of Station Square is a mass of trees and small meadows famously know as the Emerald forest. What make's this forest famous is the fact that no matter the weather or seasons, the leaves and foliage the forest contains remains constantly healthy, vibrant and green.<br>\r\nNo one knows how this is possible, and many who have tried to learn why have failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what is known, is that the forests mysterious power make's it the perfect place to live, hence why, nestled just past it's edge, there was a small village, filled with life and a warm homely atmosphere... but who cares about that?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you care about is a small 2 story house build further out from the rest of the village, not quite enough to be lonely, but enough to have a decent level of privacy and peace.<br>\r\nSurrounded on all sides by various flower bushes, the home was the perfect picture... except for a certain trio peeking through one of the windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge, Amelia and Mina were all nestled in a bush closest to the window, peering inside to get a good look at their target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lo and behold, there she was sitting on the couch while reading a book, completely unaware of the ones spying on her... or their plans for her.<br>\r\nVanilla was a sight to behold, at the age of 35 she was still a prime example of young beauty. Fair and glossy cream fur covered her from head to toe. Her long ears draped delicately down the back of her head, tip with orange fuzz. A similar orange her vibrant brown eyes. And upon her head was a tuft of matching orange hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes exemplified her sense of conservative modesty and maturity from her ankle length lavender dress to her crimson vest, finished off with a blue ascot tied around her collar.<br>\r\nAnd while it couldn't be seen, many a witness would tell that hidden beneath that prim and proper shield, was the body of a super model, with tight muscles, a decent sized rack, sensuous curves, and an ass to die for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, time had certainly been kind to this bunny, as Rouges grin confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> There she is girls. All ripe and ready for picking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina, however, didn't share her mistresses enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> That's great and all... but how are we gonna get her. Especially with her in the way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio turned where Mina was pointing to see what had her on edge, laying on her stomach, kicking her legs contently while scribbling on some paper was Cream, Vanillas 8 year old daughter.<br>\r\nBeing the spitting image of her mom at that age while decked out in her cute little orange dress, Cream was the living embodiment on cute and innocent.<br>\r\nBut despite her being there, Rouges smile didn't fade, in fact, it seemed even more proud then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Not to worry Mina, we planned for this remember. Amelia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Rouges beckoning Amelia dived back into the bush, after about 5 minutes of rustling around she suddenly popped back up again. But her cat suit was gone, and in it's place was a pink and white shirt that ended as a skirt just past her hips and a pair of bright pink jeans with some red and yellow sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Whoa... where was she keeping that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Questions for later darling. Now, let's go over the plan once more to make sure we're on the same page.<br>\r\nAmelia, you job is to act like your old self in order to get into the house, if those two saw me or Mina with you they'd get suspicious. Once inside you'll convince you to let you stay the night, you two with me so far?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two listeners nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Once the sun sets and everyone starts going to bed, you'll use the chance to unlock...</span></div></div>",

Why did you wait so long before telling us that? And 2. Why not an upstairs window?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge whirled around to look at Mina, rather incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> In order, I was pausing for dramatic effect and 2...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured to their chests and waists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> With these things?!

One drop of this, and not even an elephant stampede will wake that kid up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Sounds simple. What then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Once the clock strikes midnight, me and Mina will sneak in and meet you upstairs, and once we do we'll head for Vanillas room. I doubt I need to tell you what happens then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite Rouges confident tone Mina was still a bit unsure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Mistress, are sure this is gonna work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Course it will! I'm 95% sure it will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> And if by some chance it doesn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was quite for a long time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> We hit bricks and don't stop until we hit Mexico!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of their leaders ridiculous declaration, Mina and Amelia both face-planted with a loud thud. And all the while Rouge just stood there laughing weakly as a sweat drop formed on the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> But anywho, the time for talk is over. Amelia, your on honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Yes ma'am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStriking a quick salute, Amelia jumped out of the bush and approached the front door. Taking a deep breath and putting on her best \"Amy Rose\" expression, she raised her hand and knocked gently on the doors wooden surface.<br>\r\nTen seconds later the door opened to reveal Vanilla. The motherly rabbit smiled when she saw who'd come to visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vanilla:</b> Oh Amy, it's so good to see you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> Hi Ms Vanilla. I'm not bothering you at all am I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vanilla:</b> Oh no dear, it's always a joy to have you visit. Please, won't you come in? I'm sure Cream will be happy to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> That be great! Thanks so much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two made their way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the window, Rouge and Mina watched as Amy and Cream exchanged a hug of greeting before they all sat down and started talking enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Phase one complete. Now we just have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>That Night 9:45pm</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was pitch black when Amy looked out the window and took notice of outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> Oh my gosh! I didn't realize it was so late! I can't walk home in that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmys ears drooped in sorrow as she looked outside.<br>\r\nVanilla however, ever the mother figure of the group, place a comforting hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vanilla:</b> Oh I'm so sorry dear, I should've checked the time sooner. But if you need to stay the night, we have plenty of room to spare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy perked up, flashing a ghost of a smirk before turning to face Vanilla with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> Really?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream hopped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cream:</b> Of course! You can sleep in my room. Ever since Cheese went into his evolution, mommy had his stuff stored away, so there lots of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> Is that ok with you Vanilla?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vanilla:</b> Hehe do I have a choice? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy/Cream:</b> YAY!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls cheered, Vanilla turned to an old clock on the wall, it read 10:05, way past a certain rabbit families bedtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vanilla:</b> Well with that settled, perhaps we should turn in for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cream/Amy:</b> Okay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Cream skipped towards the stairs, a giddy smile on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cream:</b> Oh this'll be like a sleepover! We're gonna have so much fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smirked behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> (<u><i>You don't know the half of it</i>.</u>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink infiltrator then noticed Vanilla heading for the kitchen, no doubt to lock up the back door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> Oh Vanilla! Why not go up to bed. I'll take care of locking up for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vanilla:</b> Oh, how very sweet. Thank you Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amy:</b> Oh it's nothing. It's the least I could do to thank you for letting me stay here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile between them, Vanilla travelled up stairs to bed... and once out of site, Amelia got to work. As she approached the door she took hold of the handle and opened it to see if the door would make any noise. It didn't, it was well oiled and would remain silent for the whole night.<br>\r\nClosing it she jiggled the handle so as to give the impression she was securing it. Then she removed the key and placed it on the kitchen counter, without turning the lock.<br>\r\nThe house now fully vulnerable, Amelia turned and headed upstairs, an extra sway in her hips as she went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Midnight</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house was silent, not a sound to be heard, not a movement to be seen. Upstairs, two rabbits breathed contently as the slept away, while a certain hedgehog lay wide awake... waiting for her time to strike.<br>\r\nShe didn't have to wait long.<br>\r\nFrom downstairs, Amelia could hear soft footsteps heading to the upper floor. Her wait over, she slowly and quietly got out of bed and left the bedroom, closing the door with a faint 'click'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hall, she soon found her Mistress and fellow thrall waiting for her, looking very pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Nice work Amelia. You've made me proud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Amelia:</b> Thank you Mistress. It was easy honestly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Mina:</b> Being such a close friend of theirs, I suppose it would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three femmes chuckled at that before refocusing on the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Right then, where's the MILFs room?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia pointed down the hall just past Rouge to a closed door at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Rouge:</b> Perfect. Then lets get to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly Rouge was interrupted by the sound of a door opening... right behind them!<br>\r\nThe three whirled around as a small figure in a small night gown an sleep cap came into view and spoke in a sleepy voice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Cream:</b> /Yawn/...

What about you?! I told you to knock her out to avoid this from happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did! I don't understand what happened! I gave her a glass of the Nyquil just like you told me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you actually make sure she drank it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm not the one who zapped her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well <i>I</i> wouldn't have if a pink hedgehog had done her job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whispered argument went on back and forth, and all the while Mina continued to watch the rings magic affect Cream. Then she noticed something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst, hey girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"WHAT?!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina flinched under the angry gazes, but continued none the less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me, or is something different about the spell this time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Minas question Rouge and Amelia turned back to Cream in confusion to find her still standing there. It was strange, after all the spell should've finished and turned Cream into a mini clone of Rouge by now, but it seemed to still be in the process of doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, seemingly from out of nowhere, ribbons made of red light surged from the rabbits back and encased her in a skin-tight cocoon that covered her from head to tow!<br>\r\nNobody knew what to make of the spectacle and were again reduced to stunned silence as they watched what was happening before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if by magic, Creams shape began to change, her body seemed to grow and lengthen, her legs grew longer and her thighs expanded. Her arms lengthened and ended in dainty little hands. Her chest seem to balloon into a pair of firm breasts of at least a C-cup and her rear filled out into a tight and enticing ass. To finish a shower of glossy orange hair pooled out of her head to fall down her back and across half her face before ending at her waists. She now looked to be somewhere between 18 to 19 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't stop there, as her night gown was torn apart bit by bit before reforming into a completely different outfit, silky black elbow length gloves slid upon her arms as a pair of matching silk stockings covered her legs. A bra encased her breasts tightly as a pair of panties slid into place between her legs. And to top it all off, a garter belt, black silk like everything else, wrapped around her tight waist and hooked to her stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it started, the cocoon of light ribbons slowly began to reveal Creams new form before vanishing into the ether. As soon as they were gone, Creams eyes slowly opened as she gave her audience a sultry smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she spoke, in a voice that made it clear that the young innocent and na\u00efve child from before was most definitely not there anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for opening my eyes Mistress. How may I repay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rouge gang just stood there, stilled shocked at what had just happened, until Amelia finally stepped forwards with a look of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cream? Are... are you ok?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream simply smiled and strutted towards Amelia, her eyes boring lustfully into the hedgehogs own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes Amy, I feel great. In fact, I've never felt more alive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the rabbit spoke she slowly slinked her arms around Amelia and drew her in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And as I remember, I have <i>you</i> to thank for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amelia could react, Cream closed the distance and trapped her friend in a smouldering and passionate kiss as her arms roved across Amelias body, squeezing and massaging everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Rouge and Mina were examining the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is a surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it mean Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently, this little trinket has more powers to it then I first realized. This could be most interesting.\" (<i>Though I do wonder what kind of person the original owner was to NEED such a function. Oh well, questions for later.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the kissing duo, Rouge was just in time to see them separate, gasping for breath while Amelia looked dazed and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you look a little busy right now, so we'll go on with the mission while you two have some fun. hmhmhmhm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCreams smile grew and she began to guide the still dizzy Amelia back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my Mistress. Come along Amelia, I have lots to give to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O...ok...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the door to Creams room closed with a quite click, and as if on cue, Rouge and Mina turned down the hall towards Vanillas.</span></div></div>",

Your body is so amazing. So tight. So curvy. And so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly swiped a finger across Amelias damp pussy through her jeans, causing the hedgehog to gasp as a bolt of pleasure jumped up her spine, before bringing it to her lips to taste what she had discovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a second later Cream slowly reached for Amelias shirt, firmly dragging a finger over her tit and around her stiff nipple, and pulled the straps off her shoulders and proceeding to pull the whole thing down to her waist, allowing Amelias perky breasts to spill free into the outside world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no bra? What a naughty girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelias face grew redder then ever at Creams taunt, but her mind was soon wiped clean with pleasure as she felt a soft breath against her pert nipples.<br>\r\nCream giggled at the reaction and blew against Amelias nipple again, spurring another gasp, before bringing her lips up close to the heaving hedgehogs ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to play.\" Her warning given, Cream brought herself face to face with Amelias breasts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD!\" Amelias body shook and spasmed  as what felt like a bolt of lightning surged through her!<br>\r\nA look down soon revealed why, Cream had wrapped her mouth around one of her nipples, sucking deeply as her tongue slashed across the top, while her hand wrapped around her other breast, kneading and squeezing it as her fingers pinched and twisted the pert nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh oh oooooh god! Yes! Yes! More Cream! More! Please! Don't stop! OOOOOOH DON'T EVER STOOOP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia felt as if her mind was melting from the sheer bliss she felt! It couldn't get any better... but it did!<br>\r\nFor a brief moment Amelia felt a chill over her moist nipple as Cream stopped sucking it and left it bare again. But before she could protest she felt herself fall into her euphoric trance twice as deep as before when Cream began to give the other nipple the same wonderful attention as the first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amelia became lost in sea of ecstasy, Cream felt her own body responding, her breasts began to feel tight inside her silk bra, her nipples stiffened and sent sparks up her spine as they rubbed the clothing from inside and an erotic heat built between her thighs as they grew slick with her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could take no more! She needed Amelia! And she needed her <i><b>NOW!!!</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the pink hedgehogs nipple one final deep suck she let it go with a quiet pop, before raising to straddle her hips.<br>\r\nAs Amelia breathed heavily to regain her senses, she felt something soft land upon her face.<br>\r\nWith an unsteady hand she reached up and removed the obstruction to find a familiar black silk bra in her hand, before she turned her sight back to Cream, and felt her breath catch in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, mounting her hips was the most beautiful creature, except from Rouge, she'd ever seen. With red face, amber tresses cascading over half her face and back, and silk gloves framing a pair of perfect breasts that bounced with every breath, Cream was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cream watched her lovers eyes rove over her form she let loose a giggle. \"Like what you see hot stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Amelia said breathlessly as her eyes stayed glued to the perfect mounds before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to play with them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream leaned forward until her tit's were a scant distance from Amelias face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Amelia leaned in and clamped her lips around the bunnies teats and began to vigorously ravage it with her tongue while her hand mauled the other with abandon whilst Cream moaned in joy as she grinded her pussy against her partners through their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aahhh, Amy! Yes! That's it! Suck me! Lick me! Ravage me! Mmmmooooh yeeeeaaaah!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream was in heaven, her mind consumed in ecstasy from Amelias attention towards her boobs, all of which only got better when Amelia changed over to the other.<br>\r\nDown low, her hips grinded against her partners ever harder and faster, the friction making their pleasure spike higher as well as slowly push the pink hedgehogs jeans and panties down her wet, sodden legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough. Despite the shocks crashing through her system Cream still found herself craving more, much more!<br>\r\nBefore long, the cravings won out and the sexy rabbit pinned Amelia to the bed as she gazed at her with a pleading look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy! I can't take it anymore! I want you. I need you! Please, fuck me! Fuck me like a bitch in heat, now! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amelia could respond she found herself face to face with Creams bare ass and dripping pussy. It's moist sheen and heady musk driving her wild as the rabbit wiggled it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry Amy! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... as you wish, my little slut bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Amelia plunged her tongue deep into Creams snatch and wildly lashed in all directions against the girls inner walls.<br>\r\nCaught off guard by Amelias vigour, Creams arms gave out beneath her as she cried in ecstasy and thrust her snatch against her lovers lips. When she managed to regain herself she found herself staring at Amelias own core, every bit as wet and alluring as she imagined.<br>\r\nIt took her but a second to decide what to do before she dove head first into the honey pot in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the two gained a rhythm between each other as their tongues stroked, darted and swirled inside them, their moans vibrated inside them driving their pleasure to new heights which caused them to moan louder in a never ending cycle of pure pleasure that threatened to drive them insane.<br>\r\nBut it couldn't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cream I-I'm gonna...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too! Together Amy! Lets do it together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEgged on by their desire and lust, the two licked, sucked and moaned with all they had as they worked to make this a special ending to the night... and soon, it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cream-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy I-I'm-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>\"I'M CUUUMMMIIINNNG!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a crash the girls were enveloped in a white void of liquid euphoria as they rode their climax with abandon! It seemed to last forever as the pleasure crashed through their bodies again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll to soon however, the world soon came back into focus and their strengths sapped away as they both collapsed, both very tired and very satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this kind of thing happen often with Mistress Rouges group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More times then I can count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought a smile to the two girls faces as their eyes slowly dropped and they feel into a deep sleep, looking forward to their new lives together in the service of their Mistress.</span></div></div>",

Dream Manipulation. And all with an under layer of Hypnosis. Just who was this ring meant for?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina said nothing while Rouge pondered for a brief second, but then shook the thoughts away, there would be time to dwell on all that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, there was a hot piece of Momma Rabbit to add to her collection, and time was wasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSneaking quietly into the Doe's room, the Bat and Mongoose came up to bed, so close they could hear her quiet and steady breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla was fast asleep, gone to the world, and thus unaware and vulnerable to what lied ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly so as not to disturb her, Rouge raised and pointed the ring at the Mothers sleeping form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay close and hold on honey.\" She whispered to Mina, who nodded and took firm hold of her Mistresses hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, the ring activated, the familiar red glow shining faintly in the dark, but unlike before there were no rings or ribbons, instead the ring began to expel a thick red smog, quietly hissing into the air above Vanillas form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cloud became big enough to cover Vanillas head, Rouge and Mina soon faded and became the very same smog before joining the rest of the cloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first phase done, the spell moved on to the second as it slow descended on the unsuspecting Doe below, as it grew close the cloud began to split and reach out, 2 strands making their ways to Vanillas ears, whilst 2 more approached her mouth and nose. A final pair seeped between her toned legs before placing themselves before the women's mature pussy and anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smog held still for just a second, then, with zeal it surged it's way into it's chosen orifices, rushing to every nook as easily as if it were air, completely undetected by the sleeping form below it even as the last ounce of crimson vapor made it's way inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first there was silence, nothing to show any of the last few seconds had took place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, slowly at first, Vanilla began to breath heavily, and before long was gasping for breath, as if her body was on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas her arousal grew, the Rabbits cheeks became a glowing red, her D-Cup mammaries expanded and her nipples stiff, down low, her vulva grew slick and warm as the unnatural heat continued to climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooooooh... aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... hah hah hah hah...\" At last the Doe could no longer contain the feeling blasting through her, her voice breaking free in a series of hot moans and gasps against her will as her hands, by their own volition roved and explore the tight and firm curves that the mature woman possessed, spark shooting through her at every contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough, she had to have more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand went lower, past her bust, beyond her stomach, between her legs... \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!\" That was it! That was what she needed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wonderful, sublime, heavenly rush! She felt like she'd died and gone to heaven! Yet also felt more alive then ever before! Burning heat crashed through Vanillas body, making her feel as though she'd melted into a mere puddle of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, despite all of this the Mother of one did not wake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, even as her hand penetrated her very core the Doe remained within the land of nod, the rings spell constantly binding her to the world of dreams regardless of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she frolicked, lost in the pleasure, her dreams, and her very mind and soul with them, became warped and twisted into a shocking and wicked form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, the sleeping Mother was unable, and by now unwilling, to resist as the night went on.</span></div></div>",

Is anyone there? Hello?\" Try as she might however, the matrons calls went unanswered except for a slight echo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing nothing better to do, Vanilla started walking. Taking slow careful steps to insure she didn't run into anything.<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure how long she'd been walking, when she heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Perking her ears to listen carefully she heard the sound again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVoices. Faint ones, but there was no mistaking them.<br>\r\nQuickly Vanilla began to follow the sounds as she felt relief overtake her mind, happy to not be alone.<br>\r\nBut as she grew closer and the voices clearer, Vanilla realized that they seemed to, groaning?<br>\r\nYes that was is it, groans of pain were echoing from ahead, and in an instant Vanillas compassion and kindness kicked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, I best hurry and see if I can do something to help!\" Quick as she could in her dress, Vanilla made way to the source of the ailing voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer, she soon realized that the voice was in fact many, all making the same groans. Vanillas heart sank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, it's worse then I thought!\" Picking up speed she charged ahead, the wish to lend any aid or comfort she could at the forefront of her mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after a short time she finally saw something through the fog, and see came closer she found herself flabbergasted.<br>\r\nIt was a door! A simple plain white door with a simple brass door knob, yet said door was attached to nothing, no walls, no building, nothing. And a quick peek around it show there was nothing behind it either.<br>\r\nYet in spite of this, there was no mistaking that the voices, now clear as day to the Doe, WERE coming just beyond its frame, no matter how impossible such a thing should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly shaking off her confusion, Vanilla reached for the knob, her reason for being here now back as her top priority.<br>\r\nBut just as she grabbed hold she suddenly jumped ten feet back in shock as loud cry sounded out from the other side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear placing a vice grip on her heart, Vanilla surged forward and practically smashed in off it's hinges... only to freeze on the spot at the sight of the biggest shock of her life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the door was what looked be a personal library that one would find in a high class mansion, a dark navy carpet covered the floor while tall mahogany shelves packed to the brim with tomes reached to a ceiling that was to high to see, ancient torches hung from holders on the walls, and at the very back of the room was a very expensive looking rug place before a fire place, it's flames coating the room in a gentle light and warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Vanilla could care less about the room, she was more concerned with the people IN the room, and more importantly, what they were doing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were 3 in total, all female, the first was a pink Hedgehog with her quills styled as if it were hair that Vanilla instantly recognized as Amy, the same Amy currently a sleep in her daughters room!<br>\r\nThe second was a Mongoose with bold yellow fur and long wavy locks of purple hair strewn about her form. Vanilla had no clue who THAT was.<br>\r\nThe third however was the most confusing, all Vanilla could make out was that she was a Rabbit, but no more then that as the figure was obscured by shadow, thereby making any other feathers to her identity invisible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while as Vanilla took this in, the 3 maidens continued their perverse activities, Amy, currently keeling behind the mysterious rabbit while supporting her with her chest was currently in the mist of a passionate kiss with her, their tongues dancing and trading fluids provocatively, all while massaging and squeezing the strangers firm breasts. Pinching and pulling her stiff nipples every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mongoose on the other hand, was at the other end, down on her knees with her head nestled comfortably between the unknown Doe's shapely toned legs, her hands holding firmly and squeezing a pair of equally tight buttocks as she lashed her tongue over a sopping wet vulva that wink and leaked under the sinful attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd nestled between them, the shadowed figure could do nothing but moan and yelp the twos skilled ministrations, in a voice that seemed familiar to Vanilla, yet she could quite place it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that instant that Vanilla realized her mistake, what she had believed to be the sounds of someone in pain had in fact been the cries of ecstasy as these 3 girls had brought each other to pleasurable rapture, no doubt the reason for the scream also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified and embarrassed at barging in on something so interment, Vanilla felt her face grow hot as her cheeks grew bright red.<br>\r\nDeciding to hit bricks before they noticed her, Vanilla took a step back towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Finally decided to arrive for the show did you? And here I thought you'd never get here.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled by the voice, Vanilla spun round, and was even more shacked to find...</span></div></div>",

Oh yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Harder, HARDER! Please! Don't Stop! Give me more! Please MORE!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmys lovers were only to happy to oblige her, as the mongoose wrapped her succulent lips around one of the hedgehogs nipples before sucking it hard as the doe rapped her arm around to grab and tease the other while placing feather light kisses upon Amys neck sending her into a euphoric breakdown as her cries became squeals and her fem-juices showered the floor beneath her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, without knowledge or without care, Rouge and Vanilla watched the sinful performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, they certainly look like they're having fun.\" She glanced to Vanilla, smirking. \"Don't you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla didn't say anything, but the shallow breath, wet spot on the front of her dress and constant grinding her thighs together told Rouge all she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must feel so good, having those thick poles penetrate her like that.\" The bat whispered as she slowly began to thrust and grind her pussy against the matured bunny's shapely rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To feel them thrusting in and out a mile a minute, sending heavenly sparks through your body.\" She slowly caressed Vanillas flat stomach, one arm going up, the other below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To have them pierce your very core as you moan like whore.\" Her hand gently kneaded the mothers breast through her dress as the other slowly made its way under her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling your juices soak the floor as they thrust even faster, building you up to your breaking point.

You can do what ever you want here, and all without consequence darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the words past Vanillas ears, she found herself relaxing whilst chiding herself for forgetting something so basic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, shall we join them? Look, they're waiting for us.\" The bat cooed as she directed Vanilla back to Amy and the others, who were all looking at her expectantly with smoldering gazes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Vanilla.\" Amy spoke, licking her lips perversely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're waiting for you.\" The shadowed Doe called, her voice still oddly familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome and join us.\" The Mongoose beckoned, making a come hither gesture with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you heard them. Rouge whispered, her voice taking on that husky tone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, all resistance Vanilla had dissolved and flowed away. Taking the fanged seductresses hand in her own, she let her lead the dreaming mother towards the fire place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while missing the vindictive smirk that crossed Rouges lips.</span></div></div>",

But this? I\u2019m getting wet just thinking about it.\u201d Rouge spoke as she ground her breasts against Vanillas back whilst one of her hands travelled lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you? <span class=\"clred\"><i><b>You want her don\u2019t you?\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla felt the warm feeling and jolts of pleasure start to work their way from her pussy up to her head again as felt herself begin to melt into the sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this time\u2026 \u201cN-no\u2026\u201d She wouldn\u2019t let go so easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is wrong\u2026 we\u2026 we shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u2026 we can\u2019t do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing she was losing control of the situation Rouge scrambled to get things back on track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Vanilla, sweetheart, this is what you wanted, you hearts desire, your deepest fantasy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not right! I\u2019m her mother, she\u2019s my daughter, and we can\u2019t do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge couldn\u2019t believe it, after all this her prey was slowly getting away, she had to gain control again somehow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not just you in all this, look at Cream baby, she\u2019s begging for it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, <i>\u201cCream\u201d</i> was still lying there looking wantonly at Vanilla while gently teasing her clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>\u201cOh mother, I\u2019m so close. And seeing you tongue fuck me like the whores we are was so sexy.

Taboo! What if someone finds out?! What if someone sees us?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge felt a smirk of victory cross her features. It had been close to be sure, a little longer and Vanilla would have brought the Bats plans down in flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she gave an opening, a big one, she said just the wrong thing at just the wrong time, and now any chance of escape was beyond her.<br>\r\nAnd now Rouge was going to make sure it stayed that way.<br>\r\nWith that, Rouge activated the rings spell once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Vanilla, sweetie, have you forgotten? This is a dream, your dream to be exact. <u><span class=\"clred\"><i><b>You can fuck whoever you want,</b></i></span></u> whenever you want, <u><span class=\"clred\"><i><b>and nobody will care.\u201d</b></i></span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla felt her hold on the perverse warmth slip and her pussy twitch as her breasts grew sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cFuck whoever I want\u2026 nobody will care\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Rouge pressed on, upping the rings power just to be safe, \u201cIn a dream<u><span class=\"clred\"><i><b> you could act like a slut without a shred of guilt.\u201d</b></i></span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanillas hold slipped again as her nipples hardened, her pussy grew wet and her breathing grew heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cAct like a slut\u2026 no guilt\u2026\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cShe\u2019s almost there, just one more push</b>\u201d Rouge thought, her lips coming close to Vanillas ear as her voice dropped to a whisper and her hot breath danced across Vanillas cheeks making them glow as red as the ring on Rouges finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><span class=\"clred\"><i><b>\u201cYou could even commit the ultimate taboo, and fuck your own daughter without shame or remorse!\u201d</b></i></span></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Vanilla lost her grip completely and the erotic heat she\u2019d been holding back surged through her up her spine and into her head where it reduced her mind to nothing but sex obsessed mush near instantly whilst placing her even more firmly under the rings perverse magic and back in Rouges clutches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cYES! I CAN FUCK MY DAUGHTER; COMMIT THE ULTIMATE TABOO, WITHOUT SHAME OR REMORSE!!!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanillas cries ripped past her lips for all to hear as her body shuddered from the stream of orgasms coursing through her and Rouges grip on her mind reasserted itself, then she threw herself back over her <i>\u201cDaughter\u201d</i> gazing at her with wild and hungry eyes and laboured breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCream! My baby! I\u2019m sorry to keep you waiting! I want you! I want to fuck you! Please let me have you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cCream\u201d</i> could only smirk in return at her <i>\u201cmothers\u201d</i> antics as she spread her legs wide to reveal her young pussy lips, still sopping wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>\u201cOf course mother, go right ahead. Please me, pierce me, and make me cum! Fuck you daughter like the wanton slutty whores we are!\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Vanilla could resist no more, and dove straight into her waiting <i>\u201cLittle girls\u201d</i> pussy, her tongue stabbing deeply into her core as the mother doe softly scraped her teeth over her partners\u2019 clit, tearing a tidal wave or cries and mewls of ecstasy from the teen <i>\u201crabbits\u201d</i> lips. And all the while, the constant barrage of mind breaking orgasms from her fall crashed through her body, leaving her mind unable to processes or question what was happening around it as it was reduced into almost nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, watching from the back, Rouge let out a quiet sigh of relief. That had been to close. If not for Vanillas slip up at the last second, the rabbit would have been well on her way to ruining everything. Still, close call aside, everything was back on track and Vanilla was well on her way to being the Fruit Bats latest conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she watched the perverted display taking place before her, she noticed something that made her pause. Vanilla was clearly showing <i>\u201cCream\u201d</i> a good time, going by all the noise she was making, but\u2026 Vanillas movements seemed, stiff, jerky, maybe a little unsure, despite how desperate they appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cI guess it makes sense\u2026\u201d</b> Rouge thought contemplatively,<b> \u201cshe probably hasn\u2019t had a good hard rutting since she lost her hubby, so it\u2019s no wonder she\u2019s a bit rusty.\u201d</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Rouge got a dark, twisted idea, as a foul smirk crossed her face. \u201cAnd I think I know just what to do about that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was brought out of her thoughts and found she\u2019d soon get to act on her plan as <i>\u201cCreams\u201d</i> cries grew louder then before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>\u201cHaa haa haa yes, YES! That\u2019s it mother! Ooooh I\u2019m so close! Harder mother! Harder! Make me cum!\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla couldn\u2019t find the ability to respond, so instead followed her <i>\u201cdaughters\u201d</i> instructions by thrusting her tongue as far as it would go whilst tweaking <i>\u201cCreams\u201d</i> clit with abandon sending her into a frenzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! Yes! YES! That\u2019s it! More! More! I-I\u2019m going to\u2026 I\u2019m going to\u2026 I\u2019M GONNA\u2026!\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Vanilla placed her mouth over \u201cCreams\u201d clit and gently bit down, and the dam burst as <i>\"Cream\"</i> thrust her hips forward shaking like a leaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\"><i><b>\u201cI\u2019M CUMMING!!! OH MOTHER! YOU\u2019RE MAKING ME CUM! YOU\u2019VE MADE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER CUM YOU DIRTY SLUT! OOOOOOOOOOOH YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!\u201d</b></i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla didn\u2019t respond, nor did she care to. All that mattered was the fact that she had brought her precious <i>\"child\"</i> to orgasm and that she didn\u2019t let a single drop of her delicious fem-cum, which was pouring out like a fire hose, escape her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, after what seemed like forever, the rush slowed and came to an end, and <i>\u201cCream\u201d</i> collapsed, passing out in pool of her juices while her <i>\"mother\"</i> gazed at her lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla had never felt to warm, so fulfilled, so complete before. I was as if she had been keeping herself from a piece of who she truly was for all these years, but now it was back in place again, and now she felt magnificently whole for the first time in her life. Oh, it was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother rabbit turned her head as she heard the heeled footsteps of Rouge approach the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge inspected the site before her with look of boredom and dissatisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm, not bad I guess...</span></div></div>",

No. NO! That couldn\u2019t be true! There must be a way to fix this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Vanilla crawled her way to Rouge and hugged her leg close as she gazed up at her with pleading eyes. \u201cNo please Miss Rouge! There must be something I can do! Someway I can be enough for my Cream! We've never been so close until now! I can't lose her after all this! Please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge hid a knowing smirk. In truth, under any other circumstances Vanilla wouldn\u2019t have believed Rouge for a second, much less begged her for help in something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her dream after all, if Vanilla wanted to be a good enough sex partner for Cream, she only had to will it so. But the power of the ring and the afterglow of recent events had clearly clouded her mind to much to realize what was really going on. Just as Rouge had wanted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, well there is one thing\u2026\u201d Rouge said kneeling down to be eye level with Vanilla. \u201cIf you really want, I could teach you the skills necessary to wrap Cream around your finger for as long as you want\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla felt her heart soar, there was hope!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut!\u201d Rouge cried getting the Rabbits attention again. \u201cThere is a catch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnything!

Now there was just one thing left to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking her latest victims hand in her own, Rouge led her newest lover to a large heart shaped bed. As they arrived Vanilla gave a look of confusion at the yellow mongoose lying on the bed, gazing at her with smouldering, knowing and familiar eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about her dear.\u201d Rouge reassured \u201cThink of her as my \u201cTeaching assistant\u201d, isn\u2019t that right Mina?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes Mistress.\u201d Mina cooed thrusting the breasts forward to give Vanilla a good view with a coy look on her face. \u201cI love assisting you in any way I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge giggled at the ex-pop stars antics before turning back to Vanilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTime to begin your lessons.\u201d She stated while trailing her hands over Vanillas toned body sending sparks flying all over and driving the rabbit wild as she leaned in to the touches.<br>\r\n\u201cYes Mistress, I\u2019m ready. Teach me\u2026 teach me all you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s get to it.\u201d Rouge whispered as a strap on faded into place on her hips, while Mina lay at the foot of the bed, a similar sex tool fading into place.<br>\r\nRouge guided Vanillas pussy over Minas\u2019 dildo whilst positioning her own at Vanillas anus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour first lesson begins\u2026\u201d Rouge whispered as she and Mina placed their hands on Vanillas hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW!!!\u201d In an instant, Rouge and Mina stabbed their strap-ons into their into their respective entrances and they started vibrating violently not a split second later causing Vanilla to let loss a bloodcurdling scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cM-MISTRESS! WHA-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh honey, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d Rouge asked in a silkily sweet voice. \u201cIn order to make you a good enough thrall we need to fill your mind with all the best sex techniques around. But to do that we need to empty that cute little head of yours to make room for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-what?!\u201d Vanilla cried, the constant fucking of her two partners making nearly impossible to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to do that\u2026\u201d Rouge continued never letting up for a second, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fuck you hard and long enough that you forget everything about yourself except your name and devotion to me.\u201d Rouge and her accomplice began to thrust harder. \u201cOh just imagine it sweetheart, non-stop pleasure ripping through you, never slowing, never easing, never ENDING!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanillas breath grew heavy as she felt something building deep inside. \u201cAnd each we make you cum like the bitch you are, a little piece of the old you is washed away ready to be replaced with something better! Rouge cried ecstatically as she and Mina upped the tempo again. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that sound just amazing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla never got to respond, but as the first orgasm tore through her, she would never find the strength to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you\u2019d approve.\u201d Rouge laughed \u201cBut this is just the beginning, so just sit back, and enjoy feeling your old self vanish forever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it was nothing but a never-ending flurry of perverse action. Vanilla was subjected to every sexual act imaginable, her pussy was fucked, her ass railed, her breasts man-handled. Missionary, Anal, Tit-Fucks, Spit-Roasts, the list went on, poor Vanilla didn't know which way was up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with each bone shaking orgasm, Vanilla felt her mind wear away a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she lost track of time, how long had this constant rush of sex been going on? Hours? Days? Months? She didn't know anymore. All she did know, was that at some point her screams had became lustful moans, her face was now one of pleasure and desire, and she was now thrust her hips to meet her lovers in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? Finally gotten into it have we?\u201d Rouge snarked in a smug tone before grabbing her new sluts ear and yanking it to her lips.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cTell me you want it.\u201d The bat snarled into her new toys ear. \u201cBeg me for it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla, now lost a maelstrom of lust obeyed without hesitation. \u201cI want it! I want all! Oh please Mistress! Fuck me! Use me! Change me! Turn me into your perfect sex<br>\r\ndoll! FOREVER!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Rouge made good on her toys request, her maniacal cackle echoing all around as she sunk Vanilla deep into sexual oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the real world still \u201casleep\u201d in her bed, Vanilla continued to thrust her fingers into her pussy with reckless abandon, her juices spraying over her sheets, having long since soaked through. Surprisingly, in spite of her dreams the only sound Vanilla made was a quiet muffled moan even as another orgasm almost ripped her in half!<br>\r\nAnd this was the case as the hours went by and the sun began to rise, and as a new day begun, people would soon come to learn that the Vanilla the Rabbit the once knew... was now gone.</span></div></div>",

By the time she was out of her suit Amy had moved off the bed and Sonic was staring at her lustily. Rouge lay herself out on the bed and beckoned the blue hedgehog forward. Sonic climbed over her body positioning his cock at her entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With your permission my Mistress?\" Sonic asked Rouge smiled and nodded displaying her approval. Sonic slowly pushed himself into Rouge's pussy drawing a single long moan from his mistress as he sank into her inch by inch until he bottomed out. Sonic grinned before pulling back and thrusting back in as fast as he could. With each thrust Sonic touched the entrance to her womb and earned a little moan from Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster!\" Rouge demanded she could feel orgasm coming and was desperate to cum. Sonic dutifully picked up the pace barely pulling out before thrusting back in. Rouge's eye's squeezed shut and her pussy clenched and spasmed around Sonic's cock as she reached the peak of her ecstasy. Sonic found he could not take the Rouge 's body milked his dick and flooded her pussy with his cum. \"that's enough ... for now.\" Rouge said once speech returned to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress.\" sonic said as he pulled out. \"Thank you Mistress.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Now.</i>\"rouge thought to herself. \"<i>I control Amy and Sonic.

He blinked a couple of times, looking dozily around before shooting up, realizing he wasn't in his own room and remembering what had happened. He immediately became aware that something was restricting his movements and glanced down, gasping upon seeing his blue body clad in the familiar black jumpsuit with white thigh-high boots and matching elbow-length gloves. The only difference between his outfit and the one Rouge and Amy wore were that what was pink on Rouge and red on Amy was a pale baby-blue, that complimented the cobalt blue of his fur nicely. He could also smell perfume and taste lipstick; he was clearly wearing the appropriate makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crossdressed hedgehog's immediate reaction was to try and rip the suit off, but he quickly realised it was futile; the material was too durable to be torn and too tight to slide out of. Sighing, the blue blur stood up off the bed and, after taking a few moments to gain his balance in the unfamiliar high heels, took in his surroundings. He was definitely in a bed room, but it was definitely not Rouge's. Instead of the usual purple and pink colours, there was a deep royal blue motif, though the room kept the black and white accents. Other than the colour change, the room resembled Rouge's in almost every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic noticed by the bed was a table with framed picture resting on it. Picking it up, Sonic balked at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture was of him. But not the usual him; the Rouge-ified him, wearing his current outfit and makeup. He was winking seductively at the camera, with one hand behind his head and the other on his hip, which was cocked out girlishly. In the corner, in a feminine but familiar handwriting was \"Aren't I beautiful?\" with the signature \"Sapphire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic immediately slammed the picture face down in horror. As if coming to inspect the noise, Sonic could hear footsteps  approaching from out in the hall. Out of the corner of his eye, he spotted a partly open window. With his speed, he could easily open it and escape, even in this tight outfit and heels. But then again, he wanted answers to some questions. Like where did that picture come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic decided to...</span></div></div>",

How do you like your new room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlinching at the name Sapphire, Sonic crossed his arms, or rather he started to until he noticed the new boobs filling his breastplate. Speaking up he stutters a bit before speaking in a voice the sound like that of a high-pitched Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I? What the hell happened Rogue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling evilly Rouge floats over to the picture Sonic had slammed down only moments ago. \"Now now Sapphire, why on earth would you hide this picture. After all...\" She smiled as she pointed to the feminine handwriting on the photograph \"Aren't you beautiful? I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting outraged Sonic slaps the picture out of Rouge's hand his face red with anger. \"Rouge! Answer me! What the hell happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling a bit she runs her gloved finger along Sonic's neck. \"Now now Sapphire... why don't you be a good girl and go fix your makeup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her ring over Sonic's face, he suddenly goes into a trance as he swings his hips walking to the light blue vanity table. Taking a black tube from the table he begins to expertly apply mascara before Rouge stops the trance for a moment letting him admire his own work. Horror struck at his reflection and the tube in his hand Sonic recoils in horror with a shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRogue walked behind Sonic so they both appeared in the reflection \"Simple. I just got a new favorite jewel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looking at himself and Rouge in the reflection shuddered a bit \"What\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge simply said one word with a twisted smile exposing her fangs \"Sapphire\". Spinning her new slave she held the ring to Sapphire's face making her pupils dilate before Sonic smiled giggling a bit. While her memories remained of her former identity of the famed hero, Sapphire wondered why she hadn't wanted to become a girl sooner. Now looking at her reflection, Sapphire giggled striking the same pose she did in the picture looking at her friend behind her with a wink. \"Aren't I beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge, smiling at her new best friend, placed her gloved hand over her mouth giggling as she gets an idea.</span></div></div>",

That was completely true, but if Rouge hadn't listened to Tails she wouldn't be having this problem right now. You see, those last few minutes of transfer was a virus check, and a virus was found. The virus was itself! The whole system was the virus,  and it deleted itself somehow transferring the teleportation and nanite control powers naturally to Nicole. She was completely organic now.

He breasts jiggling with each passionate and forceful push from the massive brute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute of intense thrusting, Rouge saw Shadow tense up suddenly, and let off a guttural growl, and seconds after saw Sabels stomach expanding, expanding and expanding, until it started squishing  the bed as hard as he breasts were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Sabel giggled, trying to weakly stand up after that. \"You're real good\" She said patting her extended stomach, already looking several months pregnant. Sabel then decided to dismount Shadow, however he was not done. The second they detached Sabel was being engulfed in Hedgehog cum that Shadow still wasn't finished releasing. Doing the only thing her bimbo brain knew what to do, she dove her mouth on top of his dick and started sucking, and swallowing everything he ejaculated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge watched as Sabel began running her hands over her frame, collecting the cum that got on her body, and massaging herself with it, spreading it all over her fur, then proceeding to rub it on Shadows body too, using it as lube to massage his gigantic testicles, all while swallowing mouthful after mouthful of cum. Shadow was drooling in ecstasy as he finished inside of her and fell onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeemingly dissapointed that it was all over, Sabel climbed on top of him, and began kissing him with her cummy lips, which Shadow paid no attention to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you two break it up.\" Rouge said to the two lovebirds. \"I think you've both done your job.

She checked herself several times just to make sure she was still her, she breathed a sigh of relief when she knew she was still her. But as she got up, her stomach dropped. She felt a burning heat in her. Looking down at her cumfilled belly, she knew, she needed them in her. She made her way slowly to the exit, to get back to Tails, but the sensation was too much. She was already likely pregnant... what harm would one more fuck have? Sonic stopped himself from thinking that way. \"No! I'm not like that.... I refuse to let that happen...\" She thought to herself as she was stuck in her decision.</span></div></div>",

During one of their late night make out sessions she spilled that Rouge was getting worried about the power of her ring running out, hence why they needed to secure new power sources. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic wasn't pleased about using Amy like this, as a way of getting information privy only to those in Rouge's inner circle, but Amy still had a soft spot for the blue hedgehog and if it even slightly helped their chances then they <b>had</b> to do it. Besides, it's not like Amy wasn't getting her thrills, now that she out-ranked Sonic and was in a position of power, the pink hedgehog's kinky dominating side was really shining through... the way she used a dildo could be even be more rough than Shadow or Knuckles...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other cause ostensibly for not hypnotizing the kids was that brain dead bimbos turned out to make bad master thieves. Sure they could act like it, even believe they were the best thief in town, but they simply didn't have the skills.<br>\r\nSomething about the hypnotism was stunting their learning ability, and none of the original girls Rouge had taken control of had a clue how to steal a jewel covertly. This was an expensive operation, and without her girls bringing in a reliable income it had actually <i>cost</i> Rouge more money than it'd raised so far. This next generation of her assassins, con artists and crooks would have to recoup her investment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while Tails and Sonic breastfed the newborns, they'd also play with and befriend the young girls, laying the foundation for a network of spies more loyal to them than their pseudo-mother. It was hard balancing their facade of being under mind-control with their ulterior motives, especially now that Rouge had brought in Vanilla to help with the feeding duties. That bitch was fanatically devoted to Rouge, and made Tails' and Sonic's conspiring all that much harder. At least Vanilla was somewhat incumbered by her huge gozongas, so she couldn't sneak around them easily. As her job was to make milk, Vanilla's jugs were larger than anybody else in the whole organization. Constantly lactating with the creamiest milk Sonic ever had tasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that point relates back to why it was so important, and exhausting, for Sonic to be exercising right now. The exercise was <i>meant</i> to get Sonic and Tails back into fighting shape, but pretty soon after it began it had turned into a biological imperative. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no question about it, Sonic and Tails had chubbed up; their ass getting thicker, their thighs getting wider, boobs getting fuller and bellies getting softer. Tails could hardly fit into her latex suit anymore and Sonic had to go up a size. They weren't breeding sluts anymore, they were breeding <b>cows</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of it was because the only activity they got outside of this and feeding was riding huge cocks, who knew cum was so fattening??<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails had actually speculated that it was a property of the studs altered seed to make their conquests more feminine, and with how much Sonic had been fucking lately, it showed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven right now Sonic was salivating at the thought of getting more of Knuckles big juicy cock in her mouth, maybe while Shadow pounded her rear. Sonic found it hard to take her mind off it, since that additional hypnotism she had a craving that couldn't be satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompounding the problem was that, as Rouge's follower count grew, there was less man meat to go around. With ever more girls to satisfy it seemed like there was a line up at the door to the breeding den at all times. For Sonic, nothing was more frustrating than waiting around in queue to be fucked senseless, even worse, it was humiliating, especially if Tails found out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic gritted her teeth and tried working out even harder to take her mind off it. If Mistress spotted her and asked her why she was so sweaty, she would tell her that she'd been fooling around with Sable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Speak of the devil, Sonic heard the familiar <b>*clank*</b> of Rouge walking this way right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ATTENTION : BROOD SLUTS, OUR  BELOVED MISTRESS HAS RETURNED FROM HER TRAVELS, WITH GIFTS\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic voice of Omega boomed in announcement. Personal bodyguard to Rouge, he had been a hard catch, but eventually Nicole reprogrammed \"her\" to be just like the rest of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot stepped into view, looking identical to how she used to look, but with a painted on version of Rouge's outfit and poorly applied slutty makeup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind Omega, out stepped Rouge, looking as smug and self satisfied as ever, holding the end of a rope connected to her latest bound captives.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both were slowly getting thinner- No longer compelled to fatten themselves up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I get back in fighting shape, Eggman's getting a heel jammed up his maniacal ass!\" She growled. Said shaping up was unfortunately very slow-going, but there was a ray of hope. An entire science team had been put to work on the transformation device Tails had produced while \"Eggman\" had her under \"his\" spell. Between Rotor, Nicole, Sir Charles, and even Sally and Fiona, they were slowly figuring out how to rewire it to zap the fat off their bodies. Tails was simultaneously trying to reverse the bimbo-ray to restore Shadow and Knuckles' intelligence- Rouge's appraisal that the latter would be alright without his brain had quickly been met with some extremely irate ranting from Julie-Su, and her suggestion that she could enjoy her partner's newly massive shaft was followed with an enlightening discussion of the echidna race's sexual incompatibility with other mammals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their female forms were here to stay. Since the remaining, non-aged children had bonded with their mothers, turning them into fathers was likely to be quite damaging for them, and so it was decided that Sonic and Tails, the world-famous heroes, would be having a rather new image soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorbell range, and Tails stood up, ambling over to it to let their visitors in: Sally and Fiona, clothing still slightly marred by oil from the machine that they had been burrowing around in less than an hour before. Neither of them had children to look after: Each had only given birth once, and both cases had been aged up into soldiers for Rouge afterwards. As such, each had decided to help their partners with their babies. Sally had a tougher time adapting to Sonic's new form, but she had received some unlikely aid. Queen Alicia was quite a traditional woman, and she was the last person Sally expected to endorse a lesbian relationship, but, since she, still an attractive, strong woman in her prime, had dealt with being married to the rapidly-aged and senile Maximillian, she had experience of dealing with a transformed spouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had advised Sally that, if Sonic was still the same on the inside, then that was all that mattered. She had loved him when he was a robot. She had loved him when he was a wolf with elasticated arms. Surely him being a woman was easy next to that. Sally had agreed, and immediately mended things with Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona had an easier time, boasting that she was \"adaptable\", and accidentally letting slip that she had slept with Nic the Weasel when the two had worked together. Still, she had helped Tails to the best of her ability, though she was still prone to teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girls, how's it going?\" Tails asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good.\" Sally nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be done by next week.\" Fiona added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't come soon enough.\" Tails sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't you want to be cuddly?\" Fiona giggled, poking her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm still cuddly when I'm not the size of a zeppelin, thank you!\" She hugged indignantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Fiona smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, anything else?\"</span></div></div>",

If you'd just shape up and make yourselves useful, we could make them useful too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge watched via Nicole, drumming her fingers on the desk. She had programmed the other girls to be dismissive and rude towards the cows, and in order to keep things running smoothly, she needed to keep them that way. Sally, though she was still mostly herself in downtime, was practically a machine on-duty, using more logic than anyone else, bar Nicole. Indeed, the cows and studs had been part of the cycle. Once the breeding programme had ended, she had set the others to avoid the studs, and satisfy each others' urges. The only slave that interacted with the cows was Vanilla, since the others were busy with work or each other. While she could make Sapphire love herself, she couldn't make others love her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, how well have established relationships survived?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"100% success rate, Mistress.\" Nicole replied. \"Bunnie and Annette: Together.

Not even the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Day 394. THe experiment \"Empress Rouge\" has failed. I have allowed it to get this far due to the possibility that such a ring could create the peace I have so desired. However, the results leave much to be desired. SHe has taken to outright abusing Sapphire and Tala, and making them worship her for it. Estimates show that neither will last the year with their new bodies. Despite all logic pointing to making Sapphire, Tala, Knuckles, and Shadow into useful slaves like the others again, Rouge has decided to instead increase the number of worthless drooling morons. I had tried to show her that making them enjoy this state of being does not make it a viable or logical option, but she seems determined to ignore my advice. I had hoped that my ring would affect her personality enough to drive her to create my world of peace and happiness, but her own perceptions are too strong to break through. This is not what I created the ring for. I must formulate a new plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour images of Rouge appeared around her. The first raised its arms awkwardly, as wires rose the backs of her hands, her wings, and her legs to attach to a cross-shaped pieace of wood above her. The second gained the same markings as Nicole on her face, as her dress turned into a purple toga, her eyes glowing a faint green. The third glowed, and in a flash had become a shining, silver machine, its optics a flat red. The fourth flickered, then became Sally. THen it was Sonic. Then Tails. Then Elias. Then Vanilla. THen back to Sally again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole floated over to the puppet-Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option one: I re-wire Rouge's brain with my own powers, and set her on the correct path. Perhaps the easiest, most certainly the least challenging to re-sructure afterwards, but it is the most fallible... ONe wrong command and we're back to the drawing board again.\" She said,before approaching the toga-clad Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option two: I take over Rouge's body for myself, and become her new brain. My designs cannot be jaded if I am the one enacting them. However, it doesnt' feel right to steal someone's body...\" She headed over to the mechanical Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option three: I roboticize Rouge and the others. I need not worry about other issues, but at the same time, it's impossible to be subtle.\" She turned to the changing image of the other Mobians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Option four: I move the ring to someone more suited. Vanilla would make the perfect \"Mother\" to my society of love and peace, but she has been so warped by Rouge that it may not work. Lust and depravity will also result in a peaceful paradise, but not the right sort. Sonic had the charisma to lead, and Tails had the brainpower, but neither is in any condition to do so. Elias has the experience, but not the drive. Sally would appear to be the best choice, but she may also be strong enough to resist the ring's influence...\"</span></div></div>",

You had ample opportunity to change him into the perfect minion, and instead you chose to wait until he was awake to do so. Twice. It's a shame you're not as smart as Eggman, or you might've figured out the flaw in that plan after it failed the first time. You can't keep Sonic locked up when he's awake. I've seen him vibrate his body fast enough to phase through cell doors, let alone rope. When that failed, you decided to sacrifice three of the best candidates for minions, the people I had been counting on to defend us. Your nameless offspring do not make better defenders than Sonic, Shadow, and Knuckles. You also betrayed your best and brightest to make a breeder out of her as well. You were so dedicated to watching them squirm that you decided not to hypnotize them, and then had to find increasingly convoluted means to keep them under control, and to gain what? Nothing. You didn't realise that it was giving birth that undid the mind control either. And worst of all, you ignored all advice I gave you, and punished Fiona for hers, because you know best, apparently. Well I'm afraid you're wrong.

If you want to live, you can relinquish control to me, and spend a month as a the same kind of sow you turned my friends into. Oh... but it doesn't stop there. Since Shadow and Knuckles will be turned into regular servants, and \"Red\" will be Fiona again, you're going to be missing someone to fill you... Fortunately, I have just the person in mind: Scourge. A sift through Fiona's memories reveals how vile he was with her... and how many venereal diseases Miles had to cure her of when he was done with her. What's it going to be, Rouge? Wink with your left eye to get the air squeezed out of you. Wink with your right eye to walk a mile in Sapphire and Tala's shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole tightened the coil in preparation again, daring the bat to respond. No response came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't give me your answer, I will turn your brain to soup and be done with it.\" The lynx-turned-bat warned. She pressed a finger to Rouge's forehead, and sharp tingle began to throb through her skull. Rouge gulped. She had played a fierce game against the lynx, but it looked as though she had finally hit checkmate. Her daughter, pampered and aged-up as she was, had the frailest mental defences she had seen in a Mobian, and had zero chance of breaking Nicole's hold- in fact, Nicole didn't seem to be able to relinquish her control at the moment, something she had relied on to protect her before she realised to what extent Nicole's powers worked. She couldn't cry out, the door was locked, the ring was bound uselessly to her side, and even if she could've raised it, hypnotizing Nicole would put them right back at square one thanks to her hidden processors, but with the lynx even more tempted to simply crush her without mercy, and she didn't even know whether it would work on her now. Added, it was getting very hard to breathe, and she was pretty sure that simply being touched on the forehead had erased a few memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at her possessed daughter, pondering which of the presented choices would be the least painful.</span></div></div>",

As she reached the huge flower, there was already a heavy weight on her brain, but it felt comfortable, as if it were buried in cotton wool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines shredded her clothing away, leaving her in the nude as petals closed around her. Immediately, her nose was assaulted by the sweeties, most addictive scent she had ever smelt, reducing her resistance even further. She slumped, leaning against the flower's sticky stigma, as its stamens wrapped around her limbs, holding her in place. One snaked in between her legs, another below her tail, and they penetrated her, filling her most private, virginal areas with new, invasive data. In the corner of her vision, progress bar appeared, informing her of a new \"Update\". The box displayed the text \"POLLINATION\", as well as a percentage of conversion, and a grinning Eggman logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, the image of her nemesis' visage brought her out of trance. This was Eggman's doing, he was infecting her, doing who-knows-what to her systems. But it wasn't too late! The pollination was only at 17%. She could fight this, she could still break free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the flower began to pour nectar into her mouth, and she let out a moan as the sticky, yellow liquid splashed over her muzzle. Her resistance died, washed away by the sweet, sweet taste. The progress bar shot up, but she didn't even care anymore. If anything, she was slightly disappointed that her experience with the virus was about to end. It began to slosh the nectar all over her body, and she squealed with delight, pulling her arms free of their bonds to rub it into her skin. It began to solidify and harden into a new, latex costume for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOLLINATION: 100%<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flower opened, and Nicole rose from her flowery bed, stretching herself out.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<b>N-no!</b> Don't speak like that Tails!\" Sonic shouted, a clear tremble in his voice. She couldn't help herself, in one smooth motion Sapphire raised her left hand, slapping Sable across the face sharply. It left a glowing red mark on her cheek and smudged Tail's makeup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of awkward silence between the two, the air was still and it felt like the world had stopped turning for just a moment, then, as the intense staredown climaxed, Tails eyes watered up and she burst into sobbing tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Wahhh</i>, S-s-s-sonic I don't want to be a slutty g-girl any more!' she bawled, hugging Sonic by the shoulders and almost dragging her down to the floor because the fox's legs went limp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic struggled free, grabbing her pathetic friend's arms and pushing the blubbering bitch to the floor. Tails was unhurt, landing on her plush butt, but she still sniveled and flounder about, throwing a pathetic tantrum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis alarmed Sonic more than anything, if Tails kept making a raucous then someone would hear them and they'd be bimbos for sure. \"Stop! Stop!\" Sonic hissed, unsure how to calm down the hysterical fox. Sabel was making a real mess of herself, gushing tears ruining her mascara, and snot dribbled out her nose. Tails didn't care, she was going to stop being a girl <u>right now</u>, even if that meant growing a penis by sheer force of will. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding over her, Sonic was suddenly surprised to feel the weight of tears forming in the corner of her eyes too. \"T-tails, stop, please... i-if you don't stop...\" her voice was stopped by a sniffle, and she rubbed her eye. It was times like this that made the idea of becoming a brainless bimbo really appealing, no sad thoughts, just lazily waiting for your next cock and pleasing your Mistress, how idyllic. Sonic shook her head. \"<b>Tails</b>! Stop behaving like a <b>spoiled brat</b>!\" She shouted, realizing how to solve this problem like a bimbo would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire always kept a dildo with her, it was an essential item to survive in Rouge's twisted army. Of course it wasn't as large as the stud's cocks, but it was a pretty shade of pink and had 9 settings of vibrating action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails stopped thrashing about, cowering on the floor as she looked up at Sonic's imposing figure, looming over her in silhouette holding a thick 12 inch sex toy. Before Sable could protest the hedgehog lunged. Pinning the bitch to the ground and locking lips. The two kissed passionately while Sonic, eager to dominate someone for the first time in weeks, quickly stuck her tongue down fox's mouth, tasting Tail's apprehension. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like minutes of swapping spit, while also fondling, groping and teasing, Sapphire finally pulled away from Tail's mouth, a lusty glint in her eyes. \"N-no Sonic,\" Tails said weakly, though the blush on her face betrayed her feelings, \"this, this is wrong!\"<br>\r\nSonic smirked, <i>\"I know.\"</i> She said, plunging the tip of the dildo into Tail's sensitive entrance. The fox yelped, color draining from her face, her tongue flopping out the side the last pieces of willpower she held melted away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic plunged the silicone tool deep into Tail's pussy, too hard, too fast. But Tails would have to get used to the pace because Sonic wasn't about to slow down. Garbled groans escaped Tail's lips, the pleasure inhibiting her ability to speak cognitively. The best she could mutter was a greedy, <i>\"Mmo-ore\"</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Sable and Sapphire laid naked on the closet floor, panting and awash in a rare moment of satisfaction. Knowing it wouldn't last, eventually Sonic mustered up the energy to sit forward, so she could continue her earlier conversation with Tails with a clear head. Before all this, Sonic never would've realized how thankful she could be at having a mind not plagued with burning arousal.<br>\r\n\"So...\" she started, not quite sure where to begin, \"...you're not really giving up are you Tails?\"<br>\r\nSable, who still looked a mess, now covered in a fresh layer of sweat and drool, huffed in response. \"...No, I guess not. I... I just got a little panicked there for a second.\" <br>\r\nSonic smiled, \"Great! I <b>cannot</b> do this without you Sabl- I mean Tails.\" The fox gave Sonic a look mixed between smugness, disbelief, and a little bit touched. <br>\r\n\"Well, its going to be a lot harder now. Vanilla is already a hitch in our plan, and now that we can't exercise, our chances are almost zero.\" <br>\r\n\"Almost, any chance is better than none.\"<br>\r\n\"Heh, I wish I could be as positive as you sometimes Sonic.\"<br>\r\n\"Trust me, it's hard...\" Sonic replied, suddenly feeling a fresh wave of lust at mentioning the word 'hard'. She'd spent too much time pleasuring Tails in their romp, Sonic thought to herself selfishly, imagining that dildo going straight back where is belonged, between her thighs. <br>\r\nSuddenly she realized Tails was talking, and she'd missed the first half of what the fox had said because of her wandering mind. <br>\r\n\"- get some parts, but the problem is where to build it.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh, wha?\" Sonic said hazily, sounding like his Sapphire act. Tails frowned, \"I <i>said</i> I'd like to try and build myself another one of Rouge's body morphing machines, in secret, but I need to find some place I can do it in private. That way no matter how fat and feminine we get, when the time is right we can just zap ourselves back to men in peak physical condition.\"<br>\r\nSonic liked the sound of men in peak physical condition, the other parts sounded a bit implausible though. \"I thought I was the risky one, the only place you could set up a lab here without it being found out is under your bed, heh.\" <br>\r\nTails eyes lit up, \"Sonic... you're a genius!\"<br>\r\n\"What, I am? Wait, no that's a <u>stupid</u> idea Tails! Are you still suffering for that bimbo ray making you stupid? You'll get caught the first time the maid changes your bed.\" <br>\r\n\"I know, but what if the maid was <i>secretly on our side</i>?\" Tails said smugly. Sonic gave the fox a confused look, \"You know as well as I do that Rouge would never let us stop being breeding sluts, I bet she wouldn't even let us make our own beds since we're supposed to be growing fat. If one of us asked to be a maid she'd just laugh in our face and hypnotize us some more.\"<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I <b>know</b> that Sonic. I was thinking about getting another guy to be our third.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh... I'm not following you? we're the only mobians who've resisted Rouge's hypno ring.\"<br>\r\n\"<i>And</i> that's because we're the only <i>males</i> in her organization who have given birth, all we need is to get Rouge to capture another boy, beg Rouge to make them our personal cleaning maid, and then get him pregnant. It's brilliant! He'll snap out her hypnotic trance and we can turn them to our side! Boom, instant private lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Tails was positively excited, it was strange how much a good fuck and a little hope could improve her mood. Sonic still viewed the idea with skepticism, it seemed rather unethical to rope another guy into their problems, especially since they didn't even know if it was going to work. But... on the other hand it was a plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Sonic said eventually, \"lets say we do it, I still want to try and turn the children to our side, I think I'm making progress with some of them.\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, but be careful. Vanilla already seems suspicious of us.\"<br>\r\n\"<i>-sigh-</i> Don't worry, I'm surprised she can even see past her own breasts, and pretty soon she won't have time to be snooping on us with all the kids being born.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah, but um...\" Tails trailed off, \"she'll still expect us to feed from her, and if I'm going to find time to take care of the kids, ride some cocks <i>and</i> make this invention, I'm gonna need... well you'll need to distract her... by drinking most of my share of the milk?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\" Sonic protested immediately, \"b-but Tails! It's so rich and creamy, I swear I can feel myself getting fatter each time I drink it!\" Sonic subconsciously licked her lips, craving more of the addictive substance even now. \"If I do that I'll get even fatter than Amethyst, uh I mean Rotor, in no time. And like, did you see what was written on Rotor's apron? <u>Piggy Slut</u>. I don't want to be a Piggy Slut Tails!\" Sonic pouted, now she was being the childish one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know it's hard. But think of it this way, you'll get that fat sooner or later without my help either way, at least when my plan is done you'll be back to normal without any problems...<br>\r\nthough it is weird...\"<br>\r\n\"What's weird?\" Sonic said tersely, annoyance still clear in his tone. \"I was just thinking, if Rouge wanted to fatten us up, why isn't she just using the body modification machine on us? It'd be much easier\"<br>\r\nSonic shrugged, \"I dunno, maybe she just likes seeing us suffer.\"<br>\r\nTail's brow furrowed, a fleeting worry crossed her mind over the possibility of Rouge knowing about their freedom, maybe she was toying with them. But she dismissed it almost as soon as it arrived, Rouge wouldn't be that stupid would she, that was villain mistake 101. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wish I could exercise\" Sonic whined lethargically, just thinking about getting back in shape made her feel lazy. It would be so easy, just to do some squats or pushups right now, but whenever she tried to work up the motivation a miasma of sloth washed over her, followed by some gluttonous thoughts about chocolate or ice cream. Her stomach gurgled, \"Oh yeah it's almost dinner time, lets get back before anyone notices we're missing, I heard they're serving cake tonight, yum\"<br>\r\n\"I'd like to, but I want to talk to Rouge about who she should capture next.\"</span></div></div>",

As Tails followed down the path, she was thinking of who she could take. The choices for who to use as an unwilling participant in their plan was very important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person Tails thought of was Silver. He had been almost entirely absent for the entire thing, and would likely want the future Rouge is working towards to be stopped no matter what. He'd be willing to take a large risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other was Elias Acorn. Sally's brother, the Prince. While he is a high security Target to be sure, especially after Sally's disappearance. Tails could easily let him in on the plan, and he would do anything to get his sister returned safely, and he has to know how much of a danger Rouge is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails thought about other possible names as she walked past dozens of Pregnant Rouge followers, include Sally Acorn who had a large Pregnant belly of her own. The situation was dire, and while she hated having to put someone she knew into her same situation. She knew it had to be done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to Rouge's door and knocked. \"Like Hellloooooooo~\" She said in her ditziest voice. \"Are you here Mistress?\" Tails waited for several seconds before she heard the door unlock. Indicating that she should enter, so following on cue, Tails entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Oh My God Mistress! You look so great today!\" Rouge sat on her sofa and gave a bored response. \"Out with it. I'm busy. What do you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails cleared her throat.

So eliminating Elias from the picture would make my conquests all the more simple... Not to say I haven't considered it... But what better fate for the Prince to become one of my loyal sluts. Don't you agree Sabel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails shook her head. \"Yes Mistress! She will look great in your suits! Oh and like maybe get some of his guards too for some nursing sluts for me and Sapphire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge rolled her eyes. \"Sable, You're a breeding bitch. The only thing useful that comes out of your mouth is one of Shadow or Knuckles dick right before it goes in your pussy. I had been planning a strike on the Royal family for some time.\" She stroked her hand over Sable's breast. \"But it's so cute to see you actually try and think... Too bad you're just a bimbo now.... Although you love it don't you? And you'll become a nice breeding cow won't you?\" She teased Tails, rubbing in her victory over her, even if she thought that Tails was truly gone, it was still fun for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying through her teeth Tails let out some pleasurable moans. \"Like I...I can't wait to be your best cow slut ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge kneaded Tails breasts until she began lactating, and then continued. \"And you will be... The Special Milk Vanilla has serves a second purpose other than plumping you up.\" Tails ears twitched. This was new. Rouge continued. \"It's growth hormones for the children to help them age faster.... But for the Adults like you and Sapphire. It's a Fertility enhancer. Soon the two of you will be able to hold litters of at least 3 or 4. And the Extra weight will ensure you don't.... you know\" Rouge laughed as Tails stood there frozen a bit after hearing that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you and Sapphire are already new to your recent pregnancies so this pregnancy should be the last small onebefore you two really start producing.\" Rouge led Tails out of her room.

There was a rustle, and then a petite little figure popped out from behind the velvet curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do good? Huh mommy?! Did I stay hidden?\" It was a young girl, with cute bat features just like Rouges, except she had a fur coat of strawberry blond. It was Rouge's only legitimate child, and her planned successor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Crimson, what have I told you about calling me, ugh, <u>mommy</u>.\" the bat said with a shudder, and the young kid shrunk down apologetically, \"...but, you did manage to stay hidden, I think we'll make a master thief out of you yet young lady\" she finished, making the girl's face light up with glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson skipped over to the table, struggling a bit to sit down in the large fancy seat next to her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why was that lady so stupid?\" she suddenly blurted out, causing Rouge to burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you when you're older\" Rouge replied slyly, figuring a couple more weeks would age her up enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*Knock knock knock*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone else was at the door, and Rouge knew who. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, she got up to let the new party in. \"You're late!\" she said sternly, as Amy, Bunnie, Antoine and Omega entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Mistress,\" Bunnie said meekly, \"I'm not used ta walking on these organic legs yet\" <br>\r\n\"It was clearly a <b>detriment</b> to replace those fine robotic legs with inferior organic material.\"<br>\r\n\"Shut it Omegan\" Rouge said sharpy, \"I don't have time to waste on this petty chit chat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group took their places at the table, as Rouge unfurled a huge map of Castle Acorn's schematics. \"I trust Amy has already filled you in on the details of my plan to capture the Prince?\" Amy shook her head proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Qui Mistress, I am to pretend to be normal, slip past the royal defense systems and give you an opportunity to strike. Your plan is brilliant, it cannot fail.\" <br>\r\n\"<i>-sigh-</i> I know, but it means I'll have to hold off on turning you into a girl, I think the guards would get suspicious if their commander showed up as a lady\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntoine looked almost disappointed for a second, \"I live to serve my Mistress, anything for you.\" <br>\r\n\"Right, right...\" Rouge said bored, \"anyway, you two are Team Infiltrators, myself, Omegan and <i>someone else</i> will be Team Extractors, responsible for getting everyone outta there. <b>Amy</b> is sidelined this mission because she stupidly got herself knocked up -\"<br>\r\n\"B-but I can still fight\" Amy whined, mentally cursing her late night visit to Shadow. <br>\r\n\"-<b>ahem</b>, so that means her slutty butt will need a replacement, I think Fiona Fox?\"<br>\r\n\"Not that bitch Mistress! She'll foul up your entire plan.\"<br>\r\n\"Silence! Amy I swear if I hear one more word out from you tonight I'll <i>make</i> you forget how to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nervously bowed her head, the rest of the table felt silent too. Until Crimson spoke up, \"...What's Castle Acorn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smiled, \"Why, it's our future home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie and Antoine marched carefully down the castle halls, a little stiffly, but so far they hadn't raised suspicions. It was late night, and they were approaching the king's quarters. \"Did you disable the security systems yet?\" asked Rouge, who was speaking to them via a watch communicator. \"Yup, we're just about to enter the king's bedroom, with your permission\"<br>\r\n\"Permission granted, but make sure you keep him distracted long enough that we can break into his window. We don't want him running away.\"<br>\r\n\"How should we do that Mistress?\"<br>\r\n\"Get creative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further hesitation Bunnie carefully opened one of the large double doors and the pair slipped inside. The room was shrouded in darkness, but Elias was not sleeping in bed, he was crouched over a desk, covered with notes, files and pictures of missing persons. The dim illumination of a desk lamp revealed how disheveled he looked, clearly distressed, he probably hadn't slept for days, and he didn't noticed the intruders enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-prince Elias?? We're back from our mission\" called out Antoine, making the squirrel boy almost jump up with fight. \"<b>OH</b>, thank heavens you're safe,\" Elias exclaimed as he got up to greet them, \"when you failed to message back to HQ we got worried... So did you get any news of Sally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBunnie and Twan exchanged a knowing glance, \"I'm afraid... Sally is still missing, but we'll do everything we can to make sure you're reunited with her.\" <br>\r\n\"I know, I know\" he responded morosely, \"but it's been so long, I imagine she must be miserable.\"<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, I'm sure she's keeping her spirits up\" Antoine chipped in, suppressing a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... so where's Rotor?\" Elias asked, promptly alarming the duo, \"I need to talk to him about setting up this radio signal and-...\" The prince's sentence trailed off as he watched the two walk in tandem, Bunnie to the left of him, Antoine to his right. \"Oh, she's around\" Bunnie replied casually, stepping closer to the prince, who finally had a good sight of Bunnie's new body. \"Bunnie, what on mobius happened to your robotics??... <i>Wait, \"</i> he didn't get to finish talking, as Bunnie grabbed onto him from the front and Antoine from the back. </span></div></div>",

He tried to yell for help, but Bunnie covered that, slamming the royal's face into her ample bosom. Despite all his years of combat training Elias hadn't been expecting that, so he was caught off guard long enough for Antoine to crawl up behind him and firmly grasp his hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ahh</i>, w-what are you doing?!\" he managed to yelp, before Bunnie grabbed a handful of red hair and pulled the squirrel up for a kiss. Antoine was already half-erect, his swollen member rubbing up and down the kings backside. Bunnie felt Elias physically shudder when he realized what was poking him. Antoine was huge, packing a porn star quality dong. It was the only reason Bunnie had given the cowardly coyote a chance when they first started dating, and it amused her to see the prince's reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill fighting, Elias tried to punch and kick his way to freedom, but the couple had anticipated his every movement, easily binding the prince's limbs. Bunnie held his arms, forcing them behind his back, while Antoine put his weight on Elias' legs, restraining the monarch very effectively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nuh, stop this! Please!\" the king howled, he could hardly process what was going on, he was being raped by some of his best friends. In a feat of extraordinary  dexterity with her new flesh and blood body, Bunnie used her foot to caress Elias' dick, fondling it with her soft, hardly ever used feet. Despite how much he didn't want this, the physical stimulation quickly had it desired effect. The prince could feel blood rushing to his royal nether regions and he bit into his lip to stop a needy groan.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Twan was fully erect, his turgid meat prodding the king's virgin hole, teasing it with the tip of his shaft. <i>\"It'll never fit!\"</i> was all Elias could think about before -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*crash*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmashing through the window in a cloud of glass and smoke was Omegan, \"<b>Target Acquired</b>, King Bitch is secured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing in behind them was Rouge and Fiona, \"By my calculations we've got fifteen minutes\" the fox shouted, moving to secure the door. Rouge sauntered over to the bed, \"My my, I hope I'm not interrupting anything, is this how royals always entertain guests?...\" <br>\r\n\"G-ahh, you <b>bitch!</b>\" the prince shouted, struggling renewed, \"W-what have you done with my sister?!\"<br>\r\nRouge grinned, \"Ha, that incompetent slut? I'd guess she's probably in labor right now, unless she's getting some more hot dicking.\" The prince's face shifted into one of horror, \"No! Y-you monster!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh please, she enjoyed it... and it <i>appears</i> so do you\" she mocked, pointing to his straining cock. Elias tried to growl, but was cut off by another sharp jab by Antoine pecker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, change of plans, I've always wanted to see what it'd be like if I used my morphing ray on two people fucking\" announce Rouge, pulling out the gun and pointing it pointblank at the prince's head. Not sure what kind of strange gun this was, Elias was frantic trying to escape for a few seconds before Rouge pulled the trigger, sealing his fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA prickling sensation racked his body and his hair stood on ends, he felt energy blast into him, changing him down to his very core. The big things; like his chest swelling out and his butt plumping up to an attractive hourglass figure, they strangely weren't what the prince noticed most during the whole experience, it was the little things; like how his - now her - nipples went erect, the feeling of her face softening, even the way her feet became more dainty that drove the princess wild. A guttural moan of lust escaped Elias, her fresh pussy wet and needy for it's first penetration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet she wasn't hypnotized, even assaulted with this terrible lust she struggled. \"<i>NooOOo</i>, w-what's happening to me?!\"<br>\r\n\"You're just becoming suitable to join my army, honey. Now for the brute's turn.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking his cue, Antoine rammed his member into the princess' vagina, eliciting wailing sounds from his unprepared former friend, some desperate for him to stop, others just lost in ecstasy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's big right?\" Rouge asked in fake sympathy, wiping away a thick tear from Elias' cheek. She nodded sharply, unable fight any longer, \"T-t-too big\" she moaned, desperate for reprieve. <br>\r\n\"Well that's just too bad.\" Rouge said with a sneer, and zapped the orange coyote, a new energy flowing into the canine conqueror. Elias screamed, she felt like she was being split in half! Inch after inch of new dick invading her privates, it was mind breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias rocked, and twitched, convulsing in pleasure, her feet and hands clenched, never experiencing before this kind of sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had thought he was impossibly thick before, but now that just felt laughable, every second forging and smashing new beliefs on how thick a cock could possibly get, and how much she could take!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt didn't help at all that Antoine's other muscle's also grew in proportion; his chest puffing up, his arms getting swollen, even his neck getting thicker. Using his bulging biceps, Twan grabbed Elias by her delicate shoulders and forced her body up and down his growing shaft like a cock sleeve.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted deeply, the traces of sophistication and class he so prided himself on draining away along with his intellect. Pre-cum gushed down his length and onto the bed sheets, acting as a lubrication for the fuck. His grapefruit sized balls were still growing, packing ever tighter with spunk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger!\" Rouge said excitedly, and zapped the coyote again, laughing like a mad woman. Elias whined, by she couldn't scream anymore, too lost in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the sidelines Omegan sighed, \"When will I get to be the little girl\" she muttered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mistress, we've gotta go?\" Fiona Fox interrupted Rouge's fun-time, there was loud banging at the door, angry guards would burst in any second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, they always have the worst timing.\" Rouge sighed as she fished out her Hypnotism Ring, pointing it at both the prince and swordsman's face. \"Neither of you will orgasm until we're back at Club Rouge\" she commanded, Antoine motioned to remove the princess, visibly disappointed, \"No you idiot, carry her on your dick.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAntoine perked up, getting off the bed and walk-fucking out the window to the awaiting airship. Bunnie followed, looking giddy and excitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud creaking noise, and finally the doors burst down. There was a tussle, a hoard of guards were at the archway, all trying to flood in at once to save the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge ran to the ship, escorted by Omegan plus a handful of hypnotized soldiers to protect her and follow her.  Unfortunately, Fiona, who was standing closest to the door, was grabbed by two men and quickly dragged into the crowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, lets go!\" Rouge commanded, as the men threatened to overwhelm them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the airship flew off into the distance, Rouge stared back at Castle Acorn with rage, they had something of hers, and she planned to get it back. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's not that she didn't <i>want</i> to jump onto the rabbit's lap and guzzle mouthful after mouthful of precious rich milk until her cravings were sated.... except for the part where it was making her a fatass super fertile breeding bitch... but you know she'd be happy to drink it, if she wasn't already so full of cum! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla had the worst timing, the hedgehog's belly was drum tight with spooge, lunch, more spooge, and all the milk she drank pre-lunch. She didn't notice it until she thought about it just now, because being full like this was such a common occurrence nowadays, but she had totally overdone it on her \"stress relief\" today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't stop Shadow from placing his hand on her head and slamming her cunt back down on his giant dick as she tried to leave. \"W-what? No stop...\" she moaned half-heartedly, unable to deny the pleasure even if she wanted to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin moments Vanilla had spotted her, and wearing an expression of pride she made her way over to her favorite blue feedee. \"Tut tut, what's this Sapphire? I thought you were already pregnant, why are you wasting valuable time and energy when you should be focusing on the family. How naughty.\"<br>\r\n\"Like, chill out. I was just <i>-oof-</i>\", it was hard to talk and keep up the act while getting ravaged, \"-um, I needed to... make sure I'm fully pregnant. <i>-aah-</i> Like, Sable said I'm gonna have quad-triplets or something, so I got to make sure I've got enough food for all of them.\" <br>\r\n\"Honey, that's not what... never mind\" Vanilla said rolling her eyes at Sonic's bimbo behavior, \"Your late for your own feeding, you better still have room in there for my yummy milk, my sore breasts feel like they're going to burst they're so full.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic panicked, \"Um, right, like I'd ~love~ to drink some, but...\" Vanilla's eyes squinted, was she trying to disobey her superior? \"b-but like, I'd feel bad cause Elsa has never tasted some!\" she finally blurted out, trying to think of any reason at all to get out of it. <br>\r\nVanilla's expression softened, \"Ohh, is that's all? Well don't worry deary, I've got enough here for her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this time the princes-maid was still face first on the floor, licking up some cum as her ass got reamed, oblivious to the conversation going on around her. Until she was hoisted up by one of Vanilla's hands, forcing Knuckle's into a seated position next to Shadow while the pair rode them. \"...huh, what's going on...\"  the squirrel muttered deliriously, not sure what to do as she got a huge eye-full of the rabbit's left breast. \"Just suck on momma's milk, everything will feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout questioning the wisdom of her words, Elsa clamped down on Vanilla's tit and began sucking like a baby. Sonic hadn't expected this turn of events, but as the rabbit bitch glared down at her unflinching, and Shadow's cock prevented her from moving, the only choice was to obey and just hope her stomach didn't pop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went on for ages, Sonic's eyes tearing up as more cum and more milk flowed into her overtaxed body. Meanwhile Elsa was just loving this, drinking like she'd die of thirst if she stopped. \"My goodness, you're so eager Elsa, even Sapphire could learn something from you. Maybe I'll tell Rouge I've found another good candidate for breeding material.\" Sonic's eyes went wide, <i>\"No, you can't do that\"</i> she thought, <i>\"she has to remain our maid! Fuck fuck fuck.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd doubt Mistress Rouge would wanna hear that,\" a voice spoke up from behind, tinged with a distinct southern accent. It was Bunnie, walking into the breeding den holding a black leash in hand. Vanilla suddenly seemed angry, and abruptly stopped the feeding to face the younger rabbit. Sonic was incredibly thankful for this, and took the opportunity to just slide onto the ground like a lazy bloated cum balloon while Shadow got interested in someone else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"she's got big plans for that there follower and you'd do best to remember it, Milk-Whore. Don't ya'll be trying to turn her into one o your fat addicts... or I'll hafta sick my <b>attack dog</b> on ya!\" She pulled on her leash, and Sonic's eyes went wide as in behind her, barely fitting through the door, walked in a huge beast on all fours wearing a spiked black leather collar. Sonic didn't recognize the thing at first, until she noticed the blondish streak of fur on it's head and realized that this feral... <i>thing</i> was what had become of Antoine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was shocked, Bunnie was supposed to be their <i>protector</i> but now she seemed to have turned into some kind of oppressive <i>enforcer</i>, she had even taken to wearing a dominatrix inspired version of Rouge's outfit complete with a whip holster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside the blue hedgehog Elsa was physically shaking; she seemed very intimidated by the monster canine for some odd reason unknown to Sonic, and the squirrel quickly moved to leave; cum dripping down her legs as she frantically waddled out the room, even forgetting her feather-duster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not scared of your punishment,\" Vanilla stammered, \"my milk is critically important to this whole operation, if you lay a single hand on me and spoil my milk Mistress will be very displeased!\" Bunnie smirked, \"You're even more of a dumb bimbo than Sapphire is, you know that? Get back to the nursery and start taking care of Mistress' kids like you're supposed ta, unless you'd like to go for a ride on my pet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked between the two feuding rabbits, unsure who was going to give, part of him really wanted to see this punishment, even in this cum soaked room he could smell the dog's musk from here. But in the end a very embarrassed Vanilla decided to back down, \"I'm going to tell Mistress you treated me like this, and she won't be happy!\" she hollered as she stormed out of the breeding den. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

So she waited in bed, and used the time to look over her body. While much of it was hard to see due to the size of her breasts. Sonic just felt heavier and softer. She felt squishy everywhere, and while it didn't burden her much... she felt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was playing with her body, she heard the door open. She turned and saw Elias in her maid outfit coming to do the cleaning like Mistress Rouge had assigned her to do. Sonic shot up in her bed. \"Elsa! Like how was it?\" Elsa turned to her. \"It was rewarding... It was what Mistress wanted from me.\" The blind loyalty was something Sonic was used to, so she knew how to play along. Getting off the bed and carressing Elsa's body. \"So like, tell me was it a success?\" Sonic rubbed her hands all over Elsa's side while she cleaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chipmunk nodded. \"Twins.

Playing along like they were the bimbo's Rouge imagined them to be. Sonic did give birth to two more daughters in the time. During the same time, the two of them had also been fed Vanilla's milk every day, and while Sonic was recovering from her birthing experience. It was all she drank while still in the clinic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course the milk had major effects on the two. Both had gained a significant amount of weight. Tails, who was late in her next pregnancy had gained roughly 20 pounds, and had a significant increase in all of her features. Jiggling with every step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic however took the most, gaining 50 pounds due to the overexposure at the time, as well as following Tails plan of gaining the most. Rouge had eventually given up on making Sonic wear clothes due to her rapidly expanding figure. Sonic was only a day pregnant and her belly was already bigger than Tails, and her breasts were as big as her head. She had no clue what her thighs looked like due to the fat blocking her view. But she could feel her fat ass sway with every step she took. But right now she wasn't worried about that. Elsa had just given birth, and was in the clinic, and the two of them needed to be there when she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Room, Sonic managed to squeeze her massive frame to where Elias was resting, and awaited Tails arrival, only to find out later that Tails herself had just entered Labor, and was in the room across the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's great...\" Sonic muttered to himself when nobody else was there in the room. She took a seat next to Elsa and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually when she saw Elsa's eyes open Sonic shot up and locked the doors, and went over to Elias carefully. \"Hey... Uh.... are you feeling alright?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa yawned and groaned from the pain she'd experienced. \"Where am I?\" Sonic sighed as she heard that, It was clearly Elias in there talking. Their guess was correct. Elias looked up at Sonic. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic blushed. It wasn't something he expected to do. Out himself as Sonic the Hedgehog, who looked like a Fat, Big Breasted, Naked Slut. But she had no choice. She explained everything to Elias and what they planned to do. Elias took the shock of being a female lightly. Perhaps it was still the sedatives she was given, that was making her woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's about it. We're breaking out of this place, and all we need from you is to take Maid Duty, and look the other way when cleaning our rooms. I promise, once this is done. We can save everyone. Including Sally.\" Sonic said to Elias, finally having part of the plan work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElias responded</span></div></div>",

Oh its Sapphire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he was able to Sonic would have blasted back with a wise remark of his own, but he knew better. As he helped Rouge up she only giggled. \"Sorry. I'm just so bouncy and jiggly now!\" Rouge gave her a pat on the head. \"Yes you are... You little cow. Head to my quarters. I'll be there soon. You look lonely.\" Rouge ordered. Sonic nodded and made her way to Rouge's suite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she found it completely empty, and not knowing what she was called here for. she simply took a seat. However her enlarged rear made it hard for her to easily sit down, and had to wedge her flabby rear into the chair. \"First thing I do when I get out of here is lose this weight...\" Sonic thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic waited for about an hour, getting more and more anxious as the time passed. Eventually she heard the door open, and there stood Rouge and Vanilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Sapphire...\" Rouge said in her seductive tone, leading Vanilla over to the Hedgehog.\" Since Tails is in Labor, and the boys are occupied right now... I figured we could have some fun.\" Sonic watched as Rouge pulled out a dildo from the case she had with her. \"And I havent had time to play with you in such a long time. You want me to play with you Saph?\" Sonic reluctantly nodded. \"Yes Mistress! Please!\" She responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smirked. \"Then get on your knees.\" Sonic did so without question, and Rouge approached her from behind and attached the strap on dildo to herself. \"Who is the Biggest Fattest, Sluttiest Cow Here?\" Rouge asked, rubbing the tip of the dildo on Sonics pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\" She responded. Rouge let out a chuckle. \"That's not what a cow would say.\" Sonic swallowed his pride and let out an enthusiastic \"Moo!\"  Rouge slid the dildo into Sapphire. \"Good. Now drink up cow.\" Sonic looked up and saw Vanillas breast right at her mouth. So she did as she always did, and did what Rouge demanded, and began sucking the fattening cream, as waves of pleasure coursed through her body. Rouge acted like she had been using the strap on for years with how she was pleasuring Sonic. In and Out, Faster and Slower. She could hear her slaves moans through each suckle on Vanilla's breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge slid her hands to Vanilla's belly and massaged it as she felt it expand with each passing gulp. Her already large stomach grew larger and larger, and even closer to the ground. Rouge felt wetness from Sonic's enormous rack lactating from the pleasure, as those had already reached the floor and were now rivaling Vanilla's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like a solid hour. Sonic was freed from both ends, but she didn't fall far. Her belly supported her, and lifted her off the ground quite a bit. She had no way of knowing, but she had almost doubled her weight during this session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay here. I'll get Twan to take you back to your room.\" Rouge mocked.</span></div></div>",

The hedgehog was immobilized, at least for the time being; with a blue stomach weighed down by a thick new layer of fat, absolutely packed with cum and a new litter of puppies on the way curtsey of Twan's \"help\" bringing her home last night.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's pussy still ached from that encounter, and her asshole didn't fair much better after Rouge's rough abuse. Still, for how much it hurt, Sonic couldn't deny she'd do it all again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was one of Sonic's \"sick days\", meaning he didn't have to feed or entertain the brats today due to being \"over-burdened\", an condition that was happening more and more frequently as time went by. It felt good to be a lazy slut, just lying in bed all day watching mind-numbing television; ever since recent Sonic had picked up a huge interest in Spagonia Soap-Operas and was <i>deeply</i> invested in the love triangle going on screen, that was until he was rudely interrupted by the door swinging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Tails, the vixen proudly marching into Sonic's abode, looking smug as could be; \"Lots of good news today... and a little bad news, but lets start with the good stuff!... <i>Ugh. Seriously, Sonic?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTail's sudden outburst was due to him seeing the sorry state the hedgehog hero was in. A tub of ice cream to the left of him, two empty cartons to the right, and a half-finished one on Sonic's lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hedgehog quickly removed the metal spoon out from between her plump lips and tried to defend the hedonistic behavior. \"H-hey, it's just a little ice cream, Vanilla made it, what's the big deal?\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Vanilla?!</i>\" Tails rolled her eyes and motioned to pretend barf with her finger, \"God, that must have like, a million calories, how can you eat it...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't knock the stuff until you try it, if food could taste like <i>sex</i>, this would come closest\" Sonic flippantly declared and shoveled another huge lump of fattening frozen sludge into her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails just frowned and walked close to the bed, \"<i>Anyway</i>... I wanted to tell you Phase One of my genius plan is a success, with the help of Elias I've been able to create a fully working laboratory under my bed and Mistress is none the wise.\" <br>\r\n\"Thats great... -uuurp-\" <br>\r\n\"Gross\" <br>\r\n\"Uh, excuse me\", Sonic apologized, a sheepish smile on her face, \"So, like, when the machine gonna be ready, I wanna get back my hot bod.\"<br>\r\n\"Umm, about that...\" Tails was sounding hesitant, rubbing his hand behind her head, \"<b>say</b>, but I didn't tell you the best news, Rotor is pregnant!\"<br>\r\n\"Wha?! Rote got knocked up, but... I thought she was working tech support, don't they, like, only use machines to get off?\"<br>\r\n\"Ha, well I guess even they want a little flesh and blood touch sometimes, and since she was careless, we'll soon have another infiltrator in our ranks.\"<br>\r\n\"Awesome, we'll have access to the whole computer system. We can take it down from the inside!\"<br>\r\n\"Well uh, not exactly, Rouge kinda got mad at her and... because you've been unable to feed the kids so often, Rouge figured we needed some more help, so as punishment she told Rotor to become a dumb breeder like us...\"<br>\r\n\"Aww, poor guy, I mean girl... uhh, shit <i>what pronoun to use is confusing</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of perplexion crossed Tails face, \"You seem, uh... a bit less smarter than usual Sonic, do you think it could be all this tv?\" The hedgehog grunted, \"You may be a breeder bitch Tails, but you're not <i>my</i> mother.\"<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm just looking out for your welfare! You know what; keep watching your soaps, and keep eating your ice cream, I'll even tell Vanilla to send in some more, maybe with a side of cock, would you like that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnimpressed with Tails nagging, Sonic decided to play along, letting out another shameless \"<b>-uuurrppp-</b>\" before adding, \"Sure, maybe you could ask them to dip the cock in chocolate first, pretty please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails growled and stormed out of the room, muttering under his breath so Sonic couldn't hear him, \"You know, I think I'm starting to be glad my machine's design will only have enough power to cure one of us, I'll save the kingdom myself while the gloryhog can stay here getting fatter and dumber.\" </span></div></div>",

The fox couldn't deny she loved the taste, if Tails was still a male - and this wasn't actively feminizing her even more, she would happily do it all day. Alas, in the back of her mind Tail's knew too well about the devastation it was doing to her body, so the vixen got little joy from the delicious activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her friends volunteering to take her place most of the time Tails hadn't escaped the effects of the pearly white liquid; kneeling, her gut pushed against the floor, still soft and spongy, she wasn't even half full yet. But her stomach was the least of her worries, Sable's ass having swollen up by far the most, it was even making it difficult to fit under the bed! So she'd end up having to work wedged half-way under, with her fat butt sticking out for anyone to see. It was frankly impossible to work on her project when she was heavily pregnant, so as the days and weeks went by it was becoming much more difficult to get things done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut they were <i>sooo</i> close, just a few more metal forks, a light-bulb, some batteries and a rubber band and they'd be done, or at least Tails thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, shove over, I wanna turn!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails grunted in annoyance as she felt the familiar shove of a blue hedgehog push up against her. Out of the corner of her eye Tails could see Sonic latch on to Vanilla's other tit with an desperate expression of greed and hunger. This was <b>despite</b> already spending most of the day slacking off and eating cake and ice cream, Sonic was helplessly addicted to the milk, she wanted it every hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, no need to fight, I've got plenty for both of you\" Vanilla cooed cheerily, very happy that Sonic had come around to appreciating her like the rabbit thought she should, aka as the most important thing in the world besides getting pregnant, and the Mistress of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails felt very crowded as Sonic's huge belly squished up against her, she was truly massive, not even pregnant at the moment, with no sigh of her gain slowing down over the days gone by. Tails often found herself wondering how she kept mobile, she had to be almost twice as big as Rotor was now! And that's <i>including</i> the new weight the purple walrus packed on as she got introduced to Vanilla's milk too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one of their team who was keeping relatively fit was Elias, who only got to suckle Vanilla in secret, hidden from both Bunnie and Tails. After a rocky start, the prince was really starting to get the hang of Club Rouge; she got to see her sister was happy, she really enjoyed being free from the stresses of running a kingdom... and she never realize she could love cock so much. The prince just loved being degraded, she found it so liberating. To be stretched beyond her wildest imaginations, put in her place day after day, it made her wet just thinking about it. In fact sometimes it was hard to even think of going back to the civilized world of royalty and politics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest problem right now for Tails was Sonic, who was getting on her nerve more than ever with her slutty, bimbo ways. The fox physically shoved her rump back at Sonic, pressing for more room, sure, Tails didn't want to drink this fattening swill... <i>she said to herself</i>, but damn it she was not going to be bullied out of it by Sonic the Hog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hnnngh, get lost Sapphire, i-it's my turn!\" <br>\r\n\"Like, get over yourself Sable, you can't drink all of this yourself\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, watch me!\"</span></div></div>",

The mothers can' protect their children because, even when pregnant, there's still always a queue outside that room. Even the pregnant ones line up to be brutallised by Shadow and Knuckles.

All that good service, I made her empire possible, and she gives me the same treatment that Sonic got for almost destroying it... My Fiona was the only one of us who could hold a candle to Rouge as a thief. She's far too valuable as a trainer for the kids and an assistant in other matters to get turned into this. You're here because \"Sapphire and Sable\" wouldn't consider that, and we both have an emotional link with Fiona, while Rouge could still think up a plausible reason to do that to you.

After Tails and Sapphire's disappearance Rouge had lost track of them, and thus the breeding program was concluded, however with all of the offspring produced, she had a plentiful supply of supporters who followed her every command. Of all of the Slaves she had let venture outside the compound, Tails was the one she was the most worried about. Given his intellect was back, and with his new body could pose an immense threat, and Rouge needed to make sure of the danger he presented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge made her way through the forest and approached a moderate clearing with a large log cabin built in the center of it, however that was not all she saw. In the clearing were numerous kids. All of whom were a mix of Hedgehog and Fox. Rouge knew she was in the right place, and knew that Sapphire and Tails must still be in the cabin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to create a scene Rouge, climbed a nearby tree to get some distance and then glided to the house and slipped in through a window, alone and undetected. As she made her way through the rooms, she felt like she saw double with how many little creatures she witnessed moving around. Counting the ones outside, Sapphire had clearly been busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the corner Rouge could hear some feint mumblings, and turning the corner she was reunited with a sight she hadn't seen in some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire, even bigger than before, was now fully immobile and latched to the bed, with infants feeding on each of her breasts. Rouge approached and Sapphire hardly noticed, it wasn't until Rouge was almost directly over here did Sapphire notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, like Hi Mistress!\" She said in her same tone. Rouge smiled, after all these months the hypnosis was still active in her. \"Sapphire... what are you up to?\" Sapphire thought for a second before answering. \"Like, Master Miles always keeps me pumped full of babies and fox juice! He's so great Mistress...' Sapphire giggled. Clearly the time Sapphire had spent alone with him had almost fully erased Sonic from existence, and now all that was left was a fat slut. Rouge leaned in and pressed against her flabby belly. \"Now... Sapphire... Where is Tails?\" Sapphire pointed behind Rouge as she turned to look towards the ripped fox wearing only a loincloth, and much more rugged from his time in the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails... what a pleasant surprise...\" Rouge chuckled as she placed her hand on his chest.</span></div></div>",

Amy picked up the chair, and Sally opened the door to Tails' machine, which he called the Feminizer. The pink hedgehog unceremoniously dumped Sonic inside. The two girls then slammed the door and bolted it, before stepping back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then walked over to Rouge, who was standing next to Tails at the controls. Rouge smirked evilly as she watched Sonic struggle against his restraints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Activate it.\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once, Mistress Rouge.\" Tails replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink energy wave shot through the chamber, and a change instantly came over Sonic. His quills dropped down, changing into long, soft hair. His muzzle became shorter, and his nose shrank, while his lips filled out, becoming kissable and soft. His eyelashes grew out, and three long bangs of hair grew from his forehead. His waist pinched in, and his arms and neck became slenderer. His hips widened, and his legs became longer and smoother. His feet shrank, and so did his hands, not that his feet were visible. Then all the hair fell out of his crotch, even as his nipples increased in size, and began to surge forward as his breasts ballooned out. Finally, his manhood completely disappeared inside, his testicles shifted into ovaries, and all trace of the hedgehog's masculinity was gone. Sally opened the door, and Amy untied Sonic, pulling her to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge aimed the ring at Sonic's face, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our little game is over, sweetie. Good-bye Sonic, hello Sapphire.\" She smirked, as the energy beam shot out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, who had been distraught over the loss of her old body, suddenly felt different. She wasn't upset. She felt happy, even. In fact, she felt sexy, and wanted nothing more than to remain female forever, always serving Rouge's every whim. She remembered the picture she had seen in her bedroom at Club Rouge, and instantly replicated the pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I beautiful?\" She asked, in a sultry voice that sounded like an older Amy, dripping with lust, before breaking into a girlish giggle, and blowing kisses at Amy and Sally, who embraced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sapph, you really are.\" They replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, now what?\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, age me up so I can be as sexy as you, Sapphire and Sally, Mistress!\" Amy cried. \"That was what we were gonna do in the first place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, gender-bend me, I'm tired of being a guy!\" Tails yelled. \"I really need to be a girl!\"</span></div></div>",

She picked up the remote and pressed play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen faded to white, and then faded back in. It was a shot of Fiona, clad in a different version of Rouge's outfit, the one she'd worn during the Neo Metal Sonic incident, but with all of the purple replaced by shocking pink, and the neckline of the bodysuit lower than usual, exposing a tattoo of a pink heart on her right breast. Her figure seemed enhanced a little, with larger breasts and wider hips. Her face was made up in the usual style, all pink, her hair was longer then normal, still tied back with ribbon, but now pink instead of yellow, and her eyes were glowing pink. She was smiling with an almost forced look to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gods...\" Sally gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What has she done to her?\" Sonic stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn-screen, Rouge stepped into the frame, and wrapped her arms around Fiona's midriff and breasts, massaging her new servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, honey. You want to tell the camera about yourself?\"</i> Rouge asked rhetorically, almost taunting the helpless vixen. <i>\"Just a little explanation for your little co-conspirators.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you command, Mistress.\"</i> Fiona giggled. <i>\"Hi guys, it's me, Fiona. I decided to become a good little slave for Mistress. And look, she made me totally hot! I've got a new lease on life, and stable work now, being her loyal pet. I was so grateful I didn't mind telling her all of our little plans, and giving her my hypno ring! In return, she promised me I could have one of the missing slaves to submit to. You should join us, guys. It's totally fun, being a slave. I love it, and you will too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl. Now tell them what kind of person you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a slut! I'm a slave! I'm Mistress Rouge's loyal, slutty, submissive slave, and it's awesome!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is horrible.\" Sally said. \"I'm not to fond of Fiona, but... this is sick. And there's nothing we can do now. She has Fiona's ring, she has Nicole, and she can control you. Tails will wake up soon, and he''l attack us too. Do you think we should just... surrender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sal, we can't!\" Sonic replied. \"We can't let Rouge get away with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, though, the DVD was still talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Now, Fiona, do you have any last messages for my runaway pets?\"</i> Rouge asked, kissing Fiona's lips, as the vixen's cheeks were stained by a deep blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yeah! Tails, if you're awake, we have a new name for you, now that you're a girl. Sally, Nicole's waiting for you now, she says that she wants you for herself! And Sonic... bring Tails and Sally back to Tails' lab, like a good girl. Mistress, Nicole, and I will be waiting for you!\"</i> Fiona finished with a giggle, blowing a kiss at the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\" Both Freedom Fighters muttered, as the DVD went off, and Sonic was forced to grab Sally, restraining her, and rush out of the house, carrying both of his friends.</span></div></div>",

She was reaching her hand across to Nicole, who was in the one next to her, and tickling her behind the day. Fiona was on the floor, in front of the third chair. The pants of her bodysuit were unzipped, her panties pulled down, and a vibrator wedged into her womanhood, moaning with pleasure. Sonic and Sally both reeled at the sight of the poor vixen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well done, Sapphire. Be a good girl and tie Sally up for me, will you. Then let Nicole tie you up.\" Rouge commanded.

She has no worries and cares. She's much better off as my pet slut, pr rather, my other little vixen slave. Ignorance is bliss, after all.\" Rouge said, as she looked down at Tails, and gently roused her. \"Wakey wakey, little girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buh...

Her quills had become long tresses of hair. She was moaning from unwanted pleasure, and it seemed that she had orgasmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you enjoy that, Sapphire?\" Rouge asked. \"Good, because you, your fellow pets, and I, are going to be having a lot of kinky fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, I like the sound of that, Mistress.\" Sally giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, Sonic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stepped forward, untied the ropes, and held the ring up in front of Sonic's eyes. Once more, the flash went off, and Sonic's eyes glazed over, as Rouge rewired her mind from the ground up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was now Sapphire the Hedgehog, who prided herself on being Rouge's most loyal slave. She didn't mind being referred to as a slave, in fact, she loved being called 'Slave'. Her primary concern was no longer protecting Mobius, it was obeying her Mistress, and bringing her as many jewels and new slaves as possible. While she had memories of being a male, she hated the thought of being male, and loved her new body, and everything about being a girl. In fact, she wondered why she had never done this to herself before. Her love and care for her friends and family was replaced by total devotion and perverse lust for her Mistress and the other slaves, and her free spirit was overwritten by zealous obedience. All the awkwardness she felt for her outfit and makeup, were gone- now she loved them both, and couldn't imagine wanting to wear anything else, or not have her makeup done- the latter of which she now automatically knew how to do. The photo of her in the room- no, <i>her bedroom</i>- at Club Rouge- no, <i>her home</i>- was no longer terrifying, but her prized possession.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSapphire stood up, and twirled in her white boots.She mimiced the pose from her favourite photo, and spoke up in her new, beautiful voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't I beautiful?\" She asked, with a giggle and a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, Sapphire.\" Rouge smiled, enjoying the stark change in personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I tried to escape before. You were only trying to give me this wonderful gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright, my lovely slave.

I never want to go back to being male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can be arranged, as soon as Nicole returns.\" Rouge said darkly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Nicole reappeared, carrying Sally's version of the outfit, this one a blue version of the outfit Fiona wore, only a little more modest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sapphire, suit Sally up, and help her with her makeup. Nicole, come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress.\" The two girls chimed. As Sapphire set to work on Sally, Nicole approached Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you need, Mistress?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to modify the way this thing works, so that it will never work on Sonic and Tails again, and they'll be stuck as girls forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress.\" Nicole obeyed. She vanished into the machine, and shortly afterwards, reappeared, grinning. \"Done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smirked, and looked over her shoulder, to see Sapphire passionately kissing the fully-made-over Sally. Clearly, some things never changed, but one thing that certainly had was Sapphire. Now Sonic the Hedgehog was no more.</span></div></div>",

They were in a meadow with almost every kind of flower imaginable, which thrived due to the waterfall and pond nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me\" Shadow ordered leading the ladies on a path behind the waterfall and into a cave. It was a bit damp, but the way the water reflected off the amounts of sunlight that broke through the stone cast rainbows all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Shadow. It's beautiful.\" Rouge admitted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Let's set up for the night.

But Rouge ignored it as she lay on her blanket and slept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhmm Shadow.\" Rouge said in her sleep. \"Shadow...Shadow\" she said a little louder tossing and turning before waking up gasping for air. \"What a nightmare\" Rouge said clutching her head, but also noticing something. She had a blanket under her, but now she had one covering her. Also Shadow was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow?\" Rouge whispered. She got up and flew out of the cave so Amy wouldn't be woken by the sound of footsteps. Just as she expected Shadow was out on the edge of the water staring into the night sky. \"Typical\" she thought before sidling up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge? What are you doing up?\" Shadow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could ask you the same thing Shady\" Rouge said puting the blanket she had around herself and her dark lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't sleep. Thought I'd keep watch\" Shadow admitted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll unless you're expecting a UFO to attack us I think you're lying\" Rouge said as Shadow pulled his gaze from the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Rouge. I have already lost someone far to valuable to lose\" Shadow said straight as Rouge knew he was referring to Maria and also explaining why he was staring up at the moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you miss her Shadow\" Rouge said puting her head on his shoulder<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge you are the same way. I am not losing you too. I couldn't bear it\" Shadow said turning away violently as a tear found its way down Shadow's face. Rouge repositioned herself so her head was in Shadow's lap as she wiped away the lone tear with a simple rubbing of er index finger. Her icy irises met his blazing red ones as she said \"It won't. You won't let it\" She said with confidence<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Shadow and Rouge stayed silent, just watching the moon and stars, occasionally staring into each others' eyes until Rouge started using Shadow's lap as a pillow when she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to protect her.\" Shadow vowed. \"I'm not going to feel that pain again. I swear Maria, I couldn't protect you, but I promise to protect her\" He promised to his first love<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning eventually rolled around and Amy went frantic looking for the two lovers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow! Rouge!\" Amy yelled. Fortunately Rouge was a heavy sleeper so Shadow let his Ivory Angel's head rest in the grass as he went to calm down Amy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow! Where's Rouge!\" Amy asked frantic for her mistress<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down Amy. She's fine. I stepped out last night and she came to find me.\" Shadow explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't scare me like that again.\" Amy huffed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Look Amy, why don't you go find some food? I'll watch Rouge\" Shadow promised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because Rouge isn't awake to give the order herself\" Amy said leaving as Shadow walked back and laid in the grass with Rouge still sleeping, except now using Shadow's chest as a pillow. Shadow started rubbing her head to which Rouge started to smile in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a beautiful woman\" Shadow said to himself<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" Rouge moaned stirring after an hour or so<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" Shadow said letting fire meet ice again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shady.\" Rouge said waking up \"Where's Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting food.\" Shadow replied \"I take it you slept well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelously\" Rouge said stretching her arms, legs, and wings<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I want to hear.\" Shadow said. \"Come on, feel like going for a swim?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\" Rouge said smirking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge eventually found her way into the water, but she was surprised how it felt against her body.

Wave would get a lot less attention than a princess would. However, someone as skilled as Wave could be useful, even if she can't fight.

As she sat down she noticed Charmy Bee and Cream on the far end of the train looking out the window, they seemed to be on a play date and not even noticed who appeared to be their twin tailed fox friend nearby, Amy began thinking it was a little irresponsible for those two to be left alone but knowing how Vector could get distracted around Vanilla when she was around and how he tried having long talks with her it would make sense they'd lose track of the children. \"Are you sure Mister Vector is find with us going to see Mister Tails with him or my Mother with us?\" The rabbit asked as the bee nervously answered, \"Oh yeah totally as long as we call him when we get there.\" Reality was Charmy didn't actually ask but was planning to do so once they already made it to the fox's house...because at that point Vector couldn't say no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn actuality Charmy was beginning to develop a crush in Cream so he wanted some alone time with her or at the very least without Vector's overbearing prescience watching over him. Amy (unfortunately for them) overheard their conversation and thus knew they were ripe for the taking as her first targets but should she outright go over to the duo and head to the Workshop with them or should she not make her prescience known during the ride so she could get the Workshop prepared before the duo make it there?</span></div></div>",

Given her personality change , Rouge thought Sally would have loved to have others brought into their team. At this Rouge thought \"What could be so much of a problem that she would almost break her seductive personality in such a way?\" Not only for curiosity's sake but also to quiet her down, Rouge decided to question this behavior. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Sally started when Rouge finally calmed her down, \"It has to do with Sonic and his history with me. When we were together, he was so wonderful to me much like I know you will. I was his best friend and as I later found out, his crush. Then..... he started gaining other friends, and at first I thought it was nice he was gaining popularity. Then I noticed something, he was spending less and less time with me as time went on. Eventually, I became lucky if I ever even heard from him. At first, I thought it was just Eggman's fault as he enjoyed causing problems.

I thought he was pretending, but Tails showed up and he couldn't remember me either! Those two had so many friends that kept them from me I realized, that they had forgotten all about me!!! I was so ashamed and sickened, I ran away and you you know what those two did? Nothing!! They didn't even look back at me as they went inside! I was able to hide my sorrow from the others, but every night I lay awake in bed and wonder how he forgot. Sure he remembered after a while, but I will never forgive or forget that horrible moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally once again closed her arms around Rouge as she began to cry again, \"I know I sound so selfish mistress, but I don't want to be forgotten again!\" Rouge looked at Sally in shock, a question indeed!

It's still a shame that she couldn't find a prince to have a child with, there will be no heir to the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as she did a scan upon Sally's body, noticing that the nanites were still active in her system, a plan began to form in her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But maybe, I can use the nanites to impregnate Sally so that she can produce a child that will take her place. It will be hard, without a male partner, but if I use the genetic samples I collected from Sonic, Tails and his other friends, I can mash them up all together and wirelessly send them to the nanites. They will do the rest of the work in ensuring that she becomes pregnant. They will probably accelerate the pregnancy a little, but there doesn't seem to be any problem there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole smiled innocently as she prepared to send the genetic instructions to the nanites. Her plan was genius! And think about how happy she would make Sally feel. A son or a daughter to call her own(for she had no control over what gender the offspring would be).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she prepared to set the nanites to work, her sensors noticed something a little strange. Apparently, during their sexual intercourse, some of the nanites had entered into Rouge's system as well. Which meant that Nicole could have her be the one to bear the child if she wanted too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was troublesome. She could impregnate both of them had she had enough genetic material to work with. Unfortunately, that was not the case. For right now she could only give a child to one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who should she give it to?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ooohh,\" Rouge moaned to herself, clenching her stomach, she did not feel right at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer insides felt all bubbly and slushy, and as she clenched her skin, she noticed that it felt a little more rubbery. Still soft to the touch, but rubbery all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" moaned Rouge, trying not to get sick, \"Nicole, what's happening to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked frantic, pushing buttons on a holo computer a few inches in front of her, \"I don't know, Rouge. My only guess is that the nanites are malfunctioning. They're beginning to act on their own. I'm losing control!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge began to panic! This had gone just as she had predicted, the nanites were not ready. Because of their foolish lust, the nanites were beginning to tear her body apart. At least it was her instead of Sally, she could still live on to continue their legacy. It was just a shame that she wouldn't live to see it. If only she could..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge!\" Sally suddenly screamed, \"Your butt! Take a look at your butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was confused. Sure, her butt was feeling rather bubbly right now, more so than the other parts of her body, but that was surely the least of their problems, \"My butt? What about my bu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly got her answer as she turned around. Her butt was growing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, her perfect heart-shaped ass was swelling up by the second, and it wasn't alone. Her thighs were also bloating up too, trying to keep up with her ever expanding backside, her tail seemingly shrinking by comparison. She swayed it from side to side, as it sloshed around and jiggled while she did. Rouge could not lie, it was kinda sexy and felt really good to boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she had little time to think about how sexy it felt, as the bubbly feeling began to spread to her stomach and torso. Her stomach began to swell out, becoming bigger and bigger by the second. In less than 10 seconds, her perfect figure was gone, replaced by a belly that would make her eligible for sumo wrestling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were also getting to swelling treatment as well. Rouge moaned as her E-Cup boobs began to strain against her pink breastplate. They were threatening to burst free from it completely. Good thing Rouge was wearing an extra stretchy sports bra underneath, but soon even that wouldn't be enough to keep the at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rouge became more and more like a water filled exercise ball, Nicole and Sally struggled to shut the nanites off before they could do any more damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys? What's taking so long?\" Rouge called, as her arms became flabby and bloated, her gloves now beginning to strain from all the excess skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're trying to regain control of the nanites so we can shut them down!\" Sally shouted to her friend, \"Just hang in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry!\" Rouge shouted, \"I can already feel this thing crawling up my face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she said it, the bloats began to take affect. They had thankfully left her neck untouched, but her face wasn't as lucky. She could feel her cheeks swelling to extraordinary proportions, almost like how swollen a squirrel's cheeks get when their carrying nuts in them. Rouge was beginning to feel afraid, she had no idea how much more her body could take. She didn't know if it was possible, given how stretchy her skin was, but she hoped that they regained control soon, lest her body begins to explode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a large beep and a green light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've regained control of the nanites!\" Nicole yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it off! SHUT IT OFF!!!\" Rouge bellowed with all her might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole then pressed a button, and Rouge stopped swelling. The damage wasn't too bad, most of it had gone to her lower body, so she didn't entirely look like a beach ball. But the damage was done, and Rouge no longer had the body of some kind of sexy Jewel Thief Queen. She could barely stand up over her own weight, and her body jiggled and sloshed around even at the slightest movement. Thankfully, her suit (minus her breastplate) was made out of a stretchy but comfortable fabric that allowed it to expand with her body, so she didn't end up naked. The lustful part of her said that this felt really good and sexy, but the more reasonable part of her said that this was no way a Queen should look, and she was siding with the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole,\" Rouge began, all out of breath from the yelling, \"What did those things do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole ran a diagnostic on her body, \"It seems that the nanites have turned your inner body (aside from your main muscles and organs, of course) into a liquidy form that multiplies at an extreme rate. To cope with this new feature, the nanites also have increased the elasticity of your skin to hold all that expanding liquid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was confused, \"Um, could you say that all again in English?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally spoke up, \"Basically, the nanites turned you into a living water balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Rouge was surprised would be an understatement. It would even be a little sexy if it weren't so embarrassing at the same time, \"So, there is a way to change me back, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded, \"Yes, now that I have regained control over the nanites, I can work out all the bugs and reprogram them to fix your body. However, there is a second option...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A second option?\" Rouge questioned, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could allow the nanites to continue to affect your body...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally jumped in immediately, \"What?! Are you crazy?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, listen to what I have to say,\" Nicole said in a calm tone, \"I did a diagnostic on your body earlier, and it seems like all the high functioning nanites, the ones who give the orders to the other nanites, have entered your brain. While this will not do anything to affect you mentally, we can work this situation to our advantage. If we turn the nanites back on, Sally could use the Hypno Ring to hypnotize you into a deep trance. During the trance, your mind will begin to take control over the commanding nanites, essentially taking control of the whole system. Not only could we turn you back to normal, but you could also obtain the form to shapeshift your body at will, with some training of course. But in order to do that, we would have to turn the nanites back on. And since I haven't fixed the bugs yet, chances are they will continue to swell up your body until they are under your control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally was not convinced, \"Are you out of her mind? We can't turn those things back on! What if she pops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given the increased elasticity of her skin at the moment, the chances of it rupturing are only 1/100. I assure you she will be perfectly safe throughout the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally grumbled, walking up to her friend while taking her swollen hands, \"Rouge, please, tell her that this is a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked into the eyes of her lover, Rouge thought to herself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge suddenly wrapped her friend in a hug. Sally had to admit, it felt good. It felt like hugging a big squishy marshmallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally,\" Rouge said with genuine care, \"I know you're concerned about me. Hell, I would be concerned about you had our roles been switched. But this is something we have to do. If we want to be the  best Jewel Thief Queens, we need to have the looks and the power to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not like this,\" Sally begged, \"We don't need all this, we could just run and never look back. We could bring other women into your service, we don't need..'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rouge brought a finger to her lips, silencing her, \"Please Sally, I need you to be with me here. You're the only one I trust to use the Hypno Ring on me. Please be there for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge had made use of her big sparkling eyes, and how innocent she could make them look. How could Sally say no to her girlfriend. So reluctantly, she agreed to help her. Realizing that she had gotten her to her side, Rouge asked Nicole what needed to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole said, \"Well first, we need to go somewhere with more room. By the time we're done, you could be bigger than a small house. Luckily, Sally's laboratory has the efficient room to house you while you undergo the treatment. Shall we head off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut apparently, getting to the laboratory was more harder than they thought. Rouge's balloon-like body kept sloshing around and she kept losing balance. More than once, she needed Sally and Nicole's help to stand up. She eventually found out how to keep her balance, but then her overlarged thighs would get jammed in doorways and they would have to administer huge (but sexy feeling) pushes to her bulging butt to help her get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, they made it to the lab. Nicole had asked Rouge to lay on her stomach while she underwent her procedure. Rouge didn't mind, it felt really good being a living waterbed anyway. Some wires were placed on her forehead, to monitor her mental state as she took control of the nanites. All was ready, there was now only a few things to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally, are you ready?\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not really,\" Sally spoke, \"Are you sure that this is a good idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge winked sexily at her friend, \"Never more sure in my life. Fire em' up, Nicole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood,\" Nicole confirmed, \"Restoring nanite power in 3... 2... 1!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge could feel the affects immediately. Her already bloated body began to swell once more. By the second her body became more round and beach ballish. She was also becoming more slushy and jiggly, a slight tap could make her body act like liquid Jell-O. While her clothes were still stretchy, they wouldn't last for long. Already cracks of skin were trying to break through her suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge moaned to herself as the nanites did their work, it felt incredibly good and sexy. She just wanted to keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger and keep swelling up forever! Turning to Sally, she motioned that she was ready to be hypnotized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding a little, Sally reluctantly lifted the ring up, so that it was eye level to Rouge, and began to focus it's power upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge suddenly felt weird, as if nothing mattered except for that ring. Her eyelids began to feel droopy and heavy, but not from tiredness. No, it was from how good the powers of the ring was making her mind feel. She could hear voices in her head, telling her the most wonderful things, asking of the simplest but most ludicrous requests. She couldn't fight back, she didn't <i>want</i> to fight back. All that mattered, was listening to what the ring had to say, for if she did, it would continue to make her feel so good and so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"So this is what the spell of my ring feels like,\"</i> Rouge thought to herself, as she drifted away, <i>\"I'll have to ask Sally to hypnotize me more often.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were her last thoughts as the ring took full control of her brain, and allowed her to slip into the blissfulness of hypnosis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was minutes, hours, or days, Rouge did not know. The hypnosis had made her indifferent to everything around her, she was devoid of feeling except for what the ring was making her feel. She didn't realize that her body had stopped swelling, and was back to its original size. She didn't realize that they were back in Sally's bedroom, where she was resting on her bed, with new pink button-up pajamas to replace her torn up suit. She didn't notice Sally waving some strange green light at her, but as she did, the feelings of bliss began to fade away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Rouge was beginning to regain her sense of self, her feelings of focus and sense. Rouge was almost sad that it was over, she wanted desperately to go back to that sense of nothingness. But she had little time to voice those feelings, as she was wrapped in a meaningful hug by Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge!\" Sally cried, not wanting to let go, \"I thought I'd lost you. Nicole said that it would take a few days before you back to yourself, but I just couldn't stop worrying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge returned the hug, feeling bad about wanting to return to emptiness, when it had come at the price of her girlfriend worrying about whether she was going to be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to address Nicole, who was standing a few feet away from the bed, \"So what happened? Did the procedure work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole nodded, \"My experiment was a success. While Sally modified your mind, I went to work to keep your body from suffering irreparable damage. Fortunately, we were able to stop the swelling in time so that your skin didn't rupture. And now, thanks to Sally's wonderful craftsmanship in modifying your brain, you now have direct control over the nanite system. I did some tinkering to the system and have worked out all the bugs. They will now obey you without question, and you have been giving full privileges and powers over them. You are now the perfect shapeshifter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you feel?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she had heard it, Rouge felt incredible! Her entire genetic code was at her command! She could recode her body to be even more sexy than what was considered natural! She could give herself superpowers that could rival most of her Freedom Fighter friends! She was essentially a goddess now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious and sexy smile spread across her face as she looked upon Sally, whose relieved face was now replaced with confusion at the sight of her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel great, honey!\" Rouge sexily said, \"In fact, let me show you how great I feel...\"</span></div></div>",

She had never been able to fully give in to her cravings like this before, the life of a professional thief requiring a pretty strict diet and exercise regiment. But she didn't have to worry about that anymore- Now, with her ring, she could just make everyone else do all that hard work, while she sat back and reaped the rewards! Rouge triumphantly laughed out loud at the thought of it, before she tore a hearty chunk out of the honey glazed roasted turkey leg she held in one hand, and chased it down with a big chomp off the glistening sugar coated ham she held in the other, seemingly oblivious to the gut she had quickly started to form. The room was abuzz with activity, Rouge's servants bringing in hordes of perplexed castle staff- who eagerly joined in the festivities after Rouge took a quick break from stuffing her face to flash them with her ring. Everyone was chattering about how great Rouge was, about how beautiful and talented and intelligent she was, how she deserved the world handed to her on a silver platter and they were better off under her control. Hearing all this discussion filled Rouge with glee, even as more servants fell under her control- More food was brought to her table, all of it for the sole enjoyment of their mighty mistress- none of the castle staff ate anything, not even Sally or Blaze had a taste. They knew it was all for Rouge herself- more chefs brought offerings to her directly- more servants handed her food that was out of her reach so she wouldn't have to strain or work hard at all, dozens of slaves speaking in soothing seductive tones about how perfect and amazing and glorious she was as she ate and ate and ate- it took a cold pressing sensation to snap Rouge back to reality. She blinked a few times, stuffing the loaf of buttery bread she held into her maw and chugging the last of her drink, wiping her lips with the back of her hand. What was that? It only took her looking down at the absolutely massive sprawling orange and black globe attached to her torso for her to know exactly what it was. Rouge gasped- horrified by the realization of how enormous her round belly had become. It had long since torn through the front of her suit, filled out her entire lap- and gone out past her knees, forcing her to spread her legs further and further apart to accomodate it. That cold pressing sensation was the feeling of it hitting the floor! And now that she was aware of its full magnitude and no longer in her trance like binge, she was beginning to feel a major stomach ache coming on. \"I- I need to go to bed-\" Rouge stuttered, but stopped- just as she noticed an enormous cake being wheeled in, fifteen layers tall and decorated in with ornate pink hearts. Rouge cringed, rubbing her gargantuan gut with one hand as it moaned in protest, already over filled. But that cake... \"I...need to finish my dinner and have dessert and THEN go to bed.\" Rouge declared.</span></div></div>",

She had to lead Rouge mostly through the sound of her voice, because Rouge couldn't see what was in front of her because of her absolutely enormous belly. Ten hypnotized guards- and Blaze- were struggling to carry its immense weight- all circled around it holding different parts, trying to walk backwards and sideways in time with the pace of their Mistress herself, who was stumbling drunkenly, hiccuping and belching in between her moans of discomfort as her gurgling spherical globe of a gut would lightly graze the ceiling, floor, and both walls of the hallway. \"bluh....Maybe I-<b><i>bruuUUARRRrp</i></b>- got carried away tonight...<i>hic</i>..\" said Rouge. \"What? Don't be- rggh- ridiculous, of course you didn't! You're the mistress, after all- rrgh-  You get what you want, no matter what it is!\" Blaze quickly answered, as she strained to lift Rouge's engorged stomach- Even with the ten guards helping her. \"<i>hic</i>- Well...it was pretty nice- <i><b>beEEEEEEEeelch</b></i>- to have everyone serving me- <i>hic</i>- like that...\" Rouge mused, massaging the wall of orange fur in front of her with both hands. In a short while, Rouge finally got to the master bedroom- and was escorted in, barely managing to slide her overstuffed belly through the large formal entryway. Her servants helped deposit her onto the huge double king sized bed- Which cracked ominously under her weight. \"Alright- now all of you get out and let me rest- Except for you two, Sally and Blaze, I want you two to always stay by my side.\" Loyally, the guards departed, as Blaze and Sally shut the doors behind them and approached the bedside of their mistress. Rouge was a sight- laying on her back like she was on the bed, her belly dominated her frame. It rose above her like a huge orange hill, and most of her body was being smothered underneath of it- except for her head, which was poking out from the orange dome at the top of the bed- It almost looked comedic. \"What would you like us to do, Mistress?\" Asked Sally, seductively. \"Rggh...believe it or not-<i><b>BUUUAARRRP</b></i>- I have a bit of a stomachache...I-<i>hic</i>- need you two-<i>hic</i>- to rub my belly. Climb on top of it if you have to, just massage it and help me- <i><b>BURRRRAARRRP</b></i>- digest all that...\" Rouge said. Eagerly, her servants complied, massaging her mountainous gurgling belly as thoroughly as they could. Slowly, Rouge's eyes fluttered shut, and she fell into a peaceful sleep...</span></div></div>",

Rouge slowly blinked awake, yawning- though her yawn accidentally became a resounding belch. This alerted her two attendants, Sally and Blaze, who eagerly approached her bedside. \"Good morning, Mistress. Did you sleep well?\" Asked Blaze. \"Mmm... I certainly did.\" Rouge answered, as she attempted to get up. Her brow furrowed in frustration when she realized that she couldn't. Her form had grown so obese from her furious binge last night that she couldn't stand up, pinned by her flab. She realized something else as she looked up at her expanse of bulging rolls. She wiggled her toes slightly, feeling the cool air on her soles, asking \"Why am I barefoot...did you two undress me in my sleep?\" She asked her servants. Sally quickly responded \"Oh- no no no, Mistress. Just...as everything you ate was digested, your body grew with more and more fat, and eventually you ended up outgrowing and bursting out of all your clothing. Including your boots and gloves.\" Sally explained to her bedbound mistress. \"But don't worry!\" Blaze chimed in, \"You still have the ring, it seems that part of its magic is to change size so it always fits you.\" Rouge tried to turn her head and lift her arm so she could see the ring, but her huge chubby cheeks obscured her view, and her arm was so heavy she couldn't properly lift it, and her shoulder and elbow were too padded with thick fat to bend very far. Nevertheless, she could still feel the ring on her finger, just like Blaze said. \"Hm...well that's convenient. Alright you two! Get me out of bed and onto my feet, and get a mirror in front of me, I have to see whether or not I pull off all this lard!\" Rouge demanded. After a few long minutes of Sally and Blaze grunting and straining, working their hardest to lift the enormous weight of their mistress out of bed, all the while assuring her that she was beautiful and perfect and all this meant is that there was more of her radiant beauty to worship and serve and glorify, they finally got Rouge standing up, with both her enormous pillowy feet squarely on the floor. Once a mirror was in front of her, Rouge examined herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was absolutely gigantic. At least nine feet wide, and stark naked, her obese form orange and gleaming like a sunset. Her stomach was massive, it looked like she could've eaten a car or two, divided into two massive bulging rolls with a deep naval. It sprawled out about six feet in front of her, wobbling and jiggling, lightly grazing the floor. Her legs were incredibly thick, thighs like redwoods creating a fold over her calves and shins and too much fat to bend her knees. Her toes were each the size of a basketball, three on each foot, barely poking out from under her fat leg. Her hips had some nice meaty love handles resting over them, each with two rolls of fat. Her butt was like a pair of oversized wrecking balls, each cheek so nearly perfectly shapely and round, it stuck out more than four feet behind her, it wobbled like jello when she slapped it, it almost touched the floor as she stood up and it served as a shelf for her staircase of five rolls of back fat to rest on. Her arms were thick enough to impede her ability to fully bend her elbows, and she couldn't fully lower them so much as rest them on her love handles, her bicep fat encroaching over her forearm a little creating a fat fold around the middle of her arms. Her bare breasts were almost as big as her butt, pressing onto her huge stomach like they were resting on a shelf and sagging under their own weight just a tiny bit while remaining shapely, like water balloons full of jelly- except bigger than a lot of bean bag chairs. She had two thick tire sized rolls of neck fat which her whole head was practically buried in, the bottom one resting on the top roll of her back fat while the top one was rising above her head a bit, so it was visible from the front. Her face seemed to be sunken in because of her massively chubby cheeks, each almost as big as her head, and she had a triple chin which was pushed up a bit slightly by the way the bottom roll rested on her chest. She examined herself for a long time, mulling over her astounding obesity, until finally...</span></div></div>",

She can be as lazy as she wants now, she'll just make all her servants bring her food and treasure and jewels and more food. Sally and Blaze sighed, relived that their mistress was pleased with her heaving, jiggling immensity. \"You really do, mistress! Your body is a reflection of what's inside after all, and now your beauty is on full display! All your inner glory, all your inner grandeur, your true radiance is no longer restricted to such a tiny figure!\" Sally said, emphatically, showering her easily over two and a half ton mistress in compliments and praise, as the vast blob that was Rouge basked in her brainwashed dedication. \"I couldn't have said it any better myself! The more of you there is the more beautiful and perfect the world becomes!\" Blaze chimed in. Hearing that contribution, Rouge smirked, that same signature seductive and sexy little half smile on the pudgy fatty face of Rouge the Bat, as she slowly turned to face Blaze, every footfall a resounding thump which made her fat jiggle noticeably. \"Hmm...more of me, huh?

He followed all the curves with his eyes all the way down to her flawless legs. He could barely control himself, but when Rouge submerged herself beneath the millions of bubbles in the bath he regained his composure. \"Wow\" Shadow thought. \"How have I never noticed her beauty before this? She's impeccable to the last detail.\" But he came back to reality when he heard Rouge's silky, feminine voice fill the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh. That ebony hedgehog is going to drive me insane.\" Rouge whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's talking about Sonic again...wait... <i>ebony</i>  hedgehog. She's not upset with Sonic. She's upset with <i>me</i>. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was broken from his train of thought when Rouge spoke again. \"I care so much for him and I don't want to hypnotize him. But maybe Sonic's right. If he doesn't join me willingly he'll fight me and I'll HAVE to hypnotize him. I can't deal with this right now.\" Rouge sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\" Shadow almost yelled. \"She's going to hypnotize ME?!

I'll have Sonic go with Amy towards the east side of the city, Sally and Blaze can cover the west tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow?!\" Shadow screamed in his head. \"She's coming after me TOMORROW?! I have to stop that ring and fast!\" Which wasn't much of a problem after Rouge let out a huge yawn and turned off the lights before flying over to her comfy bed and submerging herself in the purple sheets and curling up and smiling from comfort. When she was definitely asleep, Shadow crawled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at that beautiful face and whispered \"I'm sorry too Rouge. Time to look around.\" He checked ALL over her walk-in closet and in her dresser (where he found no help, but PLENTY of Rouge's bra's and panties <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">  )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the only place left is the vanity table. Let's take a look.\" Shadow said creeping over to the violet table with several bottles and tubes which Shadow couldn't even begin to figure out. He started looking through the drawers and found a small white journal with purple cursive writing \"My Diary\". He flipped through it to the final entry:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> <span class=\"cviolet\"> March 18<br>\r\nI think this ring absorbs natural Chaos energy to power it's hypnotic qualities. So basically as long as I'm alive this ring sustains power since all living things need Chaos energy to exist. I feel safer knowing that I don't have to constantly look for a power source. But will my Chaos energy be enough to outweigh Shadow's? He has much more than anyone I know. Maybe he'll have some resistance to it. Well first things first. I need to capture him. Then I'll figure it out from there.\t</span> \t</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what she's planning. I should have known it used Chaos energy.\" Shadow said in anger swing his fist down to his side. \"I've gotta move. I should probably help Knuckles. But Rouge is going to hunt me down.

If I'm quiet I should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately Sonic was out cold on the couch, Rouge was soaking, and Sally and Blaze were too busy with Amy to notice him. Finally Shadow made it to Rouge's pink bedroom with a beautiful violet dresser, vanity table and heart-shaped bed. There was also a door leading to Rouge's massive walk-in wardrobe. \"Well I've got to hide until Rouge falls asleep.\" With that Shadow hid underneath Rouge's bed, the sheets drooped to the ground anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Rouge walked in wrapped in a fluffy black bathrobe with a silver \"R\" written in cursive over her left breast. Shadow looked from under the bed to observe her. She was at her dresser getting some of her white silk pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely\" She said. \"Just what I need to accompany a perfect soak.\" and she dropped her bathrobe. Shadow felt a nosebleed coming but suppressed it. the blood would be so obvious on the white carpet. Which was incredibly difficult since he saw Rouge's perfect body. Her beautiful D cup boobs clinging onto her beautiful chest. He followed all the curves with his eyes all the way down to her flawless legs. He could barely control himself, but when Rouge put on her silk pajamas Shadow almost lost it. It was like she was wearing nothing but milk. \"Damn\" Shadow thought. \"How have I never noticed her beauty before this? She's impeccable to the last detail.\" But he came back to reality when he heard Rouge's silky, feminine voice filled the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to hypnotize Shadow. There's no way around it. I have to kill him or hypnotize him. At least one keeps him alive. I just wish there was another way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow's eyes widened when he heard that \"Damn. Rouge IS going to hypnotize me. Looks like Faker got through to her.\" But Shadow stopped that thought when Rouge spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to do it. I'll have to capture him BEFORE getting the Master Emerald. It's my only choice. I'll have Sonic go with Amy towards the east side of the city, Sally and Blaze can cover the west tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow?!\" Shadow screamed in his head. \"She's coming after me TOMORROW?! I have to stop that ring and fast!\" Which wasn't much of a problem after Rouge let out a huge yawn and turned off the lights before flying over to her comfy bed and submerging herself in the purple sheets and curling up and smiling from comfort. When she was definitely asleep, Shadow crawled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at that beautiful face and whispered \"I'm sorry too Rouge. Time to look around.\" He checked ALL over her walk-in closet and in her dresser (where he found no help, but PLENTY of Rouge's bra's and panties <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the only place left is the vanity table. Let's take a look.\" Shadow said creeping over to the violet table with several bottles and tubes which Shadow couldn't even begin to figure out. He started looking through the drawers and found a small white journal with purple cursive writing \"My Diary\". He flipped through it to the final entry:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>  <span class=\"cviolet\"> March 18<br>\r\nI think this ring absorbs natural Chaos energy to power it's hypnotic qualities. So basically as long as I'm alive this ring sustains power since all living things need Chaos energy to exist. I feel safer knowing that I don't have to constantly look for a power source. But will my Chaos energy be enough to outweigh Shadow's? He has much more than anyone I know. Maybe he'll have some resistance to it. Well first things first. I need to capture him. Then I'll figure it out from there.\t</span>\t</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's what she's planning. But Chaos energy, I should've known.\" Shadow said in anger swing his fist down to his side. At least that was his INTENTION. He accidently hit the table by mistake making a loud bang along with the bottles and tube that fell with the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" Shadow thought putting Rouge's diary back \"Did she wake up?\"</span></div></div>",

Adrenaline pulsed through his veins and power surged throughout his being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transfer at 68% lady Rouge\" Wave updated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.

Am I lucky you came.\" Shadow said truthfully \"Can you find a way to get me down?\" Shadow asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Shadow, just hang on\" Amy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like I can do anything else\" Shadow joked as Amy looked around. Finally she went to the computer Wave was using and found a big blue button and a big black button. Upon pushing the black one Shadow's restraints released and he fell to the ground on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHADOW!\" Amy yelled in fear<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine... Thanks Amy\" Shadow said showing his gratitude. Amy blushed a bit since that was so out of character for Shadow. Shadow's head was down so he didn't see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. My house is near here, you can rest there\" Amy said throwing Shadow's arm over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that\" except Shadow saw when Amy blushed from Shadow's piercing, fiery red irises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long walk, Shadow was resting in a large, pink, heart-shaped bed. Shadow got a little angry about all the pictures of Sonic around the pink room, but let it go. He didn't have the strength to be angry, and just passed out beneath the pink sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Shadow awoke to a wetness on his forehead. Reaching up he felt a wet towel on it. And strangely all of the Sonic pictures were gone making the room look a bit bare. \"Hmm... Amy's gone through a bit of trouble apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast Shadow!\" Amy said carrying in a tray of eggs, pancakes and juice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Amy. This is so much more trouble than you needed to go through.\" Shadow admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't let my hurt friends suffer\" Amy said honestly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I greatly appreciate it.\" He said eating as Amy sat down next to Shadow on the bed. \"This is delicious Amy. Where did you learn to cook?\" He said awestruck<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought learning to cook would make Sonic like me more\" she said meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Amy. You really are too good for Sonic.\" Shadow admitted \"You chase him and chase him just to get rejected each time\" Shadow said moving the tray from his lap to the nightstand. He looked into her jade irises deeply \"Sonic has no idea what he is giving up. And I feel sorry for him.\" Shadow admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Shadow. That means a lot\" She said still not daring to break the gaze between ruby and jade until she closed her eyes and leaned in to kiss the Ultimate Life Form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! Shadow I'm so sorry!\" She said crying and turning away. \"It's just you've been so nice and grateful, everything I wish I had in a boyfriend and-\" She stopped when she felt a slight pressure on her arm turn her around. Once again jade met ruby except Shadow kissed Amy this time. Long and passionate they let their tongues explore each others' mouths and when they finally broke away Shadow looked at her and said \"Your wish has been granted\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shadow...\" She said smiling as she was cuddling up under the sheets clinging to his white fur as he stroked her head.</span></div></div>",

So it's just you and me.\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow grunted, trying to stand up, but Blaz casually walked over, swaying her hips in the same manner as her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother trying to move.

All you do is pursue him just to be rejected! No matter what you do he'll always run! And in case you haven't noticed, he's always running away from YOU!\" Shadow yelled. But Amy couldn't respond. She knew it was true as much as she wanted to deny it. No matter what she did Sonic ran. It just hit her harder from a different angle.

I've found a glimmer of light in this void and it might be enough to banish the darkness.\" He admitted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What?\" Amy asked sobbing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Amy. Ever since I've known you I've held a place in my heart for you. I could never shake the feeling away, but you were so focused on Sonic that I never bothered telling you. Instead I watched from the sidelines as a silent guardian.\" Shadow explained to the crying pink hedgehog<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow...\" Amy said looking into the powerful hedgehog's ruby irises with her jade ones before embracing the limp Shadow in a passionate kiss. Amy did most of the work but Shadow did enough for Amy to know he was responding. Tails walked in on them, but they didn't notice so he just left the syringe he came with on the table in the foyer before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy you don't know how long I've waited for that.\" Shadow confessed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've waited too long for someone to love me back Shadow.

Sorry Sonic.\" She said apologizing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. It's just good to see the <i> Ultimate Life Form </i> be so submissive.\" Sonic scoffed, obviously on higher ground, especially since Sonic was now his superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Sonic, can you help Blaze and Sally across town? You've got a heist.\" Rouge said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Lady Rouge.\" He said turning around \"Speed Break!\" Sonic said almost invisible to the naked eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you teach him that trick?\" Shadow asked with words flowing from his now pink lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amplified his Chaos energy Shady. I'd tell you how but that would require insurance you wouldn't tell.\" She said holding her ring up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps ignorance is bliss\" Shadow admitted, truly, genuinely AFRAID for the first time in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl Shady\" Rouge said. \"Come on, you've still got a lesson\" Rouge said ushering him forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending hours with Shadow teaching him how to walk, talk, think, and act like a proper woman, he finally knew how to apply makeup, his fashion sense became impeccable, and he didn't wobble in his boots anymore. Rouge, noticing this noticed incredible improvement and was so proud she was offering a reward to her newest recruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Shady\" Rouge said to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lady Rouge?\" Shadow asked leaning on a single knee, bowing his head and placing his right arm across his chest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done incredibly Shadow, and for that you deserve a reward. You're a lot more cooperative than I imagined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reward?\" Shadow wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me\" Rouge said and Shadow followed walking in a very Rouge-esque manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered Rouge's violet bedroom, equipped with vanity table, walk in wardrobe, dresser, and heart-shaped bed. Rouge went into her wardrobe, pulling out a small black silk bag, probably only big enough to hold a softball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Shadow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your reward.\" Rouge said, but nothing Shadow did could prepare him for what happened. Rouge pulled out a red Chaos Emerald and actually GAVE it to Shadow. She gave someone else a jewel, and not just a jewel, but a Chaos Emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Rouge... excuse me mistress Rouge.\" Shadow corrected accepting the Chaos emerald<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind my asking, why give me this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. Shadow you are being much more cooperative than I imagined, and we'll need your Chaos Control for our bigger heists.\" Rouge said \"Plus...\" She said walking closer. \"I've always had a soft spot for you Shadow.\" She as as she let her pink lips meet his. And as Rouge let her tongue enter and explore Shadow's mouth, she was surprised when Shadow reciprocated every action she made. Finally breaking away from the kiss Shadow spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I should probably go\" Shadow said turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Shady.\" Rouge said letting her arms slowly slither down Shadow's neck and meet on his muscular chest. \"Sonic, Blaze, and Sally are all gone. We've got a wonderfully comfortable bed provided.\" She said turning him around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like where this is going\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how much you're still a man\" Rouge said pulling in the ebony hedgehog and shutting the door.</span></div></div>",

That's rough.\" Silver admitted \"But I think I can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?!\" Shadow pleaded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From your description of the ring it sounds like a Spellbinder.\" Silver said deep in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spellbinder?\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. A powerful artifact that allows the wearer to submit people to their will.\" Silver explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I stop it?\" Shadow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be tricky. The Spellbinder is alive almost. It bonds itself to it's owner, their souls are almost in unison.\" Silver said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's linked to Rouge's SOUL?\" Shadow screamed \"What do we do now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down. The ring only works almost like a parasite. It loves the user when they are submitting people. If we can find a way for the Spellbinder to break that affection for Rouge, maybe it'll come off.\" Silver hypothesized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She gave me the choice to submit or not. Maybe the Spellbinder didn't like that?\" Shadow wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was more neutral. You're still submissive to the owner even though the Spellbinder itself wasn't used.\" Silver explained \"Somehow you have to set those people free. Make Rouge not want that ring anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell am I gonna do that?\" Shadow asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Shadow, but we better get back.\" Silver admitted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. Thanks Silver.\" Shadow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime you need my help, just give me a call. I got your back\" Silver promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.

Running it over the striped hedgehog's face, the lipstick and eye makeup vanished quickly, revealing the usual gruff face of Shadow the Hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now try putting it back on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Shadow snapped out of his daydream and looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see how good you are right now. Everything you need is here, so try putting it on without help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow looked at the vanity table, and the sheer amount of cosmetics; rows of lipstick tubes, multiple pallets of eyeshadow, tubes and containers that he didn't even recognize... Shadow didn't even know where to begin. Sighing, he picked up the first tube of lipstick to reach his hand and did his best.</span></div></div>",

Puckering his lips, he tried to remember what Maria did while she was still alive. After applying lipstick with a level of success he also donned mascara, eye shadow, and blush. All the while horrified at what he was doing while his mentor chuckled behind him, obviously enjoying himself. When Shadow had finished he set down the last tube looking to Sonic with a scowl. His fiery red irises blazing with anger. Of course Sonic, now having a power over Shadow, was not threatened at all. Sliding from side to side he examines Shadow, as if in keen observation. Flashing a set of white teeth he smirks before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad Shadsy. I think even Lady Rouge didn't expect this much out of you.\" Sonic glided in front of Shadow once again to look at his facial expression. Chuckling he holds his gloved hand up moving his index finger back and forth like a metronome. \"Now now Shadsy. You look beautiful, why so angry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith fury blazing inside of him like an inferno Shadow remains seated using what awesome strength he has from not tearing his rival who was only inches from him. Snarling he turns away before speaking \"You know damn well why Faker. If it wasn't for Rouge, you would be nothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, the famed Blue Blur swishes his hips walking out of the room. \"Now now Shady. Why don't you stay here and get a new appreciation for your external beauty while I get lady Rouge to examine you?\" And with the Sonic left his rival and apprentice alone. Thinking to himself Shadow looked around the room. Walking to a locked window Shadow examines the hinges more thinking to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I could very easily break this lock and get out of here, but Rouge would come after me fervently and she'd use that ring. If I stay on the other hand I'll be subject to more of this mortification, but I might learn how to combat that ring.\" After a few minutes of thought Shadow eventually decided that it was best to...</span></div></div>",

Tails was scared for his life as he thought Amy would have smashed them both flatter than a coin. But she just stayed there broken. More tears rising the more Sonic and Rouge explored each others' mouths. Eventually Rouge was so excited her wings supported them both in the air. After they released Amy was on her knees crying as she saw the pink lipstick Sonic was now wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Sonic?

He was just running from you one day ran into me. Fortunately I always had some feelings for him too.\" She said while she played with his quills with her finger. \"When we realized how much we loved each other, well, you know the rest.\" She said glaring at Amy broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Amy, Tails.

Let's go\" Rouge said seductively<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked into her icy irises lovingly before saying \"Whatever you want my Ivory Angel.\"<br>\r\nAnd Sonic carried her in her arms and sped off leaving Amy a broken woman. Destroyed. Rouge got what she wanted, but maybe she got more. She never saw Sonic's dark side before, and now that it was out she liked it. She loved the way he looked into her eyes and the way he kissed her. She loved everything about him and never wanted to let him go. He was her Big Blue and she was his Ivory Angel. And she couldn't be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lovely miss Rouge. She's devastated and I'm finally rid of her.\" Sonic said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge saw a good opportunity to use her ring here. \"Just call me Rouge. Sonic? The next question I ask I want to to answer honestly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" Sonic replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you love me?\" Rouge asked, felling silly she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Rouge. I do. Ever since I've known you, your feminine beauty has captivated me. The more I fought it, the more I wanted you for my own. I love you Rouge the Bat, and I would do anything for you. I'm just grateful I no longer have to hide it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was ecstatic. Not ONLY did Rouge love Sonic, but he reciprocated that love. They were together now. Thanks to this ring, she and Sonic could finally be together. It was so beautiful she cried into his powerful chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge.\" Sonic said tenderly \"Are you alright? Did I hurt your feelings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you tell me?\" Rouge said pulling him back in for another passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do now my Ivory Angel?\" Sonic said flashing the confident smile that swept Rouge off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember sweetie?

Finally, Rouge walked in and knocked on the door at the end. Shortly after, Wave opened it, very confused. Her confused look quickly turned to anger. \"Rouge?! How and why the hell did you break into my house?!\" She exclaimed. \"Shhhh... It'll all make sense in time...\" Rouge said softly and held the ring in front of Wave. \"Sense... In... Time...\" Wave mumbled. Suddenly, she shook herself awake. \"How may I serve you, my mistress?\" Wave  asked in Rouge's smooth and sexy tone. \"I need you to build me a machine that will transform a boy into a girl.\" Rouge said. \"Alright, mistress.\" Wave said and was about to get started. \"Oh, and make sure that it will make them sexy.\" Rouge added. Wave nodded, and headed to her lab. Rouge turned back to her treasure hunting team. \"Sonic, you have done well. I will now refer to you as a woman, too.\" Rouge said. \"Thank you, mistress.\" Sonic replied happily. \"Alright ladies, who should we hypnotize now?\" Rouge asked.</span></div></div>",

Rouge merely gave a squeeze of the hand pump. the cup drew tight against Fiona's sex. Rouge smiled at the confused look on her lovers face as she continued to work the pump. The suction from the pump was drawing blood into her groin making it puffy and sensitive. Fiona quickly realized that rouge must have one of these herself because she certainly knew how to work it.  Rouge's predatory grin widened as she flicked a clamp and the suction vanished. pulling the toy away the ivory bat leaned over and lightly blew on Fiona's now inflamed sex. The fox girl howled with at the sensation. Rouge's smile was nothing short of wicked as she used wo fingers to trace the outline of Fiona's puffed pussy sending the girl to writhe in ecstasy. For the next fifteen minutes every breath every feather light caress From Rouge was purest bliss Fiona had never known. Finally Fiona could take no more. \"No more Mistress please.\" She begged. Rouge experienced a moment of shock that turned into a thrill of pleasure that rocket all through her body. Fiona had acknowledged her as Mistress with out being mind controlled. Rouge orgasmed on the spot. as she came down a thought filled her. \"still so many toys to try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had two major options, really. He could force her to be lenient, and leave some semblence of himself in whatever she made of him, be it leaving him male, or making him work as a scientist. Alternatively, he could make her wipe him and leave her with no access to his intellect.</span></div></div>",

What are you doing?\" Tails screamed in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't be listening to you anymore.\" Rouge said descending from a beam on the ceiling. \"He only listens to me. And now you will do the same.\" She said flashing the ring at Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course lady Rouge. What is it you wish of me?\" Tails said in his own version of Rouge's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to create a gender swapping device for you and Sonic. It's high time this world saw some glamor. Sonic will help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic kneeled with Tails and stated \"It shall be done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Sonic's speed and Tails' tech savvy, those two will be wearing high heels before we know it\" Rouge said proudly to Blaze and Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Tails returned. \"The device is ready my mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent Sonic. Time for the test run.\" Rouge said in anticipation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been done. Sonic was used as the test subject. And it was a great success. Not only has he been changed, he still kept his incredible speed, strength, agility, and stamina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Rouge exclaimed clapping her hands together. \"Now let's see this test subject of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish lady Rouge.\" Tails said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they return to the laboratory, Rouge's, Sally's, and Blaze's jaws all dropped at what they saw. A female Sonic stood before them. Not as sexy as Rouge, but a VERY close second. D cup boobs now adorned Sonic's chest as well as curvy hips, plump lips, and a tight butt with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic?\" Rouge spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a voice almost identical to Rouge's, Sonic responded \"Yes my mistress. The device was a complete success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" Rouge said again. \"Sally, Blaze\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get Vivian here suited up.

And Tails (who Rouge newly named Crystal) wore the same thing except with the breastplate and times of the gloves and boots orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work Crystal.\" Rouge stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a voice that almost sounded like Amy, Crystal replied \"Thank you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge thought out loud. \"So now there are five of us. All ready to go. We might e ready to steal the prize I've coveted most of all. The Master Emerald. the perfect gem. But maybe it would be wise to capture Knucklehead first.

Sally moaned and spread her legs a little wider to give her Queen better access. Sally drew Nicole in until there was no room between them and kissed her beloved mistress. Nicole loved it the feel of Sally warm cunt seizing around her fingers, her lovers tongue dancing with her own, the warmth of the princess' breasts against her own.Nicole could feel the heat building in her loins just when she was ready to do something about it she felt Sally's fingers brush against her folds and then penetrate her. Their world shrank to only one another the sound of their lover's pleasure, the heat they shared, and the others caress. The embrace ended far too soon for either of their liking as first Nicole then Sally climaxed both slumping to the floor as they were over whelmed. Nicole sighed holding her love tight she teleported them to the room.  both wanted to continue but neither had the energy.</span></div></div>",

Two more tentacles appeared  lining themselves up with each couples rear. Suddenly the tips of each tendril split revealing four small tendrils and one much larger one. the eight small ones moved in and began to rub a warm oil against the groups assholes and pussies. meanwhile the two long tendrils snaked their way between the stomachs of each couple and through the valley of their breasts before they too split into smaller tendrils. one darted for the mouth of each member and began to secrete a honey like substance. Rouge smiled Nicole's tentacles were really something. Sapphire, Rouge and Sally jolted in surprise as the tendrils pushed into their front and back doors simultaneously. The small tendrils began to rock back ad forth drawing part way out of one partner and pushing further into the other. the machines pleasured them  The pairs breast rubbed against one another and against the tendril sandwiched between their breasts. Sapphire came first her orgasm causing the tendril in her mouth to pull back. Nicole climaxed not long after the machines sped up a little as her juices began to drip down on to Sally's sex. Rouge and SAlly came at nearly the same time. As all four came down the tendrils withdrew from them and set them on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After summoning Blaze and Cream she began to prepare for the day while Sally readied herself. Sometime later that morning, or perhaps early afternoon, the town surrounding Castle Acorn was filled with the music of bugles as the coronation ceremony began. As hundreds, potentially thousands of Mobians came to the ceremony, Sally stood upon a high balcony along with Rouge. As she looked down to her subjects Sally spoke as Rouge guided her, the teal emerald of her ring emitting a soft glow, far too low for anyone who wasn't up on the balcony to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen of Mobius. I saddens me to say the I find myself no longer capable of ruling the monarchy of this world.\" Gasps and shudders broke out all over the audience as she spoke. Holding up a gloved hand to silence them, Sally continued \"However do not believe that I am simply abandoning you. I have found a suitable replacement who will lead this kingdom in ways I never could.\" Gesturing to the ivory bat clad in a violet gown, along with the rabbit in white she continued like it was nothing \"As the supreme power of this monarchy I hereby succeed to Rouge the Bat.\" As Sally removed the silver crown from her head and placed it on that of her mistress, she turned to the crowd hands upraised. \"All hail Queen Rouge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a massive uproar came throughout the spectators the either cheered in absolute joy or yelled in fury, both attitudes having to be suppressed by the royal guard. However one face in the crowd seemed stoic almost as he gazed to Mobius' new queen. As the hedgehogs quills swished when he shook his head he made his way through the crowd to isolate himself and gather his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b> But what famous hedgehog witness Rouge's coronation? </b></i></span></div></div>",

With a smirk he looked up to the new ruler of Mobius staring at her beauty. Impressed he cared not for the change in rule. After all he was a rogue, what would new laws matter to the Ultimate Life Form? He had always done in his best interest and that was all he planned on doing. With a scoff he began to walk away before Rouge spoke to the public of Mobius, he new kingdom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the ebony blur with red streaks sticking out in the crowd Rouge smirked devilishly before speaking. Her ivory fangs almost glistening in the sunlight as words flowed from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of Mobius, it is an honor and pleasure to be bestowed the crown of Sally Acorn. With its power I intend to make all that is wrong right once again. Which is why I make my first act a queen now. A horrible injustice has fallen upon us, and it must be set right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another look to one hedgehog in the crowd she continued. Yelling, she commanded with the authority of queens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards! Bring me Shadow the Hedgehog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstonished, Shadow opened his eyes as he immediately halted. Braced for battle he combated several Mobian castle guards with the civilian crowd in an uproar. Shadow fought valiantly, his speed and manipulation of Chaos Control required the entire royal guard to come to action. Shadow was relentless, murdering any guard that dared cross his path, but it seemed with each one dead another two were ready to take the place of the fallen. After Shadow was restrained, the guards left alive after the battle escorted him into the castle while the crowd watched in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked through a massive set of oak doors, Shadow's white teeth were in a snarl as he saw the ivory bat at the throne, her golden ring glistening in the reflected light of the chandelier. With his ruby irises blazing as fire itself, he yelled to the new queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You psychotic bat! Release me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Shadow only found himself hit in the back of the head with a blunt object and forced onto his knees as one of the palace guards, an orange colored ferret, spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be wise to show the queen her proper respects in the future to scum\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow was struck again as he turned his head and snarled. Having enough of this Rouge raised her gloved hand to the ferret and the brown fox escorting the prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough you two. I'll not have any more of this... unless he deserves it. Now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gleam in her aqua eyes she looked to Shadow with a smile, cool water meeting blazing flames in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow, there has been a horrible injustice done on everyone in Mobius regarding you. You aren't recognized properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting her, Shadow's smirk came across his face before speaking hiding his ruby eyes by shutting them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not my fault laws exist. I need things, I'm not planning on playing by someone else's rules to get them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the opportunity she wanted, Rouge smiled taking Shadow's chin in her hand, while Princess Cream merely watched from a distance with a child-like innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've loved that about you Shady. I love how you play by your own rules. Which is why I have something to show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving her hand to the side Shadow turned his head amazed by what he saw. As Blaze walked out she head a seductive look about her as she brought forth an elegant, but powerful, cape and a golden crown. Rouge, calm by her minion's entrance continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with you as Mobius' new king, everyone else will now play by those rules. The world will now correct the injustice it's done by spurning your genius Shadow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, the guards restraining Shadow released him so that he may walk freely. As Blaze came around him she almost dance as she secured the cape while Rouge bestowed the crown. Showing him a mirror, Cream held one to Shadow so that he may observe his kingly visage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Shadow. You know this is what you want. All this power you've always wanted at you disposal. All those who wronged you brutally punished, and you finally given what you deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShadow couldn't deny that his kingly visage amazed even himself. There was a certain elitist appearance about him. Not in a monarchical sense, but something more, as if a sense of belonging. Shadow smiled widely before turning to Rouge, pulling out a Chaos Emerald to match his Crimson irises. Letting it's power merge with his own it glowed before his queen stood at his right sidling up to him while the two guards that once commanded him knelt in respect... or fear. It didn't matter to the king of Mobius. As Rouge waved of the guards to herald the news of Shadow's rule she whispered in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you wish first my king?\" Rouge knew she had plans of her own, and needed to keep her ring a secret from Shadow, but gaining his trust would be vital later. Besides, there was no denying it, Shadow was sexy, powerful, dark, mysterious, a gentleman, everything a queen could want. Of course her train of thought was broken as Shadow spoke. Clenching his fist he looked once more in the mirror before he expressed his thoughts...</span></div></div>",

That injustice being Sonic. His arrogance and insolence will bring turmoil and ruin to our kingdom.

Unfortunately he didn't get far before several members of the palace guard ambushed him. Surrounding him in a circle, Sonic braced for battle wondering why the guards familiar blue jackets with a red trim were replaced with white and black, respectively. But Sonic's green eyes widened farther when he saw a pink hedgehog walk into the center of the circle with him clad in the same uniform of the Order of the Ivory Shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ames? What's going on?\" Sonic said stupefied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out her hammer, Sonic noticed it was black and silver with a new scythe blade on the other end. Amazed Sonic watched Amy still braced for battle hoping soon she would calm him. Instead her normal bubbly giggle was a much more dark one before she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonic. Coming to the rescue as always. It's such a shame you are so predictable. Now as Public Enemy Number One, I have direct orders from the queen to bring you in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic didn't even have time to react before every guard at Amy's command held him down. With a dark smile Amy latched her hammerscythe on her back before escorting her guards, with her newest prisoner, to the throne room. Amy hid her minor sorrows for having to bring in her lover, but orders were orders, and she'd never disobey them. Not even for Sonic. Addressing her guard, Amy spoke again with the authority of a captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incarcerate him while I report to the queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Sonic was dragged off while Amy entered the throne room. With a smile on her face she kneeled to the queen and king before her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord and Lady, Sonic the Hedgehog has been captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile Rouge and Shadow looked to each other darkly before they looked to Amy. Rouge being the first to speak, caused Amy to smile widely at what the snowy white queen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work Amy. As a reward, and seeing as how Sonic can't do anything while he's incarcerated, he is yours.\" Tossing her a metallic collar, Rouge smiled knowing she couldn't chance using her ring and exposing herself to Shadow. After all, her ring's power only worked on women.. as far as he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was overjoyed she almost lost her composure. Taking the silver collar she knelt again before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Amy left with Rouge's dark laughter fading behind her. Walking down the magnificent corridors Amy smiled opening one of the grandiose doors seeing Sonic in four-point restraint on a queen sized bed. Yelling Sonic realized Amy had somehow changed, his green eyes blazing with fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy! Amy! Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling did nothing for Sonic though as Amy walked and swayed over to her blue lover and placed Rouge's collar on him. Looking almost like a silver necklace Sonic yelled in agony and pain as the collar's electronic impulses invaded his mind. As soon as it ended Sonic found himself as lovesick for his new mistress as she was for him. Submissive Sonic looked to Amy almost with hearts in his eyes. Looking to his restraints, Sonic put on a smirk that had always made Amy's heart melt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Ames. New outfit, four point restraint, a necklace? I'm not sure what kind of games you're playing but I think I could get into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dark smile on her face, Amy released Sonic to truly make him hers.

Besides, it would humiliate any part of Sonic left free, it would make him fit in with the other slaves, it would damage her chances of escaping, and it would be vengeance for leaving her to chase Sally for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic, meanwhile, was confused. He had no idea what this side to his Mistress was, but a second later, she pressed a button on his collar, and within seconds, being a feminine sissy who desired womanhood above all else seemed like the most natural thing in the world to him.

Rouge moaned appreciatively before pressing her lips to Sally's. they tasted (perhaps un)surprisingly like hazelnut spread. (Sally had a fondness for it.) . The ivory bat probed the princess' mouth with her tongue moaning from Fiona's ministrations. Pulling her lips free Rouge took hold of Sally's ample chest massaging the tender orbs. Sally's eyes never left the face of her beloved Mistress who was showing her such pleasures. Fiona lapped at Rouges sex eager to please her, but her own sex was feeling neglected. Reaching back behind her legs she began to tease her clit between her ring and index finger as she continued her task. Rouge let go of Sally's breasts and braced one arm just above the chipmunk shoulders. Her other arm ran down Sally's belly until she reached her sex. Then Rouge plunged two figures into her little princess and began to rub back and forth along the inner walls of her sex. At last it was too much for Sally and she came her sex clenching around Her mistress's fingers. At near the same time Fiona pushed Rouge over the edge her orgasm giving the vixen a face full of fem cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\npulling back Fiona voiced a problem. \"Mistress I haven't cum yet.\" she said still feverishly fingering her box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally be a dear and finish her off.\" the bat said rolling aside so that was possible. Sally pulled the vixen's hand away from her sex before diving right in and licking every inch of Fiona's pussy. Since she hadn't been all that far from cumming she soon climaxed all over Sally's face. The nights sexual escapades ended as they both curled up into the arms of their Mistress and nodded off not long after Rouge fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Clearing a corner, she came in front of the small hangar garage. A fundamental weak point since it would open to any device that uses a compatible signal. Luckily for Cream, Rouge would not let her go in unprepared. With a simple wireless device, the garage opened, giving her access to the rest of the workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was home and there were no cameras inside, which gave the new thief free range. No sign of an Emerald, but something did catch her eye. It was a small raygun device that looked rather new but fully constructed.

The interface screen was bland, but everything was comprehensible and user-friendly. \"Looks easy enough. We should be able to use it right away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, should we snatch more equipment from the shop while he's out.\" Cream asked, hoping to score more finds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now, we were just here for your field test. Besides, we don't want him to know the moment he walks in that he was robbed. Not to mention the fact that we would have to lug it back.\" The bat shrugged before spreading her wings. \"We done here. Let's go back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress Rouge.\" Cream chimed as she flapped her long ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Rabbit's Residence--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sat in the recliner as Cream sat idly by and Vanilla made her mistress honey tea. Giving a final amused look at the device, she believed that she waited long enough. \"I want to see this bad boy in action. Cream, your innocent charm is a good asset, but I must say, curiosity has me. A sneak peek of what's to come is entertaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light in the young rabbit's eye twinkled, speaking to her youthful wonder, if not contrasting with her new look, \"So you going to make me older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla gently gave Rouge the cup of tea and stood by to hear her thoughts. Blowing on the hot liquid, the mistress takes a quick sip and continued, \"That's the idea. Well, part of it, because I'm thinking of using it on Vanilla too. She's already gorgeous, but if she was a little younger...Maybe around the young adult range...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla smiled. \"I was more energetic in my youth, and was just as sexy too. It wouldn't hurt to flaunt it again.\" She said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving pressed a few buttons, she sprayed a beam at her young apprentice. A colorful blast hit her right in the chest and swept over her body. The beam soon dissipated, but her silhouette changed nevertheless. Marveling at the sight, Rouge and Vanilla gasped as they witnessed this event, which was nothing short of a miracle. When Cream's new body and image came into focus, the bat twirled the raygun in her hand and smirked. In the next instant, a beam hit Vanilla and the process began again. The light surrounded her until her form shrank. After the illuminations died off, Rouge was satisfied with the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger rabbit got jumpstarted past puberty and sported a more developed body. Her chest hefted a pair of B-cup mounds and her hips have expended noticeably. Vanilla, on the other hand, had those same assets deducted, reduced to C-cups and her hips matching the width. Moreover, the main difference were their heights; Cream grew modestly as Vanilla shrunk significantly. The mother was still taller than her daughter, but the buffer was no more than two feet apart. Finally, the sudden change to their size caused Vanilla's and Cream's clothes to sag and tighten, respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they came to, they looked at each other before examining themselves. Even with the mental reprogramming from Rouge's ring, aspects of their family relationship showed as Vanilla's eyes water at the beautiful young woman her daughter was and Cream was in awe of her mother's transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stared flabbergasted at the rabbits. The parent-child pair now more closely resembled two sisters. She regained her composure and grabbed her subordinates attention. \"Twenty and fifteen on your ages. I'm surprised that you've had quite a growth spurt, Vanilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It happens, Mistress.\" Vanilla assures her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing once again at the age changer, the mischievous bat purred once more. Truly, it was a remarkable gift, second only to her ring of course. 'Oh the things I can do with you.' She thought with a grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It has been a week since Rouge found the ring and had taken the Rabbit family for herself. In that time, Cream showed an incredible amount of promise, in both her naturally young and enhanced older forms. Rouge believed she was ready of her first solo jewel heist. Notably, it was to be performed in the middle of the day. Rouge must have had complete confidence in her teachings to think that the once sweet Rabbit could pull this off by herself. That, or thought that the target was in no way suitably prepared for a heist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlarms went off as a number of security guards went into a complete scramble. One guard got sight of a woman in a dark and orange sneaking suit with a bag and her arms full of gems and precious stones. He made a direct b-line for her, but rather than running, she skipped as if she had not a worry of getting caught. Even if she kept out of reach in a rather childish way, he knew that if can make for the stairs before she could, she would be cut off. Mustering what little he was not tapping into, he sprinted in a b-line to the only opening she could use and managed to reach there first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, he realized that he only made it there first because she had no intent to leave in that direction. Instead, she made her way to the window. He did not register why she would; the windows automatically shudder during a lockdown. The one she headed for was still wide open despite the shutdown due to a strip of duct tape sealing the gap closed. Security measures negated by an inexpensive mundane item. They might soon be in the market for a hydraulic replacement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bandit came to a stop in the front of the window before looking at the man behind her. He was winded in trying to pursue an alternate exit that it will take him a while to approach her again. Taking her time, she pulled a diamond from her pilfering stash and cut into the window, catching the glass before it would fall outside. She returned the authentic gemstone and hoisted herself with one hand to carefully sit on the windowsill. Just as she finished, the man closes the distance between them, but in a sluggish and pitiful way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a display of absolute prediction, she allowed the guard to get as close as possible and quickly wrapped her legs over his shoulders and around his neck. The man was lost in shock-induced stupor as he was suddenly in a headlock between the assailant's legs. He could barely think as Cream brushed his hair with her fingers so she could plant a kiss on his forehead with a giggle. With the guard paralyzed, the thief ended the tease by freeing him from her grasp and shoved him to the ground with her feet. When he snapped out of it and rose to his feet, he saw the girl sailing through the air with her ears. Shaken and humiliated, he continued to the ground level to continue the pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along one of the many streets surrounding the museum, Vanilla moved into an enclosed alleyway. She took a couples glances over her shoulder to make sure no one was looking in her direction. Draped over one of her arms is Cream's school bag with their pet chao Cheese sleeping inside with his head peeking out. On cue, the airborne Rabbit lands in front of her mother with the treasured jewels in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream gestured with the jewels in her possession, \"Mistress was right. Now that I'm getting to hang of this, it does start getting fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla nods as she sets the bag down, pulling out the aging device and some makeup removal wipes. \"Remember what else the Mistress said, that was just the first part...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Minutes Later--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSirens blared as multiple squad cars storm down every road. The alert was out; the suspect was an orange and creamed-color Rabbit Mobian, possible teenage/young adult, height slightly shorter than the average human male. Many drivers and officers scanned the populace, desperate on the off-chance that the thief was in plain sight and not seeking cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the cars rolled down a street before spotting two orange and cream Rabbits from blocks away. The crew inside would have sworn that they found the culprit if only they stayed a distance away. When they got closer, they realized that while their color-scheme was spot-on, neither were the appropriate height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rabbits saw the squad car pull up and silenced the siren. The driver stepped out intent on getting a closer look while the rest of his team advised otherwise. He knew what he was looking at, a small family of a mother, her daughter, and even a portable pet chao. Both were pretty shocked to see him with the girl cowering behind her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer,\" Vanilla started while placing a hand on Cream's head, \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man was thinking that he was right on top of her. Maybe they were not the the culprit, but perhaps she is part of this family as well. For all he knew, they could have been in league with her. He spotted the backpack the girl was wearing with the sleeping chao inside. \"Ma'am, we are in the middle of ongoing investigation. I just want the make sure that your daughter's bag was not compromised against her knowledge.\" He said in a attempt to not led on that he was suspicious of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla gulped before answering, \"But why us? What have we done? Surely whoever or whatever you're looking for has nothing to do with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just doing my job.\" He held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream looked up at the man who was intent on searching her bag. Noticing Vanilla's quiet instruction, she took her backpack up and scoop Cheese out, startling him to a groggy wakened state. Handing the bag to the officer, he immediately forced every zipper open and flipped it upside down. Considering a chao was taking up most of the space, all that fell were a few small toys and a snack that broke when it hit the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer stood stunned for a moment. An awkward pause continued until one of his coworkers left their seat. He was told that they were not going to entertain this futile exercise anymore and forced him back to the car. \"I'm very sorry about this.\" The second man apologized for his partner's actions, \"It's a little tense right now.\" Saying nothing else, he returned Cream's bag and duck back into the squad car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the police were out of view, Vanilla and Cream smirked at each other and kept walking down the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Rabbit Residence--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the mother-daughter duo passed through the front door, Vanilla lifted her ankle-length dress to reveal the gems strapped to her legs. \"Mission Accomplished!\" Cream said as she started removing the stolen treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress's backpack decoy plan was pretty clever.\" Vanilla purred as her daughter started to remove their prizes from straps on her legs. \"But that should come as no surprise given her track record.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they had the gems and jewels accounted for, they were stowed away for when they needed to present them to their mistress. \"Now we just need to wait for her to check our work. Hopefully she'll praise me for how far my training has gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the lights shut off in the Rabbits' surprise. Cream quickly turned to check the switch, but she heard a quick but quiet sound from her mother behind her. Turning once again, something forced her to spin until she was disoriented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why exactly would I praise you?\" The woman in the dark flatly stated. Cream tried to respond, but was cut off when both her wrists were caught behind her back by the bat's single-handed grip. \"All you did was take a few gems from some poor suckers. You still wet behind your bunny ears.\" Rouge licked one of her fingers and wiped it at the base of the shivering girl's ear. \"See? You're completely at my mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Mistress, I don't understand...We did exactly what you said. We stayed truly loyal to you. I thought you wanted to make me a thief like you.\" Cream muttered in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sighed as she dragged the young rabbit by her wrists. Flipping the light switch back on, the mother was seen bound and gagged on the floor. \"You see your mother, Sweetie? You misunderstood what I wanted. This isn't some fun little exercise to take you under my wing. This is not for your benefit, but mine.\" She finally lets go of the girl and approaches the bound mother. She wipes one of her tears before flashing her ring to her eyes. \"You are mine now after all, and I tend to take care of my toys, my treasures. I set my eyes on something then I protect it. But you both are so much more than a sparkling thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring worked its magic on Vanilla, her gaze fogged in a trance. Despite expecting nothing less, she still smiled of her control over her. \"You have so much potential, so many ways to be used.\" She grabbed the aging machine from the holster on her thigh. \"And you have already made my life more...interesting.\" She broke the ring's gaze and locked eyes with her subject who was still tranced. \"The things we can do...Now doesn't it make sense to leave things to me? To take this little operation in its proper direction?\" Vanilla weakly nodded and let out a muffled cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge turned to the daughter and showed the ring to her once more. Cream just stared into it, as if it was showing her the most pleasing image that only she can see. \"Now, answer honestly. Who is your Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To fulfill my Mistress's wishes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what would you be without your Mistress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question did not trigger a verbal response. Instead, Cream began to sniffled as her eyes watered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge accepted the gesture as the most honest answer she could give. This was perfect to her. She hoped for her subjects absolutely dependent, but not broken. To follow her orders unquestionably, but not require her to hold their hand. Withdrawing the ring, she locked eyes with her prize. \"Don't you worry. Now, you like to obey my orders, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream nodded, letting out a small smile from what she was thinking was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\"</span></div></div>",

Not as a mere toy, but an instrument she was entrusted to use. Seeing what was expected of her, she fiddled with it hiding her intentions for the moment. Once done, she locks eyes with her mother who was still tried to the ground. The young rabbit offered a smiling more befitting in her mistress before raising the ray gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flash of light hit Vanilla, changing her form as expected. Rouge watched the silhouette as she was trying to figure out what her servant thought of 'be equal' really meant. The shrinking body was a quick tell of age regression. She shrank smaller and smaller, past as far as they once did. With the light dispersing, the adult rabbit was now as small as her daughter. The change in size also made her binds looser around her body as she was somewhat hidden in her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mistress believed she saw what her slave was thinking. Equality in a literal sense. She turned to comment at Cream but froze at the next thing she saw. The Rabbit had turned the machine around and was pointing it at her chest. She pulled the trigger and zapped herself, dropping the device on impact. She grew in the shroud of white light, steadily moving into a stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of Rouge was Cream standing at her mother's previous age, her orange dress in her hands before it got too tight around her. She had once had the image of the two being akin to sisters, but now they looked downright like fraternal twins. Vanilla's short bangs were the only way she tell them apart at a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was interested at the start with messing with their ages, but she as yet to have done it this far before. And yet, Cream did it just to please her. Plus, changing Vanilla was more of a curiosity while Cream's helped with stealth tactics and covering up her identity. She was at a lost for what to do with a kid Vanilla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Rouge started again. \"You didn't hesitate to shoot the raygun at your own mother while she was already vulnerable. Then you shot yourself immediately afterwards. You do know what happened, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I showed you how equal we are.\" Cream knelt down to her child-sized mother. \"I still have all my happy memories with her and she will always be my mom. But whatever you need us to be, Mistress, we'll do it, no questions asked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stuck up her index finger to the cradling daughter. \"Then let me ask you a question. What made you chose those ages? What did I tell you that caused you to carry out an age reversal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream paused before speaking up again. \"You...didn't tell me anything like that. I just wanted to prove to you how far we'll go. Mom would have done the same, right Mom?\" Out of the hypno ring tranced, Vanilla nodded and moaned approval past the gag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge clicked her tongue to silence her. \"But you know what that means, right?\" The rabbits gave an uncertain look, letting the bat continue, \"Choice. You acted on your own decisions while carrying out my order. That, was what I wanted to see.\" Rouge walked to the two rabbits staring at her before pinching both of their ears. \"Of course, you understand there is one choice I definitely won't stand for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream winced at the pain her sensitive ear was feeling. She got what Rouge was impling, 'Don't betray me.'. She would have pleaded for her to stop if she had not noticed her mom swarming her hands out of her binds. Once Vanilla's hands for free, she reached behind her head to undo the knot of the gag. With Cream still being pinched, she grabbed Rouge's hand and pulled it in front of her face. She saw the ring on her finger, and started kissing it multiple times, each one getting louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge pulled her hand away from her then patted her on her head. She gave a slight chuckle of amusement, \"Very nice. I might even forget that you weren't supposed to get out of that.\" Vanilla looked down but held a smile at the compliment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat looked at the rag that silenced Vanilla in her hand and got an idea. She walked behind Cream as she was helping her mom out of the loose clothing and Cream's orange sneaking suit hidden underneath. With fluid movements, Rouge wrapped the cloth around Cream's eyes catching the preoccupied woman off-guard. \"Of course, even acceptable acts have consequences. I was expecting to have some fun with Vanilla, but you decided to take her place.\" The mistress's voice turned seductive for the next comment, \"How sweet of you. Not only for sparing your mother from humiliation, but also for giving me a chance to 'play' with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream squirmed a little as the damp rag covering her eyes sent a chill down her spine, not helped by the bat's words. \"B-but we already had some fun a few days ago. You used the raygun to make me grown while you and Mom taught me about sex and the pleasures of bring a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's different, dear.\" Vanilla chimed in, her younger voice squeaking. \"That was more...educational. The Mistress has something else in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smiled, \"True, she did learn a lot despite her youth and innocence. But what I am interested in...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge led the blindfolded Cream to the the master bedroom. Placing the rabbit's hands at the foot of the bed, the bat laid on top of the sheets. Facing Cream, Rouge eyes the tiny Vanilla at the door. Despite her childish appearance, her eyes gave a gaze towards her daughter. The mistress identified that look as it was very familiar to her; pride. She can tell that Vanilla believed that Cream can live up to Rouge's expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was not for her to decide. She silently waved her hand to shoo her. The message was received and Vanilla closed the door, leaving Rouge and Cream alone. She wanted her to be right as it would be to her benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used as few words as possible. \"I won't accept failure in any department, Cream. You should know what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit nodded and lifted her hands to scan her mistress on the bed. First things first, she needed to free her mistress from her clothes. From memory, Rouge was lying there in her usual sneaking suit. She had one herself, so she knew how to worked. A unitard with a zipper in the front, covered by the breastplate. Cream would have to remove it, but not now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge laid there and felt her subject go for her boots first. One hand supported the back of her heel while the other guided her toe. Slowly, the boot came off with a gently constant tug. Her free foot became exposed to the air, sending a chill up her leg. The same process occurred on the opposite foot. Her toe was stuck out and the boot slid off. Not much for her arousal, but she could not remove the suit without getting rid of the outer layers first. It was a good mark that Cream was thinking ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the first task done, Cream's hands were left unoccupied. It was intended as she silently made a show with the next action. Sticking her hand up in plain view, the opposing thumb and index finger grabbed the edge of her glove. With the same speed she used for removing Rouge's footwear, Cream peeled her glove away, leaving only three fingers covered. Then with a flick of her wrist, it flew off her hand and landed on the bed. She mirrored the action again, flinging the other off on to the floor missing the bed entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with a loud clap, the rabbit vigorously rubbed her hands together. From the ankles, her hands run up the her mistress's legs. The warmth from her hands broke through the bat's fabric. The heat caused Rouge's legs to arch; the back of her knees soon caressed by the wandering hands. Rouge's inquisitive eyes closed while her throat let out a desired moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer suit would drag against her body as Cream continued to move up. When the hands left an area, the fabric dragged against her again as the warmth escaped. A chill went up her spine when the cold air attacked her legs. Suddenly, the freed space was covered again. But it could not be by the hands, as Rouge still feel where they were. Instead, there was weight and softness behind it. Peeking, Rouge saw the Cream's adult body covering her legs, trapping her in a more intense heat. Between the simultaneous caressing, friction of her suit, and the change in temperatures, coupled with the unhurried speed, the bat melted into the blind service her servant provided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was giving everything to her mistress at that moment. She was to be obedient and loyal, but be able to act on her own direction. She pledged to serve her in any capacity and wished to fulfill it. She wanted this. That was what she truly believed. But that did not calm her nervousness. Despite the successful heist earlier that day, she feared that momentary success could lead to disappointment down the road. Hearing Rouge's moan gave her hope, but she dared not let up. Her skills in the bedroom is still a new world to her, but if she passed here, that will prove her worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she worked her way up to the breastplate. She figured that the sweeping motion she had been using would not work as well here. Rather than using her palms, she would focus on the precise sensations of her fingers. Sliding her thumbs under the brim, the pink heart-shaped armor hovered in place. Her fingers traced around the circumference until she reached the top. For the first time this session, Cream was directly touching Rouge without anything in the way. With a single hand on Rouge's collarbone, Cream lifted the troublesome breastplate away. Her resting hand traced the outline of the fabric slowly to find the end of the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge said nothing, but the moans kept coming. She was radiating heat that clung to her clothes that escaped when they were peeled away. This time around, there was nothing to keep her insulated. As more of her suit was moved, so was the rabbit's body removed to make room. Only then did the temperature of the room show her how cool it really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Cream was fiddling, she unexpectedly hit a snag. She looked forward ahead with it came to taking off Rouge's boots, but she did not do the same with Rouge's gloves. Cream's worry was filling up but was short lived. After her earlier display, she decided to put on another show. While she still had her hands full, she had a different approach in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands rested around Rouge's right wrist and brought her arm up the her face. Her fingertips were an inch from her nose. Then, she insert the edge of the middle finger into her mouth and lightly bit the empty space as to not bite the finger. There was more resistance then there was with her boots, so she had to apply more pressure. As the tension built, Rouge could feel the glove squeeze around her hand. Soon the breaking point was reached and Cream's head jerked back while the glove hit her face. For a moment, Rouge could see her blush intensify through the blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that and some more unrolling, one arm was clear. Repetition continued again. She prepared to not be embarrassed as she pulled with her teeth. As she tugged, she took care to only increase the pressure little by little. Then she noticed a slight twitch in her mistress's hand. Easing up at the precise moment, the garment came off in one fluid moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArms free, it was time to completely free the bust that was restrained all day. Both hands rested on the sides of Rouge's boobs, she groped a bit focusing at the lower portion. Rouge gave more moans, but Cream gave cute groans. The laying bat wondered what the rabbit was doing as she continued to toy around the edges. When the motion switched to more circular ones, she got it. She was not only being pleasured from the start, but it was a performance as well. Now, she was pretending that Rouge's chest was a safe that she needed to crack before she could get the goods. One time uttering, \"Almost...\". Another time, \"I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream would love to linger there, but she needed to pick up the pace. Back at the starting position, her pinkies and ring fingers grabbed the soon to be discarded fabric. Tracing the outer limit of her chest with her index fingers, her thumbs met and dug into the valley in Rouge's cleavage. Cream supported a boob in each hand before pushing them up. Simultaneously, the hands brought the fabric down, finally breaking Rouge's chest out of its cage. \"Gotcha.\" Cream spoke softly. Rouge noted that not only was it done in a flash, but she even managed to unhook her bra as well. Her nipples were out for all to see. All except the blindfolded servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the remainder of the stripping, Cream hands were in the unitard. Caressing her again, but in reverse. Her hands deep when exposing her stomach. They spread when they went around her hips. They took care when snaking out Rouge short tail, only to explore her buttocks afterwards. Soon, she continued to where she started. She gave one final tug and the whole thing came off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was lying down with nothing but her unhooked bra and black-as-night panties. She smiled as she looked at her servant as she set the unitard neatly aside. Rouge knew from the start, and this act symbolized everything up to this point. A gentle touch. Despite her reprogramming to emulate Rouge, Cream still cared for those close to her. Now, she was the one on top of her list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bedroom, it was a technique best suited to create a sense of longing. But if it was anything like this show, it was also a way to make one hell of a tease. Rouge bit her lip as she mused over the results of the training. It was scary in its own way, but she wondered where the rabbit would lead her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge woke up in Vanilla's bed to find herself alone. Peeking out the window, the morning sun was illuminating the room. She was not much of a morning person, but the night prior made this day an exception. Though the rabbit only had a week's worth of training, she was skilled enough to keep Rouge entertained and satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was sure as she got out of bed. \"She passed, and I sure as hell am not going to let her go.\" The clothes that were littered around the room were now washed and folded on top of the dresser. \"Diligent. How early did she wake up?\" She questioned. Still, she admired the work ethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the set of clothes in hand, the bat headed into the master bathroom for a rinse. The water from the shower head drenched her awake. Its heat fogged up the mirror beside her. The pressure was delicate as it cascaded her from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly the sound of the water spraying and draining echoed inside the cramped room. Rouge wondered as she reflected. 'Darn, it reminds me of her body heat. I think she might have left more of an impression than I thought. Her mother was different the few times we did it, but Cream was playing in a different field. How? The both of us taught her, so why did she show that level of skill?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge tried to wrap her head around it and came to a simple solution. 'Vanilla must be learning too. She probably didn't know how to properly please me. She knows how to please a man, not a woman. While Cream's teaching cemented a foundation, Vanilla's must be conflicting with her experience.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat started as a quick soak adopted some light lathering of soap to her body. 'I can't fault her for that. She became a mother for a reason. I have felt that itch before too, many times. But I'm not pleased so easily. She'll relearn the basics of she has to. And once done, it better not be a repeat of what happened last night. I like variety.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge stopped putting on soap when she got to her arms. Giving it a small whiff, the smell reminded her of flowers. 'Umm...Not really my taste.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream showed real potential to Rouge, but she was a blank slate. Vanilla needed to be reworked. Rouge did not want her broken first, that would jeopardize her efficiency. It was more accurate to say that she wished her servant to be more enlightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water washed the soap down her legs and off her body. Turning the water off, Rouge stepped back into the steamed-up bathroom. Shivering due to the exposure, she wrapped herself in towel to dry up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the condensation of the mirror let up and the bat stared at her reflection. Reapplying her signature eye-shadow, she focused on her left ring finger, the new home of her powerful gem. 'There's more to it than I thought.' She continued. 'I thought it would be easy, and it really is, but there are still more defining details. I can changed them to become what I want them to be, but my wishes would only be fully answered if I, myself, put the work in. I can't rely on the ring to do everything.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished with her makeup, she got dressed from the pile that she brought with her. Donning her boots last, she belatedly wondered if she should have had the rabbits wash her in service. She sighed speaking aloud, \"I have to remember that I am not alone in this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exited the bedroom and walked through the short hallway when a warm scent filled her nose. 'Breakfast.' This wasn't the first time the Rabbit family catered for her. She enjoyed it. She could not figure out of it was due to their hospitality or their willingness to serve. Either way, she benefited from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the dining room, she saw Vanilla and Cream in the kitchen working for her without even a command. At a glance, she saw that they swapped their ages again, looking like sisters once more. Vanilla was the first to spot Rouge eyeing her and gave her a smile reminiscent of her mistress. \"Later.\" The bat mouthed. Vanilla nodded, missing what Rouge was planning for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat waited without a word as her breakfast was brought to her. It was a nice perk of waking up in the Rabbit's household, but she got to thinking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Rouge at one end of the table, she addressed to the mother and daughter on either side. \"I've decided.\" The expression on Vanilla and Cream tensed on the serious tone. \"The reason I started training Cream was because I wanted to see her potential. She had her share of adventures, sure, but jewel-swiping isn't exactly saving the world.\" Cream leaned in closer to hear the evaluation. \"The only thing stopping her now is real experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a positive assessment of her skills. All she had to do was prove herself even more. It was realistic in the sense that there was still tweaks that needed to be done, but it could not be any higher a mark. \"I will not disappoint you, Mistress.\" Cream bowed her head. Vanilla's lips curled into a smirk. Her daughter's accomplishments were her pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that,\" she continued, \"I think we need to move on with the next step.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next step?\" Cream questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress isn't satisfied with just us.\" Vanilla guessed but stated it as a fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. My first thought when I got the ring was to take it for a test run. I had a whole list of targets to choose from. But do either of you know why I picked you first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question caught the rabbits a little off-guard. They shared a glance at each other, only to see that the other one did not have a clear answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream started, \"W-was it because I could be easily manipulated? That once I would go under, there would be very little that I wouldn't think was wrong?\" Rouge slightly shook her head. Cream's answer was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Vanilla jumped in, \"Was it because we are practically alone? Since we live as a family in a house out of the way, no one would be suspicious?\" More shaking; another wrong answer. The response they gave were half thought out, but it was still surprising nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" The real answer hit them like a ton of bricks. \"It was because you two are the weakest. I had no evidence to believe that the ring would work, so I needed to test it on those who stand no real chance against me. Plus, if I did fail, I doubt that you'd go out of your way to tell everybody. Even then, my reputation might not have taken a hit. I'm not exactly in the 'good guys' camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla grimaced at the truth, but not as much as Cream. She thought she was improving, that she was on Rouge's good side. She took in everything that was taught to her and got praised for it. But Rouge's interest was not based on her as an individual, but rather was based on a fundamental premise. The strong will dominate the weak. It would not help to think that it was easy for her. She managed to scoop them up after only revealing her first card. They were already at her mercy once she had made up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been normal to be mortified and feel helpless, but Cream did not feel that way. If anything, she felt more determined. She belonged to her mistress now, so she couldn't be dragging her heels. She was weak? Then she will change that. She reaffirmed her mission once again. To be her best for Rouge's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now I'm certain. I have put off getting new members for too long.\" Rouge rested her elbow on the table and her cheek in her palm. Taking a short sip of her much-needed coffee, Rouge confessed, \"I just don't know who yet. The ring is powerful, so I could probably get anyone. But now, I don't any order in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever they are, we will help.\" Cream pledged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother agreed. \"We'll serve you to make your life better and easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was silent for the moment. She returned to her breakfast, followed by her servants. Finishing her hot breakfast first, Rouge's eyes started to roam until she spied the age machine at the edge of the table. She gave an internal chuckle as it was resting on top of a clean folded washcloth like a precious treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the rabbits, she again noticed their twin-like appearance. There was nothing wrong with it, but she remembered her thoughts while in the shower. Vanilla's reeducation. The mother was already in an appropriate body for the night, and she wanted to keep that. If she returned Cream to her normal age, the young rabbit would know not to expect something tonight. Really, Rouge's may reasoning was 'I will do it just because I want to.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up from her seat and grabbed the device and pointed it at Cream. Everyone knew what to expect and waited for the flash of light. But it never came. \"What the...?\" Rouge tried again only to end up with the same result. She could not tell what was wrong, but one thing was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream spelled it out. \"Is it broken? If it is, then Mom and I are stuck like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla pointed out something else. \"No one else knows about this. If we run into someone we know, the secret will be out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure about that.\" Rouge gave her input. \"You could just say you're cousins or something, but that won't last long.\" Rouge kept a level head as she inspected the device closely. She might not know what is immediately wrong with it, but she had an idea. \"You know what? ...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It made the most sense in her mind. No one but Tails knew how it worked, so she will find someone else who could find out. They would need to spend time, maybe even up to weeks, to understand, restore, and even replicate it. On top of that, her new slave could create new items that might surpass it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla asked the obvious question, \"Wouldn't it be easiest to go after Tails? He'll be able to fix it instantly. And Cream broke in before, so catching him off-guard should not be a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am interested in catching him, but not now.\" Rouge confessed. \"He and the rest of his group will definitely try to stop us once they find out what we're up to. So we'll take them before that happens. My plan would be unstoppable once I can corrupt 'the heroes'. But I want it to go off without a hitch. We are going to need more people first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge had a quest in mind. Now she needed to form her party before getting her prize. A group of loyal servants answering her beck and call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she was following the immediate problem of the device in her hand. \"I need someone other than Tails to fix this. They...\" Rouge finally caught herself, \"Let's be honest, 'she' would fill our ranks and can widen our arsenal. It's two birds with one stone.\" The bat fiddled with the device before she grinned. \"In fact, I think we should do a little bird-watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge asked Cream a question to jog her memory. \"Cream. Do you remember Wave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she heard the name, Cream knew what Rouge had her eyes set on. \"Yes, I remember. Wave the Swallow. She makes and races with Extreme Gears. And she's part of the Babylon Rogues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. While she's skilled in designing the Gears, there must be more in that head of hers. On top of that, she's already a thief. It's damn near perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla placed a finger to her lip. \"But she's in a group, right? Won't we be facing the same problem as we would getting Tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not exactly wrong. The difference is numbers. There are three of them, unlike the several Sonic has. If we take her first before the others figure it out, it would just take persuading at that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they might be at Babylon Gardens or on a heist. Distance is not a problem, but finding them is.\" Rouge nodded at Vanilla's words and clicked her tongue in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...It says Wave would be at the new sand track at the beach two hours from here.\" The two more mature women stared at Cream when she finished. In just a few questions, she found a site promoting Wave's visit on her mom's phone. \"As far as this says, the others might not be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanilla shot a glance to the ground. \"I swear she's better at using that thing than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge grinned again. She knew she was not going to pass up this golden opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were few places or situations where Rouge would feel under-prepared. The beach was not one such place. By most standards, she had everything a woman would need to flaunt. Chest, hips, or butt, she was decked in almost all the essentials. Despite her impressive kicking power, there was not that much to look at when it to her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would not be the case if someone got too handsy though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, she dressed for the hot day ahead. She would have like to tease the populace with a perfect bikini, but she accounted for what might happen. Her usual Extreme Gear was carried under her arm. She figured that the trip would lead her into a race with and for her intended prize. For that reason, she chose a mini sarong that would conceal the goods, allowing an acceptable amount of modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, a crowd formed around a stage that was erected for the day. It did not take a genius to guess that that was where the main attraction was. In the far section of the crowd were the two Rabbits. Cream wore a pink tankini, still hesitant to show more of her body to anyone other her mom or Rouge. Vanilla was more bold with a striped bandeau. Apparently, Vanilla keeping her old swimsuits in the name of 'wishful thinking' came in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Showtime!' Rouge moved to the group of people, planning to cause a stir. The closer she got, the image of an unsuspecting Wave in a fold-up chair became clearer. The professional but bored look on her face made Rouge smile. 'Don't worry, things will get interesting.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed by her up-and-coming agents before cutting through the crowd. Taking one final look, she examined the chao in their arms. Cheese with Cream and Chocola with Vanilla. Despite the time she was with them, she never used the ring on them. She was not sure what would really happen to them. Luckily for her, she did not need to. They do not question what their caretakers tell them. Cheese was used on the day of Cream's heist while its twin 'guarded the house'. They were servants by proxy, but they were not chaining her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplete with the chao, the women looked like ordinary fans. They spotted their mistress and conveyed they were ready as covertly as they could. Their mission was to wait. If something were to go wrong, they were the secret group hidden under everyone's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words coming from the announcer sounded like gibberish as Rouge was bent on making a show of her own. Using the ring in front of all these people was not an option. She need to isolate Wave to avoid suspicion. It was unfortunate that the best chance she had was to get in front of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave was scoping the new sandy track when there was a divide cutting through the audience. When it faced the front, her face changed. One of her rivals stood in plain view, with an Extreme Gear no less. There was only one way to interpret that. \"Oh please!\" She got up from her position and walked to the edge of the stage, directly facing Rouge underneath her. \"You seriously think that you can just walk up here and challenge me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smirked as she internally thought, 'I swear that would be the last time you'll will look down on me.' Her smile was natural but massively misinterpreted. She shrugged and spoke to the bird on the platform, loud enough for people to hear. \"That's not going to be a problem, right? I doubt that you would want to pass up this opportunity to race. Of course, it would be very upsetting to you when I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe verbal challenge added drama to the situation. The audience got excited and would not want Wave to back off now. In all honesty, Wave did not care. Everyone here was just starstruck, hoping to see a 'cool' performance. They most likely would not understand a quarter of the things happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words still had an effect on her though. Rouge was pretty presumptuous and arrogant, striking at the swallow's pride. Wave laughs in equal arrogance. \"And how do you plan to do that? I bet you put that Gear of yours into a storage shed after your last race. Really...\" Wave kicked her board up to showoff, \"While yours was laying around, I kept fine-tuning mine. There's no way you can compete against me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shall see about that, shall we?\" Rouge further provoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save yourself from the embarrassment.\" Wave retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she had everyone's attention, she jumped onto the stage to reach eye level. \"I didn't hear a 'no'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you asking for the taste of defeat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge did not say anything. She was sure that she did not need to say anything more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Extreme Gear specialist scoffed at her opponent, \"Fine,...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was completely in her hands now. Her provocation proved effective in securing a race. All that mattered at this point was in her execution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"So are we just going to wait for this little thing to finish, or can we just skip to the good part?\" She waved her hand around to emphasize the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave shrugged. \"Fine by me. The rest of this would be boring anyways.\" The rumblings of the staff working the venue that were excited by the turn of events turned sour. The athlete looked at the crew with a fair amount of disinterest. \"If you really wanted me to stay, you wouldn't have pay me upfront. I only came here to protect my reputation, but this woman would damage it more than you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge would not have believe that Wave would have been so open to the staff. She would have guessed that they would put a stop to this. She would not have bet on the power of the people to carry this through. It would not cross her mind that they would fold without setting things straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she did not see everything transpire, she would be shocked. The main attraction of the event led to a line-up of Rouge and Wave alone on the starting line. In the time everything was set up, Rouge had memorized the track's overhead map. With it fresh in her mind, she had formulated her plan. She whispered to Wave right beside her, \"Just to let you know, I'll get what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swallow snorted. \"Well, don't expect it to be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike clockwork, the countdown began after the last word. Each number fulfilled its purpose, adding tension and suspense to the upcoming race. With zero substituted with a 'Go!', the two burst through the line, speeding at a rate the Blue Blur had to compliment. The air rushing past the racers kicked up sand, creating the illusion that they were surfing on the beach itself. As they take a turn, their after-trail changed from sand to water. In most races, eyes would be glued to those in the front of the pack. However, when there were only two, there was a certain appeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany paid attention to Rouge in second place. The one who seemed so adamant to start a race was tailing behind. She would not lie to herself. She knew Wave did this for practically her whole life. Yet, winning was not her goal. She only needed to keep up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer objective was closing in on them. A massive jagged stone jetted out of the water. From the perspective of the people on the beach, it was a natural blind spot. Even if the spectators spread across the length of the shore, it would be too far away to see tiny detail clearly, if at all. It was the ideal place for Rouge to launch the trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was a distance away, there was a way to close the gap. Every course had shortcuts for racers specializing in speed, power, and in her case, flying. Both were able to use it, but Wave refrained from doing so due to her pride. Rouge had not used them up to that point to avoid giving her prey an excuse to flee. It was all for this moment. She was going to catch her by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tech in her gear revved even harder. The board recalibrated to stabilize its balance in the air once Rouge was truly airborne. The air brushing past her body changed direction and increased in speed. She crouched down to limit the air resistance and spread her wings for the thrill of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lead, Wave had a bad feeling. She shot a glance behind her to find that she was alone. \"That's how it is?\" It was too late to change course. She readies her combat spanner for when Rouge reentered the track. It did not go as she planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge had to come back, but she took a different path. As soon as the view from the shore was obstructed, she made her move. Wave saw the bat leave the flight path early, charging directly at her. She was shocked. Rouge could clearly see the weapon in her hand and did not wield her own. Forget rookie mistakes, it was a fatal one. The more puzzling part was her absolute confidence. She was posing with a bent knee and a hand with a prominent ring pointed at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was baffling to her. Was this woman an idiot? It was not immediately apparent to her. She gave a moments pause. A pause Rouge utilized. She played a game of chicken until she thought she could not get any closer and aimed the ring in Wave's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith them still moving at top speeds, Rouge was not sure if there was an effect. She could still hear and be heard though, so she give a command dressed as a question. \"Now, how about throwing the win for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave told Rouge...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rouge was now the one left off-guard. Wave called her 'Mistress' so the ring had an effect. Despite that, she was not immediately loyal. Maybe if she showed her the ring again, she could cement the submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat would not come as Rouge was met with the end of Wave's oversized spanner and spun out. For as bad as it looked, Rouge was relatively fine. By the time she managed to right herself, Wave further expanded her lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge gritted her teeth in fury. The viewers did not see the blow she just took, so she was spared that humiliation. The optics afterward were still confusing to the uninformed. One second, she took a shortcut. The next, the distance between the racers increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat's mind shifted focus. She achieved what she planned to do, but it was not to her expectations. Now she was stuck in a competition that she did not want to win in the first place. Her anger clouded her judgement. Now she needed to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not matter to her how petty the means were. She would take the shortcuts available to recover her positioning. Wave would constantly glance over her shoulder to watch Rouge gaining on her. When it came close for the first time, she took a sharp turn to a flight path. Now the distance was maintained evenly with Wave granting no chance for Rouge to catch the drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis process continued for the next minute before it was a straight shot to the finish line. Rouge knew there was no way she could catch up anymore. That did not meant she fully accepted it though. Predictably, Wave crossed the line first to thunderous applause. At her earliest convenience, Wave kicked her Gear up and gave a silent gloating smile. She held the look until she blew a seductive wink and kiss at her mistress. It infuriated Rouge is the effects of the ring gave Wave a double-edge sword. It gave her more appeal but also bolstered pride and cockiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge wanted to confront the swallow, but the latter was swarmed by the people. In many cases, Rouge would regard them as random nobodies. They were sheep that mindlessly turned the events into Rouge's favor to stage the race. As far as she was concerned, they would disappear from her life by the end of the day. Alas, she knew she wanted to keep the ring and its magic a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe mulled over what she wanted to do next. With Rouge standing where she was, the promoter brought Wave back onto the stage. His exaggerated hype was dulling Rouge's ears, further adding to her heightened agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Did anybody else see that?\" He paused for the audience's cheer. \"Good, I thought I was the only one.\" He joked while the uproar drowned out the lame remark. The promoter clears his throat, \"But seriously, this has been a great day to launch off the debut of the track. Miss Wave, your thoughts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave saw Rouge looking down with her hand on her chin. She was not looking at her, but she knew that she was listening. \"Taking the course into account, it's...rather decent. That is if you are looking for a beginner course.\" The cheers died down at the critique. \"Just look at it seriously. It just screams 'a walk on the beach'. I raced on tracks with obstacles like waterfalls, deep pits, and falling debris. This is not a track for professionals like myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeginner. Walk on the beach. Rouge heard the belittling words and so did everyone else. Once everyone noticed Rouge, they noticed the shade that was being thrown at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe promoter gave his own two cents. \"Yes. And even after your opponent called you out, she was no match against you. Even with a track that would not provide much a challenge to her.\" Rouge made another note to find out where the promoter lived. \"With that being said, I think I speak for many of us when I say that it was close almost the entire race through. If it was a beginner's course, shouldn't you have done better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Wave snapped at the insult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost everyone was taken by surprise yet again. Was he going to be the next one to pick a fight with her? Was he standing up for Rouge? In reality, as a promoter, protecting his client was an act of job security. \"If the course is as bad as you are making it out to be, perhaps you could have finished it faster, while adding more flair. I mean, these are supposed to filled with intense drifting, close range melee, and the trinity of shortcuts and bypasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave interrupted him before he could finish his full thought. \"Look here! One, this course is subpar compared to other ones. Two, I was only racing against one other person, so of course there wouldn't be a lot of action. And three, neither of us took it seriously. Have you noticed that we didn't use those shortcuts for the first half of the race? I didn't need to show off on a mediocre sandbar like this and neither did she.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something Rouge did not expect. Wave was defending her on the stage. Was that the power of the ring coming through, or was it her natural pride?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I got paid, and I raced. As I see it, I did what you asked me to.\" Without another word, she stepped off the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the moments where Wave was telling the promoter off, Rouge slipped under everyone's noses and passed by Vanilla and Cream. She told them only what was necessary. \"The ring had an effect, but not completely. She still managed to disobey me. Follow her. Take her to Club Rouge. I have something in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish./We got it.\" Vanilla and Cream gave affirmative answers as Rouge kept walking. Looking at their target, they sighed as the crowd did not disappear from her. That was something they will have to deal with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge came to the conclusion that reprogramming Wave is going to be different than with the rabbits. In a sense, they always seemed that they were living in 'easy mode'. On the other hand, Wave's pride was going to give her some resistance. The solution seemed simple enough. While she led the rabbits with carrots, she will have to give the bird the stick.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The purple swallow had came to moments ago. Still, she could not change her current situation. It was dark. She could feel a blindfold over her eyes, obstructing her view. However, she could not remove it as her wrists and ankles were bound, keeping her spread eagle. She would have some preparations in such situations, but she knew that it would be impossible this time around. She was stripped of every article of clothing. The warm air brushed against her nude body, emphasizing her nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew she was in trouble. Other than posting guards, her captor went all out. Her mind spun when she first woke up, but it had reduced and she can think more clearly. Based on her past actions, she did not bother to ask 'who would want to do this to her?'. Rather, it was more of 'who can do this to her?' That only narrowed the field so much, but it helped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing she remembered was being on the beach, beating Rouge in a race, and meeting up with a crowd of fans. Notably, she met two rabbit Mobian sisters. They were pretty sexy she had to admit. It seemed to be a case of beach babes fawning over her for her dissatisfying victory. They were just two groupies with two pet Chao in tow. They were insistent, but their sweetness was so overpowering that she let them stick around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest was still too fuzzy to recall. Thinking of the optics, she worried that she did something stupid. Did she get drunk with them and passed out? Did she say no to the wrong guy at the bar? She did not feel hungover, so she doubted these. Then she wondered if those girls did this. Their looks could be deceiving, but they still do not seem to be the type to orchestrate something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey might have a boss to do this on their command. Her mind remained silent until a new thought arose. Before that day, the Babylon Rogues were her group and home. Jet the Hawk did not exactly have the qualities of a leader she wanted him to have, but there was not much argument that they were following him. Despite that, her mindset changed after...no, during the race. Rouge had taken that spot in her mind, with less hesitation. It gave her a sense of mental security, but the fact that she betrayed her did not escape her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it dawned on her. She could not remember why, but she was following Rouge now. She was given a command, but she ignored it. \"Rouge!\" She shouted into the air. \"Are you the one who did this?\" The silence resumed after the outburst. \"W-was it not her?\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the room opened with the sound of heeled shoes crossing the floor. As the footsteps got closer, Wave was washed with fear and dread. The bat stood over the swallow, her breathing audible to the latter. \"I've been waiting for a while. You only just now figured it out? I expected more.\" Rouge's voice confirmed her suspicions. \"Of course, we have business to attend to.\" The same voice had turned stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stunt you pulled yesterday really pissed me off, Wave. I know now that you were under my control, but I wouldn't have it to have my slaves...\" Rouge reached for the ropes that bonded Wave's wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Disobey!\" With a tug, the rope fastened more tightly on the trapped bird. The bindings dug into her skin and strained her arms. Wave stifled a scream, leaving only a pained groan. The tension eased for a moment, but Wave knew it was not over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betray!\" Wave did not hear Rouge move, but the bat was now pulling at the ankle-bound ropes. Her pain resulted in a more audible scream. With the subsequent easing, Wave guessed what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And humiliate me!\" The swallow guessed wrong. Rather than having all limbs pulled at once, only her right arm and left ankle were tugged. Unlike before, the awkward diagonal restraints threatened to pull her joints out of their sockets. Use of those limbs was impossible, but she reflexively tensed her remaining two. Flexing her arm and leg did nothing to stop the pain, rather contributing to the damage. Still, despite knowing that she was causing this pain to herself, she could not relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ropes lax for no more than an inch, but it was enough. A brief moment of stillness allowed her to recoil, but was shy from completely dispelling the pain. The sensation was still lingering in her wrists and ankles with stiffness in her shoulders and waist. Wave could feel the pulse of her blood pumping as she regain circulation. That was one issue dealt with. She was not spared of her lack of freedom and movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took a chance to get you, and it didn't go exactly how I wanted. I hate it when I lose after making a bet. I am not letting this chance slip away.\" Her voice appeared from the other side of the torture device. In the gaps of silence and recovery, it seemed that Rouge was standing somewhere else. She was light as the wind, if not the very air in the room. Was this her level of stealth? Were the first few footsteps only there to draw fear?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Please...\" Wave spoke her first words directly to her face. At least, where it was last. \"I-I need to know. You did something during the race. What was it? Why does it feel like you stand out more in my mind? Why am regarding you as my mistress?\" Wave spoke in fear-induced desperation. She hated not knowing something that was bugging her and now it was in her own mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was ticked that her monologue was interrupted. \"Let me make this perfectly clear.\" The new location Wave heard the voice was directly above her. \"I 'am' your mistress and you are to address me as such. You are my slave which means you belong to me. I say whether or not you have any meaning or worth. And these are the consequences of your actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four ropes were pulled simultaneously, shocking her that her prediction came late. She felt as though she was to be split down the middle of her abdomen. Any chance that her eyes were not filled with tears were now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\" Rouge removed her grips from Wave's bindings. \"This is not all I planned to do.\" The sound of heels echoed throughout the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought about what kind of punishment I could give you. Just basic torture wasn't going to cut it. But your body...I kept my mind on that. A way to remind you of who's in charge. I just needed to create an image with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge pulled the blindfold from Wave's eyes. Being unconscious and robbed of light, it did not take long for her eyes to adjust to the dark lit room. They had immediate focus at Rouge's hand and towards what it was reaching for...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the tables in view held a single oblong item on top of it. A shade of pink peeked through the darkness. Its shape resembled a heart and had a tiny leaf on a stem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge scooped up the heart and put it in front of Wave's face. \"Do you know what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some kind of fruit?\" Wave stated her question as an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Of course, this one is special.\" Rouge withdrew the fruit from Wave's vision. \"This is a Heart Fruit. It jumpstarts a chao's mating season. Apparently, there is a Lifenut that does the same thing, but this was far easier to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave flushed at a single word. \"Wait! Mating?!\" She tried bucking upwards but was denied due to her confinement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge adopted a predatory smile as her captive realized what was implied. \"I said I was going to use your body. More accurately, you're going to pay with your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of her fingers, a brown chao flew out from the hiding spot he was silently in. One of the two that she seen earlier with those sisters. Rouge casually tossed Chocola the fruit who eagerly caught it. The Extreme Gear specialist watched in horror as the innocent and naive creature chomped away. The bits of the fruit disappearing from the main body served as a countdown to the main event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing his food, Chocola burped and gave off a flowery aura. Naturally, he was seeking another chao who was nearby. Rouge was hit with a spark of annoyance. Even if she made the final push to use the ring on him and his brother, more complicated instructions still needed to be spelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge placed a finger on Wave's exposed midsection. \"You can nuzzle up here, cutie.\" Chocola looked Wave in the eyes. Wave wanted the chao to do anything else other than follow that order. Alas, Chocola was oblivious to her pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocola smiled as a heart appeared on his head. He slowly fluttered through the air, moving in a motion similar to skipping. Wave saw the disaster coming with no way to stop it. \"P-Please Mistress! You don't have to do this, right?!\" Tears of worry and fear mixed with the previous ones of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge said nothing.\"I-I promise never to betray again! And I'll give you anything of mine that you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be doing that anyway.\" Rouge stated coldly as Chocola placed his hand on Wave's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is my punishment?! Force pregnancy?! T-That's rape! It has to be rape!\" Wave barked in a attempt to force morality on her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sighed, \"You call this rape?\" The chao started to rub his face against Wave's skin. Wave tensed at the invasion of personal space. \"It may not seem like it, but that's how they do it. It's supposed to be nose-to-nose, but...\" Rouge's face was dead serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave tried to shake off her attacker, but it only ended up hurting herself. She could only move even less due to the extra weight of the chao pinning her middle. The violent shaking took a toll on her body as her energy flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Chocola was rubbing her was ticklish. Her body squirmed at the weird sensation. His soft chubby hands gripped tightly as he dug in deep. She could feel her skin move along with his face. \"T-this feels...weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge watched from behind Chocola. Her face contorted into a scowl more befitting of her dark partner. Wave accepted what was happening, but she was making light of it. She figured that the excessive face-rubbing would not result in a baby. Honestly, Rouge knew this too. It would not do to give Wave some time to recollect her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think this is it?\" Rouge's voice added a hint of harshness. \"You think that I was going to lock you up for one day? That there isn't anything else I could do to you? I'm going to get the results I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave, while still under the ring's effect, protected her sense of self. Rouge showed a crack in her demeanor and she was going to poke at it. \"So what? I didn't break, so you're going to do the next thing until I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge had a plan, so she was able to avoid biting the bait. \"No. First was this. Then I'll force a egg into your womb. You would be incubating it, but you'll be left with the appearance of a pregnant woman. And with the added weight...\" Rouge gave a titter laugh before resuming. \"It would be impossible to ignore. And anytime you look down at yourself, anytime you have trouble standing up, you'll remember why this happened. You turned on me. You will never make that mistake again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hopelessness renewed, Wave winced at the chao that was still on her. Forced pregnancy or incubation? Both had there own problems, but one was worse in Wave's view. \"Isn't that going a bit too far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge waved it off without concern. \"I don't see a problem with it. You're a bird and birds lay eggs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swallow would have deadpanned in most other circumstances, but continued to inform Rouge. \"Bird Mobians don't lay eggs. Why would we have mammal parts like boobs if we did?\" The bat did not admit it, but she always wondered about that. \"And why does it have to be a chao egg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you had a normal baby, that would take too long. Chao eggs hatch quickly. The idea was that you were 'impregnated' by a chao from start to finish.\" Rouge purposefully left out the part that she found 'giving birth' to a chao to be demoralizing. For the best effect, there was to be no gap in the process. There can be no room for her to deny that it was not 'hers'. \"Once this cutie had his fill, we are going to deal with the next part. Though to be honest, I've never seen them do it for this long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocola was in a constant state of face rubbing. There was something on Rouge's mind that she could not shake off. The adorable chao during their mating season always did an equally cute, soft eskimo kiss. Chocola instead was in his own world, furiously nuzzling Wave's bare stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, before their eyes, Wave's midsection started to swell. Her eyes watered and she took pained breaths. Chocola removed himself, revealing what was going on. What looked to be a bubble grew in the matter of seconds. It began from where the womb was and climbed towards the torso. Once it grew length, it gained more width, inching to her sides. Then it extended from her body, poking higher off the table than her beak was. When the event settled down, two Mobians stared gobsmacked at what occurred while a floating chao danced in celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge's train of thought derailed. Something that seemed to have been impossible appeared in front of her. There might have been run-ins that defied her common sense, but this was exceptional. A rule of nature must have been broken. If not, they have learned something that they probably should have never known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...\" Wave wept at the development. \"D-does this mean-n-n...\" Her voice was stuttering and was left shaking at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge came to her senses at her captive's nearly broken words. Her throat was cleared as she hastily came up with something. \"That...that saves a few steps.\" Unconsciously, Rouge placed her hand on the extended belly. It was soft and warm to the touch. She thought that the egg must be inside her, but when she poked her finger in a bit, it was not hard. Whatever was inside Wave reacted to her touch, startling Rouge and making the 'mother' gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is it a chao? Or a Mobian? A half breed maybe? How would that even work?' Rouge could not help but mentally ask questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carrier laying on the table was reasonably silent. Her mind was busy too, but not in the same way as her mistress's. She was only awake for a short time in the secret room. Rouge robbed her of her vision and mobility and ignored her voice. She completely destroyed the sense of superiority Wave harbored against her. Her body was changed on Rouge's very whim. The trapped bird could not recall the words about forcing an egg into her womb; it was unnecessary. There was a new lifeform inside of her. Whether she was a carrier or a mother, it was harder to escape from than the ropes that tied her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no real options, now and in hindsight. Despite this, she tried to act out. Every time she did and anyway she did it, it would immediately backfire. She could never change the course and only ended up getting hurt. Her waist and ankles were likely marked and bruised after her futile pulling. It was hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly through acceptance did the pain subside. In fact, Chocola's touch was oddly pleasant. The swelling did have the side-effect of making her skin more sensitive, not to mention the shortness of breath and extra weight. With Rouge's hand, her sensitivity seemed acute. Her palm on her exposed body was soothing. Is it something that she could experience if Rouge was not 'forced' to discipline her? \"M-mistress...A-Are we done? Can I be...released now? Please...?\" Wave wished for freedom, and only Rouge could grant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mistress heard it in her servant's voice. The prideful Wave was begging for mercy. Seeing as her plan was done, she answered her wish. She did not have any more plans and the goal was to have Wave serve her soon anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleased, Wave sat up as quickly as her protruding stomach allowed and hung her head. \"Mistress, there is nothing else to say other than I was wrong. I was a fool to disobey and betray you. I am forevermore yours to command, to control.\" The first thing Wave did once she was free was apologize. Not rub the pain away from her joints, but to devote herself fully to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge looked at Wave's hanging head and then her middle. She finally secured the mechanic she wanted, but at a cost that she herself brought onto her. Her plans went through, but not exactly as she had hoped. Was it possible that the bat felt some sense of remorse or guilt for what she caused?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a line when it came to having power over others. One could treat those under them like dirt and rule with an iron fist of oppression. They would become synonymous with fear, but some chose to fight back against that fear just for peace of mind. Otherwise, the leader could respond with care. They would be loved and many would want to protect the order. This had the real possibility to make the subject complacent and easily manipulated by others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, any competent leader would find a balance that they were comfortable with. Rouge was someone who loved to covet, but she also wanted rational living beings and not mindless machines. The ring promised loyalty, so she thought she was good. The incident during the race showed her otherwise. She needed a firm hand to maintain control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, she was more certain of something she already knew. She was responsible for anything her girls were subjected to. She would have to reap her losses as well as the benefits, even accidents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge would have to make it up to Wave for this oversight, if for her own sense of mind. That would not come freely for the new recruit though. Rouge lift the bird's head and presented her ring to her face. Wave only blinked before she got the message. She gently guided her mouth towards the ring and kissed it as if she was drinking the nectar of the gods. Again, Rouge found this form of submission enjoyable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I expect great things from everyone, including you. There will be rewards for the best outcomes, but slight hiccups will be punished.\" Wave nodded in obedience. While she hoped to get onto Rouge's good side, her powerless lingered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was certain of the bird's loyalty and wanted her to get to work. Her first thought was to give her time to rest, but she was sleeping up until about ten minutes ago. Her primary job was to be a specialist mechanic and engineer, so Rouge figured she will only work behind a desk if necessary. She was probably well-suited to pull all-nighters too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you want heaven instead of hell...\" Rouge continued, \"I suggest you get to work immediately. It was a hassle to do it on short notice, but we renovated a room at Club Rouge to be a workshop. It couldn't be too fancy, and it's not big. But it's perfect for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocola showed up again in front of the wincing Wave. In his hands was the disrepaired ray gun. Wave uneasily took hold of this device. She studied the exterior of the device, finding 'Age changer' on the side. \"Very conspicuous.\" Wave regained a sense of her behavior. \"So, now I just need to find out how to make it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mistress explained, \"Oh, it works. We stole it from Tails but it stopped working. We need you to fix it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really my expertise, but if Foxy thinks he could step on my turf.\" Name dropping Tails seemed to be a good decision on Rouge's part. There was a glimmer in Wave's eyes. \"If I may, Mistress, I could revamp it after making it work again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that you can get it working again.\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am positive. I place it on my pride; the pride of serving you.\" The reverse engineer vowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then show me.\" She finally gave a full command to her newest slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mistress.\" Wave paused after acknowledging. \"Fair note, it might take some time. Borderline reality altering technology is going to take a while to understand.\" She pivoted on the table and stepped onto the floor. A sharp gasp escaped her lips as the uncomfortable bump lost it support and weighed on her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was going to be a problem. \"I'll help you to the workshop.\" Rouge offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocola chirped to offer his help too. Wave's expression froze. \"No! Not you!\" She nearly screamed as she picked up the pace. Chocola was stunned by the sudden treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were many people employed at Club Rouge, but this section was only for VIPs. This kept things secret from the staff that she hadn't hypnotized yet. Plus, if this much work was required for one person, it was a decent decision not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the group left the room, they met the Rabbits lounging in the hall. It took Wave a hot minute to recognize the groupies as her partners in crimes while the mother and daughter were shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...? I thought...?\" Cream was confused about the series of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've waited before taking her measurements.\" Vanilla was going to have to change the patterns for the new uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Rouge remembered before turning to Vanilla. \"Cancel the order on the chao egg. We...won't...need it anymore.\" Treasure hunter Rouge might have riches, but the order was in Vanilla's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---The sun rose twice when Cream told Rouge what was on her mind. \"It didn't work on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge was shocked. The still grown Cream brought up the incident with the Overmind. When Sonic's team went up against the three Voxai, most of his team got brainwashed. Even Rouge vaguely remembered that she could not go against them. Cream on the other hand avoided it completely. \"Then how did the ring get you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCream did not know the answer. She could only give her best guess. \"It probably works differently or maybe it's stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it's that one.\" Rouge realised that the ring's power had some weaknesses. 'Still, to be able to capture someone who was immune?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress, everything has been going fine now, but I'm worried. What would happen if the ring doesn't work. What if it stops working.\" Cream was still under the Rouge's acquired power, but her free will did see her favorably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Rouge looked at Cream in the eye. \"You can't put all the hope into the ring. The ring isn't what gives the commands. I am. So what if it stops working like the age machine?\" She could sense that that was where the source of uncertainty came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...What if som...\" Cream tried to continue only to be cutoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any situation in your 'what ifs' where you will betray me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes...\" It was not from a place of dissatifaction, but of concern. \"W-what if something comes along that is stronger than the ring. Something thats c-captures you. I-I don't want to serve under someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea was not unfounded. She strived for perfection, but such a thing did not exist. \"Could there be a counter?\" Rouge spoke under her voice. She even thought about how she got the ring. Why was it in a ruin alone? Why was a powerful artifact left unguarded?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Vanilla found the two of them talking. \"Mistress, the device is done. Wave is in the workshop waiting for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother surprise to Rouge. It was only two days. \"Great!\" It was to be the first of many new things to come for their arsenal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went straight to the workshop to find the bulging-bellied Wave leaning back in her chair. It was Rouge's first time seeing the chair, but it was reminiscent of Extreme Gear as it was floating off the ground. 'She built the chair and repaired the gun in two days?' She questioned in her head. 'Irrelevant...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave noticed Rouge eyeing the chair. \"Sorry for the wait, Mistress. My body still isn't used to this.\" There was no need to redirect their attention to her stomach, but she did anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge asked before getting to the point, \"What was wrong with the gun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inventor summarized her answer as best as she could without leaving anything that might be important. \"Tails must have designed it to be a prototype build. Even if the circuitry didn't short out, the limited power supply meant it never was supposed to last long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bat nodded her head. It was a satisfactory conclusion. The rather rustic look would support planned obsolescence<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the energy source for it?\" Vanilla asked as she could not think of something that can affect someone's age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave gave a uncomfortable look. \"Uhh...It would get messy if I explained it.\" She would not care to elaborate on that topic further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rest was easy to figure out. Improved wiring, replaceable power source, decrypting code in the software.\" Her chair turned to her workbench and she grabbed the product of her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alhaya. Ancient Babylonian for 'life'.\" She introduced the new and improved aging machine. It kept the ray gun shape but was altered to have a longer focusing barrel and expanded back for the unnamed power source. It was two toned with strong dark grey on the handle and a light purple that faded the closer it got to the muzzle. More impressively, the display was reoutfitted with advance options and touch screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave pointed the different functions available. \"And this one here can revert someone to their original age, though I am not sure if it would work on someone who's age changed by something other than this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A reset button.\" Rouge stated plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Wave confirmed. There was no hesitation and no command. Rouge aimed Alhaya at the Rabbits and fired. The same lights went off as before and the family image was restored once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge smirked. One blast brought both back to their rightful ages. \"You did good, Wave. Real good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWave adopted her Mistress smirk. It was rewarding to receive praise after a job. \"My pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge felt assured in her ability to act now. The Rabbits can keep appearances and Wave could work behind the scenes for the time being. Still, she wanted more. She needed to fill her ranks even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Rouge was abruptly reminded that the universe would not have everything go her way. With everyone in one spot, a single phone rang out, silencing everyone. Whose phone was ringing now of all times?</span></div></div>",

His intelligence is unparalleled, and he's not a bad fighter either. He'd make a fine addition to the team, and with this, we can make him look the part too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course!\" Cream grinned. \"Not only can we take this thing, but with him... or her... on our side, she'll happily give us access to everything else! Vehicles, weapons, and, of course, his Emerald.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Rouge nodded. \"So, rather than going home, let's wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thieving duo stepped inside, Cream closing the garage door behind her. They headed through the building, and hid themselves in the living room,ready to attack the moment he came through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before they heard the sound of a propeller, followed by the Tornado making a steady landing. It rolled into the garage, and went silent.</span></div></div>",

You likely were planning on using that device on me and other males and starting an army of theifs...interesting thought Rouge. Would've worked on me before I built a device that changes a person's morality which I planned to use on Eggman so the world could find peace however I accidentally used it on myself and since then I haven't felt better in my life so I quickly destroyed the machine before someone could make me a hero again and was about to start a harem with the biggest threat as the first member, I made the sex changer so I could have a female Sonic but this ring will make recruitment much easier than these collars once I figure out how to use it. Thank you for your contribution Rouge and you'll join my harem momentarily.\" Once finished Tails would then put the ring on and suddenly gained the knowledge of it similar to how Rouge did.

Fiona get good and wet for me, i'll enjoy you in a moment.\" the two vixens eagerly complied. Melody sitting with her legs wide on the edge of the sofa. Fiona stripped out of her clothes and began to caress her pussy with one hand while groping herself with the other. after undressing Mina grabbed a cushion and knelt down in front of Melody's virgin pussy. \"pay attention you'll need to know how to please me later.\" Mina said to the vixen eating her out. The mongooses tongue trailed up her slaves sex eliciting a low moan from the vixen. Mina trailed her tongue through the virginal folds of Melody's pussy pausing at the top to coax the vixens clit into view. The songstress pushed her tongue deep into her pets tunnel hearing her gasp with pleasure. behind the pair Fiona now stood bow legged as she fingered herself watching her mistress work with a lustful gaze. Mina's skill at cunnilingus soon brought the Melody to her first female orgasm. The yellow vixen gave strangled cry as she pleasure blanked her mind. Mina arose and sat beside the yellow vixen before beckoning Fiona over. The red fox licked her lips as she looked at how excited her mistress was from playing with Melody. \"hop up here and give me a taste of that sweet cunt.\" Fiona was a little disappointed, but obeyed stepping onto the couch and placing her dripping sex at her mistress' mouth. the mongoose wasted no time eagerly slurping her pets juices while teasing her clit to get more. the red vixen leaned against the wall for support as Mina's tongue drove her to new heights of ecstasy. Melody recouped and upon seeing her mistress' actions new what to do. the yellow vixen quickly situated herself between Mina's legs and put what she had learned to use. Melody's was sloppy but that hardly mattered to Mina as she was already in paradise. she moaned into Fiona's sex making the girl cry out as she came all over the mongoose's face. The elated mongoose promptly began to gush her own fem-cum onto Melody.  the red vixen shifted and sat besdie her mistress as Melody moved to do the same just before they could drift off to sleep though Rouge entered.</span></div></div>",

She Swooped down, grabbing a spare mic as she landed, throwing off the music a little to where Rouge could start from the top. She smirked at the shocked Songoose and raised the mic to her mouth, showing mina her ring as she Sang the new lyrics.<br>\r\n\"Wonderful baby, Let me hold you down. Isn't it wonderful when I'm in town?\"<br>\r\nMinas eyes Dulled as she smiled and started to repeat the lyrics \"Wonderful baby, Please hold me down....\"<br>\r\nAs she sang her outfit stretched out to fit her body like one of rouges outfits, purple hearts with teal musical notes formed on her boots and chest, and her breasts and ass seemed to expand to fit the suit as she strutted closer to Rouge. <br>\r\n\"I'm just out of my mind, I'm chokin'. Cause baby, I'm meant for you....\" Mina didn't ned rouge to guide her anymore as her mind became just as seductive and gem loving as her new mistress's. <br>\r\nRouge held her close as the two sang together, pointing the ring at a camera as ther waves sent out to all the crowds and anyone watching on tv.<br>\r\n\"We'll take the good gems, and smash the bad into pieces... we'll keep you all cause now you're roped in.\"  <br>\r\nMina could barely contain herself as she became aroused and began humping Rouge's leg subtly as the song drew to a close<br>\r\n\"You're Giving me something...\" Mina gasped out <br>\r\n\"I've given you something  real good.\" Rouge finished.</span></div></div>",

After a few tense seconds, she heard his voice at the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rouge? What's up?\" He asked, sounding excited to talk to someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, aren't you a little hyperactive today.\" She teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was just really, really bored. Ignore what botanists tell you. Plants do not make good company.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Rouge giggled. \"So, I found this weird ring, and I was wondering if you could take a look at it. Are you in Knothole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry again, but I'm at my Mystic Ruins lab.\" Tails apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's even better. I'm at the GUN building in Station Square. I'll get a train. See you there!\" She said, hanging up. \"Well, the trap is set, now I've just got to spring it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge arrived at the Mystic Ruins station and instantly soared into the air, looking for Tails' workshop. She quickly found it on a hill nearby. It was easily recognisable, as it had a launch ramp several hundred meters long to the front, on which was parked a red biplane. She walked up to the door, and knocked on it. Tails opened it a few seconds later, and welcomed her to his home-away-from-home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the mess Rouge. Now, what was it that you wanted to show me?\" He asked, curious. Rouge's sweet smile turned to a sinister grin, and she fired a beam of light from the ring at Tails' eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, my new hypnosis ring of course.\" She smirked, as Tails eyes glazed over and he slumped forward, somehow still on his feet. Rouge put her finer beneath his chin, and lifted his head up to meet her examining stare. \"Are you ready to hear your new orders, Tails?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes... Rouge...\" Tails droned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boy.\" Rouge said, complimenting her pet. She led him over to a couch, cleared the robot parts off of it, then sat down, allowing Tails to perch on her lap. \"Now, first things first. No more pointless experiments. No more doing things with 'science' as your only reason. From now on, you only do experiments when I tell you to. And your inventions must all benefit my career as a jewel thief. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yes... Rouge...\" The fox repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Now, speaking of my career as a jewel thief, you will be joining me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... As you wish...... Rouge...\" Tails said, accepting his new career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuut, not as yourself. You see, you're too recognisable. So I'm going to give you a makeover.\" Rouge said, leading her victim further into his trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... makeover?\" Tails asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tails. You see, I know a lot about you. I know how you've always longed to be like me.\" Rouge lied, manipulating Tails' thoughts and emotions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Really..?\" He asked again, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my dear. You've always wanted to be a lovely, sexy female jewel thief.\" Rouge smirked, watching the fox's mind change in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I...have...?\" Tails said, further questioning these orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sweetie. Would I lie to you?\" Rouge asked, countering Tails' question with one of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would your mistress lie to you, Tails?\" Rouge pressed for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...

Make yourself a machine that will fix you.\" Rouge replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress, thank you!\" Tails squeaked, and he began to get to work. As she watched her pet build his machine, Rouge began to fantasize about what she would do with this machine. She could have, Sonic, Knuckles, Shadow, and Silver join Tails as submissive female slaves, and they would love her for it! Of all of them, she felt Silver was the biggest threat. As a psychic, he could tear apart Rouge's hold on anyone as if it were a wet paper bag. Shadow would also be a problem, with his vast powers, she'd probably need the others on her side to stand a chance. Sonic would be tough, but not impossible. She could trick Knuckles just as easily as she fooled her trusting, naive twin-tailed captive. Before Rouge could wonder about the future anymore, Tails finished his machine, and climbed into it. \"Wish me luck Mistress!\" Tails called, and dropped in before turning the machine on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash was emitted from a metal canister that held Tails, and the fox was then bundled into the rest of the machine. After a while, Tails stepped out, and Rouge's jaw dropped at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the exit of the machine was a fifteen year-old vixen, with an impressive C-sized bust. She had long, slightly curly blonde hair, a small cute nose, a soft facial expression, iridescent blue eyes, wide, child-bearing hips, a shorter muzzle, and a coat of luxuriously soft, fluffy yellow fur. She was clad in an exact copy of Rouge's outfit, downsized to fit her, and the exact same makeup. Rouge wrapped her arms around the vixen, and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little boy has grown up into a beautiful woman.\" Rouge sighed. Tails blushed. \"Well Tails-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Mistress, call me Tiffany.\" The younger woman cut in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Tiffany, I want to get you a present. A very special present.\" Rouge said seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of special present, Mistress?\" Tiffany replied, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A slave of your own. Someone who has wronged you in the past. Maybe that bitchy swallow, or that stuck-up vixen.\" Rouge replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I love that idea. I think I'll have...\"</span></div></div>",

The two travelled from the Mystic Ruins to New Mobotropolis. Rouge wrote a letter, challenging Fiona to a fight, knowing that the vixen would be unable to resist a shot at her rival, and had Tiffany post it through the door of the building in which the ex-Freedom Fighter was squatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona picked up the letter, and read it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Fiona Fox. I am challenging you to a no-holds barred fight, just like old times. Bring your valuables as a prize. I shall be doing the same. Yours, Rouge the Bat.\" She read, smirking as she did so. \"Perfect. If I win, I can sell that stuff and get more money. What time is it again? That's right, 3pm. Near the lake in the Mystic Ruins. Heh. This one's all mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona approached the lake in the Mystic Ruins, and snarled at Rouge. The red vixen had a pistol on each hip, and a rifle on her back. Then she noticed the fox holding Rouge's valuables, and did a double take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails? Is that you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It used to be, until I got to him.\" Rouge replied. \"Then he got a taste of 'girl power' and the end result is Tiffany, my lovely slave.\" Fiona burst out laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one Rouge. I don't think I could do better to the kid!\" She cackled. \"But, getting back to business, what weapons are you using?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ring.\" Rouge said, pointing it at Fiona, and giving her a brief flash of energy. Yet, despite the miniscule amount of time Fiona saw the beam, her eyes glazed over and she smiled, staring into space. Tiffany ran over to Fiona and waved her hand in front of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiona? Can you hear me?\" She asked, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I think she needs a bit more.\" Rouge said, firing another quick beam. In an instant, Fiona was on her knees in front of the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Mistress, I live to serve you.\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on then, back to Tiffany's house, my foxy pets.\" Rouge commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress.\" Both vixens replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack within the confines of Tiffany's house, Rouge sat on a couch with Fiona laying down, her head in her mistress' lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, tell me your purpose, Fiona.\" Rouge ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I live to serve my Mistress, Rouge the Bat, and please her in any way possible. My second purpose is to worship, adore, and obey Tiffany Prower, for she is far superior to me in every way.\" Fiona droned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demonstrate your second purpose.\" Rouge said as Tiffany walked back in carrying a copy of Rouge's suit in Fiona's size, as well as a makeup kit. Fiona sprang across the run and embraced Tiffany's ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tiffany, I love you! Please keep me, Tiffany, I need you!\" Fiona cried, rubbing her muzzle against the yellow vixen's leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK Fiona, I'll keep you. Just don't be such a tail-kisser, OK?\" Tiffany replied, hugging the submissive red head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Fiona, dear, don't forget to change!\" Rouge called, as the vixen instantly stripped and requested her friend's 'help' putting on the new outfit. After this was done, Rouge applied Fiona's new makeup, and the vixens stood to attention in front of her. \"Now, I think it's time we made our power play, don't you girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is Rouge after now?</span></div></div>",

I have the perfect punishment for you. Since you hurt Tails and messed up his outfit, you will spend the rest of your days as Tails slave. You will obey him, you will worship him, you will love him. If he wants sex, you will provide. If he wants a fresh supply of girls clothing to wear, you will provide. If he wants assistance when building me a new machine, you will provide. If he becomes a full girl, which I daresay he will eventually, you will automatically become a lesbian, and you will provide her with a nice pussy-licking.

In any case, she went on to be Scourge's right-hand woman for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you find out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miles showed up on the doorstep and asked for help in overthrowing his 'friends.' He brought our Fiona with him. He'd had her hypnotized to make some use od her, and had been using her as a maid of all things, before he decided to get our help overthrowing the others and use her as payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if I know him, he brought her still wearing the costume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did. It was the most impractically frilly thing I've ever seen on someone.\" Sally nodded. \"Spike heels, a corset so tight she could barely breathe, the skirt wasn't short but it was wide and strached so she was flashing her panties- which were both frilly and crotchless- all the time anyway, and his idea of a pager was a vibrator. The dress didn't actually cover her breasts, either, and she had both nipples pierced. The makeup had gone beyond slutty and right into drag queen territory, and he had her hair tied into pigtails. Not the mention that the entire ensemble was pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... We'd thought it was pretty amusing before we realised that she was our Fiona, and not the one that had hurt us. After that, Miles got rapidly acquainted with Tails and Bunnie's fists. We locked him up, and immediately began the recovery process for Fiona. It took a few weeks, but eventually she was back on her feet. Tails even invented a device which restored her to the way she was before she was taken, so she could have her life back.

Tiffany held the Hedgehogs head down as he came. as he finished up Sonic kept licking until non of the foxes cum was left.

Tails' technical know-how and Sonic's speed combined would mean that the duo would be embracing their new lives as girls very shortly. Meanwhile, however, she was narrowing down the list of victims. Currently, she wanted useful victims, either those with connections or pre-existing skills. She didn't want to go for anyone with powers without the support of 'Sapphire' and 'Amber', so Shadow, Blaze, Knuckles, Silver, and Nicole were definitely out. Eventually, she narrowed it down to four:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of connections, she had two targets, who were technically the same person: Sally Acorn and her interdimensional counterpart, Alicia. Both were gorgeous, and rich, but Sally was the best choice, being heir to the throne. She was also in love with Sonic, and Rouge knew the stories of mind control being shattered by the so-called \"Power of Love\". Getting both halves of the couple on her side would remove that possibility. However, Sally would likely be in Mobotropolis, with Nicole between them. Normally, the lynx was not a threat, but inside the boundaries of  the city, she was near-omnipotent. Alicia, on the other hand, had the advantage of being a more savage fighter, and her skill with a whip wpi;d be useful for punishing unruly slaves. Those between her and her target would be unlikely to care about Alicia's safety, but getting to Moebius itself was the hard part, and it involved sharing space with Scourge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of skills, there were another two target, these ones being FIona Fox and Wave the Swallow. Wave was a harder target, living on a blimp with the protection of Jet and Storm. She was also a lot smarter: Tails was the only one who outdid her in smarts, and she had more refined fighting skills, and having a second scientist would be useful. However, Fiona would be a more novel victim, more nostalgic, and not only was she more attractive, but the combination of her comparitively lower intelligence and her apparent weak mind would make her much easier to tame. Furthermore, just as Sonic and Sally had a connection, Tails had one to Fiona. Honestly, Rouge had no idea whether Fiona reciprocated the younger fox's love, but it was better to be safe than sorry.</span></div></div>",

Rouge noticed that he had a rather fresh lipstick stain on his muzzle, and Fiona never wore makeup (Well, not yet, anyway), though really, she wasn;t surprised. Fiona responded to Scourge;s jab by firing the gun, and blowing a hole in his shoulder. He snarled, and lunged at Fiona, clearly bent on revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a golden opportunity: She could help Fiona with her problem, and get the vixen to trust her, so she could easily brainwash her later.

Unless we power the chamber with a chaos emerald the estimated time to full charge is 24 hours. I assumed your plans would move faster than that so we built multiple chambers.\" Tails replied before turning to face Rouge. \" as a side benefit to the little speed bump the chambers will be able to modify the appearance of anyone once they are up and running.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsatisfied with her pet's explanation she turned to look at the rapidly diminishing supply of parts. \"Where did you get all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just junk egg-tech we had laying around bits of roboticizers, scanners, doomsday weapons, and some of our own junked tech.\" Sonic answered as he quickly moved some parts into place. \"We made sure everything functioned and didn't have any hardwired programs before we started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long till they're finished?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One hour before all chambers are physically complete. Two and a half hours until all programs are up and running with the chamber ready to use.\" Tails happily supplied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge wasn't sure whether to be upset that her request wasn't done or pleased they had understood her so well. still what to do with all that time she supposed she could call it a day and head to bed or she could go look for another play thing.</span></div></div>",

Every piece of clothing I take off will make you hornier. The sexier I take off the clothing, the hornier you will be.

Smoothly and sexily, she took it off, tossing it into the corner of the room. \"Oh yeah, mistress...\" Fiona moaned, crossing and uncrossing her legs. Rouge was now just in her bra and panties. She slowly unstrapped the bra and let it fall, her titties bouncing from the sudden release. \"Yes mistress, yes! I NEED YOU!\" Fiona screamed in ectasy. Rouge smirked and finally let her panties fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona dived, scrambling toward Rouge's waiting pussy.

A ghost girl that if the story Sonic said is true...had a shape shifting ability. Looking to her ring, Rouge smirked with determination.

She had tried to look away but with being a ghost there really were no immediate distractions for her. That first picture she took with that handsome creature just could not be put down. She had taken many with him but this was quite special. While her fool photographers brought so many humorous and interesting photos, this was the first that truly made her feel....well...alive! At least in the heart...but still better then any of those other pictures had. It didn't help those two idiots had to go off and 'ascend', leaving her no chance of ever having a shot even coming close to <i>him.</i> If only that little flying friend of his didn't somehow break from his restraints, then they would have been together forever. With another sigh, Lah put a hand to her transparent chin in depression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...creek...squeak...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLah brought her head up, wondering if she only imagined the noises...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Eerrr...eeeehhhh...thun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone was at the door! No...was already inside! Putting her photo into her hair, Lah grabbed the camera and headed to the parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's safe to say this house is deserted by living beings. The dust and cobwebs wouldn't pass for even that sorehead Knuckles.\" Rouge walked through the old hall, her shoes causing the old wood to creak and squeak with every step. \"Well, if a ghost would be here, they might be in the parlor...probably the only decent place in this dump.\"</span></div></div>",

The being seemed to look exactly like her except....the pupils were a little odd and there were heart patterns on the cheeks. Rouge, keeping her cool despite the slight jump, simply said. \"Who the heck are you?\" The odd copy giggled and stood up. \"Oh enough about me....but I know why you're here.

Rouge's hypnosis ring causes whoever it is used on to be reprogrammed with Rouge's seductive, treasure-loving personality, as well as making them completely devoted to Rouge.<br>\r\n2. Once a girl is reprogrammed, Rouge will get them into their new uniform, a copy of Rouge's outfit modified to fit each girl's body, as well as Rouge's makeup.<br>\r\n3. Males CAN be hypnotized as well, but only if Rouge has a really good reason.<br>\r\n4. No death<br>\r\n5. NO ORIGINAL CHARACTERS<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtherwise, have fun!</td>",
