In other words, a typical day in the life of the Doctor's companions. She scanned the room looking for any sort of way out or conviently close off switch, no such luck. Just as she had given up hope, some sort of alien creature walked...well more like floated into the room. It's singular eyestalk stared hard at Rose's body, seemingly making mental notes. It's long tentacles started to move about machinery and all other sorts of bits and bobs, making the machine that Rose somehow just noticing was sitting a foot or two above her. Finally, the tentacled alien floated over to Rose's side and spoke in perfectly clear, if not a bit awkward, English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an associate of the Doctor. He is an enemy. You are,by effect, an enemy. The Fandus Codex of Law states we may not kill in this quadrant, but we may...incapacitate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fandus returned to the machine and pulled a lever downwards. Immediately a blue light flashed on Rose as she immediately felt it's effects taking hold. Rose felt her chest swell as her breasts rising up. She gave a hard look at the Fandus and said \"Really? I mean that'll cause some back problems but that won't really do much else.\" The Fandus realized his error and went back to the machine pulling more levers pressing switches, etc. Then she felt her body entirely swell. Her stomach pushed out over the belt constraining her to the table, aided by her butt pushing her upwards. She felt her fingers becoming pudgy and thick. She additionally felt her face becoming fuller as she gained more and more. Finally ending the onslaught on Rose's body, the tentacled alien stopped the machine and again looked Rose over. \"Yes, this will do fine. For now. You will go to your cell now. Do not attempt escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleased from her shackles, Rose stood up and walked over to where two more Fandi were floating as they led her to her cell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several months had passed after the events involving their adventure that would have caused The Doctor to be separated from Rose, if he had not gained help in saving her. In those events, together, they simply spent time residing in that which was called \"The Tardis\", floating about with nothing to do. Unfortunately for Rose, after saving her with help from a few other allies, The Doctor learned from Rose what her feelings were for him, only for him to reveal he did not have the same feelings for her, with an explanation being made as to why. Though Rose understood and accepted, she felt very depressed, secretly. That was why, during their time in The Tardis, whenever she was by herself, she would use one of the small movable machines within The Tardis owned by The Doctor that could bring into being any kind of food that she wanted, with it for her being \"snacks and junk-food\". She didn't care, though. Though despite it looking like the kind \"made by humans from Earth as she had come from\", they were also had \"more in calories\" and were \"more addicting\" and not only did Rose not care, but she was also \"officially hooked\". Since then, she started indulging herself, frequently while by herself while The Doctor was by himself entertaining himself in whatever room he was from inside the Tardis with Rose doing the same, only by herself with whatever food she had. She made no messes, fortunately. She was good mannered. But, these foods she had included chips of many types, candy bars, candy of chocolate types, cookies of various types in shapes and toppings, etc., cakes, \"high-in-calories non-sweet types\" from hot-dogs, burgers, and other types, along with \"desert types\" like \"cake\" and \"ice cream\". Very little of it went into her \"hips\", \"breasts\" and \"backside\", the third of which was slightly \"bubbly\", while a huge amount of it went into her \"stomach\" which now was becoming \"a belly\". She, however, paid no heed to it. Instead, she just continued to indulge herself. Eventually, some months later, she had on her lap a huge bowl with enough ice cream of various chocolate and vanilla types to satisfy a hugely wealthy family with lots of guests in an incredibly wealthy \"Victorian Times Wealthy Home\" and a huge platter with a huge hole cake rather than a single slice,, using a spoon for both while in a \"living room place\" in the Tardis while having a \"movable object\" to get them to appear.  She had been eating it up, and by eventually it was all gone. Her belly had soon become so big, it made her look \"pregnant with 40 kids\". She hiccuped, and then laid down on her back after using the machine to make the now empty dishes disappear before hiccuping some more. Eventually, after a nap, she used a nearby \"remote\" like object to scan her weight, even though it was out of curiosity rather than concern for her own weight, discovering that she had now weighed ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rose Tyler had been in a funk. A serious one at that. Her separation from The Doctor that took place in their last time spent together had been prevented from happening through a parallel timeline merging, that also led to the destruction of all The Daleks. Unfortunately, even so, not only was it the case that every other female human companion and other human companion of The Doctor alike from before and after her was soon to be returned to places they first met The Doctor at, respectively, but The Doctor still <i>did</i> <i>not</i> romantically love her back, but after all of the other of The Doctor's human companions of female and male genders alike from before and after Rose were being dropped back off at their homes, with her being dropped off last. Coming to accept the fact the Doctor would never romantically love her back was hard. Naturally, rather than facing this, she sat in the one of the many in her sleeping room group of residential quarters in the TARDIS and ate. Meanwhile, she did at least ask for a \"food machine that could get to come into being any food she wanted\" for when she was brought home. At this point, however, it was stored for when she was returned so that it'd be given to her right before she left the TARDIS. So she \"had regular foods\" instead. She did so in the aforementioned place in The TARDIS she was in, all the while in an armed chair.<br>\r\nShe dug her hand into some extra large bags of chips of diverse types, taking a handful and mindlessly put them in her mouth, chewing slowly. It's not as if she <i>cared</i> how much weight she'd put on, given her fixation on romancing the Doctor. Since that wasn't happening, she decided this: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy should she care if her \"figure\" \"goes away\"? In fact, she decided she <i>did</i> <i>not</i> <i>care</i> <i>anymore</i> about whether or not she'd \"get fat\" or anything like that. Feeling her pants button strain on her stomach, Rose loosened her now-tight-despite-being-stretchable-due-to-being-made-of-stretchable-fabric-type -of-blue colored jeans type pants by placing them further down, letting a huge amount of swollen and bloated fat roll out from her belly. She had not been paying attention to it but she had still grown quite the chubby and distended belly. She then disposed of all of the extra large chip bags of diverse types after finishing them, and moved on to some multiple and diverse types of boxes of cookies with these boxes being also in extra-large size. The cookies were something she then started eating for about \"four \"Earth\" hours\" for each of the types like with the chips, saving the chocolate chip types of cookies for last since they were among her many favorites, with it all ending after \"four \"Earth\" hours\", again, that is. She felt very tired, after that, then. And she fell asleep, her eating craze finally over as she laid herself on her bed to rest. The next morning, Rose awoke, seeing that she had been resting a hand on her belly. When she woke up, it was the \"Earth Hour\" of 4:45 AM. She felt hungry as a result of what she had been eating, and then started eating tub-gallons of diverse types in quadruple-times-eighteen-times-more-extra large composed quantities of multiple types of an ice cream, saving the best for last in chocolate types, all the while managing to mix all the cookie types up to chocolate chip type as well. All the while, her \"weight gain\" increased itself and she grew bigger and fatter as a result. When she finished, her belly was <i>incredibly</i> <i>swollen</i> and fat. It was 6:00 AM the \"Earth Hour\" when she finished. Suddenly, she let out some hearty hiccups, after which it was then that she realized something was dreadfully wrong. Rose waddled over to the mirror next to the shelves of old books, nearly knocking over a table with a strange, alien lava lamp with her new girth. She knew she had been eating compulsively for a week, and she knew it was showing. She was wearing the largest clothes she had in her wardrobe, though, at this point.<br>\r\nFinally slowly but surely getting herself to be taking a look in the mirror and after a hard look at her reflection, Rose suddenly took a deep breath and sigh immediately after she saw how she appeared. When she made it to the mirror, what she saw shocked even her.Each and every one of those parts of her body that she saw was plainly visible. Her eating habits had certainly gone quite to the point where she both <i>felt</i> and <i>looked</i> <i>absolutely</i> <i>fat</i>. <i>Literally</i> <i>and</i> <i>metaphorically</i> speaking alike. She had known she'd been putting on a huge amount of weight somehow, in the last few weeks. Her pants were getting tighter--in fact, if she was honest, most of them she would be a huge amount of difficulty managing to button if she tried them on now despite whatever success she could still have. Rose's shirt would only conceal her small breasts, and her pants, no matter how stretchy and fitting they still were, all but felt uncomfortably snug around her behind body parts despite their success in concealing her behind body parts. Yet, in her depressed state, she pretended not to notice, often consoling herself with the thought that the Doctor wouldn't notice. But thinking that someone such as her own self may be getting fat and taking an honest look at it happening are two different things, and Rose finally fessed up to herself and she saw that she had put literally and exactly put on 280 pounds. Quite a lot by cosmic standards for someone like her and enough that for the first time since her awkward preteen years she didn't like what she saw. She saw her once-flat stomach now turned into a round, bloated, swollen, huge, heavy, drum-taut-hard-and-drum-tight-hard-as-a-sphere-shaped-boulder-type-rock-quadrupl e-times-eighteen-times-the-size-of-a-sphere-shaped-boulder-type-rock-and-yoga-ba ll-combined-and-heavy-as-a-led-made-object-of-sphere-shape-and-the-aforementione d-times-as-much-type-of-a-boulder-type-rock-and-yoga-ball-combined type of size-resemblance-and-heavy-amount-carriage-resemblance carrying swollen and round and big and fat belly of a stomach, causing her shirt to ride up and only be able to cover her small breasts, despite how stretchable it was. She saw her jeans digging into her sides, with her belly being exposed as such. Her small breasts were still small despite being slightly given a small amount of weight and her toned arms and legs were now still soft, almost sausage-like, as she gave some thought about this disapprovingly. Her face, she placed both her hands on her mouth to silence her gasps upon noticing, was also slightly soft despite how small it still was, with still small and yet still slightly puffed up cheeks. In many more pounds she knew she'd have quite a lot of difficulty getting up, getting around, getting here, getting there, getting anywhere and getting about. She didn't have to turn to her side to know her small as ever and yet slightly bubbled up backside was taking a truly small amount of the weight with the same being true for her small and yet-now-slightly-widened-hips, and she didn't want to see proof. It was <i>one</i> <i>more</i> frustration to deal with. Going on dangerous adventures with a man/alien who could never romantically love her was getting sad enough. <i>Now</i> she <i>had</i> to be ending up at a point where this was the case as she and she as in: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose Tyler, had all but ended up causing herself to have ended up at a point where she had ended causing herself to have managed all but to <i>get</i> <i>fat</i>, too. She rubbed her round belly for a brief moment. She tugged on her shirt to cover the huge bulge unsuccessfully. She checked her pants and saw that it was still covering every behind part of her body. She buttoned her jeans only to have them end up back open. Her breasts and upper body looked a little pudgy but were as small as ever, her derriere and thighs were slightly porked up and all of her belly from top to bottom had become expansive, wide, swollen, bloated, enormous, drum-taut tight and drum-taut hard combined and fat. Rose didn't care about the weight, with the Doctor not interested in her romantically, the only problem with gaining weight was the effects on her health, which she knew about full well. Rose quickly pushed these thoughts away, but then briefly thought about them again. With the Doctor completely oblivious and uninterested, why not indulge herself a little more? She rubbed her round belly in thought.<br>\r\nMaybe she should just <i>stop</i> <i>giving</i> <i>a</i> <i>care</i> anymore. Besides, the Doctor was both completely oblivious and uninterested, so upon returning home where she had been living at, in an upstairs and downstairs-house-resembling-apartment-room that the wealthy employers of that were also friends of her father offered her father and mother both some help in making some generous enough investments that though the both of her parents would be the real owners, she would still have this as a residence of her own to stay at, for which the Doctor had arranged for investments somehow enough for her 'til old age, she would start indulging herself for as much as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the \"Earth Hour\" 5:30 PM with the sky very night dark when Rose stepped out of the TARDIS and into the main room of her aforementioned home. Her goodbye to the Doctor had been short and sweet, etc., she knew he was not romantically interested in her and she was not going to stay forever. The TARDIS began to dematerialise as she looked on, wondering how her experiences will change her future, how she could ever go back to her old life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour months after leaving the TARDIS, with it being October at this point, laying on her living room couch in front of her living room TV, wearing clothing concealing only her breasts and her behind parts, Rose had gained 240 more pounds since her aforementioned departure without even noticing and her attention otherwise occupied.</span></div></div>",

Her shirt was stretched too snugly around her middle and breasts, as well, showing unsightly bulges growing underneath.  But this was temporary, she told herself with a firm resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't let herself stay in this sorry state.  She also wouldn't let the Doctor, whose recent distance was part of the cause of her own depression and weight gain, remain so aloof and listless.  He seemed to have been running pointless errands for weeks now, doing busy work, leaving Martha with little to distract herself.  Both of them had to pull themselves out of this funk.  Martha would get them traveling to exotic locals again, helping locals when necessary, and living the exciting, satisfying life she remembered when she first boarded the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>But first<i></i>, Martha thought as she walked towards the control room as fast as she could in jeans that were almost painfully restricting her waist and thighs, <i></i>I need to get back into shape.<i></i>  That parts of her were jiggling when they shouldn't be with ever step was only adding to her resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor busy doing something no doubt technical and highly futuristic under the TARDIS's console when Martha stormed in and spoke with a command she hadn't since she had fallen into her depressed, gluttonous mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor!  Listen here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor popped up, a thick cord between her teeth and a small, handheld radar-looking device in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmpph?\" he mumbled.  Martha definitely had his attention.</span></div></div>",

But, and this was good for the planet, the first people to arrive there were environmentalists.  They made the whole planet a nature reserve.  Some of the most brilliant scenery I've ever seen, and all unspoilt.  It's called Paradise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" Martha said, \"Can't wait to see it.  What's it have to do with me getting back into shape and you getting back into the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's quite inspiring.  Some of the elements are vibrationally attuned to sentient minds.  It's a great place of deep thinking.  Also, turned out the first colonist weren't too lucky in colonizing the planet.  So while they're dying out, a little . . . oh, let's just call it a specialized society, came and settled a small part with the agreement that they wouldn't spread beyond their original colony.  And they didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we want to visit a cult in a nature reserve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it was a health cult-or a beauty cult, as they'd see it.  Obsessed with being healthy and perfection, you see.  They were living to be 200 naturally when most humans were dead by 150, so they were certainly onto something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obsessed with beauty?  Sounds a bit superficial.  How can they help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they are, but they're nice enough people if I remember.  Lots of humans were in those early space-faring days.  You'd be proud of them.  And these Paradisians were always willing to lend a hand.  So, you will get to be in the best shape of your life, while I will wander the wilderness, soaking up the scenery.  It'll do us both a lot of good and we'll only have to be there a couple of days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll be a tourist and I'll be at a spa?\"  Martha nodded with approval as the TARDIS arrived.  \"Doctor, this might be one of your better and less dangerous ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not speak too soon!\" the Doctor smiled as they stepped outside.</span></div></div>",

The Doctor took a big whiff himself.  The too took in the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were mountains surrounding them in the far distance, some looking like crystals while others were covered in unearthly plant life.  The ground was a kind of flat, polished cobblestone and the buildings were made from sculpted versions of the same material, the electronic aspects blending in organically with the smooth, stone theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the people, and there were a few, were what took Martha's breath away.  They all appeared young, middle-aged at the oldest, and were all exceptionally gorgeous.  Some were in ridiculously good shape, while others were in a more reasonable-but still obviously quite good-shape, leading Martha to note that while the Doctor may have been right in his description of this place as being obsessed with beauty, they at least had some leeway in that, and that didn't mean everyone was an identical drone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" Martha whispered, feeling more and more self-conscious as they strolled down the street, \"I think they're staring at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  Maybe they're staring at me.  Not every day you see a Time Lord and a TARDIS, you know.  We're a rare breed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha placed her hand over her jiggling belly as they walked, wishing she had thrown on something less restrictive and revealing than her usual clothing, perhaps a potato sack of some kind.  She heard a few whispers as people stopped, sometimes pointing, and then hurried off.  One couple caught her eye particularly.  The woman gasped and smiled, pointing with great delight, while the man shushed her and tugged her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me they're not used a girl my size,\" Martha said, \"And I'm not even that big!  I wonder how they'd react to most humans from my time.  They'd flip if they saw how fat most of us were back then, you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Martha,\" the Doctor said, sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very urgent, very beautiful, and very authoritative woman was marching towards them, two beefy men behind her who Martha could only assume were guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!  Hey, you there!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha prepared to flee with the Doctor the minute he gave the word. </span></div></div>",

Martha took a step back as the woman reached out to grab her hand.  Martha relaxed as she saw the woman, who like everyone on the planet she had seen was gorgeous, had an expression brimming with either empathy or pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Martha started to say but the woman spoke over her, holding her hands and staring into her eyes.  She was dressed in what looked like a futuristic nurse's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing, you came to the right place.  And not a moment too soon!\" she glanced back to her two companions.  Looking at them now, Martha started to think they were probably more assistants than body guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Martha said, attempting to subtly pull her hands from the woman.  She wasn't sure she should be offended or not.  She looked to the Doctor, who only shrugged, perhaps as confused as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're condition, dear!\" the woman said, releasing Martha's hands.  Martha got the impression that despite her youthful appearance, she was probably much older than her.  \"Why, I haven't seen anything like it in years.  You must be from the outer colonies, they eat so dreadfully there.  It's tragic, really.  But don't you worry, we are going to take good care of you.  Your friend will be good as new, better even,\" she said as an aside to the Doctor.  \"What is your name, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martha.  Martha Jones,\" she said.  She wasn't sure yet whether she liked the woman or not.  Her concern was certainly genuine, but she still wasn't sure what she meant by \"condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Ms, Jones.  My name is Dr. Inga,\" she shook Martha's hands, holding on too long again, \"And I can tell just by looking at you that you must be a very beautiful person under all that.  It's a shame you had to wait so long but I assure you we have cured much, much larger guests.  Your . . . what is it, twenty pounds? . . . your extra assets will be dealt with and you will leave here a new woman, better than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Under all that\"'\" Martha repeated, her eyes going down to her puffy belly and unbuttoned jeans.  Now she was fairly sure she should be offended.  \"It's only about twenty pounds like you said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to put on a brave face, Ms. Jones,\" Dr. Inga said, almost solemnly, \"While I have never experienced such a thing myself I can imagine how difficult such a dramatic change must be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that dramatic,\" Martha said, still deciding whether she should be amused or annoyed.  If they could help he shed the weight she would put up with them being condescending for a while, but they were acting like she had been afflicted with some horrible disfigurement.  One of the male associates of the woman was staring at Martha's exposed belly with some obvious disgust.  Martha pulled her shirt down enough to cover most of it, but did not attempt to rebutton her jeans.  \"But you <i>can</i> help me get back into shape then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be my personal pleasure to do so!\" Inga said, apparently overjoyed at the question.  She then turned to the Doctor again, giving him a once-over.  \"Mmm.  Your friend is in good hands.  Shall we set you up in a hotel, sir?  We have many guests like your friend who are too embarrassed to come alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not embarrassed,\" Martha said testily, although she was a little bit.  Maybe a lot, now that everyone was staring at her like she was a freak of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, doctor, it looks like you have everything under control,\" the Doctor said, shaking Inga's hand vigorously, \"But if you don't mind, I'll be seeing the sight, traveling, roaming the earth, as it were.  Nothing wrong with that, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not, we encourage all our guests to take in Paradise's natural beauty.  We are very proud of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll treat you right, Martha,\" the Doctor said, noting the misgivings in Martha's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they don't condescend me to death first,\" she muttered as he brushed by her.  She recognized that the Doctor was eager to see the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will only be five days, and you can have your friend visit any time,\" Inga said, taking Martha by the shoulders and leading her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you?\" Martha said, watching the Doctor stroll off, his head towards the distant mountains.  Then, Martha saw where they were heading.  From the grounds, and the building, it really did look like a giant spa.  More emphatically this time, she turned to Inga, \"I mean, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks necessary, dear,\" Inga said, patting her shoulder again and giving it a squeeze, \"This is what I live for.  Mark my words, you may have been beautiful before, but you will leave here even more so, and feeling every bit of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha wasn't sure what that meant.  She took some exception to the idea that gaining twenty pounds made her into a hideous troll, even if she did feel dumpy and unattractive since she started putting on weight.  Still, with the peaceful atmosphere and a delightfully calming aroma wafting from the health center, Martha stopped having doubts and being offended and decided to relax and enjoy this.  She as due a vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So what is this health center spa really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It really is a high-tech, future weight loss clinic, using a combination of physical and mental controls to make a person thin and want to remain so.  But things might not always go as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It's a brutal, punishing \"fat camp\" where examples are swift and fattening, especially when freewheeling do-gooders stick their noses where they don't belong.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside the clinic was as lovely as outside.  Smooth, white walls curved gently around them, opening into hallways and indoor parks with open ceilings.  Stone columns with a glittery, crystalline texture were spaced intermittently around the open space.  Martha detected a faint buzzing as she passed them, although it wasn't unpleasant.  She remembered the Doctor mentioning something about the minerals on this planet having psychic properties, and wondered if it was used in the treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people she saw were mostly staff, wearing the same white uniforms as Dr. Inga and her associates, but others were obviously patients.  Many appeared older, but none were remotely fat as far as Martha could see.  As outside, she was the largest person there simply by virtue of having visible flab.  Flab which, she noticed self-consciously, jiggled with every step.  She tried to peer around the two men flanking her to look around.  She was already calmer just being there.  A few patients glanced at her, and Martha thought she saw surprise in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the potbelly.  They haven't seen someone with such an obvious one in a while, I suppose,\" one of the men said in a pleasant voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potbelly?\" Martha said, yet more annoyance in her voice, as she cupped the quivering belly she still wasn't used to in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or your hips.  Wider than usual, you know,\" the other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha scowled.  Her hips, always a prominent feature of hers, had actually gathered very little of the weight that had pooled in her belly and ass.  She then realized the two were flanking her as they were to hide her and prevent other patients from getting a good look at her.  This came closer to angering Martha.  They just assumed she was as ashamed of herself as they would be.  True, Martha had always been thin, and assumed she always would be, but gaining a little weight was hardly debilitating injury.  She was more upset with what it represented, her listlessness, growing laziness, and unrequited love leading her to depression, than she was with the weight itself.  Of course, she would be more than happy to part with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked up to a stand where another staff member with a thin tablet stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martha Jones,\" Inga spoke quietly, \"Here from the colonies.  Height, 5'3\", weight, 144 pounds-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere the clipboard-holding man's eyes went wide.  He peered between the two nurses flanking Martha.  Martha smiled smugly and waved.  She was, however, pleased to hear that she had only gained twenty-four pounds, and not the dread round thirty she feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--here for the five day total treatment.  Can you please reserve a room and file the necessary work orders?\" Inga smiled broadly, turning to Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we do her in five days?\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Irv, I'm sure she feels bad enough without your snide commentary\" Inga snapped, then smiled back at Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrv shrugged, entering the information on his tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, as always, the boss, Dr. Inga,\" like everyone she heard here, Martha felt a strong disconnect between the silky voice the man had the words he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you to your room, Ms. Jones,\" Inga said, dismissing the two others as she led Martha down a hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are the Paradise Health Clinic we know how important your body is to you, and we will do our best to return it to its natural state of beauty.  How do you like the surroundings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely,\" Martha said, and meant it.  \"So what does his involve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five days, Ms. Jones, is all we need.  We will give you the finest, purest food, teach you the most basic exercises, and of course we will use our planet's own natural elements to ease your mind as well as your body.  It will not feel like work at all.  After your first day you will notice a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha grabbed a few inches of flab around her waist, \"A few days?  It took a few months of binging to get this, I supposed five days is reasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered a stark white room with a large, round bed and little furniture.  Inga closed the door and motioned for Martha to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not too hard to talk about it, please, could you tell me how it happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How it happened?\" Martha repeated, unable to hide how ludicrous she found the question.  \"I was depressed, and I ate and bummed around my place.  Nothing happened.  I just made a pig of myself, is all.  And I decided enough was enough.  I wanted to make a change, get my life back together.  So my friend, the Doctor, suggested here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pig is something you don't want to be then?\" Inga said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes, it's an animal, from Earth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Inga seemed to make a mental note of it.  Martha had gotten used to appreciating and accommodating alien cultures, but still forgot that some basic things she knew of Earth in her time might be forgotten by humans in the distant future.  The door opened, and a young woman with a tray of food silently entered.  Like the ubiquitous aroma that was calming Martha's nerves, the food had a scent that was so attuned to the surroundings that it barely registered as food in Martha's mind.  It was just another pleasant sensation.  At least it looked delicious.  Some sort of vegetable dish, she knew, albeit with alien plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga stood up, looking outside at the sun setting quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enjoy your first dinner here, Ms. Jones,\" Inga said.  \"You'll find a dressing gown in the closet, and your other necessities should you need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha stood up to see her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor,\" Martha said, \"I do really appreciate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing at all.  It's what we live to do,\" Inga smiled.  \"Good night, Martha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga left Martha to her meal, which she promptly consumed.  It was not a large meal, but still left her satisfied.  She had been stuffing herself so fully the last few months that being satisfied and not having to undo her jeans (which were already undone anyways) was an unfamiliar sensation.  As she lay down, she found herself thinking of her med school days.  She barely ate then with how engrossed with studying she was.  As Martha drifted off to sleep, she found herself thinking more and more of herself.  Images of herself, before her current gain, drifted through her mind, wearing outfits she thought looked good on her, or would if she hadn't outgrown them.  It struck her as strange, but then, given the circumstances, she dismissed the strangeness and drifted off to a dreamless sleep.</span></div></div>",

Still, it did come with problems all it's own, the horrors of other monstrous species that shared the universe, the fact that they still couldn't save them all, and the most current problem, the irrestible cuisine. By no means was it terribly tasting or disgusting to look at, quite the opposite really. It was simply scrumptious and rather appealing to the eye (generally), no the problem lay in how fattening it all was. Despite all the excitement we see every Saturday on the ol' telly, there was an abnormal amount of down time for the Doctor and his redheaded companion. The truth simply was that they were at the right place at the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore accurately as to when the food problem started, that would be when the time-traveling duo stopped on the planet of Terg. A popular vacation spot for tourists (for the hotels) and historians (for the fascinating local culture) alike. The Doctor identified with the latter, Donna being the former. Excusng herself from the lectures of Terg archaeology, Donna soon found herself at the hotel's free, public buffet. The rest, as they say, is history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was practically hooked on anything she could find at that point, taking it all in in massive displays of the potential of human gluttony. Said displays got her into her current weight problem, and out of her favorite pair of jeans. She huffed and puffed for a good half-hour trying to get into them, failing due to her bigger tummy preventing her zipper to close. Donna gulped as she grabbed a long-forgotten box underneath her bed, a box whose contents she hoped never to use but what always prepared to just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed from the box her old \"fat pants\u201c as her mother snidely called them. It was true that in the first few years of university, Ms. Noble had put on a freshman fifteen (followed by a sophmore seventy). For four years she had been known as the fat girl on campus and the daughter with no future at home. Shortly after her studies at university were complete, Donna dropped the weight but kept her larger jeans in case of a relapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out her pair from when she was in the 180s, she was saddened to find they fit snugly and comfortably.</span></div></div>",

After all, she travelled with the Doctor, for crying out loud. The job of being his companion (and she did sometimes consider it a full time job keeping him out of trouble) required a lot of running away from horrible monsters and evil dictators and their brain-dead minions. She shrugged to herself. She could probably shift the weight in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to sweat it for now she put on a light jacket to disguise her curves a little bit. The Doctor was never intentionally rude, but he had a tendency to be a bit alien and thus was capable of forgetting that you just don\u2019t tell a woman she\u2019s gained weight. She wandered out of her room and headed for the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the dome-shaped coral-lined room, she looked around for any sign of the Doctor. She saw his brown suit jacket slung over the back of the jump seat, but she couldn\u2019t see its owner anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor?\u201d she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonna?\u201d his voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna walked around to the other side of the console and looked down. There was a section of the grilled floor missing, and she could just make out a familiar head of sticky-uppy brown hair poking out of it. She chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing to this poor ship now?\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was making a strange humming sound. Just trying to determine the source. I think it might be something to do with the thermo couplings and their linkage to the helmic regulator.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, simple as that, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredibly simple,\u201d the Doctor replied with a smile evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed any help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 Well, maybe\u2026 Yes. There\u2019s a button on the console. Could you press it for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. She looked at the console. There were about six different panels going all the way around, and each one had several buttons on it. \u201cWhich button, genius? There\u2019s about fifty per panel, here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sighed. \u201cThe third on in the sixth row on the first section of the panel directly in line with the doors,\u201d he replied irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s temp brain memorized the directions exactly, and she set to work on the console. She lined herself up with the doors and found the correct button, stabbing it with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that right?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 This is odd. It doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Try the second button on the third section of that panel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response was a shower of sparks that erupted from under the floor. Donna wasn\u2019t sure at first, but it seemed to be coming from the Doctor\u2019s section. She knew for certain when he let out a yelp in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Blimey\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, Spaceman?\u201d she asked, trying not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just burnt,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t right\u2026 Are you sure you pressed the right button?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how am I supposed to know if it\u2019s the right button? It\u2019s your time machine, matey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a tired sigh. \u201cFair enough\u2026 Okay, change of plans! We\u2019ll swap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026We\u2019ll what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! I know that console like the back of my glasses. You stay down here and just hold the thick black cable in place, and I\u2019ll deal with things up top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed irritably, but she went with it. \u201cAlright, come on, you,\u201d she said, heading for the open section of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pulled himself out of the hole, and Donna stifled a giggle when she saw that the end of his tie was smoldering. He shot her a warning gaze and headed for the console.<br>\r\nDonna removed the coat she\u2019d put on and set it aside before getting down and slowly lowering herself into the hole. She was halfway down when she realized it was a bit of a squeeze. Granted, she\u2019d never been down in the TARDIS\u2019s inner-workings before, but it had looked like a fairly large hole from above it. Now that she was within it, it was beginning to feel a bit claustrophobic. She closed her eyes and took a big intake of breath as quietly as she could, sucking in her girth. She found herself slotting in almost perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, she let out her breath, and she was dismayed by the fact that her stomach had begun to push against the massive amounts of circuitry and wiring. She was pleased to find, however, that the thick black cables were easy to find. She worked around and grabbed hold of them and held them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got them in place,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019ve I got to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to find the right sequence of buttons and switches that will rectify the power fluctuations and redirect the excessive power into the helmic regulator. Won\u2019t take a tic!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t set me on fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hush. Just give me a second. And\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a flurry of clicks as the Time Lord began working the console in madman fashion. She twisted her head round as much as she could to witness his silhouette against the glow of the console practically dancing around the console, flicking switches and pushing buttons with an unbridled glee on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched him in amazement. He really was daft sometimes, but then there were times like this when he was absolutely brilliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she\u2019d ever tell him that, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so mesmerized by this that she was taken by surprise when he suddenly stopped, slammed a lever, and all the lights suddenly came on, and there he was, striking a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And\u2026 we\u2019re back to daft</i>, she thought to herself, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor took a bow. \u201cWell done!\u201d he exulted. \u201cRight then, that\u2019s the old girl sorted! Time to have a bit of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFun?\u201d Donna asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that include? Running from more of those Sontarans? Fighting some huge green slimy monster that feeds on desire? Fixing some \u2018timey-wimey\u2019 thing that endangers all of creation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blinked. \u201c\u2026Do I detect a hint of sarcasm in your tone, Ms. Noble?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe merely smirked in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNahh, nothing like that, I assure you,\u201d he continued, working at the console again. \u201cThere is a planet that is ninety-nine point nine percent ocean!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the other point one percent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe dock where tourists can come and board the mini-subs and go exploring its depths,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds incredible,\u201d Donna replied. \u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned and started making plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shook her head and proceeded to get herself out of the floor. Unfortunately, she found she was stuck. At first, she thought a piece of clothing had caught on something, but to her dismay, she found this wasn\u2019t the case. Her girth had wedged her in tight. She pushed against the floor and tried to lift herself out, but she was stuck fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was still talking at one hundred miles per hour, so he didn\u2019t seem to notice at first, but after three minutes and no sarcastic quips in his direction, he began to suspect there was a problem, and he turned to look at her. He was confused when he saw her still in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing down there?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked up, shamefaced from having been caught. \u201cOh! Just\u2026resting,\u201d she said awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s cozy down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor raised an eyebrow, but decided it wasn\u2019t right to question whatever it was she was up to. He continued on his merry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes and struggled, twisted and turned, holding in her stomach to her best abilities. It took five more tries, but eventually, she was up and out of the hole, and she landed with a thud on the thoroughly uncomfortable floor. She got her legs out and struggled to her feet, rubbing her sore waist. She slid the section of flooring back in place and stood up, relieved that the Doctor didn\u2019t seem to have noticed, and if he had, he wasn\u2019t commenting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I dress for this?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what you\u2019ve got on is fine,\u201d the Doctor assured her. \u201cHang on \u2013 here we go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed the lever into place, and the TARDIS ceased making that funny wheezing noise as it settled into whatever location it had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight then, come on!\u201d he declared, rounding the console and grabbing his trench coat off the piece of coral he always slung it over. \u201cOne fish, two fish\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. \u201cRed fish, blue fish,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they headed for the doors.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week later, Donna was wandering around the TARDIS\u2019s various corridors. To her disappointment, after a week of running around and fighting monsters, she had only lost three pounds. She knew in the back of her mind that it was her own fault. Not only had she been helping to save planets, she had also been eating whatever had been offered to her (as soon as the Doctor assured her it was safe to). Her waistline hadn\u2019t necessarily grown, but it hadn\u2019t really shrunk either, and her fat jeans still fit snugly around her pudgy middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was off working on some sort of side-project of his. It was something that involved anti-gravity and a stuffed gorilla, so she wasn\u2019t all that interested in finding out what it was.<br>\r\nShe wandered around until she found a strange-looking vending machine sticking out of the wall. She walked up to it and looked it up and down. She saw a single red button siting in the middle of it, and so she shrugged and pushed it. Some lights lit up and a holographic screen was suddenly projected from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared in amazement \u2013 particularly the words that said, \u201cSelect Your Meal.\u201d She could feel her heartbeat speed up. There was such an abundance of choices to make that she couldn\u2019t decide for a full five minutes. She finally decided for something simple. She pressed the \u2018pizza\u2019 option. Then she went through the various sizes \u2013 she chose large. Then she went through toppings \u2013 extra cheese and sausage. She chose side dishes \u2013 cinnamon sticks with heavy icing. She finally chose a soft drink \u2013 decidedly not diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really only doing this because of curiosity. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She just wanted to see if it would be any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door suddenly opened up under the machine, and she was surprised when a large pizza box with a heavenly aroma emanating from within it. She was giving a two-liter bottle of soda and a fresh pan of cinnamon sticks, which were dripping with sugary icing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself, she knew she\u2019d have to eat all of this herself. She couldn\u2019t disturb the Doctor when he was busy, and she had nothing else to do. She carried all of these things to her bedroom, where she sat down on the queen-size bed the TARDIS had given her, and she got comfortable. She turned on the telly, found a film she\u2019d been meaning to watch, and she settled down against the pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped open her pizza box and stared at it. It looked so fattening that she felt like she was gaining weight just from the scent. She took out a slice and sank her teeth into it. It was delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but smirk \u2013 the Doctor\u2019s ship was a better cook than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished one slice and moved onto the second. She poured herself a glass of soda, which was somehow cold even without ice. She became rather engrossed in the movie she was watching, and so she didn\u2019t really notice that she\u2019d eaten half the pizza in under ten minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the credits were rolling ninety minutes later, the pizza, the soda and the cinnamon sticks had all been devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s shirt had a few stains on it, but she knew the TARDIS could do the laundry better than any launderette on Earth. She involuntarily let out a hearty belch, causing her to let a hand fly to her mouth in shock. She felt her face go red despite there being no one else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her overstuffed stomach gingerly, moaning softly as she did. She was so full she could barely budge. She managed to reach the remote and switch the TV off. She settled back into the bed and settled down for a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would be sure to return to that vending machine many times in the future\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ll never believe where we are now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna jolted awake in surprise, looking around in every direction at once. Her eyes finally managed to find the source of the noise \u2013 the Doctor. Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d she asked. She realized that wasn\u2019t a very intelligent-sounding question, so she quickly followed it up with another one. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just landed the year 1560! London! Guess whose birthday it is outside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. \u201cI dunno\u2026 Were we supposed to bring them a present?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Elizabeth the First! Her birthday is right outside the doors!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments for Donna to register this information. She struggled to get up and off the bed, trying ignore sudden emptiness her stomach was trying to alert her of. \u201cThe Queen Elizabeth the First?\u201d she asked, getting onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and the same!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and the same who once ordered you killed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor came up short for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smirked \u2013 a rarity indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026What did Martha <i>not </i>tell you?\u201d he asked at once, narrowing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out one day, Martian Boy,\u201d she replied, patting him on the cheek affectionately. \u201cSo what do we do if she orders us killed on her birthday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, that was in the future with Shakespeare \u2013 way in the future. About fifteen years, give or take. Won\u2019t have happened yet. I don\u2019t think. Maybe. Shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed. \u201cHow shall we? Do we have to dress up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I suppose a little bit of dress-up couldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d he replied. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the wardrobe room. If we\u2019re quick, we\u2019ll be just in time for the dancing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed up and around various corridors until they finally found the spiral staircase that took them up into the wardrobe room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the ladies\u2019 section?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown in that direction,\u201d the Doctor replied, pointing off in the distance. \u201cThe TARDIS will help you. Just have a looksee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded and headed in the direction he\u2019d pointed in. She rounded a few corners and found herself surrounded by loads of dresses and skirts. She tutted to herself, wondering how the Doctor had acquired all these womens\u2019 clothes in the first place. She knew he\u2019d travelled with other women before, but it was a little strange that he just happened to have clothes that suited every location they landed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through a few, she found a red dress that was her size. It looked very posh indeed. She felt a girlish grin tugging at the corner of her mouth as she took it down and headed for the nearest changing room. She peeled off her stained shirt and her fat jeans and proceeded to slip into her new dress. It had poofy shoulders and was cut rather low in the front, but not too far. She didn\u2019t trust all those men from the Elizabethan era. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she had to put on the very last piece \u2013 the corset. She sighed to herself. Her recent binge probably hadn\u2019t done her any favors. She wrapped it around her midsection and proceeded to take a deep breath and suck in her gut. She tied it up as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she looked like she was thirty pounds lighter \u2013 or she would\u2019ve, if it weren\u2019t for the little bulges of fat trying to escape through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof,\u201d she sighed, taking a labored breath. \u201cYou <i>better </i>hold together\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving rather awkwardly, she left the changing room and walked up the gangway towards the control room. Her sneakers clanked the entire way. If there was one thing she had learned from the Doctor, it was that it paid to have a pair of good running shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found him already there, going over some controls. He was wearing a very smart-looking suit that was made up of a velvet jacket, black trousers and a cravat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, look at you,\u201d she cooed, looking him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned. \u201cI haven\u2019t dressed like this for a few bodies,\u201d he murmured. \u201cRight then \u2013 ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out a hand. \u201cLead the way, kind sir,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor took her hand and led her down the ramp and through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out into a very welcoming atmosphere. There was lots of laughter and singing and music going on just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS had evidently landed in a stable near the festivities, but they could see activity occurring nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re just in time for some fun,\u201d the Doctor grinned. \u201cThis way, I think!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked around, her grin growing larger as they walked along. There were loads of Elizabethan party-goers all walking around, playing games and dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she found herself in the middle of a rather spirited dance with a group of people, all of them taking turns twirling her and various other women around. She became disoriented and tried hard to keep up, not to mention locate the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this movement was causing her to jiggle all over, and she could feel her breasts bouncing madly, almost threatening to burst out, and she was beginning to wish she\u2019d done a better job tying this thing up. She was spun around in several directions, growing dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she found herself being thrust into a faintly familiar-looking suit, and she looked up to find the Doctor grinning down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun, Donna?\u201d he asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Oh\u2026 I\u2019ll let you know as soon as there\u2019s only one of you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor laughed heartily. \u201cCome on. What say we find some dinner. Sample the local cuisine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s stomach rumbled. \u201cOhh, you read my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Wait, you didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever! Only in the direst of emergencies, like when your birthday\u2019s coming up or something,\u201d he said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about my age. Let\u2019s see what they\u2019ve got for nibbles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looped his arm through hers, and they headed inside, where they found the dining room, where various people were gathered around a massive table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s mouth fell open at the large amounts of food that were piled upon the table. There were huge amounts of meat, vegetables and desserts that made her drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, look at all that!\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they need enough to feed all the whole party,\u201d the Doctor replied with a shrug. \u201cCome on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor and Donna grabbed a pair of plates and began to load them up with food. While the Doctor was loading up, he became distracted by all the people who were talking to him at once, trying to include him in their conversations, and the Doctor ended up trying to come up with a cover story for who they were and why they were invited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna let him do just that. While he was trying to figure everything out, she was piling more and more food onto her plate. She had loads of chicken, beans, pork, carrots, peas, and various other things that she wanted to sample while she had the chance that most humans in her day and age never got to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Doctor managed to get away from the crowds, and she sat down with him at one of the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating people,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cRather nosey, but very talkative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you tell them?\u201d Donna asked with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I\u2019m the Lord of Gallifrey, and I\u2019m here with my sister from Chiswick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSister?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? You\u2019d rather I was your husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in a million years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we are, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor began to eat his dinner as well. \u201cManaged to find out what else is scheduled for today,\u201d he went on. \u201cThere\u2019re going to be fireworks later tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSixteenth century fireworks?\u201d Donna asked. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it should be a treat. Enjoying your dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d she replied through her full mouth. She\u2019d already put a sizeable dent in her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor half an hour, they sat there, talking and observing the local color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna ended up going back for seconds, and then thirds, and then just a little bit of fourths. She kept eating more and more, absolutely loving the food and drink she was consuming, only somewhat aware of how full she was getting. Her stomach was trying to stretch outwards, but the corset was growing tighter and tighter around her mid-section, and the bulges of fat were working their way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was night time, and before she knew it, the Doctor was leading her to a hill with some other people, and they were sprawled out in the grass, looking up at the amazing display of fireworks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna lay back on the hill, resting her hair in the grass. She began to subtly undo the corset a little to relieve the pressure. As she admired the beauty of the colors in the sky, she rubbed her stomach, helping digestion take place. She sighed inwardly. She wasn\u2019t about to lose weight any time soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The TARDIS door squeaked open, and the Doctor helped Donna through the threshold. She was just a little tipsy after partaking in the various ales available at the party \u2013 so much that his acute sense of hearing could almost hear her sloshing and gurgling as she moved. He kicked the door shut with his heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Donna, we\u2019re home,\u201d he said, helping her with the step up onto the central section of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome\u2026 My mother\u2019s not here, is she?\u201d Donna slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope not. I\u2019ve never done well with mothers in the TARDIS\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. She\u2019d just nag me about drinking too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you <i>did </i>drink ten glasses\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi. Shut it, Martian Boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor chuckled lightly. \u201cOkay, okay\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just head off to bed? The TARDIS should be able to help you find the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna merely belched in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor crinkled his nose. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll help you find your toothbrush first,\u201d he muttered, aiming her towards the internal door. \u201cGoodnight, Donna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Night, Spaceman,\u201d Donna replied, waving behind herself as she waddled off down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor chuckled and set about taking them back into the Time Vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, meanwhile, staggered off down the corridor, hoping dimly that she was on her way to her bedroom. As she walked, she slowly began to undo the corset, feeling it was very difficult for her to breathe with the blasted thing on. Bit by bit, as she found the doorway to her room, she began to undo the knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had opened her door and made it inside, she had just about gotten halfway through it when there was a sudden snapping noise, followed by several more, and she realized that her stomach was snapping through the remainder of the restraints, until finally it had made its way all the way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared down at the various pieces of broken string that dangled around the globe that was her belly. She sighed unhappily to herself as he got the thing off and began to peel out of her dress. She got down to her underwear and headed for her private bathroom. Her feet were killing her, and she needed a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t bother with the bathroom scale. She didn\u2019t want to know. She simply got a nice hot bath going with lots of bubbles, and she tiredly waited on the side for it to fill up all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, she was lying on her back in the full tub, which was loaded with perfectly hot water and loads of suds. She settled back into it and relaxed. She let one hand drape outside of the tub, while the other one rested comfortably upon her store tummy, which grew and shrank with every strained breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, she just lie there, listening to her own digestion taking place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after half an hour, she knew she needed to get out and go to bed, so she heaved herself out of the water and grabbed her softest bathrobe, wrapped it tightly around herself, and put on her softest slippers as well. She wrapped her hair up in a towel and padded over to the sink where she proceeded to brush her teeth, and then she headed towards her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, she found a glass of water sitting on the nightstand. Silently thanking the TARDIS for her consideration, she took a long gulp from the glass before setting it down and lying down on the bed, hoping tomorrow\u2019s hangover wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Her stomach had settled for the most part, but there was still the odd gurgle emanating from it. She let out a small hiccup and rolled over again, listening to it slosh. She could feel her eyelids getting heavier and heavier until she finally drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weeks that ensued were quiet ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was quite content to continue traveling around the universe, managing to take them to quiet places. But for the most part, they remained in the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna tried to stay active while they were in there. She tried to keep going to the gym and work out, but she found she was getting winded faster than she cared to. Then, to make matters worse, whenever she tried to go back, it was never in the same place twice. The Doctor simply said the TARDIS was in a playful mood, but Donna thought it was just torturing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing the old time machine had no shortage of was vending machines. They seemed to be popping up all over the place, sticking out of walls invitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna tried to ignore them, and she managed to for at least five whole days. By day six, though, she realized that unless she took something from them at some point, she was probably going to starve, and of all the ways to get thin, that method appealed to her the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself on the sixth afternoon, she clutched her empty stomach mournfully and headed for the vending machine. It was in a secluded part of the TARDIS. The Doctor was off working on another one of his projects, so he\u2019d be busy for some considerable time, and he most likely wouldn\u2019t want to be disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to order something healthy, but the machine seemed to be on the blink, because when she ordered a banana, she got a banana split. When she ordered an apple, she got an apple pie. When she ordered a glass of milk, she got a vanilla milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at all the desserts that lay out before her and sighed heavily. Then she attempted reverse psychology. She ordered a large cheeseburger with everything. To her disappointment, that\u2019s exactly what she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to fatten me up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she snapped irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS offered no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, however, gurgled hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at everything sitting on the floor in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, all right, fine,\u201d she grumbled. She picked up the burger and bit into it, feeling the grease dribble down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if expecting this, a robotic hand extended from the machine and produced a paper napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes, took it, dabbed at her chin and took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin five minutes, the entire burger was gone, washed down by the milkshake. She took a few slices of pie, followed by half the banana split, which took her a grand total of thirty minutes altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat down on the floor, leaning against the wall, her legs sticking straight out and her hands on her belly, which protruded firmly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more\u2026,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic arm extended again and produced a pair of antacids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna snatched them away and popped them in her mouth. Much to her surprise, they worked rather quickly, and her tummyache subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh,\u201d she sighed. \u201cMuch better\u2026 Still can\u2019t move, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic arm reached down and picked up the leftover ice cream. Donna thought it was merely clearing away the dishes, but to her surprise, a second robotic arm extended, picked up the spoon and scooped out a small scoop of half-melted ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at it, wishing she was somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she opened her mouth, allowing the ice cream to be placed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the robotic arms proceeded to feed her the ice cream. In no time, the entire thing had been emptied, with the remaining melted ice cream being poured down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it proceeded to the remaining apple pie. It took out slice after slice, letting Donna go at her own rate. It wasn\u2019t long before the entire thing was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s stomach protested against all this. She felt like she was going to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to her astonishment, the arms reached down, lifted up her shirt and undid the button on her trousers, allowing her swollen gut to expand to full capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna would\u2019ve been furious if it hadn\u2019t felt so good. She just sat there, patting her belly, enjoying the fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice fifteen minute sit, she wanted to go to her room. The hands held themselves out to her, encouraging her to take hold. She did so, and she was startled when she was suddenly hoisted back up again. She wobbled a bit, but she was back on her feet. She turned and waddled off down the corridor, and she felt relieved when she found the door to her room was closer than it had been this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went inside and collapsed on the bed, listening to her recent gorge gurgle and slosh inside of her. She rolled over onto her back and patted her stomach with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust her luck. The TARDIS was a chubby chaser.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weeks passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor took Donna to all sorts of places, but to her surprise, they rarely found themselves doing any running. In fact, they had had some rather relaxing trips as of late, to all sorts of leisure centers where they didn\u2019t have to do much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Donna always had a good time at these places, the Doctor was beginning to get a little bit bored with always having an easy time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, Donna found herself constantly be offered loads of calorie-loaded snacks from the TARDIS. She tried to turn them down, but she just couldn\u2019t help herself sometimes. They were just so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, though, something interesting was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was inspecting the TARDIS\u2019s circuitry, trying to figure out why the old girl was always taking them to nice, relaxing, boring locations. He managed to find an override system that would give them complete random coordinates. Not even his ship knew where they were going to land next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was doing this, he didn\u2019t notice Donna coming from behind him, finishing off a chocolate ice cream cone. She was just popping the last bit of it in her mouth when she came to a stop next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked through her chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d the Doctor said with a grin. \u201cWe are going to a new exciting alien planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019ve set the controls to random. Completely random location! No idea where we\u2019re going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame as usual then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled. \u201cHow much longer \u2018til we get there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot long. Should be any \u2013 whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS suddenly lurched to the side, causing both passengers to fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was back on his feet in an instant, working the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, however, was finding it a little tricky to stand up. She\u2019d had more than an ice cream cone. She\u2019d had five ice cream cones and a jumbo bag of chips. Her stomach gurgled as she found herself on top of it. Wincing in pain, she tried to roll over and get up, but it was a little difficult, considering how heavy she was feeling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, she managed to reach over and grab the edge of the jump seat. She gripped it as tight as she could, and with three gallant attempts, she managed to haul herself up onto it, where she turned around and sat down, clutching the sides, her whole body jiggling as the TARDIS shuddered and rocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Doctor managed to find a way to slow everything down. With a loud THUMP the ship settled down, and all was still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a few seconds, Donna\u2019s flesh was still, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d the Doctor said, with a big childish grin. \u201cShall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded uncertainly as she shakily stood up. She was definitely curvier than she\u2019d been before. Her breasts were a cup size larger, her rear swayed back and forth mesmerizingly, she was sprouting an extra chin, and her bulbous stomach was protruding rather far ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Doctor didn\u2019t seem to notice. Instead, he dramatically opened the doors and looked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in a jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned. This looked promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jungle was huge. That probably went without saying, but everything in the jungle was HUGE. The plants, the trees \u2013 they all towered over her like giants. Even the smallest flowers there seemed bigger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf ever there were a place that could make her feel thin, it was this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned and strode out into the open. Donna followed, absently closing the doors behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anyone else here?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno. Let\u2019s find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor proceeded to march straight ahead, digging his way through the vines and branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna waddled after, pleased to be walking a great distance and therefore burning calories.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow, the vines had all wound themselves around each other and were holding each other up, allowing them all to take in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it!\u201d the Doctor exclaimed. \u201cLook at all this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna ran her fingers along the side of an orange-colored plant. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver and scanned the plant in question. \u201cEdible,\u201d he said at last. \u201cDon\u2019t know the actual name, but it does show a low acidity factor, and curiously high in essential vitamins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they are. Well done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, everything else on the planet\u2019s huge. It only stands to reason they\u2019d grow at roughly the same rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026? Can I try one?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can! Totally safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to appear too eager, Donna wrapped her hands around the fruit \u2013 which was about the size of her head \u2013 and pulled it down from the vine. \u201cHow do I open it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor responded by aiming the sonic at the stem, which caused it to split, and then he proceeded to \u2018unzip\u2019 the plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d Donna asked. \u201cHow do you use a screwdriver to peel fruit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsed the sonic vibrations to split the stem open. Are you gonna try it or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna decided to just forgo the technobabble and dig in. She wasn\u2019t really sure how to start, so she just turned her head to an angle and opened her mouth as wide as she could, taking a huge bite. She felt the juices dribble down her chin, but she didn\u2019t care, because suddenly she was in heaven. She chewed and chewed and swallowed, and then took another bite, eagerly and ravenously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was taking her fourth bite, the Doctor raised an expectant eyebrow. \u201cGood, then?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019sh Gorgoush!\u201d Donna declared through her full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Swallow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna did so, feeling the huge amount of chewed fruit settle in her belly, feeling it stretch slightly from taking on so much at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most incredible thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked around at the other plants. There were different kinds of varying shapes, sizes and colors. \u201cI wonder if there\u2019re any banana-flavored ones,\u201d he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled at him. She continued to snarf down the whole fruit with gusto, and after a few minutes, all that was left was the core, which she let drop to the ground carelessly before she tore into a different fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large green one, this time. She found this one to have the skin of an apple or a pear, so she simply bit into it. Once again, an explosion of flavor ripped across her taste buds and sent an unmistakable signal to her brain: \u201cEat! Eat! Eat! Eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did. Donna chomped down on the fruit with gusto, eating as much of it as she could. It took a few more minutes, but at last, all that was left was another core, which she once again tossed aside before looking around a little more. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned to look, not letting go of the large peach-like fruit in her arms. As she looked around, she took a bite from the fruit, enjoying its flavor while looking around curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in the middle of her second bite when she heard the noise again, definitely behind her, and she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was there with his hands up in surrender, and there was a small gaggle of what appeared to be warriors holding spears to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, Donna?\u201d the Doctor said, trying not to sound too nervous. \u201cCould you be a dear and tell these nice people that I have not come here to rape their land and defile their women?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, chewed and swallowed. \u201cHe isn\u2019t, you know,\u201d she said to the natives. \u201cThose are the very last things on his mind.\u201d And she took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d the Doctor said with a grin. \u201cShe\u2019s Donna Noble. You can take her word for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe natives looked at each other uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of them, possibly their leader, lowered his spear, and then all the others lowered their spears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked forward. He was fully dressed in skins, with tribal markings on his face, and his hair was wild and graying. He approached Donna cautiously, and she eyed him warningly, somehow managing to look authoritative even while slowly devouring a giant piece of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have eaten from the Sacred Garden,\u201d he said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna swallowed the last bit of fruit, and for some reason, this one felt heavier than the others. Her stomach began to quiver with fear, trying to contain the large amount of fruit it had just been tasked to hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSacred Garden?\u201d she asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d the tribe leader said. \u201cAnd they say those who eat from the Sacred Garden are to be worshiped and obeyed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the tribesmen got down on their knees and proceeded to bow before Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked rather peculiar, sticking out of the group of kneeling people. He looked over at Donna and shrugged with a bemused expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked bemused right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou, er, worship people who eat from the garden, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d the leader replied from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Why\u2019s that? What\u2019s so important about this garden?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he looked up. \u201cYou do not know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose who eat from the plants and live must have otherworldly powers. Only a goddess such as yourself could survive these plants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they began to chant some sort of holy prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor managed to slip out of the field of people\u2019s backs and made it over to her. \u201cNot bad for a temp,\u201d he said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheeky,\u201d Donna replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about? Are the fruits dangerous or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not. I\u2019m sure of it. It must be something else. Maybe it\u2019s their biology and they can\u2019t digest the fruit. Maybe someone made up the legend to keep these people away from here. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tribe leader was on his feet again. \u201cGoddess, you must command us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked surprised. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a divine holy messenger! You have come to show us the way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. She looked at the Doctor, but he was just grinning away, loving this. She wrinkled her nose at him and looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 what have you all been doing so far?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe hunt. We gather. We raise our young so that they may learn to hunt and gather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed. It wasn\u2019t really her place to change these people\u2019s lifestyles. \u201cJust\u2026keep on doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she assured them. \u201cYou\u2019ve been going the right way all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 We have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You have good lives. You don\u2019t need me to show you anything. You\u2019ve had the answers inside you all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribe leader stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned to his people, held up his hands and shouted, \u201cThe Goddess has spoken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they all erupted into cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, Goddess,\u201d the Doctor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better believe it, Time Boy,\u201d she replied, smugly crossing her arms over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d the tribe leader declared. \u201cWe shall have an enormous feast in your honor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at them. She let her arms uncross and cradle her belly, which was still rather full from all that fruit. \u201cOhh, I dunno\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, Goddess!\u201d the Doctor said eagerly. \u201cCan\u2019t we stay? Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glared at him for a moment before sighing. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribesmen cheered again, and they began to lead the Doctor and Donna towards their city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna began wishing she\u2019d worn elastic.</span></div></div>",

When they said feast, they really meant it. She was so stuffed as she followed the Doctor back to the TARDIS. Not that he'd noticed. He'd spent most of his time helping to defeat a so-called \"god\" that was terrifying the natives. Turned out to be a genetic mutation that had been dumped on their world decades ago. With the creature neutralized and the people saved, they'd been very grateful and treated like heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was still talking a mile a minute about god knows what, but Donna was just waddling after him.

He was still talking. Where did he find the energy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat down on the jumpseat and got her large posterior as comfortable as possible. She sat back and rubbed her stomach. She was almost certain she would burst. She rubbed and rubbed while the Doctor set the TARDIS in flight and back into the vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" the Doctor said cheerfully. \"That was good fun! Maybe we'll go back there someday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna hiccuped. \"Yeah... someday...,\" she moaned, leaning back. \"Blimey... I can't believe I ate it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were impressed! Said only a goddess could pack it away like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm paraphrasing, but that's what they meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes but smirked fondly. \"God, look at me. Don't know how I'm going to move from this seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're more than welcome to stick around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor turned and disappeared behind the console. She heard the sound of the metal grating he called a floor being lifted, and a moment later, it slammed shut, and he returned with a neck pillow. \"Here you are! Try that on for size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled gratefully and slipped it on. God, that felt good. She put her hands under her enormous belly and rubbed it. \"So go on, then. Say something science-y. Should put me right to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor gave her a stern look but continued working and talking anyway. She knew that he just needed someone to hear him talk sometimes. It's what she felt he needed from her the most - to not be lonely. She snuggled into the seat and rubbed her belly, drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Doctor made it a point to bring Donna home periodically so she could see her mother and grandfather. He'd experienced his companions drifting away from their normal lives too often and wanted to ensure that she still had a life on Earth. Living with her family, she had no rent to pay or anything, and her chronic unemployment meant she remained free to gad about the universe without being missed too much. Still, they agreed that they would try to arrive a week or two after her departure, regardless of how long she'd really been away, if only to reassure her family that she remained safe and not-dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her mother didn't know about all the zooming around space and time. Donna knew Sylvia would never approve of her misadventures. Her nagging would be cranked up to eleven, and it already seemed to routinely be at ten and a half anyway. The last thing she needed was Sylvia Noble's patented brand of \"intrusive parent\" sticking her nose into her already stressful life as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking out an outfit for reuniting with them proved difficult. After a few more heavy fat meals in the last few months, her belly stuck out whether she was stuffed or not. It jiggled vertically and horizontally, mesmerizing passers by. She'd had to adjust her wardrobe accordingly six times now, going up many trouser sizes. It had become such a normal part of her life now that she had to admit she'd gotten used to gaining weight. What with all the running for her life that came with a standard life in the TARDIS, she hadn't really worried too much about it. She made sure to get some healthy food in with the junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now she would have to face her domineering mother, and she knew she would never let that sort of thing off the hook. To have ballooned like this in the months she'd been away, only to come home a few weeks after her last visit, she didn't know what to do. She looked over her clothes in the hopes that she might find something less revealing. Something to take the focus off her gut, or at least disguise it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she found something she'd hoped she'd never see again -- the girdle from when they'd gone to the Middle Ages. Okay, the official name was a \"corset\", but all she could think of it was it helped make Captain Kirk look svelte on Star Trek. She looked down at her bowling ball of a belly and sighed with cold dread. <i>Just power through it</i>, she thought. <i>You're only staying for dinner.</i> That's all it was. In, out, a few hours, a cup of tea or two, and then back to the bigger-on-the-inside phone box to let her flab fly free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing, she slipped it on, finding it difficult to get over her belly, but she sucked it in as best she could until the corset fit neatly around her enlarged middle. With all her might, she started tying it up. She'd just wear something bulky like a sweater to make it less noticeable. After a few minutes, she had it ready. She slipped on a thick dark blue sweater and a pair of her fat jeans and posed momentarily for the mirror. Frowning, she made sure the girdle wasn't too noticeable. She looked a little lumpy, she supposed, but at least her gut didn't protrude... <i>quite </i>as much. Taking a deep breath -- but not too deep -- she moved awkwardly out of the wardrobe room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor brought the TARDIS in for a landing with minimal bumps and checked the readings. \"Right!\" he said triumphantly. \"Chiswick! 2009! Home to Facebook, smart phones and the last half-decent season of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of that,\" Donna replied bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the best. You're not missing out on much.\" Then, his head tilted like it always did when he was bemused. \"Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your breathing seems a bit... awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn alien senses. \"I'm fine. I'm just... wearing a little extra support under this sweater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Support?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I've gained weight, and I'd rather my mum didn't notice, so I thought I'd just... hide the evidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked her up and down before his eyes lit up. \"Ohhhh!\" he exclaimed. \"I didn't notice there seemed to be less of you! Sorry, not the sort of thing I normally look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I'm glad. That's what friends are for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled and prepared to open the doors. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never. But let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled open the doors, revealing they were in a lot just down the street from her house. She knew her Gramps would want a look at an actual alien space ship one day, but it would have to be on a day when her mum wasn't about. They trudged up the sidewalk until they were walking up to the house. Not even bothering to knock, Donna pushed the door open and poked her head in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" she called out. \"Mum? Gramps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'ello, sweet'art!\" Gramps called from the kitchen. \"We just put the kettle on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at her grandfather's voice, Donna moved hurriedly into the kitchen and gave the old man a peck on the head. \"How've you been, Gramps?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad, considering,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrill voice cut through the air. \"Donna?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia came into the kitchen, looking a bit frazzled. She barely held back a scowl when she saw the Doctor. \"Oh, you brought <i>him</i>, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the Doctor said, waving slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mum, he's my friend,\" Donna said with an eye roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia still eyed him with great suspicion. \"Funny how we don't know anything about this 'friend', isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, leave it, luv,\" Wilf scolded. \"I'm just glad our Donna has a friend she can rely on in her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gramps,\" Donna said gratefully. \"Now how about that cuppa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant idea,\" the Doctor agreed. \"Wilf -- how's the telly working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better since you tinkered with it. Although, I'm still getting the hang of that new remote control you built. Keep getting a channel called the 'Venusian Home Shopping Network'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, might have extended the range a bit far. I'll fiddle with it before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bit back a smile. If only he were husband material. But then again, she felt she needed a friend more than a husband anyway. She helped get the tea together, keeping her breathing nice and even as she got out the sugar and honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not taking yours with sugar now, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, <i>mum</i>, just a bit of honey. That's all. The sugar's for him. He can't drink it unless it rots his teeth out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia nodded distantly, glancing back at the Doctor as he chatted with Wilf before readdressing Donna. \"So what are you up to these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know -- just traveling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With <i>him</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with him. What's wrong with that? It's more fun with a mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as you're taking care of yourself. I don't want you falling apart out there without me to keep an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smirked. \"Mum, I feel as though you're watching me no matter where I go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia thankfully didn't realize that wasn't strictly a compliment and sat down at the table while Donna poured the tea for everyone. She passed out the cups and went to take her seat in the sole empty chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately regretted this. She felt the corset struggle as her stomach bulged against it. She winced slightly as she tried to lower herself naturally into the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the Doctor was talking a mile a minute about re-configuring a hairdryer into a particle accelerator, so nobody was really paying attention to her. She eased herself down into the chair, hoping to disguise the fact that she sat perfectly straight in her seat, her legs at an awkward angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a long day after all. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day went by fairly uneventful. The Doctor and Donna regaled Wilf with the adventures they'd had lately. Zooming around time and space, fighting monsters, saving planets and running away from danger had given them plenty of stories to tell, and he held onto every word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sylvia had been largely forgotten, mainly because she'd been toiling away in the kitchen, making dinner. Donna had long since given up trying to help her mother cook. She never seemed to get it right. Every attempt ended in criticism. So now she just hung out in the living room with her gramps and ignored it. Of course, then her mother would complain about doing all the work, but hey, at least it was less for Donna to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she heard that shrill voice call out. \"All right, it's ready! Come and get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna awkwardly got to her feet, feeling the corset under her clothes groan slightly at her stomach attempting to bulge behind it. Thankfully, it held together, and she followed the others into the kitchen. Her mouth about fell open at the spread before them. Roast chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes, devilled eggs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilf whistled. \"Good grief, Sylvia luv, that had to take a bit of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia shrugged as she wiped her hands with a rag. \"Well, you know how it is when we have guests over. Never know how much to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks amazing, Mrs. Noble,\" the Doctor said politely as he joined them at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her attempts to look like she didn't care, Sylvia still grinned slightly. \"All right, you lot. Dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bit her lip slightly as she picked up her fork. She already felt like a sausage crammed into a tin with this corset on. She didn't need even more pressure. Perhaps she could get away with keeping it light. But it all looked so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Doctor passed her the mashed potatoes, she found herself scooping a hearty spoonful onto her plate. She'd just go easy on everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept she didn't, because she kept piling more on as it came around to her. Her plate loaded to maximum capacity, she winced to herself. For a woman who nagged her about her weight, her mother really shouldn't be so good a cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation carried on to the latest gossip around town, with her family giving her updates on the various friends and neighbors and what they'd been up to lately. Pretty tame stuff compared to traveling through time and fighting monsters, but she knew she needed to experience the tedious monotony of the universe as well as the exciting bits. She chatted away with her family, the Doctor throwing in the odd question here and there, and soon, she began to forget how much she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, about twenty minutes later, she began to feel the swell in her stomach grow against the corset. She squirmed in her seat as she felt it dig into her flesh. She really needed to stop eating, but to do so would leave uneaten food on her plate, and her mother would only take that as an insult. She forced herself to keep at it. She ate every last scrap of food on her plate while still holding together a half-decent conversation with everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed, and at last, dinner ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt like she would explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach pressed hard against the corset, which she feel straining against her. She swallowed down a belch and set about helping tidy up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went well,\" Sylvia remarked as she washed the dishes. \"Don't know why we don't do this more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled wryly. \"Yeah, well, maybe don't say 'oh, it's <i>you</i>' every time I have him over, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing up took another ten minutes, and each one seemed to pass slower than the last as Donna kept herself moving. Her stomach gurgled angrily, demanding breathing room at once. Sighing heavily, she pretended to check her watch the minute the last plate went into the cupboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the time,\" she said. \"Better get back before I completely fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia shrugged. \"Well, all right then. But I'd like you to call more than just once a week,\" she said, awkwardly hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll try,\" she said in a fake annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to the living room and fetched the Doctor. He'd managed to finish repairing the TV remote and had spent the evening showing Wilf some of the more human channels. She gave him a hug and promised to call him at her next destination before hurrying out the door with the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rush?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't breath with this bloody thing on,\" Donna gasped as they made their way. \"Why the hell did you park so far away?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sighed and followed her up the street back to the empty lot where they'd left the TARDIS. Once they got there, she waited impatiently as he got out the key and unlocked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, all a -- oop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pushed past him and got inside, immediately reaching under her sweater. She pulled on the knots and began to breathe a little easier as she felt her stomach expand with relief. She didn't even care when the resulting expansion caused the button to pop off her trousers. Her sweater rode up, and her full belly pooched forwards proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor didn't seem all that concerned. He just stood off to the side, hands in pockets. \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much,\" she sighed. \"God, that was the longest dinner of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought it was one of my better interactions with your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. \"Yeah, I think she's coming 'round to you.\" She plopped down on the jumpseat, hands atop her belly. \"God, I'm exhausted. I swear, I need a place where I can just relax for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor thought about that for a moment, and then he smiled. \"There's a planet I've always wanted to visit,\" he grinned, already working the controls. \"I've heard it's one of the best leisure planets in the universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Donna asked sleepily. \"What are the odds the TARDIS will actually take us there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. \"Well, she won't with <i>that </i>attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right, sorry,\" she chuckled. \"What's the planet called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight! Almost made entirely of diamonds! You can relax to your heart's content!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pondered. \"Will I have to wear trousers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost certain they give you a bath robe the minute you get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed a finger at him. \"Book it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and started inputting the coordinates.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Donna woke up next, she found herself in her room. She briefly wondered if the Doctor had carried her here, but she also knew the possibility of the TARDIS simply \"putting\" her there could be just as likely. Either way, she enjoyed a good night's sleep, rolled out of bed and got on her fat pants. She had to admit -- it felt great to breathe normally for a change. She took in her profile in the full-length mirror and shook her head. Her stomach still protruded outwards like she had swallowed a bowling ball. If she kept this up, her fat pants probably would be replaced by a pair of \"fatter pants\". It would get extra difficult hiding this from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd gotten dressed and done her hair up a bit, she made her way down to the control room. The Doctor stood at the console's monitor, typing away on a keyboard with his brainy specs on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" she said, walking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooooood morning,\" he replied, not looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted slightly at his lack of looking at her. She walked up behind him and put her chin on his shoulder, looking down at the screen. \"Whatcha working on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our reservations on the planet Midnight. Told you about this last night, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" she grinned. \"Pleasure planet, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose crinkled. \"No, relaxation planet. Pleasure planet is something else entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, can we go to one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes, making her grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a prude,\" she sighed dramatically, walking off and plopping down on the jumpseat, ignoring how loudly it creaked under her considerable rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are!\" he said triumphantly, finishing up. \"Reservations booked! We're all set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. So when do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just grinned excitedly before running down the ramp and opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat up a little straighter at the white light that poured in. She got up and scurried down after him, peering out the doors. \"Oh my god, we're already here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sent the reservation back through time,\" he explained. \"Which means, we should be receiving a greeting right about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a humanoid woman in a white uniform and a pleasant smile walked up, holding out a pair of white bathrobes to them. \"Doctor John Smith, and Miss Donna Noble,\" she smiled. \"Welcome to the Midnight Spa and Relaxation Center. Here are your customary robes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna got over her shock -- plus her relief that they hadn't been mistaken for a married couple -- and took her robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall show you to your rooms,\" the woman continued, leading them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed her into the complex, the Doctor making sure the TARDIS locked behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Separate rooms,\" Donna whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With adjoining doors,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon arrived at their rooms. Donna popped inside and immediately gaped at the place. Queen-sized adjustable bed with massage feature, big screen TV with an easy-to-understand remote, huge bath tub in the corner with a shower feature and a small balcony that overlooked the diamond world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gorgeous,\" Donna murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. She turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the interior door swung open, and in walked the Doctor, his bathrobe on over his suit like his usual trench coat, and carrying a small jar. \"Ooh, Donna, look -- macadamia nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but laugh. He could be such a child sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is amazing,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I've always wanted to visit! You know, the sun it orbits emits phenomenally lethal X-tonic radiation and there is no atmosphere. Exposure to the surface for even a split second would result in the unfortunate person being instantly vaporized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, then looked outside. \"So... why am I not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The leisure facility is encased in a fifteen-inch-thick glass dome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, that's good, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite. Gosh, there's just so much to do around here, I don't know what to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I came here for some relaxation,\" Donna reminded him. \"Not a load of running up and down corridors, even if it's only to the tourist shops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded understandingly. \"Ask, and you shall receive,\" he said, pulling a brochure out of his pocket and handing it to her. \"Came with the room. All the attractions in the facility -- restaurants, games, shows, relaxation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna opened the brochure and let out an impressed whistle. \"It all looks good. Don't know how we'll cram it all in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, between the two of us, we can cover a lot of ground. Personally, I like the look of the anti-gravity restaurant, and then there's the diamond-cutting demonstration...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a hard time picturing you sitting still for one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Well, y'know, they might learn something from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled. \"Well, I need to change first, and then I need to kick back for a bit. You can catch the show, and we'll meet up later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Where are you going to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at the brochure again.</span></div></div>",

She wondered if this could be considered \"self-destructive behavior\". After worrying about her weight so much, it felt counter productive to go to an all-you-can-eat buffet and pig out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course, I won't pig out</i>, she told herself. <i>I'll behave myself. I just want to experience an alien culture that no other human being on Earth will ever see. At least, not in my lifetime. Hell, I probably won't even like half of it. Just gotta be sensible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepeating this to herself mentally, Donna finally found the Midnight Buffet. The opening resembled the entrance to a fancy restaurant in a shopping mall, but with large booths and plenty of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist at the front desk smiled pleasantly when she walked up. \"Table for one?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please,\" Donna replied politely, showing her a plastic payment card the Doctor had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist rang it up and directed her towards the buffet line. \"Help yourself and enjoy!\" she said, handing it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and grabbed a large tray. Keep it simple, she told herself.<i> Just having a late breakfast. Or an early lunch. Whatever.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nShe got into line and felt her nostrils flare at the scrumptious smells wafting her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe both.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the food looked vaguely familiar, but others looked quite bizarre. Still, she couldn't help but marvel at how delicious most of it still looked. Still, she thought, just because something looked good didn't mean it was, in fact, good. She'd been led astray by normal-looking food in the past. Tomatoes, for example. They looked perfectly edible from the outside, but then, you got inside and found a lot of jiggly jelly-looking stuff. Not appetizing in the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she'd make a go of it. Just a few small samples here and there. She scooped up something that looked like beans, followed by some blue stuff, then some stuff that looked vaguely like cannolis, something that resembled a buffalo wing, and a beverage that looked neon orange but had the most delightfully fizzy bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the heap of food on her plate. So this would be breakfast and lunch for the day then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way to a small booth not far away, she took a moment to look at the crowd. Mostly human, or humanoid anyway, but some obvious aliens milled about, chatting amiably with everyone. She also couldn't help noticing just how large a lot of these people more. All of them with bulging bellies all protruding as they tucked into their meals. Several of them got up and went for more, despite how badly they waddled. It made Donna feel just that bit more secure about her own size -- she looked downright skinny compared to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that happy thought, she settled into a booth and tucked into the food. She tried the weird-looking stuff first. To her surprise, it tasted like raspberry ice cream. Pleased at a familiar taste and texture, she continued to spoon it into her mouth. In fact, it seemed as though a lot of the food tasted like something back on Earth. Perhaps the food had been genetically modified or something to be more appealing to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she plowed right through the meal and gobbled it down in minutes flat. Soon, an empty plate sat before her with the remnants of her meal. She took one last sip of the fizzy orange drink and leaned back in the booth. Making sure no one was watching, she loosened the belt on the robe a notch. She felt very full. She licked her lips and took another glance at the buffet line. Still plenty to go around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>... What the hell?</i> she thought, and grabbed her tray for round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so many options, it'd be a crime not to try a few more, she reasoned. She loaded her tray again and returned to her booth, eating it all down in nothing flat. She went back a third time and got much bigger helpings. More refills on that orange drink. More piles of that blue raspberry stuff. More food for her already-too-full belly. She chomped her way through it, losing the ability to care how much she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, though, she had to give in. She'd definitely had enough. Six trips through the buffet in total, and each time, she'd had to adjust the belt on her fluffy bathrobe ever-so-slightly. She lounged in the booth for a long time. She imagined she looked like she had swallowed a bowling ball, pressing against the table now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she realized she couldn't just sit there -- not with the belt on the robe about to give any second. With a miserable grunt, she heaved herself out from the booth and dragged her way to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you had a good time, ma'am!\" the receptionist called out cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna managed a dazed smile in her direction but reserved her energy for getting back to her room. Her stomach gurgled and churned as it struggled to digest everything. It jiggled horizontally and vertically with every footstep. She needed to get back to the room, if only so she could rub some of the pain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she staggered up to her door and inserted the room key. Once inside, she immediately shut the door and let the belt on the robe pop open. She gave a huge sigh of relief as her belly jiggled outwards and sagged heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes scanned the room, and then she noticed the in-ground bathtub in the corner. Smiling to herself, she grabbed a pillow and lowered her bloated self into the bath, and then started the warm water. Adding some bubble bath, she got comfortable on the tub's seat and leaned back, enjoying the sound of the water running as it filled up the bath. She smiled dopily as it rushed up over her ankles and along her legs. She put her hands atop her belly and smiled beatifically as she became slowly submerged. Once it was up to her breasts, she lazily reached over and turned the water off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in complete silence for several minutes, enjoying the warm, the bubbles and her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed with embarrassment, then shrugged since there had been no one to listen anyway. She laid her back against the pillow and enjoyed a nice long food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, when she woke up --</span></div></div>",

Specifically it was her engagement ring, the only reminder in the universe of Rory Williams' existence. \"Still obsessing over that ring?\" the Doctor asked, trying to sound natural. Amy kept looking at it in wonder, practically not hearing the Doctor. After another 5 minutes of ring-staring, Amy went to her room, when the Doctor got a rather full observation of what Rory's erasure had done to poor Amy. Feeling depressed yet not really knowing it or understanding why, Amy had resorted to comfort eating to fill the void left to by Rory's abscence. Given this was going on a good few weeks, they had a fair stockpile of not-intended-for-human-consumption foods, and the compulsive eating, you can probably tell what's happening to the redhead's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, as many could testify, was a very thin girl. Not the case now. You can't call a girl thin if she had a muffin top that Amy had, nor if she had the badonkadonk that Amy also sported, one that wasn't well hidden by Amy's ever-so-shrinking jeans. Her once fairly flat chest was now a high-C cup nearly on full display despite Amy usually wearing a sweater.

Otherwise, her now wide hips and chunky lovehandles stretching her jeans and sweater to near ripping point made her complete unrecognizable from the front.  The Doctor peered in on Amy, somewhat dreading the confrontation he was about to have.  It wasn't so much that telling her she should lose weight would be awkward.  The Doctor was fully aware this was frowned upon in many cultures.  Mostly, it was that this weight gain was obviously just a symptom of her greater depression, and that he could do nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing in front of an antique food dispenser in one of the TARDIS' many storage rooms.  It had been from some alien encounter or other and the Doctor had accepted it as a gift, although never used it.  Now Amy appeared so desperate for consolation she was searching the whole ship to new things to eat.  The Doctor would have to hide this device later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Amy, how goes things on this fine day?\" the Doctor said as unnaturally as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned to him, her eyes already rolling, her puffier cheeks stuffed with an alien snack from the machine.

Impossible, the Doctor thought.  She was a pound away from ripping even the loosest of her clothes.  For a girl as thin as she used to be surely she must notice how everything was getting bigger and softer, from her wide, wavering hips to her round, swollen belly to her equally puffy face.  The poor girl must have put on twenty, thirty pounds at the least.  Denial could be powerful, but that powerful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, perhaps . . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor aimed his sonic screwdriver at her.

They showed something, but not something he immediately recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, Amy,\" the Doctor said.  Amy turned around, annoyance plastered all over her tired face as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Amy said as the Doctor approached waving his screwdriver at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yes, yes, definitely something, somebody's put something in you, or something's put something in you, hard to tell right now,\" the sonic screwdriver gave off some whirring sounds which the Doctor seemed to partially recognize.  \"They're emitting waves, yes, waves attuned to your own human brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy spread her arms, \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't tell what they are yet, but maybe if I send out a counterwave we can at least see what happens when we cancel them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked more confused than ever.  The Doctor adjusted something on his sonic screwdriver.  He waved it over Amy.  In seconds, he saw the dull, tired expression drop from her face.  Her feet shifted, spreading apart a little.  Her hands went to her belly, squeezing it in her sweater, then letting it go, hovering over it.  She squinted, pursing her lips, then her mouth and eyes opened as wide as possible.  She was on decibel from shouting, and the Doctor couldn't tell whether her primary emotion was anger, fear, or equal combination of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" she said, trying to keep her cool.  Her eyes looked down at her stomach, having to pass her swollen breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Amy, clearly something's been done to you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a blimp!\" Amy suddenly shouted, once again grabbing her stomach, gripping it through her tight sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad yet-\" the Doctor said, contemplating that maybe he should have done a little research into this first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell has happened to me?\" she was yelling now.  Thoughts of all the eating she had done lately drifted through her mind, and she in part realized that she had done this to herself, even if something forced her to do it.  That actually made it even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry, we'll sort this out,\" the Doctor said authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's face crinkled as if she were holding back tears, at which point she reached up to feel her bloated cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Doctor, I'm a whale, a pig!

The larger Amy got, the harder it would be to fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a trip to Arcateen III, Amy?\" the Doctor said, sidling up to Amy, almost bumping into one of her wider hips. She popped open the can and took a sip, holding the weird, jiggly snack in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds familiar, doesn't it?\" Amy said, still annoyed, still with that dull, tired look on her face. \"Weren't you just talking about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was!\" the Doctor said, excited Amy remembered something. She seemed momentarily confused, but then simply rubbed her tummy, took a large swig of alien soda, and belched loudly.  The Doctor rushed to the control room and set the TARDIS to go right to the Arcateen system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy followed behind. She tugged on her sweater. It was long enough to cover her swollen middle, but tight enough that it still showed off how soft she was getting. The only thing it hid was how close her jeans button was to popping off for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned on a railing, still tugging at her sweater with a vaguely confused look on her face like she couldn't understand why it didn't feel right. The TARDIS was already materializing on the Arcateen III surface. He checked a receiver to see what signals were coming through. Very little, it turned out, as predicted. The Arcateen atmosphere might not block out all electromagnetic waves, but it got the bulk of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat that,\" the Doctor said, but too late. Amy had popped the strange jello-like thing into her mouth and swallowed. The Doctor cringed. He wasn't entirely sure what it was but thought he should have remembered something about that particular item of food. Amy patted her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp, excuse me,\" she covered her mouth while still holding her stomach. The Doctor stared at her until it made her uncomfortable. \"What?\" she said, annoyed, still holding onto her stomach which was now making some rather strange noises that she seemed to not notice at all. Then the Doctor remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, that was human food all right. Very high calorie, very dense, meant to pack a lot of energy into a small space. Not really supposed to be eaten like a snack. How do you feel?\" the Doctor went right from exposition mode to concern mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Why are we here, Doctor?\" Amy said. She was leaning against the railing near the TARDIS console, holding her growling, churning stomach in both hands. It bubbled a little forward. Amy lurched, but her expression of shock was short lived. Whatever waves were going into her brain were taking a while to wear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably good for another five pounds . . .\" the Doctor said cautions. Amy's eyes widened slowly as he mouth dropped open. With a loud gurgle and a resounding ping, her jeans popped open under her sweater. She grabbed her puffy tummy in both hands just in time for it to round out further, her sides stretching both her jeans and sweater as her lovehandles took another hit. Amy screamed, looked at the Doctor, then back to her stomach, and screamed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Amy, now that we're here we are blocking the signals to your brain-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smacked the Doctor upside the head, causing him to reel away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me <i>eat</i> that knowing it'd make me even <i>fatter</i>?\" she yelled, hitting him in the shoulder this time. She had awakened just in time to feel new fat forming under her skin, and it was not pleasant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot and I didn't think you'd eat anything in sight,\" the Doctor said, backing off. \"Look, whatever was making you eat and, ah, grow yourself, it's being blocked while we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief,\" Amy said angrily. She yanked at her jeans. They were far too tight. Her thighs and ass felt crammed in them. Even her increasingly tight sweater was comfortably loose in comparison. \"What's doing this to me, Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a question-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why? Why would anybody want . . . this?\" she spread her arms to indicate her fattened figure. She didn't need to look in a mirror to know that she was a few pounds from chubby, if not there already. And if chubby felt like this, she really didn't want to know what fat felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry, Amy, you have the best minds at work on this,\" the Doctor said, strutting around her, glancing with an amused look at Amy's widened backside, \"While in the Arcateen atmosphere no signals from space can get through without heavy distortion. If something is doing this on purpose, it's going to have to come right to us.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm still hungry!\" Her love handles bad started to peek over the waistband of her way-too-small jeans, giving her a, rather cute, muffintop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arcateen III? Well, yes and no. Yes, in that you're PROBABLY not being forced to shove confections down your gullet at a constant rate. No, in that the atmosphere of Arcateen can't stop you from ACTUALLY being hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, what CAN stop me from actually being hungry?\" she inquired, angrily taking another swig of her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't really stop that\" the good Doctor started, \"but I can try to keep your mind off it.\" He started walking to the doors of the TARDIS. Amy followed. \"How about a look at some Arcatinian culture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded begrudgingly. \"Alright.\" She tossed her now empty can on the floor. \"I'll, uh, pick that up later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two opened up the doors, and were immediately greeted by loud jazzy music. They stepped out into the nosy streets of Arcatavia, the largest city on their planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS PLACE IS REALLY LOUD!\" Amy yelled, her voice muted by the music and chatter of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, NO LOST AND FOUND! NOT ON THIS PLANET!\" The Doctor obviously didn't hear her right, and Amy didn't hear him. \"ARCATEEN III IS A PLANET OF MUSICIANS, IN COMPARISON TO IV, WHICH HAS ARTISTS, AND II, WHICH IS FULL OF YOUTUBERS! ARCATEEN V IS UNINHABITED, AND I DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT ARCATEEN I!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, THE MUSIC IS GREAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor realized talking just wouldn't work so he just started walking, and Amy was following closely. The people all looked like they were made of water, they're interior systems being completely visible. Nonetheless, Amy found a way to bump into every single one she passed, no doubt because of her significantly wider hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to a clearing, she was able to see the phenomenon that was the sky on their planet: completely black, but with three suns. If the music wasn't as deafening as it was, The Doctor would have told her about how the sky is black because of the extremely dense stratosphere, and that she'd be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the clearing, a throbbing pain entered Amy's head. \"DOCTOR!\" He didn't hear, as he just kept walking. \"DOCTOR!!!\" Again, no response. Before she could get a third 'Doctor' out, she stopped in her tracks. A glossy look covered her eyes, as before, and one thought rushed through her head: food. She split off from The Doctor's trail and started heading for the smell of food. The Doctor, oblivious to his companion's detour, continued on, stupidly pointing out attractions to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her own way through the crowd, her sense of smell finally brought her to a building with odd characters on their sign. '\u00b6&lt;\u00b5~\u00b0\u00f0\u00df' \"Must be French or something\" she thought. She opened the doors and the smell of food blasted her in the face as much as the music from earlier. It smelled like heaven. She walked inside and let the doors swing shut. The quaint little restaurant was significantly quieter, and Amy could finally hear herself think. Granted all she was thinking, really, was 'food' but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of the water people greeted her. \"Junbaar colinkwa ecurecu quidasta te! Homarshta enslabadabass yum'po!\" is what he would have said if the TARDIS translator wasn't working. \"Ah, a new face! Welcome friend. We love having off-worlders come in to try our cuisine.\" The Arcatanian led Amy to an alien looking table. \"Come, sit, and I will bring you one of our finest meals, free of charge!\" Amy sat her plush rear down in the chair, a few inches of flab hanging off each edge. A few moments later, the friendly Arcatanian returned with an excellent cut of Arcatese sky rhino prime rib. It was bright blue. \"Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd enjoy she would, as she dug right into the blue meat. It cut like a not knife through butter, and it melted in her mouth. It was EASILY the best meat she'd ever tasted, second only to the giant salmon of New New New New New York. Bite after bite of the bright meat entered her gullet, and soon enough, she'd finished the whole thing. 24 oz. of prime rib had made their way to her stomach, and it'd find its way elsewhere on her body as well. Moments after finishing, her body started absorbing the meat into her OWN meat. Her already huge gut started to recede, only to be replaced with jiggly blubber. Finally done putting up with Amy's tummy, her sweater rode all the way up the pale globe, and with the way it was filling out, she'd never be able to tug it down again. Resting on her belly was her mammaries, and the mammaries they were. Her boobs had quickly risen through the ranks of bra size, quickly passing B, C, D, making it up to DD size. Her bra was cutting into her back fat badly, and threatened to snap if her breasts grew any more. Down south, though, was where most of the prime rib went. Her hips had flared outwards even more, letting more than a few inches peer over the edge of her seat. Her booty had grown into a full fledged badonkadonk. Each cheek was well past basketball size, and a gaping hole had ripped down the middle. Her thighs matched up with her ass, the cellulite coated pillars wide enough to rival tree trunks. She'd finally passed chubby and made it to fat. And her fattening wouldn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your prime rib, ma'am? Would you like some desert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have desert?\" the fatter girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid! Tonight, we have an Apalapucian Cheesecake, drizzled with light chocolate, and Desperusian Sundae with a side of Kinjanan Graham Crackers. Which will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, could I get both?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes! In fact, I wouldn't have it any other way. I'll be right back.\" He left to retrieve her desert, and an evil smirk spread across her face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor, still prowling the streets of Arcatavia, was getting further and further away from the restaurant Amy was currently feasting in, and completely unaware of what lie ahead for her. After some time though...</span></div></div>",

But don't worry, Amy-\" the Doctor, still yelling, turned to find a surprised-looking Arcateenian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran back the way he came, cursing himself. He was distracted by the loud, vibrant city and let his natural enthusiasm get the better of him. Fortunately, Amy couldn't have gotten far, not in her fattened state. He looked around where he had last been certain she was there. Left, nothing, right, nothing. He grabbed a local. He spoke slowly and carefully, known that even the TARDIS' powerful translator would only be working minimally in the Arcateen atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see an alien woman around here? Pale, red hair, a little on the plump side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody like that went into Hormahsta's,\" he said, pointing, and he Doctor ran through the nearby door of a small, cozy restaurant. He first noticed a pleasant, smiling hostess, then noticed she was only mirroring the glee of her boss who was virtually clapping his hands in excitement as he placed a giant, ice-creamed covered cake in front of Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poor Amy,\" the Doctor said. In that short time Amy had already grown. She had now completely outgrown her clothing. Her legs, once long and slender, were now at least three times their original width and looked stubby attached to her wide, plush hips. Her belly was round, globular even, and only look smaller next to her oddly bloated breasts crammed into her sweater. The weight was mostly going to her lower half, tapering off so that her face, while softer, was not nearly as fat as the rest of her. She had the dull, tired look from before, but a faint smile was on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" she said taking a fork to the desert. She moaned, her eyes fluttering, as she ate. This was clearly having a stronger effect on her dulled mind than the mass produced junk food from the vending machines on the TARDIS. She let on hand rub her engorged tummy as she gave a thumbs up to the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have never been so honored!\" the alien said. The Doctor could only see that they were simply so flattered by Amy's love of their food that they had no idea how much it was harming her. He rushed forward, holding out his psychic paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Health inspector!\" he said, waving it around. \"Here to inspect the health! What do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy rolled her eyes, then took another large bite, her eyes continued to roll further back as an orgasmic look crossed her face. \"D-Doctor, this is so good. Why are you even here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'am, we need to test this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" the owner yanked the Doctor's paper away, then threw it back at him. The Doctor frowned. Of course the psychic paper, relying on subtle, close-range psychic waves, would be useless on Arcateen. \"You can't come in here bothering my customers! The lady is simply enjoying her meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-mmmm!\" Amy said, her cheeks puffed up with food. She nodded vigorously, parts of her body shaking that had never shaken before, then patted her belly to release a little belch. \"Just let me finish then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she enjoying it?\" the Doctor said sternly. He aimed his sonic screwdriver at Amy, concentrating hard to get the setting just right. He only needed to break this mental hold on her long enough to get her back to the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept stuffing her face, but the Doctor saw the change. He saw her dull eyes grow alert, that slightly smile drop, her limp hand resting on her belly suddenly grab the rolls suddenly there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schmoctor!\" she said, her mouth full, but still eating. Then, after swallowing, belched strongly enough that her she was surprised by how much her breasts jiggled. She gaped wide-eyed at them, then gasped at her exposed belly. \"DOCTOR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Amy, let's pay the man-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH!\" Amy screamed, grabbing the sides of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Amy, you had a nice meal-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the owner, trying to stand but falling out of her chair on her soft, enormous ass. Her jeans shredded further, leaving her pale, cellulate-ridden legs bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me?\" she yelled at him. She stood up, almost knocking the table over as she seemed incapable of taking in her new weight. Had she not been half naked, the Doctor thought she would have looked even more imposing than a normal, thin Amy ever would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cook you a nice meal, why so angry?\" the owner looked from Amy to the Doctor, confused, defiant. \"You don't want to finish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor saw it before Amy felt it. Her belly growled, her eyes darted to the unfinished desert. She looked helplessly at the Doctor who still aimed the sonic screwdriver at her, fending off whatever mental control was coming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, more than anything,\" Amy said with a whimper as she grasped at her roaring belly.</span></div></div>",

Her jeans tore a little more down the sides. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver aimed at her, was estimating her weight at around 180. The thin young woman he knew was no a chubby, pear-shaped eating machine. She gritted her teeth and pushed herself away from the table, heading to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" she said, to the shocked faces of the restaurateurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, our foods not good enough for you?\" but their voices were drowned out by the deafening music outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor latched onto Amy's softer hand as he pulled her through the streets. This had been a disaster. He felt her stop at one point, and turned to see her, glassy eyed, stuffing a approximation of a chicken leg into her mouth. She moaned, not that you could hear it, and her belly quivered, expending sides with her hips every so slightly. This, as Amy's wide eyes indicated, woke her up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET ME OUT OF HERE!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M TRYING BUT YOU TO STOP EATING!\" the Doctor yelled, dragging her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's mind kept going in and out of awareness. Whatever was being transmitted into her brain was fighting hard to keep control. Amy found the best way to fight it, and ignore the gnawing hunger it brought, was to focus her how her belly and breasts jumped up and down each step, how running was so much harder than it used to be suddenly, and her hips were swaying her back and forth more than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pointed to an alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE TARDIS IS THERE! WE'RE ALMOST HOME FREE!\" he knew it was half true. Once on the TARDIS they would still have Amy's growing problem to deal with. \"AND WE SHOULD HURRY! I THINK WE JUST RAN OUT ON YOUR TAB!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snorted as the sounded lessened in the alley as they approached the TARDIS. \"I'm positive I don't have the cash on me to pay for whatever I just ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor snickered, \"Nobody carries that much money on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy threatened to smack him again. \"Do <i>not</i> make fun of me right now, Doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey closed the door behind them and the sound died away. Amy held her head in her hands. She slowly walked to a bench near the center of the control room and sat down. Her ass spread out under her, tearing her jeans completely off finally. Her belly squished out in front of her, as did her breasts. With her puffy cheeks and double chin forming, she looked almost nothing like her old self. She growled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do? I can feel it in my head and I'm doing all I can to fight it,\" she said. \"What if it never stops? I'm already a whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor put on his comforting, take charge tone as he knelt next to her. \"I'm sorry, Amy, this was a bad idea. Horrible idea. I knew Arcateen food had undesirable effects on humans from past experiences, but I thought if we could stop whatever is being transmitted into you it wouldn't matter. Even without this . . . brain . . . transmitting thing I shouldn't have brought you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat straight up and patted her bulbous belly. \"This is a little more than undesirable, Doctor. I think I almost got stuck walking through the door. Why would someone want to do this to me? To anyone!\" Amy felt a stabbing pain in her head grow. She grunted and held it tight, \"D-doctor, I can't fight it much longer . . . aaaaaaaah . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot deaf to her pleas, the Doctor was still engrossed in his own thoughts. He had no idea why someone would want to fatten up his companion. If they wanted to, they certainly arranged for quite a clever trap. Fattening her in such a way that the first thought would be to block out the waves, and that the Doctor's first idea on how to do that would be to come to this particular planet with food that had an almost instantly fattening effect on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that could be one big coincidence, and that whatever was going after Amy might be doing so with no consideration for the Doctor's presense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he could already tell that once that happened, there would be nothing that could protect him from Amy's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Doctor,\" Amy said, still clutching her head. \"I n-need something to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's stomach wouldn't stop growling with hunger. It was rumbling, gurgling, and jiggling all at once. She looked down at her stomach, craning her neck to see past her swollen breasts, and couldn't help but be shocked at the size of it. Amy's stomach was the size of a globe and wouldn't quiet down it's needs for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hauled herself to her feet, and moaned as she could feel her fatter butt cheeks wouldn't stop jiggling for a solid five seconds after she got up. She walked over to the Doctor, fought very hard to ignore the fact she was almost waddling, and faced the Doctor. The Doctor, however was fighting really hard to ignore the fact that Amy's swollen stomach and fat butt were completely on display in her ruined outfit. While Amy tried not to cry when she finally noticed that even her hands had a bit of fat on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be something we can do.\" Amy said. \"We can find out who is doing this to me before i get too big, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, probably,\" The Doctor nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good enough for me,\" Amy said. \"What we should probably do is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's next words were cut off by herself this time as whatever was making her so hungry then added something else to her besides brainwaves.

She jumped and stared at the Time Lord, shock written on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the Doctor asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was about to say yes, but she didn't know that herself. The hunger had decreased a little bit, but she could feel something else growing in her mind. It took her a while to figure out what that thing was, but once she did, she couldn't deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Amy realized she had gone silent again. She looked at the Doctor again, but a question had formed in the back of her mind. One she couldn't ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much to i weigh now?\" Amy asked the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver and started scanning her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we were in that diner,\" The Doctor said as he worked. \"I estimated your weight at 180 pounds. Then you had that chicken leg.\" He said nervously as he finished scanning her. He checked the results. \"You are now... 181 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor went silent as Amy took in the news. After a few seconds, she realized that the Doctor was expecting her to yell at him or something. Although, for the first time all day, she didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a mirror?\" Amy asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was surprised by the unexpectedness of the question. Nevertheless, he pressed a few buttons on the console, and a full length mirror sprouted from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took one look in the mirror at her new body and her jaw dropped. The young, modelesque kissogram she classified herself as was long gone, and in its place was a fat, redheaded pear. Her cheeks were noticeably fatter and she was close to having a permanent double chin. However, Amy's face wasn't the problem. Everything below it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, her breasts had engorged themselves, straining her A cup bra within an inch of its life with her new double Ds. Admittedly, though, when she had first woken up from having her mind dulled, she was a little excited that she could now classify her breasts as tits. Her arms seemed to have grown as well as the sleeved of her extra tight sweater made her arms uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good amount of weight, though, had gone to her bulbous middle. Her stomach swelled outwards so that she looked several months pregnant. Although, Amy figured the only thing she would be pregnant with would be a food baby. Her belly jiggled every time one of her feet while she was walking, and her love handles personally made sure her sweater couldn't fit over it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majority of her weight, though, went to Amy's lower half. What was the name of those horrible reality show people from America? The Kardashians? Well, whoever they were, Amy's fat ass out shined the size any of theirs. Her butt cheeks were each the size of a soccer ball and made her ass more classified as a full fledged badonkadonk, something that excited Amy. Her legs, once long and slender, were barely recognizable anymore as her thighs touched no matter how much of her stance she widened, even to the point where fat spread down to her ankles. Amy's hips were noticeable wider as now, she had the movie trope \"Hartman's Hips,\" something mostly seen in cartoons where a female character had hips wider than their shoulders. She knew it wouldn't be long before her hips gave her trouble fitting in doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stared at her new adipose in awe, not believing she had gotten this fat so fast.The feeling she had in the back of her head eventually showed itself once she turned her back towards the mirror, looked behind her and got a good look at her ass. This time, she was able to classify the feeling. It was a mixture of joy and excitement out of seeing her fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood there for so long staring at her new form that she completely forgot about the Doctor. At least until he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pond, don't you think we should do something so we can stop you from gaining weight?\" The Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Amy said, now looking at the Doctor. \"We're not doing anything to get rid of any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then dragged her hands up her swollen stomach to show what she was talking about. She only confused the Doctor, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Amy...\" The Doctor said. \"May i ask, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well come clean,\" Amy said, shrugging her shoulders (which made her new cleavage jiggle for a solid few seconds). \"I am a new FA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor still looked confused at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FA stands for Fat Admirer,\" Amy translated. \"It basically means that while most women find being skinny being attractive, I find being fat attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor slowly took in her words.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Doctor entered the kitchen, seeing Amy already in there, going through the fridge (admittedly, this had been the norm for the past few months now). The sight of Amy frankly gobsmacked the Doctor. The thin young woman he once knew had been replaced by a chubby, pear shaped, eating machine. Her face had gained a noticeable amount of weight, telling by her double chin and round cheeks. However, Amy's face wasn't the problem, everything below it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had swelled to the extent of her increasing two whole bra sizes, and shook and wobbled as she walked, which excited Amy. Admittedly, she did have a good amount of back fat to go with her chest, but she accepted it. Her stomach had swelled out, eclipsing her feet in a big jiggly mess. When she was full, it made her look six months pregnant. Her stomach had given her a nice set of love handles that could be seen even in the loosest of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, none of this held a candle to Amy's lower half. It seems like at least half of the weight Amy gains goes to her hips, butt, and thighs. Her butt was the biggest out of all her proportions. It was a big jiggly mess that stretched out all her jeans, leaving her in a pair of yoga pants, which were clearly short termed as the seams were stretched and her underwear was outlined across the back. Amy's thighs had grown thick but jiggly, to the point where they resembled tree trunks and rubbed together as she walked. Her hips had expanded to the point where they were as wide as her shoulders, and caused her to have trouble fitting in seats, going through doors, and pulling her pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from the Doctor's perspective, she was oblivious to all of this, as she never could stop eating the delicious alien food he had in the TARDIS kitchen. Last week, she was accidentally given some food from a race that had an instantly fattening affect on humans. That really helped her grow into how she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor figured that Amy had been living in depression without knowing why for far too long, and it was time for her to go back to normal. He approached Amy, having practiced how the conversation might go down in his head twelve times now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Amy was too concerned with deciding from the contents of the fridge to notice the Doctor. At least, until he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Doctor,\" Amy said, looking into the fridge again for something to eat. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine..\" the Doctor said, preparing his words. \"... See, we need to talk about something, Pond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Amy nodded, not really paying attention, too busy staring inside the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, i think you've been depressed for a little too long,\" the Doctor said. \"It might be time for us to start adventuring again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, okay,\" Amy said, subconsciously rubbing her swollen stomach, looking through the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" the Doctor said. \"So shall we just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis excitement quickly dismissed as he saw Amy had barely even moved a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, are you listening to me?\" The Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Amy mumbled. \"Do i want the ice cream or the frozen yogurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis annoyed the Doctor. Random people he could deal with ignoring him, as they usually did. But his friends never ignored him when he was trying to talk. It always made him angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!\" the Doctor snapped. \"Can you stop looking through the fridge for a moment so i can tell you you've gotten fat and you need to lose the weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blurted it all out before he had a chance to realized what he was saying. He then quickly covered his mouth, hardly believing he had just said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it was that that got Amy's attention. She closed the door to the fridge and looked at the Doctor, her eyes wide, and her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Amy do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Doctor silently stands still and wait for Amy's reaction. He was definitely scared. After all, in the past, Amy had done some pretty bad things to people who so much as insulted the Scottish, but they never said that she was fat. This might have been the Doctor's imagination, though, but he thought Amy looked even more intimidating now than she ever did skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Doctor waited for Amy to explode at him, Amy rubbed her swollen stomach and closed her mouth. Then, her face formed into the biggest smile he had ever seen on her in his life. She rubbed her belly even more as she prepared to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor!\" Amy said, her hands running up and down her body. She looked down at her stomach, which made her cran her neck to see past her swollen breasts. \"I've been hoping you would say something about it for the last month now. Looks like i finally got fat enough to break down your rational side that didn't want to insult people. Nice job, though, not saying anything for so long. Most blokes don't last a week before saying something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy talked, the Doctor grew more and more confused by her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure i understand,\"the Doctor said. \"Haven't you been gaining weight because of the depression?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Amy laugh so hard most of her body jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Amy laughed. \"The depression didn't make me fat. I did this to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she could tell that the Doctor was more confused than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought this was happening to me without me noticing?\" Amy asked. \"Very unlikely. I'm up to 180 pounds. Well, that's what it said last week. I uh, can't exactly see the scale anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor could hear actual pride in her voice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean,\" the Doctor began. \"That you've been doing this to yourself on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you get it,\" Amy said. She smacked her ass, and laughed as it took a really long time to stop jiggling. \"It's a fetish that I've had for a couple of years now, but never gave in to because of society's definition of beautiful. Cause, see, in my mind...\" She grabbed her swollen stomach and shook it, causing a jiggling mess. \"...This is beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" the Doctor said. \"Admittedly, when i imagined this conversation in my head, you were having a completely different reaction to being called fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what happens when you call a willing fat girl fat,\" Amy said. \"She likes it and thanks you for finally using that word. Still, though, nice job waiting so long finally using it. You would be liked by the fat women of Britain. But as you actually did use the word, you're all right with me, too. I mean, i have a really nice pear shape.\" Her hand went to her butt. \"Just look at the size of my bum!\" Amy said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was getting a bit of an understanding of what Amy was talking about, but his mind was still plagued with questions; How long had she felt like this? When did she decide it was time to get fat? How big did she plan to get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one thing, though, Doctor,\" Amy said, rubbing her belly and slapping her fat ass at the same time.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't affect anything outside of the Vortex, but people inside could be stuck for years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we are stuck for god knows how long in the vortex?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But don't worry! The TARDIS has so many things to do that if you took every living thing in the universe, stuck them into the TARDIS and had them do everything, it would take 20,000,000 years for them to see it all. And as for food and water, the TARDIS never runs out as it produces it's own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that makes me feel better, but what if I got lost exploring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was what I was going to talk to you about next. Give me your wrist.\" Clara reached out and gave the Doctor her wrist. He put a watch on it. \"Now, this watch has a built in teleported that will automatically teleport you to the main console room. It also has a communicator built in so you and I can talk to each other. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure.\" Clara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now run along and have fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Clara replied as she walked towards the hallway. She was happy.
