Identify yourself or be fired upon!\" The CAG then heard a reply over the wireless:\"Galactica Actual, this is the Earth ship Continuum Est. I'd very much like to meet with you, Commander. Permission to dock in your portside landing bay?\" The entire CAG was immediately stunned to hear that this ship came from, of all places, <i><b>Earth</b></i>. Adama then recovered, and answered the Continuum Est:\"Continuum Est, you are clear to dock.\" He then spoke to the entire Colonial fleet:\"Attention all ships, the unknown vessel claims to be from the planet <i>Earth</i>. I say again, we have encountered an <i>Earth</i> vessel!\" The entire Colonial fleet was stunned into silence, then broke out into massive celebrations as they realized that they have found part of the Thirteenth Tribe. Back in Galactica's CAG, the crewmen were still cheering when Deana announced to Commander Adama:\"Sir, I'm receiving a signal from our alert Vipers. You should hear this, sir!\" Adama picked up the phone, and said:\"Galactica, Actual, go ahead.\" \"Sir, you should see this thing! It's bigger than any ship I've ever seen, and you should see these fighters!\" Adama was puzzled, and asked:\"Kat, what fighters? DRADIS isn't picking up anything other than the one Earth ship.\" Kat paused a moment, then replied:\"Sir, did you just say this huge thing came from <i>Earth</i>?! I got to admit, sir, that makes a lot of sense; these birds look more advanced than ANYTHING we've probably even thought of!\" Then, Deana interrupted:\"Sir, the Earth ship's shuttle has landed in the port docking bay.\" Adama:\"Good. Saul, notify Colonial One and alert the President that she should be there when we meet these people.\" Colonel Tigh acknowledged him:\"Right, Bill, I'll tell her.\" Commander Adama and Colonel Tigh then proceeded to the docking bay, and were joined by President Laura Roslin along the way:\"So, we've finally found someone from Earth. Now that we know it <i>does</i> exist, hopefully this ship will be able to take us there. What did the captian say it was called, again?\" Adama answered her:\"The <i>Continuum Est</i>. Strange name, but we <i>have</i> been apart our entire histories, so the Thirteenth was probably <i>bound</i> to be completely different from us.\" They reached the docking bay to see the giant, heavily armed Earth shuttle land. The crew of the entire deck had come with the three of them to witness the twelve worlds' first contact with the Thirteenth Tribe...</span></div></div>",

The Colonials noticed that the Earth men's armor each a an odd, two-headed golden eagle on their torsos. The brown-haired man stepped off the shuttle, extending his hand to the President, saying:\"Good to meet you, ma'am, Commander, you may call me the Stranger, for now.\" Adama, curious, asks:\"Why are you called the Stranger? And, why are you people all wearing armor? And why are you the only one with their helmet off?\" The Stranger answered the Commander:\"I am called that because it's my favorite title and the others would freak you out. We all wear armor because it's cool and protects us better than your flak jackets ever could. As to why I'm the only Earth man here NOT wearing a helmet, it's because you WON'T like what you see under their helmets.\" Laura Roslin then interrupted, also curious:\"Why? I mean, what's the problem?\" The Stranger answered her:\"Well, Madame President, they look <i>just like me</i>, and ARE me! Want to see? Boys, show 'em your faces, if you please!\" The Earth men in the shuttle then removed their helmets to show that the Stranger was, in fact, telling the truth! Several of Galactica's crew immediately fainted, and Adama shouted:\"CYLONS!\" Every armed Colonial in the bay drew their guns and aimed at the identical Earth men. The Stranger put up his hands in alarm, saying:\"Whoa, whoa! Look, we're NOT Cylons, okay? Yes, we know about the frakking skinjob imitators in your fleet, but we're SO NOT THEM. We've actually been CHASING the damned bastards all over this half of the galaxy, AND we can PROVE that we're fully human, alright? Now, may I please get a tour of your ship before someone here blows my FUCKING head off?! Hmmm? It won't hurt for you to just let me look around, now could it? In the meantime, the other mes here will be happy to answer your questions and compare our two peoples' technology, if you're curious.\" Adama answered hi:\"Sure, it couldn't hurt. Come with us, then, Stranger.\" The Stranger then answered:\"Great! I'll be waiting for you outside, then\", and walked out of the hanger bay. Adama then pointed to two marines nearby:\"You two, stay on this guy AT ALL TIMES, understand? Now, let's go.\" The President, Adama, and their marines then walked out to catch up with the Stranger. The identical Earth men then announced to the fuming Colonials below them:\"Attention, crew of the Galactica and you other people, we will now take any questions you may have!\" With that, the entire room began clamoring to ask questions of the men from Earth.</span></div></div>",
