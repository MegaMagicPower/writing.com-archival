They come in all sizes and have the ability to make fantasy characters real. However, the technology is rare and only a few people know about the organization, even fewer actually work for it. Though their goals are unclear, their technology has proven to be successful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick, an incredibly intelligent scientist was one of the few that worked with the organization. One of his most critical jobs was to ensure the devices didn't fall into the wrong hands. However, that didn't stop him from delivering devices to people he trusted the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne Friday morning, Nick had decided to drop off a device to his friend's family. He rode in an ice cream truck that was owned by the company and stopped at the address. He left the box on the doorstep, leaving a message on the package that said \"Have fun.\" Nick rang the doorbell and ran to his truck, driving away before anybody noticed him. A person inside started to wake up, hearing the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is this person that will find the package?</span></div></div>",

He was currently home alone as his older sister, Olivia, was currently at college and his mother, Rebecca, was currently at work <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother was 47 years old with long brown hair and brown eyes. Rebecca was a bit playful and loved to write adventure stories. She had always imagined going on one herself. She loved her children a lot and loved to spend time with them in many ways. She protected and helped her children whenever she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon\u2019s sister, Olivia, was 20 years old with short brown hair and blue eyes. She was hard working and did her best in school. Olivia liked to visit her family as she temporarily lived in the college dorms. She typically visited her family once every month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon currently didn\u2019t have school today so he got to stay home. He walked to the door and looked to see who rang the doorbell, only to find that nobody was there. However, he did find a mysterious package on the doorstep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm? Now what could this be?\u201d Damon softly said to himself. He saw the note and didn\u2019t think anything of it, bringing the package in. He put in on the table and unwrapped it, revealing a new green GameCube. Damon was excited and quickly plugged the device in. He wasn\u2019t sure how to put games in it (as it didn\u2019t look like it had an opening like a normal one) but he was excited to use it. Once it was plugged in and he turned it on, a sweet female voice started to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings user. Congratulations on your new fantasy shrinking device. This version can make any Nintendo character appear at any size you wish. There is also a program to shrink yourself or others around you. Please select your choice user.\u201d The device said. Damon was amazed, though had doubts it was correct. Still, he saw no harm in trying it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing he was able to choose was which series he wanted to look at. After looking through his options, he chose\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Damon chose the twilight princess herself. Midna was incredibly beautiful and (in his opinion) the best partner in the series. He chose her size to be 4 inches. He was also able to pick whether or not Midna got to keep her powers. After a minute of deciding, he chose to let her keep her teleportation and her floating abilities. He also gave her the ability to switch between her two forms at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he hit complete, the top of the machine opened, raising an antenna. It suddenly fired a beam at the floor, making Midna in her true form appear (currently unconscious). Once it was done, the antenna lowered back into the device and closed up. Damon was astonished that it worked. He carefully picked her up and looked at her. She looked just like how she did in the video game and was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it actually happened!\u201d Damon said quietly. He took her to the kitchen and set her down on the table. He then started to make a PB&amp;J for her. As he was doing so, thoughts ran through his head of the possibilities. He also had no idea how it was even possible, but he didn\u2019t question science as it was probably a bad idea. He finished the sandwich and put it on the table. He then set Midna on the sandwich so she had a soft bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d Midna mumbled, starting to wake up. Damon smiled as the shrunken girl sat up rubbing her eyes. \u201cWhere\u2026am I?\u201d Midna asked. She looked up to suddenly notice the giant in front of her. Normally, someone would be afraid. However, Midna was different as she had faced the king of evil one on one before and had even almost died multiple times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello there, my name is Damon.\u201d The giant said. Midna calmly stood up and stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings, my name is Midna. Where did you take me, and why?\u201d The twilight princess asked, not showing fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my home. I brought you here so we could have fun and be friends. I even made you something to eat.\u201d Damon said, gesturing to where she was standing. Midna frowned and started to get a little upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you wanted me to be your friend, why did you capture me and put me on the food? You want to eat me, don\u2019t you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m sorry, I put you there so you had food and a comfortable place to rest. Please, can we be friends?\u201d Damon asked. Midna started at him for a second before sighing. She was able to tell he was being sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, but tell me what exactly you are planning to do with me.\u201d Midna said. Damon gave a warm smile.</span></div></div>",

He was still asleep and looked so peaceful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer husband was 48 years old with short brown hair and brown eyes. Josh loved video games and played them often. He also worked at a library and liked good stories. He brought his family to work often so they could get into the habit of reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet also had 2 kids, Tim and Samantha, both 15 years old. Tim had short black hair with brown eyes and Samantha had long brown hair with green eyes. The two kids loved doing things together and stuck by each other a lot. Though they didn\u2019t work very hard in school, they still helped around the house, playing games as they worked like hide and seek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet kissed her husband and climbed out of bed. She was still naked from last night\u2019s fun, but she didn\u2019t think it mattered since it was only 4:30 in the morning (which made her confused as to why someone rang the doorbell).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to the door and opened it a little. She didn\u2019t see anyone, but there was a small package on the ground. She picked it up and brought it to the basement. Violet opened it to find it contained a green GameCube. The woman became confused as it didn\u2019t see like a normal one. She plugged it into the tv that was in the basement and turned it on. Suddenly, a female voice spoke on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings user. Congratulations on your new fantasy shrinking device. This version can make any Nintendo character appear at any size you wish. There is also a program to shrink yourself or others around you. Please select your choice user.\u201d Violet stared for a moment before giggling. She thought that this was just some sort of new game that Josh ordered and that it meant appear on the screen. Violet decided to go along with it, as she wanted to get better at video games for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed the screen showed multiple series that she had to choose from. Though she wasn\u2019t entirely familiar with them, she decided to pick\u2026</span></div></div>",

The machine buzzed and opened up a small slot at the top, raising an antenna out of it. The machine shot a laser that created the tiny character within seconds. Once it was done, the machine pulled the antenna back in and closed up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViolet was astonished as she stared at the unconscious boy. She couldn\u2019t believe the machine meant bringing the character to real life. She carefully picked Pit up and inspected him. He was so cute to her, making her giggle. Suddenly, Pit stirred and woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLady Palutena? What\u2019s going on?\u201d He asked, stretching. He suddenly jumped at the sight of the naked giantess. \u201cAh! Who are you? Where\u2019s Lady Palutena?\u201d Pit asked. Violet giggled at his reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Violet. I brought you here for some fun. Don\u2019t worry about your goddess, she\u2019s safe and sound at your home. You are just so cute by the way, especially with those small wings.\u201d Violet said, carefully and lightly poking his left wing.

Lady Palutena is the one who grants me the power of flight.\u201d Pit said, embarrassed.

Just let me go so I can return to Skyworld!\u201d The giantess smiled and grabbed his feet, making him dangle. Pit started to get nervous at what the giant is planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll keep you. I\u2019ll show you to my family a bit later, but for now I want you to be\u2026</span></div></div>",
