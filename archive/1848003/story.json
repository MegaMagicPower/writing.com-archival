The sun is shining and you relax in the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father is discussing with Archius, you could hear them out of the opened window.<br>\r\n\"Archius You told me that you found a way to get rid of my problems without a risk of being detected and suspected. You know what I mean.\" Iulius said.<br>\r\n\"Yes lord, you will be very pleased. You could get rid of all the rats and they will be never seen again.\" Archius answered in a low voice and seemed not happy.<br>\r\n\"Very well. So I order you to prepare everything, today one of those rats will visit and I want to see if it really works\"<br>\r\n\"Yes my lord, Archius will do as you wish.\" with that he leaves and it was silent again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what your father meant and what kind of .. well what ever it is.. Archius had found to help your father with his problems. You decide to ask him later. It's time that you learn about your fathers work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later Sira comes to you \"Gaius, what are you doing? Your mother said that you should come inside.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah thanks Sira. I will go inside, did we have some fruits or something? I'm a hungry. Please tell Galla to bring something.\"<br>\r\n\"Sure young master, I will tell her.\" Sira bows down and went back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow her and decide to visit your father, who sits at a desk and writes a letter. \"Ah son. take a seat.\" <br>\r\nYou do as he wishes and sit down and wait for the right moment to ask him about what you've heard earlier.<br>\r\nBut before you could ask something, your friend Archius entered the room and goes to your father \"My lord I..\"<br>\r\nHe was interrupted \"Silence Archius! It's not time to talk now\" your father said with an angry voice.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry my lord. I just had finished your order\" he puts a grape on the table.<br>\r\n\"Go now Archius, we will talk later.\" The slave followed the order and leaves the room, but just in that moment Galla entered the room \"Young master your snack is ready.\" She informs you smiling and carries a plate with fruits and some other thinks and placed it carefully on the table.<br>\r\nYour father stands up and hits Galla angrily \"Who allowed you to enter my room. GO!\" <br>\r\nGalla runs out of the room and you stare at your father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIulius sits back down onto his chair and grabs some of the grapes Galla brought and eats them \"Gods.. Sorry Gaius. What was it that you wanted to talk about or did something happen?\"<br>\r\n\"Well no father I.. just wanted to visit you.\" you answer distracted.<br>\r\nYour thoughts are with Galla and what happened a moment ago.<br>\r\nThat's also the reason why you don't recognize that your father mistakes Archius special grape for an ordinary grape and eats it.<br>\r\n\"Well if that's all.. would you mind if...</span></div></div>",

So here we go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday we will travel back in time, back to the ancient Rome.<br>\r\nIn a time where the Roman Empire was at the peak of its power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll persons, names and places are fictional but related to the ancient Roman Empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are Gaius, the son of Iulius Augustus. 16 years old and born into a noble and rich family and one day you will be head of the family.<br>\r\nYour mothers name is Aurelia. <br>\r\nYou also have two sisters their names are Cornelia (older) and Claudia (younger).<br>\r\nLiving in a large patrizian villa your family owns many slaves from all around the empire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are befriend with some of the slaves. One of them is a medicus and called himself a alchemist, his name is Archius, well it's the name your father called him. <br>\r\nThere is Galla, a sweet girl at the same age as you, which works in the kitchen. <br>\r\nSira is your mothers maid, she is a bit older then you.<br>\r\nWell there are other slaves, so feel free to add your own characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main story-line is based on the accidantally transforming or shrinking of your father. He wanted a way to get rid of his enemies at the senat and their hanchman without a risk. Archius probably knows a way to let them disappeare unknown to anybody, but it backfires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease remember the story takes place in the ancient Rome. Oh and most of all, have fun!<br>\r\nSo please feel free and add some chapters <img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S.: GiftPoints are also available for your chapters</td>",
