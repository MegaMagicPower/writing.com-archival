Bowser and his minions on the other hand, weren't as fortunate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OUTTA MY WAY!\" Bowser shouted as he flings his doors open, scaring some of the koopalings, that were beaten by Mario mind you, into running out of their father's way.  He just stomped in and sat on his throne covered in bandages from the last battle he lost against Mario.  \"I hate that plumber, aaaahhh!\" he muttered as he put a bag of ice on his head in null out the pain from the hammer he got whacked with.  \"I guess the 300th time we fought Mario this month went badly again?\" said Kamek, a magikoopa, said in an annoyed tone as he appeared with a broken wand he patched together from a battle during the last line of defense and the bit of leftover star magic from Rosalina captured in a bottle after he recharged his wand with it.  \"Kamek, I thought we gone over this before!  It ALWAYS ends the same!  Every time!\"  Bowser snarled with frustration as he slams his fists on his throne.  \"Now I have to imagine that vat over there.\"  Bowser groaned pointing to it.  \"The.. the vat of b-blood?  This is kind of excessive don't you think...?  H-h-hang on...\"  Kamek muttered walking up to the vat.  \"*Sigh* I picture it being Mario's... what are you doing?\" Bowser said.  \"Uh Bowser, the star magic and wand got in the blood, it absorbed it and turned dark.  What is in that stuff, dark stardust?\" Kamek said.  \"What!? Let me see tha-! Woah...\"  Bowser exclaimed but then noticed the star magic turned a purple and black mass of it.  \"Yeah that would be dark stardust from the party games, the broken dark stars.  Why do you ask, you coming up with something?\" Bowser asked.  \"Well, now that you mention it I notice a dark star coming out of it.  I remember what it has on star magic users if they get corrupted but it was on the tip of my tongue, all I know is that powerful star magic users... change into something that can handle it better.\" Kamek said.  \"Hmm, you are definitely on to something.  Wait, star magic!? Where did you get that? I got something...\" Bowser asked.  \"Remember when I told you that you attacked when Rosalina was visiting?  I got the stuff from her...\" Kamek explained.  Bowser looked at his wand and at the mass and felt a bulb come out as he got an idea.  'YOU GENIUS! You just gave me a great idea. You and the rest of the magikoopas are leaving this castle and make sure they bring me Rosalina! IMMEDIATELY!\" Bowser commanded and went back to his throne laughing maniacally, \"Thank you and right away your majesty\" Kamek says as he left to gather the forces to find Rosalina, leaving Bowser to laugh at the thought of his new found plan \"GWA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamek appeared to find the minions recovering from their beatdown, among them is a younger magikoopa named Kappa one of his most recent masters healing the Koopalings with the other magikoopas while Kappa fiddles a bit with his wand happily, prompting a nod from Kamek as he clears his throat.  \"Alright boys and girls, we got a mission to capture the magical space princess known as Rosalina,\" Kamek called out flashing a wanted poster of Rosalina \"Now get to it!\" \"Y-yes sir.\" Kappa stammered as he went with the rest of the minions.  \"Ah... Kappa, wierd as always...\" Kamek groaned as he followed the minions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Wiggler Grove...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina watches over the wigglers as they wander the grove and took in the peace after the fight against Bowser as Kamek appeared behind her and decided to thank her for the star magic.  \"Hey Rosalina? Thanks for that star magic back there.\" Kamek stated as Rosalina turned in shock and noticed a magikoopa and a few of Bowser's minions with him.  \"What do you want now?  Has Bowser had enough of dealing with Peach's capture and decided to send you after me instead?\"  Rosalina asked as she glared at the koopas.  \"Wow that is right on the money, you really ARE smarter than you look!  I got a little glob of your magic that turned dark and would like to use YOU as an experiment with it.\" Kamek stated with a sadistic smirk, deeply disturbing Rosalina.  \"So Bowser wants to do the same to me he does to peach just so he can experiment on me!? A mother of the Lumas!? There is annoyingly evil and there is disgustingly evil! You can't take me anywhere!\" Rosalina spat at Kamek.  \"Why do you think I brought some boys with me, and the big guy behind you?\"  Kamek said pointing to something behind her.  \"Wait, what?\" Rosalina looked to find Morton shouting \"What's up guys?!\" as he slammed her head hard enough to knock her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in some horrid lab at Bowser's castle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... what happened?\" Rosalina groaned as she blinks her eyes open to find her self chained up to a wall to the point where she can barely move.  She notice Bowser looking down smugly at Rosalina.  \"Welcome to my humble abode \"princess\" Rosalina, I remember you helping Mario beat me.\" Bowser chuckled.  \"I know about the experiement with the corruption of my magic, Bowser.  What do you plan to experiment with on me?\" Rosalina demanded.  \"So Kamek told you about the experiment, at least he is helping you keep up to date.  It's ok Rosey, I am not planning on capturing Peach anymore, not until I use you to find a way to get rid of the Mario Bros first.  That way Peach and I can rule the kingdoms together without that pesky plumber and his buzzkill friends getting in my way.\" Bowser said.  \"And you want to corrupt me into serving you?!\" Rosalina snapped.  \"Corrupt you into my minion, dry you up of your magic, kill ya for good, whatever... as long as you don't interfere. Hehe, this will be interesting...\" Bowser responded with an evil smile.  Rosalina just stared on with fear, she had her wand hidden but cannot reach it at this point due to her chains and just waited as the minions chuckled and watched in anticipation as Bowser pulled something out...</span></div></div>",

Is this how it would end?  Impaled on some horrid weapon made from some corrupted form of my magic? She should have known that magic fog would come back to bite her someday, at least the princess is safe that she knew, but what about her lumas?  \"If it kills ya instead of corrupting you, well... I would be rid of you anyways, so it would be a gamble where I win either way.  So let's see what happens... hehehehe\" Bowser chuckles stomping over menacingly.  Then he laughed a hearty one as he plunged the spear right through her chest prompting an agonized yell from Rosalina as she tears up in what she thought to be her final moments.  'T-This is it' Rosalina thought...</span></div></div>",

Rosalina yells out in agony as she feel something happen to her. 'Is this the end... no, something is wrong with me!' Rosalina thought as she continues to express her pain as the spear dissolves into magic and enter her to begin the transformation.  The flesh it spreads through turns pale and cold.  \"<b>O</b>H <b>G</b>O<b>D</b> I<b>T</b> H<b>U</b>R<b>T</b>S! <b>G</b>O<b>D</b> D<b>A</b>M<b>M</b>I<b>T</b>!\" Rosalina cursed as her flesh starts tearing in her back as something grows in.  A horrible ripping sound echos as her wings sprout, resembling a skeletal bat with a membrane made of her now corrupted magic.  \"<b>Wh</b>at's <b>happ</b>ening <b>to me?!</b>\"  Rosalina cries out as her canines grow out to become sharp, full-blown fangs and her finger nails grow into claws and her hand and feet grew to appear long and monstrous.  Then a tail resembling a spine is painfully slinking out of her lower back as the rest of her back had spine tearing out.  Her final cry of suffering rang out as a hiss as her transformation complete itself and the gaping hole that spear made was closed with her ribcage pressing up against her chest as an extra ribcage burst out her sides and wrapped around her as if it were her armor.  She then just hung there, reeling from the agony she was in with a short sobbing session.  \"Ahhh, you turned out quite nicely.  I was expecting you to become morally corrupted by the darkness, but physical hurts you quite a lot didn't it?  At least that would explain the hungry demons and powerful Dry Beasts.  And it seems they have the most effect on you... BWAHAHAHAHA!\"  Bowser laughed along with his minions with the exception of Kappa who just looked on in horror and pity.  Rosalina growled a monstrous one as she glares up at Bowser with tears flowing out of her angry eyes, now red irises with slits for pupils. \"<b>You will... *hic* You will pay for this...!</b>\" Rosalina growled.  \"I am sure you will get there eventually...\" Bowser purred in a sarcastic tone, prompting another growl from Rosalina.  Bowser then pulled out a syringe and stabbed Rosalina in the neck with the tiny needle, drawing her blood.  \"We will see what Dr. Koopansheet can make out of this, <b>as for you... your services to us are done!</b>\" Bowser cackled, leaving Rosalina in a terrified state as he is prepares to burn her alive as the rest of the minions cackle at her certain doom...</span></div></div>",

GWAHAHAHA!\" Bowser laughed as he fire comes out, ready to fry a terrified Rosalina as she closes her eyes tight for the extra painful burn, especially since she is now a...  \"OH MY GOSH! MARIO IS COMING!\" Kappa shouted. \"WHAT?! HOW DID HE...?!  INTO POSITIONS...!\" Bowser shouted as a mass panic ensues, on cue for Kappa to warp over and knock the axe down, causing a wheel of chains to spin violently, stopping everyone in their tracks while Kappa runs behind Rosalina, including the Mario bros and Princess as they notice something happening to the floor.  \"Uh-oh\" Bowser said as the floor opened up like a huge trapdoor.  \"NOT AGAAAAIIN!\" Bowser shouts as he and the rest of the minions fall down into a crevice below,  the spear flying out of his grip and stabbing into the trap door.  Kappa notices the axe getting pulled back up, causing the floor to rise up to close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina open her eye to see the Mario bros. and Princess Peach instead of... where ever her kind goes.  \"<b>Mario...?  Luigi...? Peach...?</b>\" Rosalina said.  The other were shocked and terrified to see Rosalina like this.  What did Bowser do to her?!  Rosalina winces at her stomach roaring at her from within, the smells are overwhelming, of peaches and cake, of mushrooms and spaghetti, and of... ectoplasm?  Is it from that ghostly dog from that mansion he won?  It doesn't matter now, she needs to feed, but she doesn't want to hurt her friends.  \"<b>Please get away from me!</b>\" Rosalina begged.  \"What-ah happened to you?  Are you alright?\" Mario finally got the guts to ask out of concern, where did he see those eyes and fangs before...?  \"<b>PLEASE! I don't want to hurt anyone! You are not safe around me when I am like this!</b>\" Rosalina pleads, tearing up as the group heads closer to release and comfort her.  \"I got a ba-a-a-ad feeling about this...\" Luigi quivered as he starts shaking as Rosalina struggled to get away from them.  \"Rosalina what did Bowser do to you?!\" Peach asked.  She started to see what Rosalina was talking about.  \"<b>I'm hungry... I am so hungry!</b>\"  Rosalina whimpered.  \"Rosalina, if you come with us, you can eat...\" Peach was about offer, but Kappa jumped out from behind Rosalina.  \"No, she's right! That spear turned her into a vampire!\" Kappa warned.  The gang froze up, that is where those eyes came from, and what spear?  Rosalina started snarling as she threw her arms forwards, breaking her chains and lunged at Peach, hissing at her.  \"<b>I'm sorry... I can't take it anymore!</b>\" Rosalina said as she slid her dress's shoulder to reveal Peach's soft flesh, which made Rosalina drool a little.  \"<b>I won't take too much, I promise...</b>\" Rosalina moaned hungrily as she sank her fangs in her flesh and started drinking some of her blood.  \"WAAAAHAHAHA! I knew it, vampires are real!\"  Luigi panicked as he got out his hammer and ran to her.  \"Luigi! Be careful, you could...!\" Mario warned.  As soon as Rosalina removed her fangs, she turned looking for her next victim to see Luigi with an expression of pure terror as he slammed a hammer in her face.  After that her world went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario sighed and facepalmed a little, as Luigi looked over the unconscious vampire, as she reverts to her original form, the tears on her dress and dried blood still present as evidence of her transformation.  Peach wondered if the hammer killed her and tried to pick her up, only to hear her groan from the whack on the head.  \"She needs our attention, Bowser did this to her for a reason.\" Peach informed, saddened by what happened to Rosalina and annoyed that Luigi knocked her out.  \"Sorry about that.\" Luigi said kicking a floor while Peach responds with a hmph.  \"What do you mean a spear, Mr. Magikoopa?\" Mario asked.  \"Good thing the Boss made a spare so you can learn to watch out for weapons like it.\"  Kappa responds pulling a spare spear, like the one that impaled Rosalina.  \"This is made from a corrupted version of Rosalina's magic, giving off Corrupting Darkness, Type V for Vampirism in this case.  It was supposed to be a saving grace for defeating you and your brother.  Haven't really gone as far to find out how, mostly turning everyone against you, or creating a dark army.\" Kappa said with a shudder at the end.  \"Isn't this taking it a little too far...?  Turning a mother of lumas into a vampire I mean?\" Peach said with a twinge of anger in her voice because of what Bowser is willing to do.  \"Hehehehe, it could get much worse, I have a book on Ztar Magic as we call it that says it could do more than make vampires, or drypires in Rosalina's case.\" Kappa explained pulling out a tome with and angry black star with white eyes.  \"We have to take care of Rosalina, does this mean we have to be her blood source now that she is a <i>blood</i>-sucker?\" Peach asked.  \"Yes and no, provided you let her hunt animals or give her blood packs, she doesn't have to bite anyone.\" Kappa responded.  \"One more thing.  Why would you open the trap door on Bowser, your boss?  Are you worried he went too far as well or something?\" Peach asked \"We just want to teach Mario a lesson, not ruin lives or killing him or others.  Beside I would rather not live with a bunch of vampire fire-breathing turtle demons.  Apparently, being a blight on life itself is all the craze these days.\" Kappa stated.  \"True. True.  But to be fair, your boss did capture the princess and tried to take over the Mushroom Kingdom.\" Mario retorted.  Yeah well, not even sure this is about the princess anymore, he sounded much more concerned with killing you off.\" Kappa with a shrug.  \"Ok. So where are we going to bring Rosalina?\"  Luigi questioned.  Peach just stared at Rosalina, and thought about how a spear turned her into a vampire when it should have killed her like any normal weapon.  \"Poor thing...\" Peach said in a forlorn tone as she rubbed the vampire's head, earning another groan from her seemingly lifeless body then a small purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kappa...\" Bowser growled.  He knew there was something about to happen.  Mario could not have known about this, unless those toads and lumas prove to be smarter than we once thought.  But for one of his own to use them as a distraction... I should bake him up next time I see him.  Kamek was not pleased one bit, \"Lousy steward of mine, and those cockamamie Mario Bros. probably used our little experiment to rescue the Princess.  Last, time we make a mistake like that again!\"  And Rosalina, she turned into a monster when I impaled her with that spear.  Those eyes and fangs are not enough to fool the Demon King of the Koopas, but vampires can't just grow ribs out of their chest like that, nor do they usually have tails, let alone spine-like.  Rosalina already had control of her star magic from traveling space with those star-like fat boys for years, so why am I not surprised that the spear had worked especially on her.  I still have some of the normal star magic Kamek used to recharge his wand, and the blood sample from Rosalina after her transformation into a rather... special breed of vampire.  I can only imagine a vampire with such power she has now.  \"I wonder, shall we go see if Dr. Koopansheet is alright?\"  Bowser growled with malicious intention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina groaned as she started feeling something soft under her.  It made her feel happy to feel the warmth her own body lost during the transformation.  A few sweet smells floating around her, the voices telling her to find the sources and feed.  Her eyes are fluttering open as...</span></div></div>",

Her head suddenly hurt.  \"MAMA!\" small star like creatures floating and happily glomping her, assaulting her with a scent of starbits. \"Where were you?! Did Bowser kidnap you this time? That meany!\" One luma said.  \"Careful, she's not exactly normal anymore.\" a blue-eyed brown one name Polari said. \"Of course she ain't normal, our mama can do anything!\" a white one responded. \"That is not what I meant, Mario said Bowser turned her into a vampire or something.  She might still be hungry!\" Polari barked back. Rosalina cringed at that comment, I really hope this is a dream.  \"Sorry, mama! We didn't mean to upset you! We were SO WORRIED when we found out you got captured!\" a blue luma apologized.  They know everything, about my capture, about my transformation.  Not only that, but they are surprisingly calm about me being a vampire, do they know I don't want to hurt them?  \"How do you know what I have become?\" Rosalina asked a little shocked by one of her lumas saying she is a vampire.  \"You know we know, eh?  It goes a bit like this...\" Polari appeared to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes earlier, an hour after returning from Bowser's castle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn elderly toad, Toadsworth, with his brown spotted beige cap just stood there staring forlorn at the observatory to see little glows floating around from their search while comforting a brown luma Polari, he helped Rosalina keep order and raise the lumas, humanly impossible for Rosalina to handle alone, he missed her greatly, as do the other lumas visiting and circling the observatory. \"Poor little blobs must be worried sick about their mother.\" Toadsworth finally spoke to himself.  He then sighed, not only did Rosalina go missing, the Princess also met the same fate, no doubt captured by the knucklehead Bowser.  Why can't he leave them in peace for one bloody week?!  \"Toadsworth?! Toadsworth! We are safe!\" Peach called out to him.  \"Peach?  And they found Rosalina, and in poor shape?!\" Polari happily called out, only to become worried after seeing Rosalina.  Toadsworth perked up a little, at least Peach is safe.  \"Mario, you saved Peach so soon?  That's a new re...\" Toadsworth praised looking at Rosalina and was suddenly taken aback \"What the bloody hell happened to her?!  And who brought this magikoopa here?!\" Toadsworth shouted noticing that Rosalina was limp and pale, her dress torn up from her change.  \"Kappa here told us Rosalina was experimented on by Ztar Magic, in the form of a spear, by Bowser!  She may look dead...\"  Polari looks like he doesn't know what to do. \"D-DEAD?!\" Polari cried out. \"...but she is FAR from dead!  He might be up to worse than no good with those things.\"  Peach responded as Toadsworth checked her pulse to be horrified by Rosalina groaning in response despite having no pulse.  Rosalina became an undead being, a vampire?!  Bowser caused this?!?!  Toadsworth's mind is slowly being overtaken by questions on the matter.  He heard of vampire, but dark star magic, or ztar magic in their case, creating vampires, that could mean on thing.  Bowser turned her into a vampire!  This is serious!  \"I... I don't... how dare he... take it up with the lumas, we will speak with them on the subject, they would want to see their mother again, even in <i>that</i> condition.  Is anyone in there? We are going back to the Observatory!\" Toadsworth responded.  Polari confused and afraid for what is coming, Rosalina looks dead, but she groaned when he checked her pulse. \"How is she alive if her heartbeat is not present?\" Polari asked prompting a blank stare from Mario. \"It is best if we talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the Observatory...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lumas were mindlessly wandering the rooms of the Observatory waiting for any info on their search for their mother, hoping she is alright.  Polari appeared to find the lumas wandering \"Hey guys, mama is back!  She is with the Mario Bros and... well, she is... different now, but she is back.\" Polari says, causing the others to shriek for their mama as they swarm to the garage to find her unconscious in Mario's arms, which worried them.  \"Mama...?\" \"She looks different...\" \"She's all beat up! Did Bowser do this?!\" \"I... I don't feel her pulse, is she dead?\" the lumas squeaked leading to some of them to cry for their mama.  Kappa got the attention of the lumas as they quickly glare at the magikoopa, one of them left to check her pulse and got a groan and a small twitch from Rosalina in response \"guys she is alive but also not alive...?\" a luma stated worried and confused.  \"Do any of you know about... the creatures of the night?\" Kappa asked unsure of they understand. \"I read one of the books, why? Did you do this to her?!\" a luma accuse.  \"No! That was Bowser! He was experimenting with these spears made of your mama's magic after it somehow became corrupted by exposure to blood.  He decided to experiment what is now Ztar Magic on where it came from, Rosalina herself.  He impaled Rosalina and rather than kill her like you'd expect, she turned in an intelligent breed of undead, a vampire.  I fear he is going to do the same to others, I personally can't imagine what Bowser would do with the results, I only know they are not pleasent.\" Toadsworth scootched to Mario \"I guess that also explains koopas and goombas and others traveling through here\"  \"Mama's a vampire?! What's the point of turning her?!\" A luma responded as Mario brought Rosalina to her bedroom to rest and the lumas followed him.  \"She recently fed on Peach because she was starving from the transformation.  The point of doing this to her is not clear to me.  Maybe he wants to turn everyone against Mario, maybe to kill him and proceed with world domination.  I admit to being iffy about this myself, but Mario getting beat around is a better fate than getting killed, by the spears or vampires.  This is BIGGER than any of us believe.  I have a feeling that Rosalina is just the beginning.\" Kappa explained.  \"I can't say this is some clever trap, I felt a strong hint of dark star magic coming from Rosalina, I fear for her. *sigh* I will go check on her.\" Polari responded after being informed by Mario that he put Rosalina to bed.  \"But she was scared that she is going to bite us, she did not want to hurt us.\"  Peach responded. \"Maybe the wand she had lets her control her magic and since she has people to love, it makes Rosalina want to protect them.  The spear had tainted her magic, but attempts to join her blood lead it to leave her soul alone.\" Kappa explained.  \"Thank goodness!\" Peach exclaimed, remembering her screaming from where the Mario Bros rescued her. \"So let me get this straight...\" Toadsworth began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you about what happened to me?\" Rosalina spoke up.  \"We know you made a friend at Bowser's castle, a magikoopa named Kappa, who explained the situation about ztar magic being created by some blood vat he had, which on its own is... disturbing.\" Polari spoke back to explain the situation.  \"Are they here now?\" Rosalina asked as she gets up.  \"They are talking down there, if you would like to see them.\" a green one pointed out the room. \"Thank you!\" Rosalina said as she stepped outside only to cringe and hiss at the exposure of the core, reminding her that this is not really a dream, thankfully she didn't burn up from what she sees, considering it is not actually a sun.  She just smiled a little knowing her lumas still accept her as their mama despite her condition.  She can only hope Peach and the Bros' friends don't see me as a monster, that made her smile fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosalina has become a blood-sucking monster because Bowser used a spear on her?! I find that a little hard to believe that charlatan would do something this stupid, even for him!\" an Toadsworth, exclaimed in shock.  \"I don't believe this either, but I was there when this all happen, I regret backing out of this too late.\" Kappa sighed.  \"Then how do we feed her?  Taking blood is kind of sadistic, and won't someone be aware of the presence vampires when she feeds?  Maybe if she hunts somewhere no one to find something or she gets bloodpacks that are close to expiration, like these?\" Peach wonder as she pulled out a blood packet, which shocked Mario.  \"How the heck did you get-a that?!\" Mario exclaimed.  \"I have my ways...\" Peach said smugly as Mario sighs.  Rosalina heard that they are planning to help her drink blood without hurting someone, and notice a blood bag which peeked her attention with a hungry smile as her eyes turn red.  Rosalina had an urge to approach and snatch the packet.  Peach noticed her coming up and gasps, startling Rosalina out of her urge. \"I-I'm sorry, I guess I am still hungry...\" Rosalina said sadly looks away still thinking about biting Peach.  \"You just got up at the right momet, no need to feel bad about.  Till we can find the way to fix this, you can drink this.\" Peach explained with a sigh.  Rosalina just stared, drooling a bit at the bag.  She had no choice but to snatch it and drink from the bag.  It tastes like orange juice.  As soon as she is done she starts to feel better.  She then realized that she could drink these everyday now.  \"What am I gonna do?\" Rosalina said dejected by the thought.</span></div></div>",

I can tell you have a better handle on your magic than your hunger.\" Peach stated pointing at where Rosalina bit her when she first transformed to remind her.  \"I don't think you would be the right teachers, since I AM the vampire, none of you are... and you don't have powers that only work at <i>night</i> since I am a creature of the <i>night</i>\" Rosalina quipped poking her wand at the moon in the sky to emphasize the time of day.  \"I am aware of that, but we could get what you need to feed yourself properly while we find a way to fix that pretty star magic of your right up and get rid of your affliction.\" Kappa states with great confidence.  \"Y-you think so?  Wait, there's a cure?!\" Rosalina asked, moderately irritated that no one brought it up earlier.  \"WOW! Way to hold up valuable information, Kappa.\" Mario responded with a facepalm.  \"Well, I prepared this explanation for how long? A few freaking hours!  In hopes that space queen here is still accepted, cause her being rejected means we are too for helping a bloodsucker, and that makes things a helluva lot harder.\"  Kappa snapped. \"Sorry.\" Mario and Rosalina said.  \"Well after that just happened, I guess I can see the difference.\" Rosalina said, pulling out her wand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama, can you still eat starbits?\" a red luma says as she shoves some starbits into her good hand.  \"But don't vampires require blood to...\" Rosalina said but felt her magic shift.  The starbits are now a sickly looking shape, as their once vibrant colors turned purple and black, which made the luma feel disgusted to look at.  \"Now they look wrong... really wrong...\" the luma responded.  Rosalina picked up on of the warped starbits as they seem to start seemingly oozing down her finger then ate one of them, only to taste like the good starbits did before she turned.  \"But they tasted good!\" Rosalina exclaimed as she starts eating the rest of the warped starbits, they felt gooey to hold, but that didn't stop the taste, probably because she is a vampire created by Ztar Magic.  \"Eww\" the luma stated.  She finished off what she decided to call ztarbits.  \"How could you enjoy that?  Ugh, god!  Did you see what happened to them?\" Peach gagged as Rosalina smiles in bliss at the taste of the ztarbits.  \"Be careful with the supply, ztarbits can keep you fed for so long before you have to drink blood again to fully satisfy yourself.  I guess ztarbits serves as an alternative for a time.\" Kappa warned.  \"I noticed, unfortunately...\" Rosalina said glumly at the thought of it.  \"So what about my magic.  I can corrupt starbits, sorry my child, and can turn into... you know.\" Rosalina said, cringing as she remembered her transformation.  She decided to show what she is now.  Her skin pales as her nails grew into claws, bone-like wings emerged from her back, her fangs grew out and her irises turn red, housing slits for pupils.  This affected her outfit as her teal dress darkened to a purplish-blue, fitting a vampire who wants to live a normal life.  Her yellow broach turned red to resemble the substance she needs to survive.  She stretches her wings for everyone to notice that her magic is spreading throughout her wings as some sort of membrane.  \"She seems much more powerful than she did before.\" Toadsworth pointed out.  \"Aren't vampires usually this powerful?\" Mario asked. \"Not much of her power, they don't burn in the sun as you could tell while bringing her here.\" Kappa explained.  Rosalina folded her wings as she let out another sigh, \"More information withheld... \" Rosalina thought. \"And if you are wondering, yes I told them about it.  You were unconscious after Luigi bonked on the head.\" Kappa said, prompting Rosalina to glare at Luigi.  \"Sorry\" Luigi said.  Rosalina decided to go a safe distance thinking \"I think I can still use the observatory to travel? Maybe when the going gets tough.  If Ztar magic and star magic are opposite and I can still move the observatory, it might hurt me to the point where I have to rest well to recover, I hope that isn't the case.\"  Rosalina wondered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ROSALINA IS A VAMPIRE?! AAAAGGGGHHHH!\" A Toad freaked out as he came out from hiding nearby, he knew what they were talking about when he saw Rosalina transform.  Rosalina had to try something fast.  Maybe if she talk to him.  Rosalina knelt down behind toad who is panicking at the group, smiling in order to look friendly.  \"Hello little guy, I don't want to harm you.\" Rosalina said calmly.  \"But vampires like...\" Toad snapped as he notice a smiling Rosalina with her red glowing eyes.  The pupils however had become spirals that span out to the edge of her red irises and are spinning in a smooth, hypnotic motion.  Toad just looked on and then smiled a little, \"W-Wow... you got pretty eyes... what can I do for you, my queen?\" Toad asked as his eyes became spirals, dissipating Rosalina's smile into a look of surprise at what she did.  \"Umm, could you please take a rest on your ship over there, this is a dream and you will forget all about it.\" Rosalina requested politely.  \"I need a nap anyway, night night!\" Toad said giving a friendly wave as he nonchalantly walked off.  As she reverts to her human form to make sure it doesn't happen again, she notice that her friends saw how she defused the situation.  \"She hypnotized him?  Well, at least Toad won't rat her out!\"  Kappa said.  Rosalina shrugged \"My eyes just changed, and Toad was entranced with it, so I used it to calm him down and put him to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina was left in her biker outfit with a dummy that has an insulting resemblance of Bowser with her training her magic powers and claws.  She don't mind, it is his fault that she is a vampire.  Bowser's fault that there is a threat on the rise because of those Ztar Spears.  This would not have happened if Bowser just stopped kidnapping the princess.  With tears forming, she tried to punch the dummy harder to the point where she instead impaling it with her arm, which is covered in solidified ztar magic forming a blade.  She tried to pull and shake the dummy off and pushed it off with her foot.  As she did, she also saw the arm blade dissolving, her arm being free again.  She decided to try a bit of her star magic.  One of the attacks is star flash.  Once meant to stun enemies, ztar flash is essentially a ball of shadow that feeds her magic and can launch at enemies.  Not only that, restoring the magic of her flash became immensely powerful to their enemies, to the point where is hurts her as well, judging by how it burnt her arm, so she doesn't use it as much.  She tried the Ztarm-blade (the name of her arm-blade) again but it can shoot life draining shards (at the dummy of course).  She then practice her dry beast form on it.  She tried her strength and could lift a boulder close by with no trouble at all.  She smiled at how powerful she became, and considered keeping it...  What is she saying?!  Rosalina decided not to think about it anymore and go back to her bedroom on the observatory... but not before noticing that power has significantly decreased<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at Bowser's castle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is almost done sir!\"  Dr. Koopansheet said.  \"Perfect!  If Peach really loved Mario that much, he can keep her, I can create my own perfect Queen, power of Rosalina, beauty of her and Peach, <b>immortality of a vampire.</b>\" Bowser growled, pleased by the progress.  A large menacing machine resembling a coffin is glowing an evil energy, not the energy that turned Rosalina into a vampire, one that is <u><b>far worse</b></u> than that.  \"She is not the only thing we took from those whiny little blobs...\"  Kamek sneered, staring at the source of the experiment's power, The Grand Dark Star, or Grand Ztar for short, essentially the exact same thing as the Grand Stars with the exception of the black bodies with angry white eyes (remember Mario Party's Dark Stars/Ztars? Think about that).  Bowser saw the status on complete, which made him smile with enough malice to give even those who show no fear nightmares for days. \"Push the button.\"  Bowser said, ready to see his new queen.  \"Kappa is missing out on this!\" Kamek said as he pressed the button.  A void of darkness devoured some of the blood and samples filled in as offering and caused a reaction within the mechanical coffin, only to explode in darkness with turns the world around them black for a moment and all color to come back a moment afterwards.  Bowser sees the body and gasps before smiling evilly \"Beautiful!\" Bowser said as the coffin opens revealing a woman looking to be Peach and Rosalina mixed together.  Her hair is blood red from the roots, only to turn black as it reaches her lower back, while giving off a dark fog at the end.  Her hair has a bang that barely covers the opposite side of Rosalina's bang, the left side of her face.  Her pale body has a black shell, sporting silver spikes, with its underbelly covering her torso and waist area, looking like a one-piece swim suit showing her top cleavage.  Black and red scales cover her clawed hands and feet and appear as marks on her cheeks.  Her body have some muscle.  The woman opened her eyes having a seductive look as she looked around and at Bowser.  \"hehe... hehehe... hahahahaha... HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"  The vampire laughed insanely as she lunged at Bowser.  As Kamek prepared to defend Bowser, the Grand Ztar burst out and attacked Kamek and everything went black as Bowser screams after she bites down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina was preparing to visit the Mushroom Kingdom, close by the observatory since she stayed by to help Kappa and E. Gadd (interested in ztar magic and vampires) find out more about ztar magic and how to cure her.  In her normal outfit, she said bye to the others after having breakfast (some ztarbits and a bloodbag).  Having reached the ground she sped towards the castle.  She noticed something from a distance...</span></div></div>",

Rosalina, not understanding what it said, just took a breath as she narrows he eyes back, before she is forced to use her supernatural speed to run through the kingdom to find Peach, but not before the guards noticed where Rosalina was looking and sounded the alarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina soared through the halls through the panicking toads, koopas, goomba, and all the sort until she found Peach.  Leaving some of them to lure them to the observatory for evacuation with guidance of the lumas.  Just as the strange creatures popped out of the shadows and starts going ape dung on the place  \"We are leaving! RIGHT NOW!\" Rosalina yelled.  \"What's happening?!\" Peach said.  \"We heard the alarms sweeties! And noticed something... nasty by Bowser's airships.  Care to add anything, little feller\" E. Gadd.  \"I only know it radiates more Ztar Magic than HER!\" Kappa responds. \"Last night, I noticed the observatory's power has lowered significantly, the screen states that it went down the same time I got captured, it seems to be strong enough to take us somewhere on this planet, but a Grand Star and a couple Power Stars are missing! Peach! What do you know about that blob of darkness over there?\" Rosalina asked.  Peach just looked at the darkness floating towards the kingdom in horror  \"What is it doing?\" Peach asked with great fear \"It appears to be floating with Bowser's airships. I think it said traitor when it saw me from a mile away, who is the traitor? I don't remember working for it.  Is it because I am a... you know what?\" Rosalina responded.  Someone kicks the door down and ran in. \"Peach! What's going on?! Luigi and I were feeding yoshi apples when we heard the alarms!\" Mario called out.  Peach looked at everyone and sighed \"You will know soon enought Rosalina.  On that subject, you remember Dark Star, don't you?\"  Peach asked.  Mario just froze up and just breathed a little \"Y-yes from inside Bowser's body.  That artifact that poses a grave threat to the kingdom?\" Mario responded. \"T-t-this is a-a memory trip thing right? It is not really...\" Luigi stammered.  \"Yoshi?\" Yoshi just said.  \"See for yourself.\" Peach said as she walked aside, the sight made Mario and Luigi pale at the sight of the darkness creeping closer and the menacing glows in its shadow.  This didn't affect Rosalina that much since her skin is already pale due to being undead.  \"This is what happens when Dark Star is truly empowered by a relentlessly evil being, which is Bowser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mario did this stuff before, but I am weak... do I want to get her to... do it to me?  I should... I want her to turn me. Into a vampire. Have I become that desperate?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosalina?  If it is ok, I want you to tu...\" Peach suddenly ask before a tremor and looked out to see Bowser demolishing walls left and right, followed by waves of bizarre creatures wearing black stars on them and what looked to be vampire versions of his minions.  A battle starts with the Peach's soldiers .  \"PRINCESS PEEEEAAAACH!  YOUR KING IS HERE!  COME OUT OR I'LL RUN HEAD FIRST INTO THE OBSERVATORY, I KNOW IT IS BEHIND HERE!\" Bowser called out.  \"Bowser?!  Is he out of his mind?!\" E. Gadd shouted.  \"NNNNEEEEEHHH!  Something is terribly with him!\" Kappa cried out in nasally terror.  A young woman, wearing a seductive looking top resembling Peach's while wearing a skirt resembling Rosalina's, walked in after him, catching the gang's eyes.  \"Mwah mwah, Thank you! Thank you! I know I'm beautiful\" The woman said in an egotistical tone as the monsters notice her and took a comical amount of time applauding her.  \"Followed by someone that looks like Rosalina... and Peach?! Did he make a fused clone?!\" E. Gadd exclaimed both excited and terrified.  \"Yes, yes he did. OUT OF ZTAR MAGIC!\" Kappa responded. \"Aww shucks feller, I wanted to study it.\" E. Gadd.  \"We need to get outta here and figure this out, your forces are getting trampled!\" Rosalina shouted.  \"We can help with that. PIXELATE THEM!\" Kappa commanded. \"With pleasure!\" E. Gadd responded as he got out a machine that disintegrated the group into pixels and stored them in their respective pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a small shack near the observatory, the machine exploded in a mess of pads and cameras and the gang flew out as pixels reintegrated back into their proper selves.  \"We can check on the evacuees.\" Luigi proclaimed riding Yoshi to the observatory. \"YOSHI\" Yoshi shouted as he dashes off.  \"Wait aren't we going there anyway?\" Peach called out, but sighed as they already disappeared. 'At least you could ask to become a vampire. NONONONO I am being desperate again.'  \"Your brother is weird...\" Kappa said earning a nod from Rosalina.  \"After this I am feeding on you Peach, unless there is a good amount of those blood packs on the observatory.\" Rosalina inquired.  \"I kinda want you to do more than feed when you bite me...\" Peach said looking down.  \"W-What do you mean?\" Rosalina asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PEEEEAAAACH!\" Bowser beckons as he charges towards the gang \"DINNER TIME!\"  Bowser's scales are darker than normal, his claws and fangs are longer than normal and his eyes glow the intense black and red as he stares them down. \"What do'ya think?\" Bowser says showing off his form, his bones protruding from his body, his second ribcage sticking out his chest, his mutated tail swaying, he has become an abomination.  \"Bowser, calm down!  I wanna see Rosey and Peachy...\" the woman says showing up from behind Bowser.  Peach and Rosalina jolted from the lady calling them by their nicknames as guards started jumping out from the ground and surrounding the gang to keep the enemies from reaching them.  \"Peach, we are done.  I have a new Queen now.  I guess introductions are in order.\"  Bowser chuckled  \"Aww look at the cute babies, I wanna drain them dry.  Wow cross spears, vacuums, nice touch.\" the woman says as she snaps her fingers, Bowser then breathes fire on the guards melting their weapons.  \"Who the hell are you and what the hell did you do to him?!\" Rosalina shouted at the woman, letting her eyes glow red.  \"Nothing bad!  He wanted to take over the Mushroom Kingdom, so I gave him the power to do just that.  I just need to kill the Princess and the Mario Brothers I heard so much about!  My name is Draculina by the way, Queen of the Vampires and second in command to Dark Star Soul.\" the response left shocked looks on their faces. \"So that cloud was Dark Star!\" Peach deduced. \"You don't know the half of it!  Where are the Mario Bros anyway, the red hat... and... uh\" Draculina was about to finish, but she got distracted by the very clues to lead her to Mario on a plumber.  After realizing what is in front of her, she burst out laughing (which offends Mario), she can't find any room to breath. \"HAHAHAHAHAH WHA-WHAT I CAN'T BREATH HAHAHAHA, SOMEONE HELP I REALLY CAN'T BREATH, OH MY ZTARS, HAHAHA MARIO IS THAT PLUMBER DUDE?! HAHAHAHA! HAHAHA-HEheheh.  Huh, alright, I gotta give you that, you are a funny bunch. BOWSER GOT BEAT BY A PLUMBER!\" Draculina exclaimed, making Bowser rather embarrassed.  \"What am I supposed to say? Big things do come in small packages.\" Peach retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, what about you?  You want this power don't you, want to big space mama turn you!\" Draculina accused.  \"T-th-that is enough!\" Peach snapped, Rosalina felt uncomfortable with what is going on her.  \"You want to feel powerful, tired of being the one getting kidnapped. 'Mario? MARIO, HELP!' I am a weak little princess.\" Draculina callously continued.  \"SHUT UP!\" Peach yelled tearing up, slapping Draculina.  \"Wow, you hit me hard!  What, did I struck a nerve?  Sounds like I struck it hard.\" Draculina said picking up a guard.  \"W-What are you doing?!\" Peach yelled and watched in horror as she bit the guard and drained him dry to the point of shriveling up.  She and Bowser did the same to the other guards as well.  \"Sorry, we were hungry.\" Draculina said.  \"You monsters!\" Rosalina spat.  \"What are you gonna do mutant? I know that he turned you into a drypire, Dark Star had a little faith in you to carry out his wishes!  He loved the irony of it, you are the mother of lumas and he wants YOU to be the one to drain them ALL! But now I will have to end your reign of good-vampyness and do the deed myself!\" Draculina sneered pointing to the observatory. \"This can't be irony, this is sick! HOW DARE YOU REQUEST I KILL MY CHILDREN?! I didn't even hear him speak to me, I didn't now he existed anymore!\" Rosalina shouted.  \"You're a vampire now Rosey... you figure it out!\" Draculina snapped. \"<b>I AM NOTHING LIKE YOU!</b> At least I did not take innocent lives when I feed!\" Rosalina retorted in a harsh tone, her eyes burning red.  \"Mama would never hurt us!\" a small beige luma wearing Mario's hat.  \"G-go back home, now! She is a dangerous creature!\" Rosalina cried worried about what might happen next.  \"Awww one of the brats have Mario's hat!  I wish I have a camera for its funeral!\" Draculina said as her Ztarm-Blade formed and tried to attack.  The luma saw what is happening and squealed as it shields its head. \"MAMA HELP\" the luma shouted as Rosalina's face went blank from what is about to happen. 'Oh hell no...' Rosalina thought as Draculina brought the blade down. *SLASH*</span></div></div>",

Gadd himself.  \"YOUR WELCOME FELLERS!\" E Gadd shouts from the distance, angering Draculina to the point of shooting a shard at E Gadd which made him and the others duck as the shot flew past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this all just some dark game?<br>\r\nThis world will never be the same!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshi and Luigi hurled a bunch of fire balls at Draculina, Rosalins took the chance to hit her in the side with a shard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, eins, zwei, drei! We now fight back as one!<br>\r\nSo, eins, zwei, drei! They think undeath has won!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you little...!\" Bowser shouts as Peach shoots a fireball enhanced by dazzle spark, causing Kappa's fireball to become strong enough to scorch his face, causing him to shout in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe has succumbed to this dark behemoth,<br>\r\nThis battle is the start of one big...<br>\r\nSurvival Game!<br>\r\nNow we hold nothing back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach focusing her anger at Draculina in her frying pan, red from the heat as she strikes Bowser in the face. Sending him reeling, now open to a good fireball to the chest from Kappa and a solid punch in the face courtesy of Mario and his flaming fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the end of the world?<br>\r\nOr just the start of the fight<br>\r\nBringing back all the light,<br>\r\nYou want to survive this war?!<br>\r\nThen we must fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina and Draculina constantly clashing their blades, Rosalina hitting her with her own magic and smash moves, a small luma just charged the reeling Draculina as Luigi and Yoshi jumped on her and deliver more fireballs to her flailing body before fleeing, allowing Rosalina to dash up and punch her in the chest with her Ztarm-Blade charged up by fire magic.  Draculina grunted and gagged in pain as Rosalina punched her off the blade and sent her crashing into Bowser, knocking both the villains out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the luma's vampiric mother turns to retreat to the observatory with her friends, the entity took notice of the battle and started to approach.  A power star floated onto the observatory as well, but it is black and the group is immediately glared at by its angry white eyes.  \"Poor little thing...\" Rosalina said with a tear as she approached the star and hoped it doesn't make her condition worse.  It seems it is not powerful enough as it just sat there, so she poked it with her wand and absorbed the dark energy, reverting the star to a gold star with happy black eyes.  She gained Ztar points for cleansing the star and saved it to upgrade her powers later.  \"Please don't hurt...\" Rosalina says nervously and started running one of the big guys took notice and made a platform and tossed her into the air.  She then shrouded the observatory in star magic, the clenches fists tell everyone she is in burning pain from trying to keep it from corrupting the core.  As she does the observatory floated upwards and then mysteriously stopped responding.  They turn to face the problem glaring them in the eyes.  The pain doesn't bother her as much as she stares at the being, a chill running down her back as she feels a powerful presence of fear unlike any fear she felt before.  Panicked screams fill the air as Luigi is shaking to the point he is moving around without moving his feet.  The cloud slowly faded into oblivion, revealing a large sphere with countless spikes, a black stare broken in half and seems to use it to speak. The cracks resemble fangs of a horrible monster.  This is Dark Star Soul isn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"tRaItOr... YoU dArE cAlL yOuRsElF a VaMpIrE qUeEn...?\" It bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina grew angry at the accusation, \"You dare call me a traitor, when I never worked for you? Like I would ever align myself with you, vampirism be damned.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I aSsUmEd YoU sErVeD mE cOsMiC oNe... YoU aRe FiLlEd WiTh ZtAr MaGiC... sEeMs I wAs MiStAkEn... YoU sEeK tO uSe ThIs GiFt To PrOtEcT tHoSe BeNeAtH yOu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina sighed. \"A gift wouldn't make me hurt others to survive, I don't care if it makes me immortal.  Besides even though I am a vampire, I still care about my friends and family, so don't you think I would abandon them for squat.  YOU WON'T MAKE ME KILL MY CHILDREN!\"  Rosalina said her eyes glowing red at the end of the sentence.  The creature sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AlWaYs AbOuT tHoSe LiTtLe BrAtS!  nO mAtTeR, bOwSeR mAdE aNoThEr VaMpIrE qUeEn To CaRrY oUt My WiShEs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't I will let touch my lumas or my friends either!\" Rosalina snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt chuckled evilly as it pointed a magic sucking spike at Rosalina's heart and went to pierce it.  This would be the end of Rosalina's time as a vampire and in this world of Mario hadn't forced it away from her with a flaming punch. \"Leave her alone, she wants no part in this!\" Mario yelled as Luigi followed still shaking, but trying to be brave at the same time.  It chuckled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MaRiO...? LuIgI...? It HaS bEeN a WhIlE... hAsN't It... OlD fRiEnD...?  yOu... DoN't ReMeMbEr...? I rEmEmBeR yOu... SoOn EvErYoNe WiLl Be DEAD...

I WILL MAKE SURE YOU WILL LOSE EVERYTHING... PEACH YOUR LOVER, YOUR FAMILY, EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT WILL BE GONE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTHING! LEFT! BUT! DUST!\" Dark Star declares as a powerful energy is forming to strike down the observatory.  But a familiar energy blocks the shot and flew right into Dark Star, prompting an agonized screech, an old toad appears with seven powerful stars appear. \"Toadsworth?!\" Peach called out in panic of an old man wanting to fight the creature, Rosalina ignores it to look at the black stars flying overhead trying to stop them from escaping with a forlorn expression. 'To think all this could be prevented if I didn't sit around watching Wigglers.' Rosalina thought with regret as tears form.  \"I have dealt with enough vampires and ztar creature to distinguish those with peaceful intentions like Rosalina.  I placed something that can reverse her condition if she desires. NOW GO, I WILL TRAP IT HERE!\" Toadsworth called.  \"Toadsworth I order you on here, Dark Star is dangerous!\" Peach cried out tearing up from what is happening, Toadsworth just stares with a proud expression.  \"I will be fine.  You will do great, I KNOW it!\" Toadsworth said in a comforting tone as he uses the seven stars to break the observatory from Dark Star Soul's grasp and sent it flying to some far off place allowing Rosalina to take back control and steer it far away from Dark Star Soul.  \"NNNOOOOOOOOOOO!\"  Peach cried as she was held back by Mario and Kappa, while Luigi just watched someone she saw as family stay behind will the others flee.  Toadsworth face Dark Star and wagged his finger \"Like I said DISAPPOINTING!\" Toads worth shouted as he cast up a shield to trap Dark Star inside.  Dark Star scattered its minions around the world before it closes and land a punch on Toadsworth as he warps away.  It shouted in frustration and glared in the direction it was tossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoU cAn'T eScApE... yOu CaN't OuTrUn Me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo MaTtEr WhErE yOu Go Or WhAt YoU dO, WE. WILL.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A day passed since the Fall of the Mushroom Kingdom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina is still fighting her magic trying to corrupt the core, she is worried that it would ruin her observatory, not having to deal with it, she didn't know what would happen when ztar magic reached the core.  It hurts, very much, but the loudest she was is the groans and panting and whimpers.  Her arm, the one holding the wand, is burnt and weakening from so much exposure.  She tried to look for someone to help her ignore the pain, although knowing what happened the crowd of evacuees were resting, in their areas.  Due to not expecting such large crowds, there are a few taking in the sight, including Peach who still staring where they fled remembering what happened to the kingdom a whole day after Rosalina was kidnapped and turned into a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach?  Are you alright?\" Kappa asked for Rosalina since she needs to focus on her magic, magikoopas surrounded her to keep her power in check .  Peach just shook and choke back a sob \"I let this happen... I-I-I am the reason Rosalina is a vampire... I am the reason the Mushroom Kingdom has fallen, I hope Bowser is happy with himself, because I am certainly not!  I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT ANY OF THIS! Thousands of people died, because OF ME!\" Peach shouted as she starting ramming the the barrier, hurting Rosalina greatly. \"Peach are you crazy? It's going to break and you'll fall to your death.  Not to mention Rosalina is in a lot of pain as it is.\"  Kappa yelled in a panicked tone as Rosalina screamed in agony as she tried to keep someone onboard, but she could feel her slowly passing through.  \"I WANT TO DIE! I AM COMING TOADSWORTH!\" Peach shouts in tears, as she begins to tear through the barrier.  \"OH GOD THIS HURTS!\" Rosalina screamed as the burns spread throughout her arm.  \"PEACH STOP!\" Kappa shouted. \"I DISAPPOINTED MARIO, THE MAN I LOVE! I GOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE KILLED, BY DARK STAR!  ALL BECAUSE I DIDN'T WATCH ROSALINA, BECAUSE I DIDN'T MAKE SURE SHE WAS SAFE!\" Peach cried as she starts pushing through the barrier, wanting to fall to her death.  \"PEACH, STOP!\" Mario ran up to the duo and started pulling Peach back in to her dismay.  \"She went crazy, She is willing to burn Rosalina's arm off to end her own life.\" Kappa explained.  \"Peach, please stop!  Someone help.\" Mario cired. \"Leave me alone!  I can't take it anymore!  The kidnapping is one thing, but all that violence and death, it's too much for me!  Let me die!\"  Peach pleaded, sobbing profusely in between her despair filled ramblings until Kappa bind Mario and Peach to a magic rope and pulled them back in, this made Rosalina's pain subside greatly, leaving her panting with rivers of tears from the agony.  'Peach, why...?' Rosalina thought as Peach sat there sobbing hysterically and Mario tried to calm her down and comfort her, she saw the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm is getting worse to the point where she can't take it anymore.  She has to land it for her pain to end.  She shouted in agony as she flung her wand over to what Mario saw as a familiar structure.  \"Did you see what you just did?! We are going to crash!\" Kappa shouted catching Peach's attention and having her look at the familiar place closing in while Kappa ran back to his area in a dome in a panic.  \"Let's-a go.  You'll be-a safe there. and runs into a dome of the observatory.  It will be fine, I will be with you.\" Mario told Peach gently in a sad tone as he brings her to safety.  \"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry everyone.  I... I feel so unworthy!  I don't deserve to be a princess!  I AM TOO WEAK!\" Peach cried and tossed her crown off her head in a fit of sorrow and self-loathing, as Rosalina screamed in agony as she made the observatory draw closer and closer to the location.  The magikoopas and a few other evacuation groups and Koopa Army deserters fleeing to their areas created by Rosalina so they can brace for impact.  She flick the wand upwards and sparked it to force the upper tip to point upwards and the observatory land bottom tip piercing the surface.  As soon as the observatory lands, Rosalina lands in pain from the use of her magic and upgraded her light resistance ability without thinking, which calmed her arm, but not get rid of the pain completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen her stomach growled furiously, her eye started glowing red again after realizing she needs to feed immediately.  She growled like an animal as she tried to keep herself from trying to break in a barrier and rushed to her room, and shouted in pain as she opened her hidden chest and plunged her fangs into a blood bag, and then another, and another.  5 bags lay there when she started to feel better and she fell back on her bed, crying from her burnt arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Peach came in with a medical kit to find empty blood bags on the floor and Rosalina grinning a silly one at the mirror, \"Shhh, I am awaiting orders...\" Rosalina said not taking her eyes off the mirror, her red eyes covered by swirling spirals and a drooling silly grin.  Did she hypnotize herself? If she did this to try to nullify the pain then, looking at her horrifyingly burnt arm, though it is not as bad now thanks to her combined healing factor of her magic and her vampire blood, it seems to work pretty well since she is not in pain from all that.  \"Rose... I need to talk.\" Peach said.  \"I need my master's permission...\" Rosalina said gleefully as she continues to stare. \"You are looking in the mirror!\" Peach said facepalming. \"My master comes first... <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" Rosalina chirped as Peach loses her patience and turns her body to face her and slaps her hard and after a few seconds she turned feeling her cheek. \"Ugh... what...? Gagh!\" Rosalina groaned as she felt pain from her arm as Peach sits down.  \"I... I'm sorry, I was so lost.  I watched my entire kingdom fall, the kidnappings were normal, but those people, all the destruction, I let it all happen, your vampirism, the kingdom's destruction, I let it all happen.  I failed... and now my attempt at suicide burned you arm to... that! All because I let you go alone!\" Peach said as tears are forming at her eyes an she immediately breaks down and Rosalina had to hug her. \"I'm fine, it will heal.\" Rosalina said noticing Peach's crown is missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina made Peach go back to Mario, she been with him for far longer.  1 whole year since the events of Odyssey, a half a year since Peach got back from her travels and Mario still stuck with her, even when she wouldn't marry him anytime soon.  He just stayed as her savior, and since then she was growing to regret her decision to not marry Mario.  Yes that proposal was childish, but that kind of behavior was few and far in between, otherwise Mario has been good to Peach since then, giving her space while staying kind.  Mario on the other hand is not a ruler like Peach is and yet he saw the passion to keep her kingdom safe, but what happened is marked as her ultimate failure and now Rosalina, the lumas' mother-turned-vampire using normal star magic, is in pain from the experience, from keeping her ztar magic from corrupting the core while traveling, all because she is still Princess Peach, because Bowser wants her, because she was confident that Bowser wouldn't care about capturing Rosalina.  The comforting starting because Rosalina saw Peach trying to push through the bubble saying she wants to fall to her death.  They saw the signs, Peach losing hope in her eyes, thinking she is selfish or becoming dark for wanting Rosalina to turn her into a vampire herself... yeah they are aware that Peach is starting to consider becoming a vampire.  Maybe she wants to be abandoned somewhere so she could start a new life, but then she felt that becoming a monster made her feel that something is wrong with Peach.  Mario stood by to make sure she has enough self-esteem to keep from trying to end her own life.  Not that he blames her, a home's destruction would break anyone's spirit, but that didn't mean she had to kill herself.  Needless to say it is best if Peach stayed with Mario, at least till she gets her confidence back.  They seemed happy together anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast time Rosalina saw her, Mario followed her and comfort her in their area.  She followed them to check up on Peach.  While she had her turn, Peach gave her a cast where her arm was burnt up.  She did drink enough blood to heal it, but she chose to keep it on a while longer just in case.  She looked sadly at the groups, the lumas, her observatory.  She hopes that what happened with the Mushroom Kingdom, doesn't happen to whatever kingdom they are in.  She sniffs the air to smell whoever is near by and to look around, she occassionally turned into a swoop as flying around as a little creature is less suspicious than a human sized bone covered monster.  After some looking around, the observatory landed somewhere that it looks to be...</span></div></div>",

Maybe if they like a rest they should feel free for the time being, I can search a little more if I can find anyone to help us, provided we do so outside my vampire form, not sure they take a vampire helping evacuees survive too well.\" Rosalina informed in case she wants to go find their friend Daisy.  Kappa came along as well.  \"I came to check up on you, sources say Daisy is back here.\"  She went back home to Sarasaland to find her father and warn him about that... thing that wrecked the entire kingdom. thinking Peach is one of the victims of the massacre, and wants to ensure that all of Sarasaland is prepared to deal with the vampires and ztar creatures courtesy of Dark Star itself.  The legends that starts spreading throughout the world is proven true.  \"Ok then... hey Rosalina, are you hungry?\" Peach asked.  \"A little, which is why I am getting some starbits, why do you ask?\"  Rosalina asked.  \"I... *clears throat* I need to ask you something... may I ask you do <i>it</i> to me.\" Peach requested.  \"I don't understand.\" Rosalina said blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand, why you don't want to do it to me, so you don't have to say \"yes\" when I ask this...\" Peach said.  \"I don't know what you mean by tha-\" Rosalina said but was cut off by Peach. \"I WANT YOU TO TURN ME!\" Peach snapped, leaving Rosalina and Kappa shocked.  \"Wha... I... I don't... understand.\" Rosalina had trouble thinking of what to think as Kappa went \"WHAAAAAAT?!\", was what they say about Peach true, does she want to be... like her?  \"I want you to turn me into a vampire!\"  Peach exclaimed.  \"Why?\"  Rosalina responded.  \"I am tired of being weak, I want to be stronger!  I want to be useful!  I want to better play the part in ending this nightmare, even if it means sacrificing my humanity. I will do anything to be useful, if you won't turn, I will train.  Whatever it takes!\"  Peach cried out.  Rosalina is stunned, not knowing what to do next.  Does she offer Peach her blood, does she not?  Should she start a coven, should she not?  She didn't want to ruin her life, but she is acting like she is willing to become a vampire like her.  \"Does Mario want this?!\" Rosalina said.  \"He is iffy on this, but I told him that I can choose to get rid of this.  He said if I wanted this he'll still love me.\" Peach said smiling.  \"Is this what you really want?  I got something if you don't...\" Kappa said.  \"If I find that this is not my life,  I can cure this if there is one.  But if there isn't, well my kingdom is gone anyway, we can be a coven of friendly vampires, we can... be a family?  If you don't turn me, I won't think less of you.  I can understand why, you don't want anyone to have to go through what made vampirism a curse.\" Peach said.  Rosalina relieved that Peach will still be her friend if she refuses to turn her.  She made a choice.</span></div></div>",

Rosalina changes to her vampire form and lets her fangs grow out and she sank them in to feed, and then inject.  Rosalina closes her eyes as the process happens, Peach groaning from the change about to happen.  Her flesh pales and grows cold as Rosalina finishes her process, and opens her eyes to see the transformation start, and begins comforting Peach.  Peach groaned as her heartbeat stops, she felt weak at first, but then her eyes open up and they flash a blood red hue with pupils as slits, and her fangs and claws grew in.  She flipped over and let her own bony wings grow out, tearing through the back in her dress.  Peach hisses as her power increases greatly and groans at her growling stomach.  \"<b>Shhh... you'll be fine, here let me give this to you.</b>\"  Rosalina said in a soft tone as she hands her a blood bag.  Peach made no hesitation to drink from the bag, as Rosalina smiles sadly, petting her head as she feeds.  When she finished, she breathes for a second  \"<b>Am I a vampire now?</b>\" Peach asks smiling.  Rosalina just nodded and lifted Peach up and help her regain her balance from her transformation.  \"<b>I feel powerful already.</b>\"  Peach said stretching her new wings.  \"<b>Kappa told me about the purified version of my magic being a part of the cure of vampirism.  If you do not want this, we hope this will reverse our vampirism.</b>\"  Rosalina said smiling at the thought that she might finally be free from her curse.  Peach smiles in response, at least she can be strong while she can.  \"<b>What are we doing now?</b>\"  Peach asked as she started floating.  \"<b>We should train our powers, but how and where...?</b>\" Rosalina asked.</span></div></div>",

I understand why you want to be stronger.  I would do anything to avenge the observatory and everything on it if it gets destroyed.  There has to be some way to help you get stronger, one that doesn't ruin your life!\" Rosalina said.  Kappa just looked at the two princesses.  \"Peach wants to get stronger?  Then I got something for her pinkiness here.\" Kappa blurted out, pulling out a syringe.  The girls looked at the thing in confusion.  \"This contains the essence that contains Rosalina's magic.  Exposure from the inside can grant the user permanent ability to use Roslina's magic.  Meaning Peach could gain the ability to use Rosalina's star magic, after being purged of ztar magic and turned back to normal, I found that this is part of the cure, but I have plenty of these, I just need you to become another source.\" Kappa said with a smirk.  \"There is a way to give me powers, Rosalina's powers?\" Peach asked. \"Yes you can use purified versions of Rosalina's powers, do you wish to proceed?\" Kappa asked, Peach just lit up.  She can become strong without becoming a vampire?! Rosalina doesn't have turn her to become useful!  \"YES!\" Peach said excited that she doesn't need to become undead to help save the world.  \"Alright hold still!\" Kappa said as he injects Rosalina's magic into Peach's body.  Peach felt strange, and she started seeing herself in Rosalina's position and memories.  She suddenly started floating as her veins turned beautiful blue for a moment.  Although not noticeable, a platinum blonde streak, Rosalina's hair color appears on the right side of her hair.  Transformation complete, her body radiates Rosalina's purified star magic.  \"Rosalina? What happened? I feel like raising lumas and protecting the galaxies.\" Peach asked, her voice now echoing.  \"It... it worked?!  HAHAHAHA!  WOW!  My God woman!  It worked!  I expected the serum to turn you into a gold headed clone of Rosalina!  Wow, this is incredible!  Welp, you have her magic now, use it wisely!  Now lets see if I can use this to cure Rosalina of vampirism, by dissolving the Ztar Magic that maintained her vampirism.\" Kappa laughed in relief as he saw the result was not a cloning process.  \"Wait, you thought that the serum would turn Peach into my twin?!\" Rosalina blurted.  \"A clone of you with her memories and personality, just figured a peppier you.  Thankfully, she became a hybrid of you.  Better than twinning her of course.  Now let me get back to work.  Good day!\" Kappa chuckled as he walks off, leaving Rosalina to sigh with great irritation.  \"I still have my wand.  Mind if I teach you how to use my magic and wand?\"  Rosalina asked with a smile.  Peach let out an echoing giggle in response and agreed \"Gives me something to do, let's go!\" Peach chirped twirling around in the air as Rosalina floats with her happy that Kappa has the chance to cure her vampirism.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Peach floated along from time to time, having bits of swerving due to not being used to floating to move like Rosalina was.  \"Be careful, Peach!  You only just gained those powers, you don't want to work yourself too much.\" Rosalina warned.  \"I can't help it... I am a little excited!  I don't feel as weak anymore!\" Peach says, as she stops floating forward she fell forward and landed in some daisies.  \"Woah! Ouch!\" Peach squeaked out.  \"This is why you need to calm down a little,\" Rosalina said helping her up.  \"Alright, since normal star magic can negatively affect ztar beings and vampires, I can keep my distance while you practice the attacks and defense.\" Rosalina said, wishing she could help the princess-turned-refugee better.  Hopefully, Kappa hurries up with the cure, but these things take time.  \"Here let our arm blades clash and you'll see what I mean...\"  Rosalina explains as her ztarm-blade forms and takes the moment to block Peach's starm-blade to make a point.  Peach thought about fighting back with her arm, and a blue version of Rosalina's ztarm-blade formed on her right arm.  She prepared the strike and hit Rosalina's blade without harming her.  The clashing of blades did severe damage to Rosalina's blade as she blocked the strike, and then she felt a burn on her arm.  Rosalina looked at her arm as her ztarm-blade and look at Peach who gasped at what happened.  \"See what I mean?\"  Rosalina asked.  \"You make a good point.\"  Peach said as Rosalina nodded glumly with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, Peach just beaten Rosalina in a spar with a mischievous smirk, Rosalina chuckled and smiled at Peach.  \"You did well, maybe because I am weaker to light magic now.\"  Rosalina praised with another chuckle.  \"GAAAGH!\"  a familiar voice came from behind Rosalina and Peach noticed three giant flowers attacking someone.  \"Someone is in trouble!\" Peach yelled as she helped Rosalina up and make a b-line for the source to find Daisy being attacked by by some weird giant flowers looking like piranha plants, but the five flower petals resemble tips of a dark star, and the mouth is more of a crackled, demonic smile, with a rather ticked off singular eye inside.  \"What are you?! Get away from me!\"  Daisy shouted whacking at the monsters snapping at her.  That would kill her instantly if she didn't stumble back from the colliding attacks.  \"Daisy!\" Peach cried as she runs along to aid her by shooting her Shooting Star at one of the monsters.  It just writhed a bit from the burning sensation and flings its sights on the source.  Rosalina hisses as her wand  lets loose Shooting Ztar at the creature, it clearly hurt but not as much as Peach's attack.  \"Stay away from Daisy!\"  Peach commanded, launching another shooting star at the beast.  \"P-Peach...?\"  Daisy said as the other two girls attacked the monsters.  The plants reacted viciously at Peach's attack and started straying close enought for Rosalina to form her ztarm-blade to cut off the main body of the plant monster, which then exploded into purple smoke that dissipated shortly after.  The other two took notice what she did and one of them got shot by the crystal bullet of her blade.  The beast writhed a little more and snapped at Rosalina, who gutted the beast in the eye, destroying it instantly.  \"The Ztarbud's eye is the weak point!\"  Rosalina called out.  Peach accidentally created a fake exploding Peach while thinking of a peach and threw it into the mouth of the last ztarbud and exploded the beast from the inside, finishing it off just as quick.  They magic users panted a little and notice Daisy standing behind them.  \"Daisy?\" Peach said with tears forming in her eyes.  Daisy looked like she is about to break down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PEACH!\" Daisy screech, bolting at Peach with her eyes overflowing with tears as she finds that Peach, her best friend, somehow survived the Mushroom Kingdom's demise at the hands of some demon.  She is not sure Peach has the right to call herself a princess, since her kingdom got completely demolished by Dark Star, but this changes nothing about her.  \"DAISY!\" Peach cried in response as they collided into an intense, tearful embrace as she finds that her best friend is still safe.  \"I thought that Dark Star creature killed you!  I thought you were dead!\"  Daisy sobbed as she embraced that platinum blonde streaked princess.  \"Rosalina and Kappa helped us escape along with the Mario Bros.  We are fine...\" Peach responded trying to console Daisy.  \"Don't you dare scare me like that again!\" Daisy yelled.  They eventually broke off and noticed Rosalina looked a little off.  \"What happened to Rosie?\" Daisy asked, noticing she seemed a little more pale than last time.  \"That is a long story, for now, let's just say she got kidnapped and experimented on by Bowser.\"  Peach explained.  \"Now Rosalina is getting captured?  Wait, BOWSER IS THE CAUSE OF THIS?!  I KNEW IT!  THAT SON OF A...\" Daisy shouted, but was cut off.  \"Yes we know, I was captured as well and found out what he did to her.  When we go visit a friend we made and our friends, you may be in for a bit of a story.\"  Peach explained trying to calm Daisy down.  The girls agree to go back, Daisy marching behind them.  \"I will kill that mutated turtle for what he did...\" Daisy muttered along the way.</span></div></div>",

Her whole life flashed before her eyes, her childhood, the lumas, her friends that treated her with kindness.  She smiled at the thought of how bittersweet it was only for the smile to disappear.  No one saved her, probably because they didn't know she was in danger.  Bowser must have seen the opportunity to kidnap her while she was alone, when nobody was watching.  She mentally cursed Bowser as her eyes finally closed for what she thought would be her last time.  Bowser looked at her shocked and checked her pulse, nothing.  \"She's gone?! Awwww, that stinks! I expected something cool to happen like a servant or a pet, or something to torture... aw well, at least she can't interfere anymore, right fellas?!\"  Bowser shouted laughing evilly as the minions broke out in raucous applause and cheers unaware of the spear being absorbed into her corpse.  \"J-Jeez boss...\" thought Kappa, a magikoopa like Kamek (who is not related to him), he was content with experimentation to see what it could do to defeat Mario, not how to use it to murder someone in cold blood (not even Mario deserved this and he gave his old teacher Kamek and some of Kappa's friends a whooping more than once in the past).  Bowser flung his view into the crowd, \"You there get rid of the body, we have no need for her anymore.\" \"Yes boss!\" A koopa said and released the body and carried it off with a mutated dry bones, a couple regular dry bones, and a shy guy.  \"Go to your rooms and fresh up, kids, we are celebrating the beginning of the end of our troubles.  Unveiling the solution to all our troubles.\" Bowser laughed.  \"Alright!\" The Junior and the Koopalings cried out in joy as they go to prepare for a celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in the catacombs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina's body was recently tossed on the pile of the Koopa Clan's enemies (some of them are Mario's from the lives that were lost XD).  The henchmen just left it to rot, laughing and cheering \"One down, the rest are next, Kehehehehe.  Watch out Mario.  Good thing I got a camera, that was going on ShroomTube.\"  About a minute later, the body starting struggling a bit and then suddenly opened her eyes with a gasp.  She sat up breathing heavily from being dead for a few minutes.  \"Is this Underwhere?\"  It was dark down there so it was hard to see, but somehow she sees that the room is brighter than it is supposed to be without most torches which dimly lights it.  And she was horrified with what she woke up on, the same pile of bodies and skeletons they threw her on.  She scrambled off and horror and fell on her side causing a sharp pain in her side.  She just laid there a bit in speechless awe.  \"Am... Am I alive? H-How?\" She murmured silently as she finally got up.  She heard laughter from the outside of the room and looked out to notice that the minions decide to hang out for a bit and walk off.  'Yep, definitely still alive...' Rosalina thought.  For some reason she could smell turtle stew on the koopa, cherries on the red cloaked shy guy, and chicken bones on the dry bones, which stopped coming to her when they left.  Rosalina chose to creep out and move around the catacombs a bit without attracting attention to the goons who are leaving the catacombs.  She had to do something about her situation, she needs to see what happened since she \"died,\" but she also needed to make sure her lumas and friends are doing alright.  Maybe she should...</span></div></div>",

The trance was broken by a sharp pain in her stomach as it starts growling.  It was hard to stand at first but then she thinks she can keep going despite her hunger pains.  She powered through the pain in her growling stomach by following the sweet smell only to find the source through sniffles. \"H-he's going to go back *hic* on his word... I know it... *hic* He will do the same to the others with that horrible spear... *hic* he did to Rosalina...\" \"Peach?\" Rosalina whispered to her self. 'Is she where the smell is coming from' Rosalina thought, then a sharp grunt came out as her hunger pains become agitated.  \"H-hello? Kappa...? Is that you...?\" Peach called out.  Does she know one of the minions.  She stumbled into the shadows as she turns to face Peach.  \"Wh-who are you...? Show yourself!\" Peach demanded.  Rosalina looked relieved and horrified at the same time, Peach didn't meet the same fate Rosalina did but Peach is the source of the sweet smell.  Rosalina had to step forward... causing Peach to start shacking \"Rosalina...? hahaHAHAHA It's you... IT'S YOU! Your alive... how is this possible?! I thought you were dead! I am so happy you are not...\" Peach yelled out with tears of joy to see one of her newest and closest friends, alive and well, only to find that Rosalina froze up, drooling slightly.  A dark energy flowed out of where she was stabbed.  Seeing Peach for the first time through her scent, the hunger pains, it was all the beginning of her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'open...' Rosalina's skin turns pale.  She only had so long to speak before the changes progress.  \"What is happening to me?\" Rosalina whispered out to Peach. 'enter...' her finger nails grew and sharpened becoming claws. 'Why does this feel so good?!' Rosalina though as she continues to transform.  \"R-Rosalina...?\" Peach quivered at what is happening.  What did Bowser do to her?  Did he do more than kill her?! Rosalina's eyes started glowing red as her pupils became slits. 'Consume...' 'I need to fight this... please let me fight it!' Rosalina shouted in her head. Her fangs emerged. \"P-Peach... p-please... s<b>t</b>a<b>y</b> <b>away</b>\" Rosalina pleaded as her tone grew more dark and seductive.    Her body surged with blood-corrupted star magic causing something else to happen...  \"<b>Please... Help MEEEE!</b>\" Rosalina yelled out as bony-like wings burst out her back.  Peach watched in horror, because of him, Rosalina had become a vampire.  Rosalina snarls as she slowly looks at Peach with hunger in her eyes.  Peach steps away terrified of the monster Bowser has created.  Terrified <i>for</i> Rosalina who had transformed into that monster.  She knew Rosalina could not take it anymore.

Rosalina looked down sadly at Peach, saying \"I'm sorry, I didn't want to hurt you.  I was just so hungry, and I didn't know why until I met you again.  I should have...\" \"What happened to you?\" Peach said. \"Peach, I...\" \"What did Bowser do to you, he said you were dead.\"  Peach said clearly upset with what Rosalina had become.  Rosalina said clearly scarred from her death \"I didn't know what happened, Kamek captured me, Bowser impaled my chest with that... <b>horrible spear</b> turning me into this... <b>Bloodsucker</b>.\" Rosalina's eyes glow red as she remembers that memory.  \"All so he can get revenge on Mario.\" Peach grimanced, all over this dulling kidnapping cycle, how far will that monster go?  \"Princess? Are you alright?\" Kappa appeared behind them.  The princess turn and saw Kappa standing there and after a few awkward seconds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAGGGGGHHHH\" The threesome screamed for a few moments before the magikoopa freaks out thinking Rosalina came back as a vampire for revenge and starts throwing himself to Rosalina, begging for mercy.  \"Vampire!? Nonononono, I have no idea what bowser was thinking please spare me.  Kamek gave him the idea not me!\" Kappa bawled.  \"Agh, I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you!  I didn't want to feed on Peach!  I am sorry for the commotion! I don't know what is going on here!\" Rosalina bellowed out trying to calm Kappa down.  \"Calm down she is with us!\" Peach cried doing the same thing Rosalina is.  Kappa became more focused on the torn off door.  \"But what would Bowser say about THAT?! Surely a vampire would do this rather than his captive princess would.\" Kappa shouted.  Short seconds off awkward staring at the detached door strewn on the floor deformed by Rosalina's unholy strength given to her by her affliction.  \"I was... blood-starved... wait, how do you know what happened to me?!\" Rosalina asked and realized she confirmed Kappa's suspicions and slapped her mouth.  \"I... I got this.  A forbidden tome on Corrupting Darkness.\" Kappa stated. \"Type V in your case for well... Vampirism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina clench her fists at being told what she became, as if it was a cruel reminded she did not survive being impaled without a cost of her humanity.  \"That would explain why I got turned into a vampire by a spear of corrupted star magic.\" Rosalina huffed.  \"That is what we called Dark Star Magic, or Ztar Magic as some of us would like to call it, more specifically Corrupting Darkness which is the kind of corrupted star magic that spear is made of.  One that resulted in star magic being exposed to blood tainted by dark stardust.\" Kappa grimaced, \"What drove Bowser mad with power.  I can imagine how Bowser can react to what it really is and what it did to you.  He would resort to classic vampire hunting to get rid of you for good.\" Rosalina cringed at the thought of Bowser as a vampire.  \"We wouldn't want a vampire Koopa able to turn to a more monsterous drypire form, remember when Bowser said he tried it on a few dry bones since they can't really die?  That is also an ability\" \"Gyaya, someone is coming!  It's not safe here anymore.\"  Kappa quivered.  Everyone else just left with him as the guards started patrolling again.  \"Oi, what happened to the door... and the Princess?!\" A koopa yelped in panic.  \"Looks like someone a vampire would do! I KNEW they were real!\"  A goomba croaked in fear.  \"SOMEONE SHUT THE GOOMBA UP AND FIND HER! GET BOWSER!\"  Dry Bones hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The army is going on a victory trip the mushroom kingdom to take it all over with an army\" Kappa yelped in a panicked state.  \"I knew it!\" Peach yelled out.  \"We got to do something about this, my Vampirism, the army, the evil spears, we have to warn them.\"  Rosalina warned.  \"We know, that is why I got something in my little stash I was saving for Peach, if you are willing to follow me where no one can detect us.\"  As they round the corner...</span></div></div>",

A surge of hatred flows through Rosalina's mind as she re-balances herself and her fangs emerge as she hisses at the villains as she points her finger at Bowser, her eyes burning red as she glares at the King himself while she shifts to her vampire form. \"You did this to me! What were you thinking?! You are lucky this dump isn't overrun with vampires created by me.  Why would you do this to me?!\" Rosalina ranted as bony-wings emerged from her back, membrane made of her blood-warped magic, to further demonstrate the damage done to her.  Something else emanates to show something about to emerge to show them her wrath.  \"This is crazy, YOU ARE CRAZY! This is what your obsession can do to people, she wanted to go back to her lumas, now she is unsure she can stay without hurting them in anyway!  Kidnapping is one thing but you are willing to RUIN lives, I thought she was dead!  What is wrong with you!?\"  Peach shouted.  \"What? It was just a bit of karma for helping that whoo-hoo wooping jerk of a plumber.  But her curse would do just fine.\"  Bowser huffed.  \"Mario deserves a good beating, not getting slaughtered with no remorse.  Or ruining other lives to do so.  Can't say I disagree with Peach on this really, because I don't agree with using Corrupting Darkness on a mother of a bunch of lumas, no matter how much she interferes.\"  Kappa barked.  \"<b>You stay out of this, traitor!</b>\"  Bowser bellowed pointing his spear at Kappa, prompting a yelp and quiver while Rosalina bears her fangs at Bowser as she stands in front in defense of Kappa.  \"Disappointing, Kappa... VERY disappointing.\" Kamek hissed.  \"Is that so...? AND TURNING ME INTO A MONSTER IS ANY BETTER?!\"  Rosalina shouted in tears.  \"You are more powerful for one... a shame you used them to defend those weaklings... instead of turning them.\"  Kamek callously responded, Kappa just gulped.  \"Enough!  I am getting too old for this... Morton? Roy? Grab the Princess, and if Kappa stays with them, crush him with the fledgling.\"  Bowser requested.  Roy and Morton just looked at each other, smiling sadistically \"You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?\" Roy asked.  Morton chuckled a bit. \"I'll crush the runt!\"  Morton growled at Kappa with a vicious grin.  \"Come here my pretty!\" Roy beckoned in a taunting tone.  Morton laughed maniacally as he charged at Kappa and lunged at him... \"STOP!\" Rosalina shouted as she held out an arm to Morton, but he was suspended disturbingly close to Rosalina in her vampire form with a sharp pain in his body.  Everyone frozen in horror (even Bowser) as they turn to Morton impaled by a purplish-blood red spike bursting out of the shard like mass of her vampiric magic covering her right arm.  Morton just gagged and grunted in pain as he turned his sight to the sword-like spike as he bled all over it only for the blood to be absorbed which made Rosalina feel like she just fed again by the sudden taste of turtle soup on her tongue.  Morton starting screaming in agony as he is being fogged by her magic till Rosalina shook him off and the fog cleared revealing a dry bones version of Morton falling apart as he hit the ground.  \"MORTON!\" Wendy shouted as the rest of the enemy freaked out about what just happened.  Bowser just stared in horror at what Rosalina did to defend Kappa, he then glared at Rosalina in rage realizing what happened and pointed his Dark Spear at her.  \"KILL THEM!\" Bowser shouted fire flying out of his mouth.  He is MAD!  Everyone started rushing down the stairs (even jumping off said stairs for a quicker way) with their weapons and wands ablaze.  Kappa looked at the princesses.  \"Alright, new plan... RUN!\" Kappa shouted in panic as he and Peach grabbed Rosalina so her monstrous speed will take them with as she bolted for the entrance, just before Roy and a few big guys could dog-pile them.  Bowser stomped and shouted in frustration as everyone looked over in mourning at the remains of Morton, Bowser finally looked at the bones and his spear and sighed \"That does it...\"  Bowser growled then jumped over to Morton's skeleton, stabbing the ground and drowned the remains in Ztar Magic, Morton roared a disturbing roar as he came back together and screech, the star magic faded back into the spear as blood magic is left to handle the rest returning his flesh in a horrifying, vampiric form of Morton.  \"FIND THAT MURDERER AND KILL HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY FIRST!  I want her to pay for what she just did!\"  In a flash the minions, Koopalings and all, poured out in droves to search the Dark Lands and all lands surrounding it.  \"I got bigger fish to fry with this baby.\"  Bowser sneered as he returned to the vat filled with a dark mass.  Bowser looked over glumly from disappointment from the fact that she would interfere with him again.  He then looked over to the samples Rosalina gave out during her death and the spear with an evil grin as he growls \"Got some ideas baby, let's get to it. He he he he...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of Rosalina running at supernatural speed through the Dark Lands where monsters are on patrol...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang screamed in panic as they bolt through the forest just outside one of the towers just outside Dark Land and stopped by the cave to make sure her speed helped to lose the group of pursuing enemies.  After a few hours of traveling and a few hours of resting, Rosalina groaned in discomfort as her stomach growls, which at this point is not a good sign to Kappa and Peach meaning Rosalina will have to bite one of them, running the risk of infection.  Of course, Rosalina confessed she bit Peach and drank her blood and Peach only feeling wooziness from blood loss made them assume that the stereotype of vampires turning their victims by just biting them is not necessarily true, which made them feel much better.  \"Ugh... why did we have to discover that accursed magic, now he knows what it did to Rosalina...\" Kappa groaned as he put away his journal and grumbled as he straightens one of his buttons and noticed Rosalina starting to enjoy the taste of Peach's blood as she feeds while Peach started showing discomfort.  \"HEY! Aren't supposed to be satisfied after a moment, how are we going to explain the Princess getting sucked dry?!\"  Kappa barked snapping Rosalina out of her blood-induced euphoria and let go of Peach, feeling weakened by the feeding while looking rather annoyed at Rosalina, who is still wiping the blood trickling the side of her mouth and licking it.  \"I am sorry, really I am!  She just smells so good, like peaches and cake.\"  Rosalina cried out, clearly panicked by what she did.  \"At least find some way to remind you that you could have drained me.  Ugh, no offense, but I hate this feeling of being fed on.\"  Peach muttered rubbing her neck.  \"At least it wasn't as bad as my first time! *sigh* What would the other think of me, now that I am forced to feed on others to survive?  Is there even a cure for this.\"  Rosalina sighed.  \"I am surprised that you know much about vampires, being a space-traveler and all.\"  Kappa said.  \"Pardon me, but I have a library on my observatory!  One time I read a book about mythical beings.  Didn't think they were real, but then again I just learned that Luigi adopted a ghost dog, so I guess anything is possible.\"  Rosalina responded faked offense at first, then though about a book and what is now her species.  \"Thankfully, I am strong enough to not set me on fire by the sun... even though the sun doesn't even shine on Dark Land.\"  \"That's Dark Land for ya, no sunlight, only lava and bones, Heh.\" Kappa retorted with a chuckle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a more hours of traveling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagical shapes are floating across the clearing towards the gang, causing Kappa to suddenly face the princesses and block the magic with bubble shields and releasing them with a 'phew.'  \"Again, DISAPPOINTING!\" Kamek floated overhead on his broom charging his magic blasts.  \"Oh, son of a bi...\" Kappa groaned in frustration before getting shot at the feet causing him to jump around, yelping in panic, much to the pleasure of the minions that follow Kamek out of the the forest.  \"Oh no, they found us, look out!\"  Rosalina shouting grabbing Kappa and pulling him out of the way of a sledgehammer flying towards him, and slashed at the hammer with her Ztarm-Blade, as she called it.  It hit the metal and bounced the hammer away.  \"You three are under arrest under the Koopa King for killing one of his children and turning him into a pile of bones!\" Kamek proclaimed in an angry tone.  \"Morton tried to kill Kappa,and you are one to talk, you cheered when Bowser impaled Rosalina.\" Peach spat.  \"Silence!\" Kamek shouts as he shoots magic at Peach, who jumped out of the way.  \"Haven't you ruined enough lives today?\" Rosalina asked coldly.  \"Not until the Mario Bros are dead!  And even then, Bowser is the King of Koopas, he does what he wants!\" Kamek hissed as he starts attacking again, this time Rosalina.  One more blast flew at Kappa.  Peach blocked the shot with her back.  Rosalina witnessed this and, feeling something emerging, as rage build up inside her.  Her body started snapping and crackling, she started yelling in pain as she transformed yet again.  Her muscles swell up slightly, making her grow a few feet, her claws grew longer as did her fingers, feet and toes.  Her wings grew in bigger than normal.  A spine-like tail emerged lifting her dress and whipping side by side.  Her ribs push up against her chest as an extra rib-cage grew out of the sides of her chest.  Then she turned to face Kamek with a look of murder, and roared at Kamek.</span></div></div>",

Some of them were cut down as they approached with her claws.  A dark blast was formed to blow some others away.  Her arms grew Ztarm-Blades as she snarls at the remaining.  Rosalina then plunged them into two big guys, which drained their life away, turning them to desiccated corpses this time as she didn't have time to reduce them to bone.  \"<b>DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE!</b>\"  Rosalina rants on as she then slashes at the others, cutting them to lifeless pieces.  Her arm-blades disappeared as she pants for a moment, a wicked grin formed as she found that the remaining kill waiting for her is Kamek who, being the smart one of the group, bolted off screaming on his broom like his life depended on him.  She calmed down and started reverting back to normal as she looks horrified at what she did to the ones that didn't escape.  \"<b>I... I... I'm</b> not <b>a monster...</b> I'm not a monster...\" Rosalina chanted scarred from the results of her rampage, but realized Peach and Kappa are missing.  She started to desperately smell around only to find them trying to hide in the bushes with a buttoned hat poking out.  \"Is it over...?  Are the goons gone?  *looks around*  Well at least they are gone.\" Kappa murmured.  \"Kappa!  Thank goodness, how is Peach?\" Rosalina called out, hoping she survived, to which Kappa responds, \"Let me check...\"</span></div></div>",

Besides killing is not always necessary, but you clearly had no choice seeing how far gone they are...\" Kappa said.  \"What do you mean?  Kamek seemed normal... and what about my monstrous self?\" Rosalina responds.  \"The spear had more affect on you than we once believed, more-so than the other subjects as far as I know.  They probably gone mad from the influence of ztar magic, were they used on as well?\" Kappa responded.  After a minute of pondering, Peach was left completely healed.  \"Ugh... is anyone alright?\" Peach asked.  \"Ok, you are alright, *sign* so are we.  But our attackers aren't.\"  Rosalina responded sadly.  \"You did what you had to do to save us, we don't have to repeat this.\" Kappa said comforting Rosalina. \"I sliced them to pieces, I Drained them, I BUTCHERED THEM!  The worst Mario did was whack them on the head and jump on them, or shot them with those damn power-ups!  What I did to them is NOTHING like how you would have handled them!\" Rosalina shouted, clearly in tears from what she did in her monstrous form.  \"Peach and I could have been captured and had Peach's mind and soul corrupted by those twisted spears while I would be executed for trying to help my people away from said spears!\" Kappa retorted.  Rosalina tried explain how what she did is worse, but what Kappa just said about the spears and consequences can bring out more calamity than Rosalina killing a group of goons in her dry beast form.  \"I... I understand.  I am not sure I am going to forget this easily though.\" Rosalina said.  \"Did you become that creature when you saw me get hit by Kamek's spell?\" Peach asked. \"Yeah...?\" Rosalina responded.  \"Maybe you gain that form because I got hurt.  You got very angry when I was injured, and taught Kamek that we cannot be trifled with us because you care about us, even though we are not vampires like you.  If you didn't we would more likely be dead.\" Peach reminded. \"Thank you Peach, that means a lot to me.\" Rosalina responded with a smile.  \"Should we rest up for tomorrow?  I know Rosalina doesn't need sleep anymore, unless to recover faster, so maybe we could trust her without her feeding on us? Or should one of us help out so she could have someone to feed on so she won't eat us in our sleep?\"</span></div></div>",

I have to... *cough* become like her?\"  Rosalina tears up as her eyes widen.  What does that supposed to mean?  Is she going to play a hand in Bowser's ruining more lives?!  How is she going to explain this to the rest of the kingdom?!  'Hey guys, I got fatally experimented on by Bowser with a dark spear and awoke on a pile of bodies as a vampire who had to turn your princess into a vampire herself to save her life when a magikoopa tried to kill her.  Kappa?  Nope, he helped us escape!' It is not that simple, this is not like ripping her dress and getting her a new one, I am being forced to turn her into a creature of the night to save her life, or what's left of it.  \"I... I can't... I... I don't want them to think less of me.  I don't want to be the monster that ruined their princess!\" Rosalina cried, tearing up for what is happening next.  \"I understand... you can do this, we might find the cure anyway, who knows...?\" Peach said with a weak smile.  Rosalina cried for a little, then tried to regain her dignity. \"Alright... this might pinch a little.  I don't know I was dead mostly when this started... <b>hehe, please be ok.</b>\" Rosalina sighed defeated as she changes to her vampire form and knelt by the princess and sank her fangs in her shoulder once more, but this time her blood and magic flowed into Peach who winced in response then closed her eyes, silently bidding farewell to her old life, hopefully for now.  Her veins are noticeably glowing purple as her skin pales and the warmth of her body fades away.  She twitched a little as she groans from the transformation and turned on her side, the duo backed away as her back starts warping and groaning as her own set of wings grow in, her body was glowing with Rosalina's magic, which is now inside of her along with her blood.  She gritted her teeth which now bears fangs as her eyes shot open with a gasp and breathing, now glowing red with slits for pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Welcome to Vampirism, Peach...</b>\" Rosalina whispered with a sad, guilty tone and she picks up Kappa, \"<b>You might want to hide here.</b>\"  \"Wait, WHAT?!\" Kappa yelped as a muffled grunt came out as soon as she shoved him under her dress, since she already fed, she might not want to let Peach drain the poor magikoopa. \"<b>Sorry, this is the best I can do.</b>\" Rosalina said. \"Did you do battle Bowser's boys before?  It's musky in here!\" Kappa complained, only to be shushed by Rosalina.  \"<b>I was recently accepted into smash bros 4 and Ultimate, now shush!  She's hunting...</b>\" Rosalina whispered as Peach looked around growling and sniffing for fresh meat nearby, hungry from the transformation.  She got up and hissed as she found fresh corpses to feed off of and sped towards them.  During her feeding, Rosalina let Kappa slip out of her dress gagging a little. \"Never smelled so much leg in my life.\" Kappa said.  \"<b>At least you are not part of Peach's first feeding.</b>\" Rosalina retorted.  \"True that!\" Kappa muttered.  Peach knelt over the corpses, filled up on the blood she now craves, her wings unfold as she feels her new powers flow through her body as she returns to find Rosalina and Kappa.  \"<b>Is Kappa alright?  I fell asleep as soon as you bit me and know I woke up drinking their blood.</b>\" Peach asked concerned about their new friend.  \"<b>I hid him under my dress.  It was the best I can do.</b>\" Rosalina responded, sounding motherly to Peach for some reason, she was revived by Rosalina however.  \"<b>Oh... ok then??</b>\" Peach decided not to question it.  \"<b>So how do we explain this to the people, Rosalina?</b>\" Peach asked sadly.  \"I am tired of this crap for one day!  Let's just cross that bridge when we burn it.  Being how nice they are I am sure they would understand if we mention Bowser's experiment, it's not like you two actually wanted to become vampires.\" Kappa complained.  \"<b>Y-yeah...</b>\" Rosalina hesitated a bit, why did she hesitate?  \"<b>What are we going to do now?</b>\" Peach asked.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosalina continued her walk through the halls of Bowser's castle. 'why does such a cool castle belong to such a psychopath?' Rosalina thought as she wanders towards the two mirrors, one normal and the other made from the same substance as the spear the she thought killed her.  'I can't believe I am still alive... is this even possible? Can I finally see my children again?' Rosalina thought as she passes through the mirrors, only to stop in the middle and is silhouetted by the sunlight from the view of Kappa, who noticed the woman standing in the middle. 'No, something wrong, why do I suddenly smell turtle stew again, I-I-I don't...' Rosalina thought as she looked around in a panic until she stared wide-eyed at the normal mirror.  She saw that she had no reflection, this scared her to the point when she placed her hand over heart, and felt no pulse.  She shook in fear, her mind fogged by questions about her situation, what will happen, and what is going on.  She turned to the dark mirror, to find that the dark one had her reflection, but it looked wrong.  Her flesh is pale and cold to the touch, her eyes are red and her pupils are replaced with slits. A gasp has revealed her new fangs sticking out from the top of her set of teeth. she looked at her hand, shaking with terror at the evidence of what she is, what she is turning into.  Her fingernails lengthen into claws, this cause her to remember the book she read on the creatures of the night, the one she had become.  'claws, sweet smell, no reflection...' Rosalina thought, tears forming in her eyes at the realization of what she had become. \"red eyes, pale skin, fangs, blood, blood, blood, night, claws, blood, fangs, blood, blood, bite, pale skin, fangs, red eyes\" Rosalina rambled breaking down from her realization.  She had become a vampire, a creature of the night, and it was because of Bowser and that damn spear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKappa saw the woman start crying and muttering something about blood and fangs, which immediately set off his \"bad times ahead\" senses, he knew it didn't just kill her.  Actually it technically did since vampires are essentially undead, so she is basically dead.  But he knows that affect from that tome he likes to carry around.  It's a pretty cool looking book that informs the reader the danger of  Corrupting Darkness, a form of Ztar Magic.  Seems this woman's corruption doesn't seem to affect her personality and morality since she is crying, but he needs to be prepared for an attacking vampire.  He crept towards the woman and passes the sunlight to find to his horror that the woman is Rosalina looking at his direction from her crying, probably wants to slaughter him for working for her supposed killer.  \"AGH! ROSALINA?! YOU WERE DEAD! DON'T HURT ME! I WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS!\" Kappa cried as he throws a blood bag at her.  \"Please stop!  I don't want to hurt you!\" Rosalina cried, but the bag hit her face and her hunger caused her to grab the bag and plunge her fangs in the bag and drank blood from it.  \"You got your food, please spare me!\" Kappa cried out ducking and cowering.  \"T-Thank you... come on, I won't hurt you.  I don't want to hurt anyone.\"  Rosalina said wiping the tears from her eyes. \"I just want to see my friends again.  I want to see my children again, but I don't want to risk draining them.\"  Rosalina said tearing up from the thought of how they might take her transformation into a vampire.  \"I'm just gonna visit Peach for a bit...?\" Kappa said  as he scampers off a little, making Rosalina weep a little more before he could leave.  \"You can do the same if you wish, she would love to see YOU again.  Just don't try anything.  I am NOT keen on getting drained today.  Maybe if you are good, you might be useful.\" Kappa said in a way that calmed her down.  \"O-ok... I won't hurt you...\" Rosalina said as she got up and followed Kappa to Peach's cell.  Whatever Kappa's plan is, it will work as a lone goomba finally found his way to the dining hall when he overheard that Rosalina somehow survived and is currently following the traitorous Kappa to Peach's cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Rosalina become a vampire spooked the mushroom creature and snagged the empty blood bag and a sheet of paper he dropped and bolted right for the dining hall.  The goomba then slammed the dining doors open and ran over the dining ware to warn Bowser of a new update.  \"BOWSER! BOWSER! A VAMPIRE IS IN THE CASTLE, THE VAMPIRE IS ROSALINA, THE ONE WE THOUGHT YOU KILLED!\" Goomba shouted in panic.  \"What?! A vampire?! Rosalina?! How did she survive?! You dare lie to the KING?!\" Bowser shouted slamming the table.  The goomba just threw the evidence onto the empty area, horrifying the ocupants.  \"Kappa gave this to her, and has plans to use her strength to get the princess back home!\" the goomba shouted.  Bowser snarled and threw his dishware \"GUARDS! SEARCH THE CASTLE AND BRING ME KAPPA AND THE PRINCESSES IMMEDIATELY!\" Bowser commanded and just like that the minions pour out in droves to search for the criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was weeping from watching that clip of Rosalina being impaled and killed by the spear over and over to torture her relentlessly, which made Peach hate Bowser even more than ever, making her repeatedly screech 'I hate you!' and swear words and death threats in Bowser's face in a fit of despair and rage and bite him on the nose hard along with a few horrible scratches.  It was lucky that Kappa healed the scratch marks from when Bowser struck her in response and threatened to bring her Rosalina's fate, as her next visitor would someone she wished were alive, as well as the first vampire she meets.  \"Peach? Are you alright?\" Kappa asked.  \"Of course, I am.  I am so sweet and fabulous even though I watched someone I made feel special GET SLAUGHTERED BY THAT FAT BLOB OF A DRAGON TURTLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN ROSALINA!\" Peach said cheerily until she got to the part where she watched Rosalina get murdered on video.  \"O-o-o-o-ok that's the thing here, um there are... hehehehe complications with the experiment.\" Kappa said. \"WHAT?! Now she is a bloody powerup for his goons, or maybe a grinning hypnotized goo zombie, or better yet she faked her death to get away from me! I can't freaking blame for that, that I let her die!\" Peach yelled on the verge of another emotional breakdown, prompting a disappointed nod from Kappa.  \"*Sigh* She won't believe me you can come out now!\" Kappa called out. \"Ok...\" Rosalina said meekly as she emerged from the shadows, making Peach cover her mouth in wide-eyed shock as she sees her alive and well, albeit looking strange, red eyes and all, but alive nonetheless.  \"Rosalina...? You faked it! You faked your death, I knew it! I never thought you would be able to... oh my god...\" Peach said reaching out to hug Rosalina and she just walked up to her and took the hug, comforting Peach, who didn't care that her body felt cold.  A sweet smell of peaches and cake.  \"Don't get too comfortable, Rosalina came back... different. She is a vampire now.\" Kappa said, prompting a glare from Rosalina, and Peach went wide-eyed.  \"What? She saw the eyes!\" Kappa barked. \"Rosalina?\" Peach said, the red eyes and cold-to-touch pale skin makes sense.  \"I woke up like this.  I remember dying from a spear to the chest and now this.\" Rosalina explained gesturing the fangs.  \"Bowser... he did this to you?!\" Peach almost shouted.  \"Peach, I won't hurt you. I don't want to feed on you. In fact, your little wizard here gave me a blood bag.\" Rosalina said.  \"Where is the vampire?\"  A guard shouts as multiple foots steps can be heard.  \"Oh no, they somehow found out! Rosalina you need to rip the door open.\" Kappa yelled.  Rosalina just grabbed the door and after a few yanks, the door flew right off which shocked Rosalina.  'I never felt this powerful before.' Rosalina said as she wedged the door in the tight corner to keep the guards from getting to the princesses and Kappa.  Rosalina then followed Peach and Kappa as they flee the area before the guards are smart enough to clear the obstacle.  Just leaving the dungeon Kappa lead the girls to the last left turn before the entrance room... what will happen then?</span></div></div>",

He knows who the vampire is, Rosalina.  \"YOU!  You are the reason I am a bloodsucker!\"  Rosalina hissed, her red eyes burning with malice at Bowser.  \"Why did you do this to Rosalina?!  Killing her is one thing, but to force them to live out a possibly eternal life drinking other's blood!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!\"  Peach ranted.  \"Vampires are powerful creatures, whose power are worthy to be wielded by King Bowser!  I realized what the spears did when a lone goomba reported your condition.  I feel like I should make you my second wife, Peach would be the first after I make you turn her!  Then you lovely ladies will be the ones to lead an army on the Mushroom Kingdom once you turn all yours friends and family, except Kappa who will stand trial for treason!  I am sure my vampire wives won't be able to get enough of magic turtle blood.\"  Bowser snarls, looking at Kappa at the end, which made the little magikoopa gulp as Bowser gives him a maniacal grin.  \"Now give up!  You are coming with us!\" Bowser commanded as Rosalina looked to find it just turned night throughout the chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well... I got a BETTER idea!\" Rosalina roared as she slammed her fist into one of the walls, bashing a huge hole in the side.  She than jumped off after grabbing Peach and Kappa.  \"NO!  Where are my paratroopers?!  Find them!\"  The trio screamed as bony wings burst out of Rosalina's back and they carry them throughout the skies of Dark Lands, holding Kappa and Peach tightly.  She never felt so free flying through the sky, she would say this is truly a gift she wants to spread to others if it doesn't makes them drink blood to survive.  She would give this up to not have to hurt innocents to survive.  \"I'm flying...\" is all Rosalina can say as she darts through the Dark Lands, searching for a forest to hide in.  \"YES I AM AWARE OF THAT!\" Kappa shouted stuffing his ztar tome in his face.  \"What are you doing, Kappa?!\" Peach called out.  \"I'm not a big fan of heights!\" Kappa responded.  \"Maybe we can land near the tower, there is already a white flag coming out of it, Mario already beat the tower!  We can look for help there if Bowser hadn't already posted his goons there!\" Rosalina said.  \"Not a good idea, heard plans about it earlier!\" Kappa responded.  \"Darn it.  We'll just fly lower then.\" Rosalina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina, Peach and Kappa stopped by a toad house after leaving Dark Land.  Peach was able to get intel about Mario and his allies being somewhere back at the one of the worlds before this one, which means going back a long way, they will most likely run into them.  Good to know that Rosalina's brash wall-punch made the bros' job a lot easier than normal.  \"If only Mario were here...\" Peach groaned.  Rosalina stayed out back to stretch her new wings and learn to make them disappear when she didn't need them.  She can feel her thirst welling up a bit in her mouth, not surprising.  That blood bag was kind of small and so it kept her full for half an hour, now she if feeling hungry again.  \"Rosalina?  We got a place to rest, good thing a vampire of your power can't burn in sunlight as badly as vampires normally do, worst case scenario prolonged exposure can cause a bad sunburn according to Kappa and that book.\" Peach chirped, noticing that Rosalina seems to walk over with a hand on her stomach.  \"Are you getting hungry?\" Peach whispered worried about her friend.  \"W-wow, you smell nice...\" Rosalina sniffed at Peach a little.  \"O-ok... woah!\" Peach yelped a little as Rosalina grabs hold a bit then lets go.  \"I'm sorry, I... I grabbed you a bit, you smell like peaches and cake so I lost control a bit.\"  Rosalina murmured to Peach.  \"You are just a little hungry then?  I feel like you could hurt me worse if you were starving, maybe if I let you bite me now, it won't be as bad?\" Peach said bringing Rosalina close to her shoulder.  \"I won't take too much...\" Rosalina said as her fangs extended and close in on her flesh.  \"Hello?  I still have a spare with me!\" Kappa called out from the front, freezing the princesses in place before she could bite Peach.  \"Never mind then.\" Peach said, that was awkward.  \"I thought that bag back at the castle was the only one he has.\" Rosalina snapped quietly going back to the front with Peach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the trio continued their adventure (an interesting one I might add from some people's perspective).  \"Alright, I hope my wings work in daylight\" Rosalina said.  \"Only one way to find out... *rustle* what was that\" Peach said noticing sounds coming from the edge of a forest...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosalina opened her eyes weakly to find a dark cell in some dark area.  \"What happened?\" Rosalina thought.  Last time she checked she was with her children, when some man from something called from some organization threw one of them aside, demanded cooperation with a client, who is that creep Bowser, who was brought along to grab Rosalina from behind, and some surgeon guy to deal with their duo of traitors, and shoved a rag in her face when she demanded an explanation.  And then next thing she knows she's here, chained and bound up to some board with a hole to see her entire back though, stripped to her bra and panties, and hearing chatter about destroying Mario and Peach and kagune infusion and... putting something into her?  Wha... what do they want with her?!  Did she do something wrong?!  Why would a group meant to protect the people from ghouls work with someone who wants to control an entire kingdom?!  She has seen what some ghouls did, not all of them enjoyed what they did, they did it because they are desperate to survive, there are ghouls who did not want this violence to go on!  I checked on Mario and Peach and saw a ghoul die helping them escape!  Is that why they went after her, she felt sorry for them?!  Why would they want to destroy Mario and Peach?  What did <i>they</i> do?!  Someone is approaching... she never felt so scared in her life... please help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you honestly think you deserved to be loved by such weak little creatures anymore?  You think you can get away with helping my old friends Mario and Luigi save the \"Princess?\"  You thought I would let you get away with showing pity to those... monsters?!\" the person said with great malice and disappointment with Rosalina as she glared at him.  \"That \"monster\" saved someone from YOUR partner, Bowser!  What in the stars are you thinking working with that power hungry tyrant?!\" Rosalina shouted at the figure, who just gasped a little and held his chest with a chuckle.  \"At least he has a beef with that nuisance you call a hero.  At least he was willing to be fooled by us into once again retaking the \"Princess\" so we can cut her down right in front of that spiny-shelled crook!\" He said as Rosalina just nodded.  \"Why do you quote when you say Princess, she is nothing like Bowser.\" Rosalina snapped.  The figure looked back at someone a bit and then looked back at her, pulling out some apparatus \"You... you don't why? HA! You don't know why we want that mockery of the star children dead! Then again you will relate to her soon enough!\" the figure said stepping out of the shadows, bringing a chill up her spine.  \"I am Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Kanou's assistant until one of those monsters dealt with him, and I will make you more powerful than ever, perfectly able to protect your worthless lumas... at a great cost!\"  He laughed as he flipped Rosalina, now tearing up in fear for what is going to happen next, and readied the apparatus... she just screamed as he remembered to knock her out first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n30 minutes after the surgery...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMario just saved the Princess again, with the help of a luma, worried by its mother's disappearance, hiding in his hat, allowing him to spin attack. This time, she was saved from the members of a long forgotten organization, three of the remaining CCG as it were.  \"You and Peach are under arrest and will be executed.\"  One of the remnants said. \"Oh crap!\" the Mario said as Peach gasped.  \"I back that notion, but we had a deal! THE PRINCESS IS MINE!\"  Bowser shouted.  \"You do not know what she really is tyrant!\" The agent said as he knocked him off the bridge with a strange club.  \"YOU SON OF A...\" Bowser screamed as he became completely submerged in lava, while Mario took the opportunity to break Peach out yet again and fled as the agent took notice.  \"They are getting away!\" one of them said. \"The other is out to kill the newborn ghoul, they will deal with them.  Let's follow them!\" The other said and got flung into the lava by a burnt up, VERY angry Bowser. \"How do ya like getting burnt. COME AT ME!\" Bowser shouted as they engage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina groaned again as she woke up laying on the dungeon floor, and notice her now dusty dress resting nearby.  Getting up slightly, she cringed in pain from her back being cut open and stitched together and bandaged.  She reached for it and slipped it on.  Her wand fell out of her sleeve via conjuration and used it to unlock the door and walked out to find no one is here, hearing footsteps of someone down the halls and floated in the opposite direction to attract no attention.  What is strange is that a nice smell is coming from the direction, telling her to turn back and greet it.  \"Show yourself, ghoul!\" a voice sounded behind her.  This scared her enough to move faster, but the smell is starting to hinder her, voices muffled in her head.  Her stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the way into the dungeon!\"  Mario called out.  \"Rosalina? Where are you?\" Peach called out.  \"OI LADY! How did you escape? Get back in there.\" a hammer bro commanded Peach just lowered her head with a sigh irritation and turned to face the koopa. \"What in the... what is wrong with your eye?\" hammer bro said.  Then suddenly something behind Peach made herself known.  \"What the heck is that?!  How long can ya do that? GWAAAAAAAA-\" hammer bro shouted as that something lashed out at him, dealing nasty damage as it slashed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina can't tell which way to go anymore, voices in her head telling her to find it. 'I... I can't... someone help...' Rosalina thought as the smell grew stronger, she passed by a mirror and noticed that smell is making her drool profusely.  'I must leave, I have to... submit.' Rosalina's mind slowly faded away, slowly giving in to the controlling influence of her hunger.  'I don't want to leave anymore... I need to eat... I want to eat...' Her incredible strength grew, something is shuffling in her back threatening to tear the stitches off to break free.  'no escape, no mercy, just... just flesh... I want it... I WANT FLESH!'  Rosalina shouted in her head.  She screeched as something rips its way out of her back, tearing the back of her dress along with the flesh and stitches, she stumbled into a cell and screeched again as she transforms, her flesh warping and fusing as something now flails, free from its prison, glowing in the dark along with her right eye covered by her bang.  Now getting up, Rosalina snarls as she now stands consumed by a dark hunger, her mind now that of a dangerous predator.  \"A woman...? Where are you? There you are, are you alright.\" an agent spoke.  A drooling Rosalina growled like an animal as she glared at the agent with an insane smile, something rising from the shadows.  \"Th-that... your eye is normal that's impossible... Kanou is de-AAAAAGGGGHHHH!\" the agent scream as an enraged screech echoed from a rabid Rosalina tackling him something bolting through to end the agent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GGRRRAAAAGGGGHHHH!\" a feminine roar, along with a scream and a horrible sound, echoed through the dungeon.  \"Mario, that came from that way.\"  Peach cried out.  Mario then felt a whimper and shuffling in his hat. \"It's-a alright! We will find your mama.\" Mario responded reassuring the luma in his hat.  They turn the corner to find a figure, Rosalina upon inspection, eating a body.  The luma peeked out \"M-mama...?\" it said horrified by what happened to her.  Mario and Peach just watched as Rosalina finished eating the body, and burped silently before getting up.  Her mind fully cleared and in control of herself.  She looked to see her friends and child staring in horror, noticing something receding into Peach.  \"R-Rosalina...?\" Peach asked.  'What has he done to her?!' Mario thought.  Rosalina looked at what she did, her hands covered in blood, the bite marks and gashes, the stickiness by her mouth.  She tried not to throw up, and ends up swallowing it.  But her eyes are streaming with tears at her kill.  \"Oh god... W-what have I done...?  I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...\" was all Rosalina could say as tears started flowing from eyes.  Rosalina quickly peeked at the mirror and lifted her bang to find her eye has changed to a red iris and black sclera. \"What's happening to me?!\" she cried as she dropped her bang back on her eye.  \"Y-you're ok, you are not alone.\"  Peach said as her own right eye turned black and red, her something coming out in full bloom, eliciting a gasp from Rosalina.  It's her kagune resembling leaves of a peach (ukaku) and the vines (rinkaku), both of which are a shade of pink brighter than her dress.  \"We are both ghouls...\" Peach said smiling sadly to comfort Rosalina.  'Dr. Mortimer, turned me into a ghoul?!  What will my children think?!'  Rosalina thought, devastated by the revelation as she noticed the luma coming out of hiding and trying to comfort her.  \"I am so sorry, my child.  I don't know what happened *sniff* I was up there, and I got kidnapped by Bowser and that *sniff* agent and Dr. Mortimer changed me!  I lost control and killed someone!  This is not what I want!\"  Rosalina said hugging the small luma, which strangely doesn't yield a pleasant smell like the agent did.  Mario was making signs that he knew what Peach is.  \"I figured that-a out, Peach being a ghoul and all.\" Mario said, as Peach looked down ashamed she had to keep it a secret.  \"Mario, Luigi, Daisy, Dr. E Gadd and Toadsworth know about me already.  I'm sorry I kept it a secret from you.  I will make this up by supporting you!  I could teach you to use your Kagune and to hunt.  Our friends will help keep us safe, while we do the same for them.\"  Peach proclaimed, hugging Rosalina with her arms and kagune before letting go.  'That is her kagune?  Then what is mine?'  Rosalina thought as she looked to her back and gasped at the sight.  The something that helped her end the agent was her Kagune, or more specifically her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: There is not enough choices for the Koukaku or Bikaku or Chimera. Sorry about that!</span></div></div>",

She bucked her shoulders around to find that they move accordingly, lowering and rising in sync.  She even flapped her wings, only to find that they aren't exactly fit for flying.  \"Then what is this coming out of my back?\" Rosalina asked. \"That is your ukaku, one of the RC types we ghouls have.  Certain positions our Kakukou are in decides what type of kagune we have.  I don't know what happened to mine, but I have both ukaku and rinkaku, because my kakukou developed in the the shoulder area, like how it was implanted in your, but then I developed a spare in the middle back, mainly my waist for my rinkaku.\" Peach explains spreading out her kagune.  \"As you saw the only way we can keep this is if we consume the flesh of the living.\" She continued in a sad tone as she and Rosalina sat by the body.  She decided to use her kagune to cut off a piece of flesh and ate it to feed herself.  'I wanted flesh... that is all I can eat from now on... this helps me understand why ghouls hurt other people, they can only eat flesh. Then how would I last out there in space? How can I find planets that have people who provide flesh to consume, how could I even go through with it?  I don't to kill innocent people!' Rosalina thought but then nodded a little \"Then how did you survive all that time you were a ghoul?\" Rosalina asked, this made Peach make a weird face then shook her head. \"I always end up at the throne room's cage due to the mysterious disappearances of his goons in the dungeon and assumed it was Mario, while really... I was the one who ate his minions.\" Peach responds with a small frown as she presses her index fingers together, Mario turned green and gagged a little even though he heard the story enough times to strengthen his stomach, but Rosalina is not that well-versed in hearing that Peach actually ate some of Bowser's goons.  \"Frankly I learn that I can consume the flesh of sentient beings, humans most commonly as they taste better than Koopa, and starbits, since they are technically not human food, which we cannot consume.  Yeah I know, we can eat starbits, but not human food.  We can have water and coffee too.\" Peach said Rosalina's ukaku perk up in response, she can still eat starbits?  She doesn't have to rely on flesh all the time to stay alive!  \"Since I live to be kind to others, I would rather eat people who are already dead when I found them, like when they committed suicide.\" Peach said which bummed Rosalina out, suicide victims?!  Seeing how much trouble murder can cause, at least she is not killing anyone.  Rosalina had one more question, \"Were you always a ghoul?\" Rosalina asked.  Peach sighed \"I was born a star child, I can tell you know it, but that wasn't the end of it.  This is, or was, my mother's Kagune, my father was a human who went through the same hell Mario is in right now.  He understood why she left him at night, she couldn't eat food like he could, but the starbits was a thing sometime back then, that is when our ghoul biology decided that starbits, despite being edible, do not count as human food and therefore cannot get us sick like normal food would, which is such a good thing, that we don't have to rely solely on consuming the flesh of others, although we have to consume larger quantities of starbits, as much as any normal food, to get same satisfaction as eating flesh. In fact, a good amount of flesh keeps you well for 1-2 months at most.  We felt that it doesn't excuse hurting others, though.  That is why I like starbits, they don't make me throw up.  Why I am ruling the Mushroom Kingdom instead of them is... well, something I don't like to talk about often.  All I could say is that the TCR, a faction created not just for peacekeeping for ghouls, but also for a crusade against the true threat to humans and ghouls, the Dragon Orphans, remnants of the Dragon itself.  Not the one you would think it is, it's actually far more nightmarish to look at.\"  Peach said as Rosalina tries to learn to store her kagune, but hoped she could wait for Peach to teach her to do so.  \"My grandmother, also a ghoul came from that place when she was young, when the CCG still existed, remnants of which I assumed got here undercover.  She helped the toads deal with a problem and was crowned queen, her rule was fair and just, as well as kind.  She also left at night to hunt potential threats, and like to eat starbits.  Mario is a defect from the CCG, short for Commission of Counter Ghoul, who just wanted to protect me since the day we first met, long ago.  He didn't know at first, but... I had to let out my kagune to save him from Wart.  He had mixed feelings about being near me at first, but in the end he is still there for me.\" Peach explained.  She and Rosalina suddenly smells something approaching, meaning they have to go right now and save more questions for on the way home or with some friends of hers.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosalina felt something wrap around Peach's kagune and found that it came from her a blue rinkaku on her bottom right. She looked left and found a blue galaxy forming from right shoulder, and a smaller one peeking out her right, both of which is identified as her ukaku. \"Just like Peach's... except looking new born\" Rosalina murmured. \"You're a chimera too!? I am a breed born with two kagunes, my ukaku on my shoulder area, like yours, and my rinkaku on the waist area of my back, like yours.  You have become like me the second Dr. Mortimer implanted your kakukou in you.\" Peach explained, a little excited that Rosalina's kagune matched Peach's in RC type.  \"I am SO happy to teach you how to use your new kagune!\" Peach chirped filled with glee, not only having a friend to relate to, but one with the same rc type.  \"I dont get it! Our kagune is different!\" Rosalina retorted back at Peach, snapping her out of her happy thoughts and shook her head violently.  \"What? Oh, right... I don't know any ghoul with the same kagune with the same exact appearance as another, some do but that is not exactly common.  It's rare enough for a ghoul to be born with two RC types at once.  From what I know my Kagune has a unique form, having a peach theme. and so does yours, with the whole galaxy theme.\"  Peach said stretching out her kagune to emphasize her point, while Rosalina checked out her own, moving to her whims.  \"We marked many possible combinations a ghoul can have, there is a lot, for a rare sighting.\" Mario said.  \"Wait, you were with the CCG?!  One of their men helped Bowser kidnap me and hurt god knows how many lumas that tried to stop them.  Why would they want to create a ghoul, if they sought to snuff them out?\"  Rosalina asked.  \"I fell out of favor with them, that is all I want to talk about.  As for you, I have no idea.\" Mario said confused by why a CCG member aligned himself with Bowser in the first place.  Then he felt his hat move around, as the luma tried to enter, but remembered having one more question, \"Mama, you saw those things before.  What's a ghoul?\" the luma asked, Rosalina sighed in response.  \"Ghouls are powerful humans with amazing powers in many forms, ones they have to maintain by... eating people.  They eat people to survive, as they cannot eat most human food.  I don't want to eat people myself, but I was born like this... so I feed on starbits, coffee, water and people who... ended themselves.\"  Peach said trying to find ways to explain without scarring the poor child further than Rosalina did when she lost control and ate someone in front of it.  Needless to say it disturbed it and Rosalina that this is her life now.  \"She could still eat starbits?!\" the luma asked, sounding kind of excited that she is still not much of a threat, this relieved Peach of course.  \"That's right!  Our bodies decided that a bunch of edible crystals do not really count as human food since it came from space.\"  Peach said smiling that she brought up that she doesn't throw up when she eats starbits.  (This is my headcanon on ghouls being able to eat starbits, due to those starbits not technically being human food, but more so space food).  \"The magic that made them is warped by RC cells, what makes up our Kagune.\"  Peach said feeling much better about what the child would think of its mother.  The luma squirmed into Mario's hat as Rosalina faced Peach and asked  \"You were born like this?  Then your parents are ghouls, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach cringed a little at the question.  \"You are half-right, my father is human, my mother is a ghoul.  They gave birth to me, a One-Eyed Ghoul, a hybrid.  My mother always left him every night to find starbits on special days and people who committed suicide.  The CCG came and showed no respect for Father because his wife, my mother, is a ghoul.  When she got killed by them for no discernible reason, he distrusted the CCG as much as Mario does nowadays.  His rule is kind and made numerous laws that honored Mother's memory, giving a life to those who do not want to kill, resulting in a peaceful kingdom, one I intend to protect and rule should my father meets the same fate at the hands of the CCG for protecting a ghoul.  I was scared of the CCG since that day, until I learned to wield my Kagune proficiently with the help of a few friends I made, who remembered Mother being kind and fair.  Heck, I worked at their coffee shop before the raid.\"  Peach said glumly and cheered up as she remembered those who felt what it was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did Bowser say about this?\" Rosalina said clearly tense about the thought of Bowser finding out about Peach.  Would he abuse her?  Would he torture her into becoming evil?  Would he experiment on her?  Would he kill her?!  \"No, he always get the drop on me before I could defend myself with my kagune.  I can't imagine what he would do if he found out, even after the first time the koopalings came along with him...\" Peach said with growing sadness and regret.  \"You sound regretful... are you alright?\" Rosalina asked.  \"I... I don't want to talk about it!  Only thing is I was hungry...\" Peach responds with tears in her eyes.  Rosalina, feeling that she did something horrible to survive, decided to drop the subject.  \"All that matters is... there were nine, but now there' eight.  It's a miracle Bowser didn't find out what I am when he found her like this.\" Peach said wiping a tear away.  \"I see, I'll break off that subject.  So how do I make these things go back inside of me?\" Rosalina asked.  \"You can do that anytime with just a bit of thinking, I will help you with that when we get out of here.  At least we are better prepared to deal with Bowser should he find out.\" Peach said as she readies her kagune for whatever is coming next. 'What will the rest of my children think of me, now that I am like this?' Rosalina thought as she was left some distance to try out here Kagune, lashing her rinkaku into the cell and then slapped the air with her ukaku, and learned to solidify her ukaku and fire off crystals.  She caught up with the gang after she took a few seconds to revert her \"wings\" to normal.</span></div></div>",

You know ghouls need to eat flesh to survive.  You <i>should</i> know what happens when a ghoul is forced to eat other ghouls too much!\" Peach retorted rousing her kagune aggressively at Bowser.  \"At least, I don't eat children, like you would since you are a ghoul after all!  Now you shall live with eating your own kind!\"  Bowser said coldly with a malicious grin, this made Peach try to fight back the tears at the thought of what she did.  \"Wh-what is he talking about?\"  Rosalina asked.  \"I... I don't want to talk about it right now, Bowser is attacking.\" Peach responding her voice wavering a bit at the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you two die, I can see what makes you powerful, Alice was quite interested in ghouls, if I had known what she is, I would put you through so much more than what Alice had in store for you, ghoul.\"  Bowser snapped.  \"I said.  I don't. Want. TO TALK ABOUT IT.\" Peach sneered with increasing rage.  \"Maybe I can starve you out and make you try to satisfy it using you lovely red plumber, or maybe... *turns to Rosalina* one of your besties.\" Bowser snarled, his evil grin spewing a bit of fire.  \"SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP!\" Peach screeched and her body spasmed violently.  Rosalina and the luma felt uneasy about Peach's sudden outburst while Mario just watched in horror, knowing what happens when she is forcibly reminded of her actions she does not want to remember.  \"I WON'T KILL MARIO, I WON'T KILL ROSALINA, I WON'T KILL ANYONE ELSE, JUST YOU BOWSER!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"  Peach screeched then starts laughing insanely at the thought as her kagune melted into a dark substance that starts covering her body.  \"I AM SICK OF YOU AND YOUR LITTLE BRATS!  I WILL CUT DOWN EVERY REMAINING CHILD YOU HAVE!\"  The substance turns into a shell as it bursts through the back of her dress, then splatters itself on her dress as it solidifies into armor resembling Bowser's body, with more pink based green areas and beige body scales.  \"I WILL TEAR OUT THEIR THROATS AND SHOVE THEM SO FAR UP YOUR ASS, THAT THE NEXT TIME YOU TAKE A DUMP, YOU WILL HEAR THEIR SCREAMS!\" Peach continues berating Bowser as it spreads to her face forming a mask that left her mouth and ghoul eye uncovered.  \"Let me show you what I CAN REALLY DO! HAHAHAHAHA!\" Peach cackled insanely as she then proceeded to claw at bowser with her Kagune  attached to her arm hulking out into a monstrous form as if it were a koukaku.  Bowser blocked with his shell, but was pushed back.  \"Good day for a challenge!  Prepare to die, Peach!\" Bowser laughed as he jumped up and tried to land on Peach, but she wedged the claws into the tail area, causing Bowser to scream in a comical amount of pain as he runs around grabbing his rear end.  Peach stood there cackling at Bowser's pain as she took the moment to strike Bowser in the same area, sending him rolling on his back bouncing back and forth for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina watched what happened to Peach in shock.  She is really going at it.  A sharp pain in her head appeared as a hammer hit her, stunning her a bit rather than knock her out like it normally would.  She then faced the Hammer Bro group ready to attack.  \"HAMMER BROS ATTACK!\"  The taller one shouted as they started jumping around tossing hammers.  She tried to create a defense barrier, but it froze her wings into crystals, with shot more of them at the hammers, deflecting some back at the bros, knocking a few of them out.  She charged a scatter spell while her rinkaku flailed around, slapping the hammers her crystals missed away from her to buy her time.  She launched the spell, while Mario used a fire flower to assist her, knocking out the rest of the group.  This roused the other minions to attack.  Rosalina's kagune and Mario's fire flower made short work of the goons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! DIE!\" Peach laughed as she lands yet another blow on Bowser as he is flung back once more.  \"That does it!  No more Mr. Nice Koopa King!\" Bowser bellowed as he starts launching fireballs at Peach.  Her warped kagune unwrapped her arm and reformed into a tail-like rinkaku and struck the fireballs, exploding them without damaging Peach.  Bowser took the moment to land a punch on Peach, hurting his hand while only pushing her back a bit.  Bowser held his hand and shouting in pain, so Peach landed her own punch with a psychotic smile.  Bowser was sent flying into the wall and fell into the pit with a huge crash at the bottom.  Peach grinned maniacally as she turned to the duo.  \"Uh-oh...\" Mario said, remembering what happens when Peach gets like this.  \"Please... run away...\"  Peach forced through her faltering smile as she approaches the duo and tried to grab Mario.  \"PEACH STOP!\"  Rosalina shouts lashing her rinkaku to restrain Peach.  \"You are not a monster!  Please, we are your friends!\" Rosalina begged, Peach stopped struggling and stared at Rosalina.  \"You don't have-a to fight anymore.\" Mario said.  Peach suddenly calmed down with a saddened espression as her armor dissolves and her kagune appears back to normal.  \"I... I did it again... I lost it...\" Peach murmured, her tears welling in her eyes.  Rosalina just watched it happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I can't... I don't... what was that?!\"  Rosalina said, stuttering at first.  \"That was my kakuja... something you will gain from repeated cannibalization.\" Peach said glumly.  \"Powerful weapons that can be wielded with greater power before, at the cost of our sanity.\"  Rosalina's eyes widen at the thought, horrified by her words.  \"You go insane when using kakuja?\"  Rosalina asked.  \"Only a few retain their sanity, it is extremely hard to remain sane while using it.  I hope you are not in the same situation I was.\" Peach said walking away.  Rosalina and Mario follow her.</span></div></div>",

HAHAHAHA!\" Bowser laughed as he points the device and spun a hypnotic plate at Rosalina's face.  As a result, she felt her eyes change as she is slowly becoming spellbound.  \"N-No! I won't let this happen!\" Rosalina said and struggled to look away and move, with web flying out of her abdomen and into the wall, instead of Bowser instead since she could not move to aim.  \"Please stop... I... <i>want to lay eggs for Bowser...</i> NO I WON'T!\" Rosalina yelled groaning in discomfort as she struggles unsuccessfully, her speech is slurred a bit, as her eyes are now half-closed and turning red from the influence, then a smile appears.  \"Stop... please... <i>please let me serve you!  I want to lay eggs just for you!  Not for Mario! Not for his friends!  Not for his rivals!  Just for Bowser! Heeheeheeheehee!</i>\" Rosalina chirped with a motherly giggle at the end as suddenly she became so happy to see Bowser.  \"Good Girl!\" Bowser purred petting Rosalina, who lets out a loving sigh. 'Thankfully it is strong enough to affect her, just gotta remind my minions not to hit her in the head!'  Bowser thought.  \"Don't worry, I will take good care of them!  If this works, you can be one of my spider queens, Peach is the head wife though!\" Bowser chuckled ready to see what they can do against Mario.  \"<i>I am sure you will take great care of them!  I don't mind as I can be near you, my King!</i>\"  Rosalina chirped with love and happiness in her red eyes with swirling pupils.  Bowser just petted her again, laughing as he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina happily sat there, humming in her cell, staring into space with her eyes faintly glowing red and swirling pupils from the hypnosis.  One time she was occassionally laying eggs, other times feasting on the critters and traitors she webbed up.  One day as she continued to stare happily into space.  \"R-rosalia...?!\" a voice called her attention.  \"<i>You came for Bowser?  I feel a bout a half hour left before the next egg laying.  He is such a great care taker!</i>\" Rosalina chirped staring happily at the source.  \"What happened to you?  You're half spider!\" the voice called out. \"<i>I am happy!  Do you not know how pretty he said I look?  He is so great, he said I can come out and be one of his queens when Mario is gone!  Peach is the main wife though, we mother the children.  Until then, I lay eggs for HIM! Not for Mario, not for his friends and rivals, just for Bow-</i>\" Rosalina praised until the source lashed out with a harsh slap to the face.  Her face flung away from the attacker from the force, having hung her head low, a hand on her head.  Groaning from the strike she looked up at her egg sac ready for her to lay her eggs in, her eyes back to normal from the slap.  \"Uh?! Ugh... W-Wha...?  What happened?  What was I doing?  Is... is that my egg sac?  Where are my children?  Why am I asking where my children are?!  My children are lumas waiting for me back at the observatory, not whatever comes out of this egg sac.  Though not even they deserve it here!\"  Rosalina panicked, clearly broken out of her trance by the slap and freaking out.  \"Oh thank god, I thought that would rile you up or something!\" the voice said.  Rosalina jumped a bit and turned to find that she was slapped by a familiar figure, who said \"Are you alright, it didn't hurt did it?\" \"No, I'm fine.

She is quite startled and freaked out, though anyone can be freaked by another person born with a spider's body from the waist down.  Rosalina's eyes widening at the realization, she stumbled over due to never getting used to her new body.  \"Please, I don't want to get hypnotized again, I don't want to stay hypnotized!  It feels like he... he... spiders don't produce asexually, do they?!\"  Rosalina started.  \"Not unless you suck someone dry!

Here, I have a key!\" Peach whispered unlocking the cell.  \"Yes, please get me out of here!  Hang on...\" Rosalina said as she crept up onto the egg sac and purred as she lifted the sac on her back.  'ok...?' Peach thought as she started walking with the drider, putting her mask back on.  Rosalina is constantly swerving due to her not being used to having 8 thin, teal legs, but while keeping her egg sac from falling off, she learned enough to maintain her balance while not moving too fast to keep it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no guards down that hall.  So what happened to you?\" Peach said.  \"I don't know!  I was with my children when I blacked out suddenly.  When I woke up, my legs were replaced with this.\" Rosalina said gesturing her spider body, tapping it caused it to wiggle a bit and made Rosalina feel a bit happy, but then shook her head a little.  \"He said something about me giving him the eggs I laid for him while I was under his control.  I tried to tell him what he did to give me this spider body, but he dodged the question. and hypnotized me to praise Bowser and provide my eggs, if I only know how he turned me into this!\" Rosalina continued as she lies back on her egg sac while her spider body.  Bowser laughed \"You should hear how snap-filled and skin-creaking transformation after injecting that conversion venom I forced that spider queen before I burned her down?  Beautiful!  Shame she was unconscious when she transformed... GWAHAHA!  She is still sitting there grinning that stupid grin!\" Bowser said.  \"Quite sadistic sire.\" Kamek said blankly sipping his tea as the princesses snuck by the doors without getting detected, not noticing that they just converted another source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left the dungeon and quickly made for the entrance.  The duo slipped out the entrance when they caught by the guards and went for Bowser.  Peach removed her outfit and mounted Rosalina while helping her hold her egg sac (much to Peach's disgust).  Rosalina then started teaching herself to run with her body but occasionally stumble and are forced to hide from Bowser's forces and web up and cocoon the singular goons that find them before they could call out, sometimes sucking the minions dry and eating fruit to feed herself.

Rosalina's confusion was immediately replaced by fear when she remembered it was meant for her.  She stuggled a little more as the syringe closes in on her face as the user chuckles at the thought of a unique Koopa Breed \"You will feel a small pinprick... and the change will be intense!\"  Dr. Koopansheet exclaimed as he stabs her in one of her arms with it causing her to yelp in pain from the needle shoved in one of her veins to inject the infusion.  Rosalina is suddenly getting angry at the koopas for that reason, but the face blanks out with a twinge of a jerking pressure in her muscles. The pressure got more intense as her muscles began to grow.  She felt power building up, making her feel intense pleasure and pain from her expanding muscle mass and the tightening of her dress.  'Oh my... this feels so good... more... More!' Rosalina thought as she mentally reveled in her new strength  The koopas just watch with fascination and glee to see her grow strong so she could handle the next change.  By the time they stop, the back of her dress had a huge tear in her dress as her body now resembles that of a male body builder with breasts and curves that have also grown a few sizes to make her resemble more a woman.  She couldn't feel or flex as her skin was hit with a burning sensation, causing her to cry out in pain as her flesh transforms, all the while her muscle get bigger, as soon as the growth ends, beautiful blue scales spread through out her body and cover the upper half of her still-human face, mainly her eye area and forehead while retaining her ears as well.  As she continues to scream in pain as her transformation continues, flinging her now completely blue eyes, originally being greenish-blue  After another yell, burning flames, resembling a blue nebula, flew out of her mouth as the yell became more of a roar in pain overlapping her scream.   She continued panting as she grew an underbelly across her torso and her lower half of her face.  Now her face has completely changed in terms of texture, while her face remained human looking in shape, normal human nose and all.  'Why does this feel so good?!'  After one last shout in pain and pleasure from the transformation and growing strength, a spiny shell emerged and connected to the shell part of the underbelly and a tail formed resembling the other koopalings, as well as new koopa horns emerging from the top of her head, the alteration causing her hair to turn royal blue from the roots and going back to platinum blond as it reaches the tips.   Rosalina roared once more, fire flying from her mouth and slump down, exhausted from the transformation, tears streaming from her still-human looking face, and her face rose and growled at the two Koopas, who measured her to be a yard bigger than she once was.  \"HEHEHE ALRIGHT!\"  the koopas sound off in glee.  \"What did you do to me?!\" Rosalina shouted a flame to put emphasis on \"do\".  \"We would welcome you to the kingdom as our first breed of Huupan, the first and only (not for long) Human-Koopa hybrid, courtesy of Dr. Koopansheet!\"  Kamek proclaimed, prompting Rosalina to roar in his face. \"Why so angry? Are you now powerful and you became the most beautiful and unique breed of koopa.\"  Kamek claimed callously.  \"Kamek, I hear you were experimenting, is it ready...? Ahhh, I see it is a success!\" Bowser yelled in triumph.  \"Don't worry, I figured out you were behind this.\" Rosalina grumbled sarcastically, to which Bowser huffed an annoyed one.  \"Now we can move on with Peach.\"  Bowser cackled as Dr. Koopansheet left with the syringe saying \"In a flash, sir!  Just let me clean the needle first.\"  \"I doubt they would have a choice but to stay here. Gehehehehe, should Mario recognize them, he'd know he already lost!\" Bowser cackled. \"How does that make any difference.  I mutated for that?!\" Rosalina snapped in outrage.  \"Mario has no reason to trust a koopa!\" Bowser explained. \"Especially the ones who went go-karting, sporting and partying with Mario and traveled with him to help him fight evil... you're hilarious.\"  Rosalina huffed.  \"DON'T CRUSH MY DREAMS!\" Bowser barked in an unhappy tone. \"Anyway, remove the torn clothing, at least let her show that her she doesn't need clothes since her shell covers her shame for them.\" Bowser commanded.  \"YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!\" Rosalina shouted with a blush on her human looking face.  \"Right away sir!\" The two took Rosalina under more prepared measures due to her newfound strength...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rosalina had to follow the guards to her prison where she will be kept in case she get any funny ideas, same with Peach.  At least, she could understand why Bowser has a tendency to always slouch, so he can avoid bonking his head on random things hanging from the ceiling.  Another thing is that she has to look at how she \"evolved\" will hearing the haunting sounds of Peach undergoing the same transformation on the way there; the screaming, the crackling, the roaring, tearing of clothes, all that creepy stuff.  Rosalina is wondering what would Bowser want to do to them when they are all done.  At least, she has become more capable of defending myself, why is she feeling caged in these <i>STONE</i> walls.  Rosalina was visiting Peach and Mario sometime before she turned into this \"Huupan\" or whatever they are called.  Bowser just flew through the wall like it was made of cardboard and knocked her out before she could do anything, last time she saw Peach is one of those koopalings carrying me off while a few of their own held off Mario and Luigi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Mario Bros think of her now that Peach and Rosalina are now half-Koopa.  What would their friends and people think?  What would her children, the lumas, think?! Stealing power stars and grand stars isn't exactly how she would say best first impressions happen.  In fact, since they power their ship, that is pretty much stranding someone.  Maybe she can fix this?  'Hello, Mama's Home!  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Don't mind the shell, mean old Bowser turned me in a Human-koopa hybrid. Why?  Because apparently he thinks Mario hates koopas despite hanging with some.'  Ugh, this will be harder than it is supposed to be.  But then again, lumas are on good terms on the ones that do not work with Bowser, and plus if they see that my face and body still looks normal, albiet more muscular, the lumas would recognize me by my face alone.  There is still hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time, she reached her cell Peach is there and is trying to tuck her head in.  I guess she got the same body Rosalina does, except her body scales are pink, her eyes and hair are magenta.  Her hair appears to be the same Rosalina's is; Magenta from the roots, but is restored to blonde as it trails down.  \"Hey Peach, some visit.\" Rosalina broke the ice.  \"Don't look at me, I'm a monster.\"  Peach whimpered, which saddened Rosalina.  The main reason Mario tagged along is because the repeated savings allowed them time to hook up, and it has been going great since then.  Who know Mario is able to help keep the entire kingdom under control?!  I can only imagine what Mario would think of them now that they are half-koopa.  Knowing Mario, and how much of a hero and role model he is, he would flip out on Bowser and Dr. Koopansheet for what he did to Peach and try to keep the love going despite the fact that she is only half-human now.  A larger muscular Peach would be more for Mario to love and the experiment didn't exactly change her personality, she is still the kind princess she and Mario know.  Heaven knows Rosalina really likes her new muscular body when she gets past the fact that she is a koopa hybrid now.  \"Oh come on, Mario is a good person, he will still love you...\" Rosalina said still trying to comfort her.  \"How?! We at the Mushroom Kingdom have been having a tiff with the Koopa Kingdom since the kidnappings started, and by god is this the worst or what?!\" Peach snaps with tears in her eyes.  \"Face it Peach, our bodies and faces still look human, we don't look like Bowser!  Besides we are stronger aren't we?\" Rosalina responded. \"True, but what would the others think, do we have to leave and start a new life?  Am I gonna have to get used to traveling through space if I don't belong back home? We are genetic mutations!\" Peach said.  \"Maybe we should see the positives of out bodies!  We got muscle, we are bigger, we still look human!\" Rosalina exclaimed trying to make her feel better.  \"*sigh* Thanks Rose, that means a lot but this is... gonna have to take some time to get used to.\" Peach responds glumly.</span></div></div>",

Peach gently pushed Rosalina off and walks up to a mirror.  She gasps to find that her body is the exact same thing with the exception of a giant pink shell and koopa's skin.  Her face and torso is still human like.  Not to mention the muscles on her body, which she can't help but to smile at and flex.  As she flexes her muscles, Rosalina can't help but smile seeing Peach start to enjoy her body.  Despite being half-koopa, she has completely cheered up.  \"You are right! This is awesome, guess this means that if we choose to stay this way, we would have to get our outfits resized to fit our bodies, but when we get out of here, we can defend ourselves better against Bowser!  They have no idea  that they made it easier for us to escape!\" Peach exclaimed.  \"Now that you mention it, how do we get out of here?\" Rosalina asked with great curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach just looked at the walls and looked at her body to remind herself she is essentially a powerful half monster now.  Peach started breathing a little harder and caused a wall to crumble with one powerful punch.  Big enough for the koopa princesses to leave through with ease!  \"Pretty showy, even for you, but quite effective for one lone punch.\"  Rosalina inquired.  \"Hey, Bowser tore down my castle wall just by running into it!  He asked for this!\" Peach retorted gesturing the hole as she climbed through followed by Rosalina, but not before the cracks started forming just seconds after the Koopa hybrids left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thud is heard from the throne room, but Bowser waiting for the princesses to embrace their koopa halves and join his army, to defeat Mario and possibly earn Rosalina a koopa hybrid lover, as Peach in his mind is all his.  Then he heard a raucous crumbling coming from the prison area.  \"Wait, did I FORGET about the walls?  OH NO!\" Bowser shouted in a panic as he realized that two of the strongest Huupans are in a stone-walled prison cell.  He found that her now-best match had punched a hole in the wall that they must have escaped through, one that make most the floor in shambles.  \"SON OF A BI-\" Bowser roared, but was cut off by a piece of rubble that fell on him.  \"Ow.\"</span></div></div>",

They can't breathe much due to this.  The slime transforms and glows, and the princesses began to feel the effects of the change.  Peach and Daisy yell out in confusion and saw that they are melting into Rosalina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rosie... help us...\" Daisy cried as she and Peach lose their consciousness and become heads attached to two globs of slime covering Rosalina, who watched their friend drift lifelessly into place as their bodies melt into her.  Rosalina is then forced to absorb their friend and completely transform.  When the slime cleared, her friends' heads are now attached to Rosalina's torso, right besides her own; Peach resting on her left, with Daisy resting on the right side of her body.  She soon felt her shoulder frame extending to fit the heads on her body as it doubled in size and grew a bit of muscle.  Her dress appeared to look like scales a blue dress of Rosalina, yellow parts of her dress, and peaches finger-less gloves and broach of Peach.  Did she fuse with her friends?  \"G-girls...?!\"  Rosalina stutters inaudibly bouncing her shoulders to make them wake up.  Rosalina then cringed in pain and pleasure of all things as two pairs of arms burst out of her back and while green scales with pink tips grow in and covers her back, arms and legs.  The feet lengthen and grew claws from her toes and soles, making it so it resembles a dragon.  She saw this and stares at her hands, which also grew claws.  Rosalina at this point realized that this \"latex egg\" is doing more than fusing her with her friends.  It is making her half-dragon!  Rosalina the felt a painful, yet pleasurable pressure in her back starting building up and immediately subsided as dragon wings burst out of her back and a tail sprouted from farther down.  She heard a roar from inside the liquid as her fangs grow in.  The heads also reacts to the changes, as the roared with her as their fangs grew in as well.  While their ears are pointed, they also grow in green horns; Rosalina are curling going forward and droop down looking like icicles, Peach's are pointing up and swerving a bit like smoke and Daisy's are ram like, with \"cracks\" that resemble lightning.  Rosalina groans in pain as her and her friends brains are becoming rewired to teach her how to fly and use their dragon breath while giving her a strange urge to collect treasure.  When the changes stopped, she put her hands to her face to find that the changes left their faces alone.  The heads soon woke up, their eyes now having slits for pupils and looked at their new body, noticing that heads' respective arms; the center, Rosalina, head controls the main pair attached to the shoulders, The left, Peach, controlling the the middle pair, and the right, Daisy, controlling the bottom pair.  Rosalina could still feel her two legs, implying that she is in control, due to being the magical one.  Peach and Daisy on the other hand are panicking that they can't feel their legs, while Rosalina starts trying to break out of this egg, feeling the shell grow weaker with every hit now that her transformation is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices are none other than Bowser and Kamek who are now watching the egg hatch and revealed the Princesses hybridized and fused to create a giant dragon-human hybrid.  A flurry of elements make up their breath as they roared as soon as they break out of their egg.  She then bends down a little, panting from the change and the constant pleasure and pain it brought.  \"HAHAHA!  THIS IS THE EVOLUTION OF MAN TO BE EQUALS TO KOOPA!\"  Bowser shouts in triumph.  The hydra-hybrid glared at Bowser.  \"WHAT DID YOU DO TO US?!\"  The three heads shouted in unison.  \"I grow bored of capturing helpless old you and the plumber coming after me for that reason!  I am SICK of this and I want to know that human-dragon hybrids can be dominated by <i>koopa</i>-dragon hybrids!\" Bowser announced.  \"You have gone insane!\" Rosalina snapped slamming her new tail on the ground.  \"At least I know my dragons!  Do you have ANY idea what a dragon can do?  What an ARMY of dragons can do?!\" Bowser roared in confidence.  \"I know that we are now powerful enough to stop you before you can hurt our kingdoms!\" Peach yelled out, the other heads just nod in agreement with Peach, while Daisy grins ominously at Bowser.  \"Wait guys, maybe we should show him what dragons can do.\" Daisy said, earning shocked locks and realized what she meant and grin with her.  \"You know what? Maybe we SHOULD!\" Peach chirped back.  The hydra princess then pushed out Bowser with their dragon breath attacks, Peach's fire, Rosalina's ice and Daisy's lightning.  Bowser went flying from the dungeon and crashed into the goons which fell down the stairs as the hydra princess laughed at Bowser's shenanigans.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!  Wow, I never felt so powerful in my life!\" Daisy cried out after a laughing fit and flexes her arms to gesture.  \"What do we do now?  Should we make teach Bowser a lesson or warn the kingdom about what Bowser is up to?\"  Peach asked.  \"Hmm, a tough decision, especially since this body could need a bit of getting used to.\"  Rosalina stated feeling confused about who controls the arms, which after a few attempts, is starting to become second nature.  The three princesses now have literally all the time in the world to decide as they have fused together.  They have agreed to...</span></div></div>",

They try to break out, but every attempt, every hit makes it spread faster, until they are completely covered.  Muffled screams were then drowned out by the liquid that formed inside the eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosalina is terrified about what is happening, she might be drowning!  Rosalina suddenly felt pain in her body.  She can feel something snap and reform as her body doubles in size and her magic grew much more powerful due to her changes.  Wings and a tail sprouted of from back and grew large enough to support her weight.  Rosalina groaned in an odd bout of pleasure as her muscles swell a bit and beautiful blue scales emerge from he flesh to cover her arms, legs, and all of her back and sides.  The most done to her face was grow in fangs as she roared her first roar as her pupils have become slits.  She felt a strange pressure as horns emerge from the top of her head and curled forward.  Claws grew out from her fingers, her toes, and her soles, destroying her shoes.  She looked at her body and noticed spikes coming out of her elbow, knees and thighs, as well as her tail and ears that are now pointed.  Her dress torn up at the back and arms from the transformation, while feeling tighter on the body itself.  Feeling her scales chafe and tear a bit into her dress, she fully realizes what the egg did to her.  It made her part dragon.  This is confirmed by her moving wings and tail.  As her transformation draws to a close, her mind started getting affected, making her learn to fly and use her dragon breath and giving her an urge to collect treasure.  With her transformation complete she had to escape the egg and started hitting the shell.  With each time it didn't break, it grew weaker until it finally lets her out and get a fresh breath of air and roared to signify she had become part dragon.  The eggs had begun hatching as well and revealed the other two princesses transformed.  Peach and Daisy's bodies are like Rosalina's but the color scheme of the scales and wings are different; Peach's scales are pink and Daisy's are yellow tipped with orange.  The princesses look at at each other with shock and actually happy their faces did not change much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened to us?!\" Daisy shouted.  \"We are part dragon!\" Peach yelled out in shock, moving her tail and spreading her new wings.  \"Why would someone turn us into THIS?\" Rosalina asked gesturing her new wings while freaking out the princesses by accidentally throwing ice out of her mouth as she yells 'this'.  \"I don't know, but I feel strong enough to find Bowser and get some answers from him!\" Daisy growled with a smile, pounding her fist into her hand.  \"We are in the clear, boys!\" Kamek says as he appears.  \"Now we just need to trap our strongest minions!  And lord Bowser can have fun with you, Peach!\"  said a crazy looking koopa wearing a tag saying Dr. Koopansheet.  \"YOU DID THIS TO US?!\" Daisy snarled fire pouring out of her mouth, raising her tail resembling a spiked club on the tip.  \"Dragons are vicious, powerful beings, they may seem to act peaceful, but that is only when not provoked.  When forced to, they are a force to be reckoned with!  Bowser himself almost got cooked up\"  Kamek said with great pride as Dr. Koopansheet suddenly felt unsure by the girls smiling to hear this knowledge as they gave the koopas a chilling glare, one that made Dr. Koopansheet lose all of his color from the glare from Rosalina, the calm one of the group.  \"Uh... Kamek, Bowser wouldn't want them to know about this, would he?\" Dr. Koopansheet asked, Kamek passed an annoyed glare and looked back at the princesses smiling at Kamek with fangs showing menacingly at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowser asked me to bring the princesses when they hatched from their latex eggs, don't sound to hard...\" a hammer bro said marching towards the lab room.  \"Ok, here comes the hammer!\"  He said his phrase to build up his confidence.  One step forward, and Kamek and Dr. Koopansheet was sent flying through the door and sent crashes into the walls of a cell, Peach emerged from the lab and slammed the cell door shut with her tail, strong enough to jam the door shut.  The hammer bro just stared wide-eyed for a bit. \"Eeeeeh, maybe a quick snack first...\"  hammer bro said as he walked back a bit and ran off screaming.  The princesses came out laughing at the idiocy of the koopas and walking out.  \"What do we do now, though?\" Rosalina questions.  \"I wanna find Bowser.  If he planned this, then I wanna try this power out on that jerk!\" Daisy demanded.  \"We are not used to these bodies yet, calm down!\" Peach said.  Rosalina then chipped in, \"Maybe we can get used to these bodies if we...\"</span></div></div>",
