You start your 95' Jeep Wrangler and turn onto the main road towards your single bedroom apartment, being a computer programmer you got paid quite a lot, but it didn't make you a billionaire, but you weren't struggling to make ends meet. Even though you made a lot, you still preferred not having the 'up-to-date' technologies like the newest car or the best house money could buy, but having this money made it hard for you to have an actual relationship with anyone, because just about every girl you dated was only dating you for your bank account. You turn on some music to distract your mind from your latest relationship failure, she was nice at first, but she started cheating on you and tried multiple times to have acess to your account, so you dumped her cheating ass and shut her out of your life like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh whats this?\" you say to yourself as you see the traffic in front of you start to slow to road construction. \"Come on I just want to get home\" you say to yourself again, for over an hour you are stuck in the slow moving traffic. You look to your right and see a sign for a detour, but no one was taking the detour, as you neared the turn you saw why. The road for the detour was unpaved and most of the vehicles in the city, they couldn't handle the unpaved detour, but your Jeep could handle the rocky road just fine. So you turn onto the detour and follow it away from the road construction, after following the road for half an hour you start to notice trees and vegetation where houses and building should be, suddenly you notice you were no longer driving on the unpaved road. You stop and get out of the Jeep, \"what kind of joke is this?\" you ask, you look back the way you just came and there was no longer a road or any sign of civilization, \"what the hell is going on?\" you say. You look back in front of you and see what looks like a crude wooden fence and some type of sign staked into the ground, you get back in your vehicle and drive over to the fence, your original assumptions about the object being a sign were correct and painted on the sign was........</span></div></div>",

The only words you could translate was, Trespass, violators, Emperor, and land, not in that order. \"Whats that supposed to mean?\" you say to yourself, just then you hear a stick snap, drawing your attention away from the sign, \"hello!\" you yell out, but you saw and heard no one. You had the feeling of being watched so you climbed back into your Jeep, in the center compartment you kept a handgun, because you lived and worked in the city you were always afraid of being mugged or carjacked, considering how much money you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled out the gun and checked it to make sure it was loaded and ready to be used it the time came. Suddenly the sound of thunder cracked through the air, making you jump, \"heh maybe thats what I heard earlier\" you say, but you knew in your head that the snap or a branch and the thunder weren't connected. After a while it started to rain and it progressively got worse so you decide to lock up and sleep in your Jeep for the night, you remember you had some energy and granola bars in a box under the back seat so you climb in the back and get them, \"dinner is served\" you say out loud. You hop in the passenger seat and watch the rain fall on the windshield, soon you find yourself drifting off to sleep, you wake up and see it was dark out and the rain was still coming down hard. You find that you lost your Glock while you were asleep, you reach down at your feet and search around before finding it just under the seat, as you sit up you look over and see a set of glowing green eyes staring in at you, you fly out of your seat in fear, you take aim with the gun and pull the trigger, but nothing happened. You mentally kick yourself for forgetting to chamber a round, which you quickly correct, but when you brought the gun up again the eyes were gone. The first thought that went through your head was \"what was that thing?\" followed by \"what now?\"..........</span></div></div>",

You continue to follow the footprint in the mud until you come to what looks like a small cliff with a river, the rain was making the river become a raging torrent. You search around, but find no more prints, \"well I guess I better head back then\" you say, just then a bolt of lightning struck a tree nearby, startling you and causing you to take a plunge into the river bellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are sucked under by the currents brought on by the rain, you fight to the surface, but its a losing battle. As you float down river you pants become snagged on tree roots which keep you further pinned under, you can feel your oxygen start to run out, \"I guess this is it, gonna die without knowing what happened in the first place\" you think to yourself. Your vision starts to darken and you become light headed, soon you pass out under the water. You open your eyes and find yourself laying down on something and wrapped up in warm blankets in a dark room, the only source of light was some moon light that streamed through an open window. \"Where am I?' you   mumble, you get to your feet uneasily and thats when you find your clothing was gone, except for your underwear, \"what's going on?!\" you said to yourself. You feel around the dark room before locating a sliding door, you open the door and find yourself in a room with three candles burning, you feel the presence of someone else being in the room, \"hello?\" you say.

You bump into the blankets you were wrapped in and get caught up in them, by the time you freed yourself the wolf was now standing in the doorway making you scramble backwards quicker until you felt your back press against the cold, solid wall, looking around in the dark room you saw no way to go except the window and doorway where the wolf blocked your escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing someone who grew up as a nerd in school, you never really knew how to fight and defend yourself, plus no one is ready to go head to head with a wolf like this, looking at the wolf your fight or flight instinct is screaming at you to run, but with no where to go you curl up and start sobbing. Curled up on the hard floor you sob and wait for the wolf to attack, hearing it walk closer and closer...... to your complete surprise you feel the soft fabric on the blanket on your bare skin and the sound of a female voice hushing at you followed by singing in Japanese. Hearing this you stop sobbing and look over your shoulder to see the wolf kneeling next to you and running her paw over the blanket in an effort to calm you down, looking up you see the very same glowing eyes that were staring at you from the other side of your car door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down the wolf finished singing her melody and just looked at you, slowly a paw came up and touched your face, making you flinch a little, but then you realized she meant you no harm and was just examining you. Slowly you did the same and reached out, touching her soft and clean fur, amazed by what you saw and felt you didn't notice her other paw slowly petting your head. Slowly you yawn and despite the new discovery, you were still exhausted from your fight in the river and the scramble across the floor made you remember that, not caring about a human like wolf next to you, you snuggle in the blanket and start to nod off, seeing this the wolf resumed a sort of lullaby as you drifted off to sleep, letting you lean against you the wolf smiled and brushed your head one last time, interested in the strange creature that was now in her homestead.............</span></div></div>",

All around you were traditional Japanese artwork and furniture, laying next to you was your now dry and neatly folded clothing, cautiously you get dressed as you look around, seeing the wolf was missing, \"was last night even real?\" you thought to yourself. Slowly you got up and moved to the door, sliding it open slowly and peeking out, still not seeing her you slowly open the door all the way and walk out into the next room. the first thing you noticed was the small table in the middle of the room and what was on it, your missing gun, unloaded and partially disassembled, \"shit\" you say out loud, suddenly the wolf turned the corner holding a plate of food in her paws, pausing and blinking as she saw you were finally awake, giving you a bright smile as she waved to the table, setting the plate in the middle next to your gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat you stood in place, watching her with uncertainty before finally joining her on the other side of the table, as you sat she started going off in Japanese, pointing at the gun and the plate before pausing and looking at you, where you just gave her a confused stare. Slowly she pushed the plate towards you and gestured at it, on the plate was a variety of foods along with a set of utensils, slowly you picked up the chopstick and held them awkwardly as you tried and failed at grabbing a roll to eat. Patiently the wolf sat there watching you struggle, but saying nothing, finally you grab an omelette roll and try to bring it to you mouth but drop it half way making her giggle some which in turn made you red in the face. Seeing this she stopped and moved over towards you, slowly reaching for your hand and grabbing it, which you allowed her to, slowly she fixed the chopstick and helped you grab another roll and this time you successfully eat one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her do this a couple more times you soon got used to it and before you knew it you were eating on your own, after a light but deserved breakfast you turn and look at her, her semi-glowing eyes studying you as you too looked her over, even more surprised by what you saw in the daylight this time. After a seeming forever stare down, the wolf slowly reaches out to touch your face again, asking you a question that you didn't understand \"I-I don't speak Japanese, I can't understand you\" you tell her, making her flinch as she finally heard you speak for the first time. Slowly she touched your face and moved closer so her head was almost touching yours, making you a bit nervous, slowly she closed her eyes and went quiet, after roughly an hour she opened her eyes and.......</span></div></div>",

The fox looked at you and asked you a question, \"what'd she say?\" you ask Han, \"she asked if you were in charge?\" you nod to the fox, she sheaths her sword and bows to you.

You and Han follow the strange fox into the village, apparently word spread super fast because before you took four steps into the village every villager had stepped out of their homes and were walking toward you and Han. When they get about ten feet away they stop and stare at you, talking quietly amongst themselves, the fox walks over to a small group of males and females and they start to talk amongst themselves. \"What's going on?\" you whisper to Han, \"I think they're discussing what to do with us\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel something touch the back of your neck, you spin around and see a bright white, female wolf standing there. She covered her muzzle with her paws and let out a small giggle, she lowers her paws and says something that sounded like a question. \"Han what'd she say\" you say over your shoulder without talking your eyes off the wolf. Han lets out a nervous laugh, \"she um..wanted to know if she could touch you\" he says, you think this over, normally you would have thought this an odd question and would have said no, but nothing today was anywhere near normal. You remove your helmet and nod to the wolf, she smiles and softly touches your face with one of her paws, it was a strange feeling having her soft, furry, paw run across your cheek, but it was a nice feeling. You remove one of your gloves and hold it up, the wolf saw what you were doing hand held her paw next to your hand to compare sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer paw was slightly bigger than your hand, but not by much, unbeknownst to you some of the other villagers started to walk forward and cautiously reach out.

You turn back around and suddenly you feel something wet run across your face like a dog's tongue. You see the wolf standing there with a guilty smile on her face, \"I think she likes you\" whispers Han, just then the multi-tailed fox signals you for you to follow her. \"Get Aaron and Henry here, and fill them in\" you say as you make your way to the fox. She leads you to what you guess is her home, she opens the sliding door and invites you in, but before you enter she stops you and points to your boots. \"Sorry\" you say as you remove your boots and set them by the door, she nods understandingly and gestures to a small table with sitting cushions around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if you know what I'm saying, but I don't speak Japanese\" you say to the fox, she nods again as if she understood what you were saying. The fox pours you a cup of tea and hands it to you, which you accept, you take a small sip and burn your tongue,<i>\"careful its still very hot\"</i> you hear. You look at the fox, \"you can speak english?\" you say <i>\"yes I can\"</i> was the answers, but what shocked you the most was that the fox's lips never moved when she spoke. \"How...?\" was all you could say, <i>\"I have special abilities\"</i> was the response, \"but how are you talking without using your lips?\" you ask. <i>\"I know it might sound weird, but I'm talking through your mind\"</i> she says tapping her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Christopher\" you say, <i>mine is Kino\"</i> says the fox,the two of you talk for about an hour, discussing your situation. \"So Kino if you don't mind me asking, what were you talking about earlier?\" you ask <i>\"The people you say me talking to are the leaders of this village. We were talking about the possibility of you staying here with us\"</i> says Kino. \"Thank you for your hospitality\" you say,<i>\" lets get living spaces for you, but I have to warn you there's a small catch</i> says Kino.......</span></div></div>",

The sergeant got back up and continued running, taking a left then a right, \"this is so fucked up\" he grunted to himself, the OP was supposed to be a simple in and out, grab an insurgent informant and get out, but that was before the hidden AA battery swatted the Blackhawk from the sky before the mission began. Turning down another hall, Grimm could hear the sounds of enemies outside, searching for him and any survivors making him stop and press his back against the wall, he had been running ever since the helo went down, stopping to catch his breath and for the soldiers outside to disperse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Heart thumping in his chest and ears as the sergeant caught his breath, closing his eyes and wiping away the sweat, Grimm was suddenly hit with a wave a nausea, when he opened his eyes again the sergeant suddenly no longer found himself inside the dark hallways of an abandoned house, but now in the cool, dimly lit interior of what looked like a ship or cargo vessel. \"What the fuck..\" he whispered to himself, walking forward, gun drawn as he examined his surroundings, The sergeant stood next to about ten containers, they appeared to be used for storage of large quantities of items, they felt as cool as the temperature of the room he stood in, but almost as soon as he touched one it seemed to set off some sort of alarm, red lights and a klaxon sounded. Holding his rifle tight and scanning around the room, footsteps echoed everywhere as the inhabitants of this ship came running, looking for a quick exit, Grimm found that all the doors refused to open, and appeared to have no door handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Just above him on the catwalks a door opened and in ran three people, their features covered by the darkly lit room, but their postures showed they meant business, jumping for cover, Grimm readied himself for a fight. \"Come out pirate!\" a voice commanded from above, \"Surrender now and we'll let you live out your days in security lock up!\"</span></div></div>",

As he came out of hiding a light was shined into his face, an audible gasp was heard as well as whispers among the three, \"What the hell...?\" one whispered, the sound of a gun cocking made the sergeant stop, his pulse racing, \"were they going to shoot me?\" he thought to himself as he waited. \"Drop your weapon!\" a voice commanded from above, gently and slowly the sergeant set his rifle on the ground and pushed it away from himself, hands still high in the air, \"don't move!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon as the voice ordered the last command, two doors opened below and two more figures walked in, the red lights overhead stopped and the room was suddenly filled with a blinding white light, allowing Chris to see just who was in the room with him. As his eyes adjusted to the light he looked up at the catwalk and took a step back, standing there was a fox, wolf and some sort of lizard, but not the normal one that roamed Earth, no these ones stood on two legs like a human. The one in the middle held some sort of rifle, not clearly of human origin, their clothing was different as well, almost futuristic, a coverall or pilot like uniform, but with armor plates, glowing different colors in some areas along the legs and neck, behind each large tails stuck out, free of confinements of the suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Looking down in front of him stood another two bipedal animals, one a female fox with what looked like a set of horns and blue fur, her armor was slightly different than the rest, it was clean and bore some sort of rank on the shoulders. The second one on the ground was a large wolf with a mixed fur pattern of blue and black, in his hands he carried what looked like a set of hand cuffs or binders with him. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way um.. whatever you are\" the fox spoke.</span></div></div>",
