So what lead up to this adventure was trying to overcome fears, trying to retie relationships with friends after incidents at an old school, and trying to get the lives of the people who I protect back to normal after the kidnapping and the deaths of my friends. (Some of which were immediately revived.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Now since that point there was this Christmas party where I actually received a gift five gifts actually.

Since then with the help of my friends (the ones I revived) I revived the rest of my friends which you may hear more about in the continuation of this story. It has been two years since that incident almost three now and so we begin our story back at Grimwood's where I am about to see one of the girls I protect,care about,socialize,and work with.

For those of you who do not know my sister fell in <br>\r\n<br>\r\nlove with a brilliant doctor who was working on a serum to make one stronger and more cunning. The serum went wrong however he embraces that failure seeing as <br>\r\n<br>\r\neven though it did work it turned you into a monstrous form. That man was a young Dr.Jekyll shortly after marriage  they had a beautiful baby girl my sister was <br>\r\n<br>\r\nkilled shortly after that and I was never able to find the killer. by brother in law Hyde was killed for being different in what people thought were crimes against nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......Being her god father I took care of that child....Her name was Heidi and her name was Jackie you see both forms were given their own name because they <br>\r\n<br>\r\nacted differently and neither form knew of the other...she grew into a happy girl however everything came to an end when Heidi,Jackie died unexpectedly due to a <br>\r\n<br>\r\nsickness that I could only assume was cancer....I never was able to get over their deaths so now I need to go find who and what was to blame so  I can get closure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room fell silent after the story the young demigod told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"young Mr. Dementia please take the time you need you and Sibella are two of my smartest students not only will you to find the answers you are looking for but you will not have missed anything important to your education. Miss Grimwood said slightly tearing at the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I am sorry about everything you have gone through man I hope you can get some answers.\" Shaggy said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yea me too no one should go though such terrible things especially nice people like you Sartan\u00e1.\" Scooby added<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was now bald with a very thin frame he wore plaid pants just like his grandson except more worn out and he wore a button up shirt and a bat bow tie to finish his ensemble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Well look who came to visit his poor old grandad how are ya old buddy, you whipping those demons back to hell I see. What seems to be the trouble that would have you running here during school I might add. You know it may not seem like it but education is important.\" Sartan\u00e1 I spoke rosary quickly nudges him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie you are rambling again Sartan\u00e1 asked for our help with something and he is one of the smartest boys I know he is able to fluently speak German,English French and Spanish. and took 10 years of biology for a 170 year old boy he has done a lot with his life to keep his mind as sharp as his fangs dear. Rosary replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I know I'm just teasin him he knows that now I hear you are trying to put together a puzzle and I am guessing it is a figure of speech cause I don't see pieces laying around.\" Sartan\u00e1 I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yea... Grandad you know what anniversary is coming up right?\" Sartan\u00e1 asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartan\u00e1 pulled out a pipe and prepped it and whistled and an old grayish dragon slowly crawled in on it's collar the name ember was engraved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber puffed a small flame to light her master's pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy i know you miss them but there isn't anything I can do to make it better it's hard to lose people you love I know god I know but I don't have the ability to bring them back I'm sorry Sartan\u00e1.\" Sartan\u00e1 I spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Grandpa I know you can't do anything to bring them back the thing I have the problem with is the fact every time now when it comes close to the anniversary I start having these dreams where they are getting tormented like their souls were stolen and now they can't have peace and I think Heidi was killed poisoned which is why she got sick and died. I need to know who had done it and how to free them so  I can be at peace.\" Sartan\u00e1 argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Sartan\u00e1 stroked his beard and went upstairs and came back down with a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sartan\u00e1 I ma gonna give you the addresses to your ancestors past me you need to tell them your story because your puzzle even perplexes me if Heidi was killed for some evil plan if you save her there may be a chance to talk with the boss about a \"mulligan\" and give her another chance.

Sartan\u00e1 and Sibella got out of the car and headed inside to find a rather modern Sartan\u00e1 was not a fan of modern but he was too getting hungry and push past the look to just try to get food so he could keep moving. Sibella decided to get a large chocolate based coffee drink and a rare roast beef sandwich and fries to go Sartan\u00e1 had gotten the same however he decided to get his coffee black. the headed back to the car and ate as the drove through a few states making stops at pit stops to get a chance to use the restroom every couple hours and before the sun had set they made it to the ranch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartan\u00e1 made it to the front door and knocked waiting patiently seeing as he wanted to make a good impression on his great grandparents who he has never gotten to meet as of yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nafter a few moments an old man walks out and starts yelling <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who the Hell are you and why shouldn't I be shooting you yet to get off my goddamn property.</i>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Are you Eli Dementia by chance?</i> Sartan\u00e1 asked a tad nervous not wanting anyone to get hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who wants to know? I have told you guys for the last time I am not selling the Ranch. </i> The man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We aren't here to try to buy a ranch sir my name is Sartan\u00e1 the third you know the nightmare prince the heir to what was your throne once?</i> Sartan\u00e1 explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ah so your my good for nothing grandson's bastardized son then just great I'm guessing you now need help to get the kingdom back since you are too much aof a weak ass to get it yourself.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSibella immediately got pissed and moved Sartan\u00e1 out of the way so she could speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You know you have a lot of nerve talking to your great grandson the way you are I mean it's bad enough he has been partially blinded form his own dad and scared both physically and mentally for life from him but maybe I can see when his dad got that from Sartan\u00e1 was only here to get answers to get this thing called a mulligan in the terms for lost souls his God daughter died and since then every year he has weird dreams of her being tormented and you know what else Sartan\u00e1 very well may not ever have the same strength his grandpa or any of his ancestors had power wise I mean he still doesn't even have his wings but he has never given up even in the sight of danger no he fucking laughs it off and takes out anything in his path regardless of how possible anyone else things it is.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEli takes one look at him seeing the determination he had when he as his age Eli the starts crying seeing a new light for his heir line an equally as strong man who keeps getting back up after being pushed around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So you r here to have your great grandmother essentially take a look into your mind to see if she can make sense of these dreams her being a one of the last shaman around has some benefits from learning however I need you to complete three tasks for me before I can help you. Number one I want to see how good you can shoot. Number two I need help getting rid of these bastards who keep coming onto my land who want to buy it for corporate bullshit I want no part of. and lastly I have a demonic Coyote problem that needs taken care of pronto or else my cattle will get corrupted. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartan\u00e1 took one look at him stood back and thought for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Consider all 3 problems taken care of by tomorrow I will take care of the Coyotes tonight if you can give me some insight as to why it is my ancestors who are also of royal decent and living in places like a ranches and such.</i> Sartan\u00e1 replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Simple once we were done with the throne line we were supposed to follow suit as the rest of the ancestors living in mansions on the land near the Castle your dad now owns however as you and I both know that stupid prick has destroyed over three quarters of the nightmare realm making it impossible to live there anymore so we made identities to live here your grandmother was a revered skin walker shaman in the area so we set up base here when she met me she made it wo where she doesn't take from other than her human and bat monster form when she met me as a young vampire I should let you know. and well we have made a good life here except for the increase in demons and corporate bastards</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSartan\u00e1 nods and gets ready to begin the three tasks so he can be closer to finding answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
