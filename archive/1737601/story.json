She was always cooking and tasting what she made. And when Sakura started gaining weight as well, her mother encouraged her, but always made sure that her body was as healthy as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura beamed as she saw the huge breakfast laid out on the table and soon enough both obese women sat down on creaking chairs, plowing through their meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Sakura's father joined them, but he was so skinny and his portions so small that it didn't really matter as far as the feast was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating her meal, letting fly a hearty belch, and waving goodbye to her loving parents, Sakura headed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty feet from her house she met her best friend Ino who was....</span></div></div>",

Her face visibly flush with alcohol as she let out a small hiccup her cheeks jiggling slightly. \"Hello my student\" Tsunade spoke her words almost slurring together good afternoon Lady Tsunade Sakura replied her words were echoed by both Hinata and Ino. \"Waitress\" Tsunade called still mildly intoxicated \"Yes mam\" a 350lb woman in a cow print bikini asked as she waddled up next to the hot spring. The woman herself was very beautiful her added weight just increased her beauty she had cute light pink hair that looked to be tied up in small pig tails. She had a very well rounded body shape both Hinata and Sakura both thought to themselves both kunoichi loved Naruto and Sasuke to much respectively. Ino on the other hand Oh My Kami she thought as she checked out the woman before her, the woman before her had cute chubby feet large pillowy thighs and from her point of view a fairly large amount of junk in the trunk. But her gut and breasts were the true stars of the show her gut was fairly meaty and had two rolls of fat on it as it slid slightly over the top of her bikini bottom but her breasts were at least high DD cup and looked super perky. As Ino checked out this beautiful cow the cow herself pulled out a water proof note pad with a pen in the rings out of her slightly massive mammaries and spoke with a slight drawl in her voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \" Hello new customers as you heard lady Tsunade say I'm one of the waitress at this here establishment my name is Whitney by the way .\" Now what would you like to order? Sakura spoke what are your specials today? Well today's special is the Hippo steak please note it's not made with actual hippo meat Whitney stated I'll have that Sakura replied. What about for me miss Whitney, Hinata asked for you I would recommend the foxtail special with a side of our bunny rolls for desert. What about me what would you recommend for me Ino asked for you I'd recommend the sow platter and a date with me after work little miss check me out Whitney stated. Ino blushed with slight embarrassment at being caught. Miss Tsunade I'm assuming you would like the vanilla cow for desert along with some more Ushi Sake yes that would be great Tsunade replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes later <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four women see Whitney come back carrying all of their food before stopping tapping the ground twice with her foot causing her leg to jiggle slightly before a table appeared before Sakura, Hinata, Ino and Tsunade along with one extra. Whitney sighed as she passed out the food that each of the girls ordered the Hippo steak went to Sakura, Hinata got the Fox tail and bunny rolls Ino got the Sow platter which was piled high with pork based dishes and Tsunade got a large vanilla sundae coated with toppings and a large barrel of Ushi sake. Whitney let out a light groan as she sat down in the hot spring next to Ino well I'm on break for the next hour so I thought I'd get that date of ours started early as she siddled up next to Ino with a small pile of beef based dishes or her plate. Well what you girls waiting for an invitation Tsunade slightly yelled let's eat as she grabbed her barrel of sake and began to start drinking through a hollow bamboo tube in the top.the other girls Whitney included dug in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n45 minutes later <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura let out a moan as she rubbed her now stuffed to the brim gut it was packed tighter than a drum she thought. She had to of gone to at least past 350lbs if not more. She looked over at Hinata she saw that was in a similar state the once 350lbs heiress now looked to up 380lbs if not more than that. Ino and Whitney looked so full they had to waddle at a slow pace unless they wanted to be sick both but at least they could fairly well atbut400 lbs each.But Tsunade herself now looked to be about 955lbs and was almost to full to move or use her famous strength technique.

Last week we set aside a weekend for just us girl to have some fattening fun!\" Ino said with a annoyed tone. \"Oh right, then let's go and get some food!\" The trio of girls left for the new store. A minute later the girls had arrived at the store where they saw Tenten who was leaving the store with many bags on her arm and a satisfied look on her face along with some sort of chocolate but even withe her cloths stained she still looked amazing. Her hair was done up in its normal fashion, her cheeks were swollen with fat, her chin had five friends underneath it, her hoobs were massive and were stretching her shirt to its max and were threatening to tear it in half and nuzzled in between her breast was a large jug of milkshake and were resting ontop of her mass gut, her stomach was huge and had four rolls of fat and poked out from under her shirt and it was all saported by her massive ass and thighs, each cheek was a foot wide and stuck half a foot behind her and her thighs were just as wide all and all she looked like she weighed six hundred pounds a full three hundred pounds more then last time they saw her. \"Tenten is that you you look so much\u2026bigger?!\" Asked Sakura. \"Yeah I realy put on weight ever since I started to eat at the restaurant connected to this store for all my meals\" Tenten said while patting her stomach. \"You've been eating here six times a day!?\" Ino half shouted. \"Ah-Hu and I've been buying all my food for home at this store.\" Tenten said still smiling. \"Well we we're going to go inside you can come with us if you want.\" Said Hinata. \"Well I was going to go home get some rest but......  </span></div></div>",

It was her who suggested that Sakura join the Ninja Academy when they were kids, the only difference between them at the time being dedication and follow-through. Sakura found it far too difficult to continue and eventually pulled herself out of the academy when she was still young where Ino went on to graduate and eventually become a chunin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a little unsettling for Sakura to be around Ino sometimes, being that they <i>were</i> so different and led such different lives. She got to be close to hotties like Sasuke before he mysteriously disappeared, and that new guy she'd seen around the village; Sai. Whereas she led a simple existance about town, stepping out only to go shopping with her friends or pick up some groceries. But other than that, they were really close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Billboard Brow!\" Ino teased as she sauntered up to the pinkheaded porker, long blonde ponytail flapping in the breeze, \"Long time no see, Hokage says I'm free today, wanna grab lunch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut whereas Ino had emerged with grace and dignity, if not a little loudly, Sakura's lifestyle had prevented her from doing so. While she was a pretty girl, refined and intelligent, Sakura's girth kept her from doing a lot of things. Like walking long distances and jogging. From the mere twenty feet from her house to here, Sakura's expanse had grown a little tired of the hot Konoha sun. Underneath her pillowy upperarms, she had started to sweat a little, and her round cheeks had appled with exertion. Her breasts bobbed up and down as she struggled to catch her breath to voice a breathy, \"You're buying Ino-pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Ino stopped walking to allow her horizontally generous friend time to catch up with her, turning around and leading the tubby girl to some sustenance. \"Geez Sakura, sweaty much?\" she asked, noticing how much persperation was dripping from underneath her pink hair. \"Oh yeah, my bad, it's hot today!\" she lifted one meaty arm to wipe the sweat from her brow and let it fall back down uselessly to her side, sending a tidal wave through her adiposity. \"Uh-huh, I'm sure that's it.\" Ino said as she eyed Sakura's gut, bulging from underneath her red top, \"Don't you need muscles to wear a muscle shirt?\" she teased, pinching some of the jiggly flab that caked itself around Sakura's upperarm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Ino!\" Sakura turned bright red as she pulled her fat away from her pinchy friend, \"Quit pinching me!\" the blond giggled, \"Oh whatever, Sakura, where're we eating?\" the pinkheaded girl looked around until she spied her favorite spot, \"The BBQ restraunt, again?\" Ino sighed, \"Geez, it's like I'm eating with Choji.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's that supposed to mean?\" Sakura huffed, puffing out her breasts and placing her hands on her generously padded hips, \"Tenten eats here all the time too!\" Ino snorted, \"Sh'yeah, and have you <i>seen</i> the size of that girl?\" Sakura looked down, \"Good point... okay, is there some kind of salad place around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond shinobi giggled, \"Of course the only restraunt you don't know is one that serves salads!\" Ino teased her again by slapping her across the pale upperarm, making it jiggle wildly, \"It's cool with me, I don't mind eating barbecue again- but just this once, next time I get to pick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yum!\" Sakura's belly rumbled loudly as she headed towards the restraunt, forgetting the heavy late breakfast she had already consumed with her family. \"Hey, wait up!\" Ino grumbled, chasing after her hunger-crazed friend, \"Geez, <i>now</i> you decide to pump those leg muscles?!\"</span></div></div>",

Ten Ten's gut, while not as huge as her butt, was a monster all the same. Constantly hungry, Ten Ten considered taking an hour away from eating a huge repast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Sakura, she too had had ambitions to join the Ninja Academy but instead had discovered how good it was to stuff her face.

All that money, even split three ways which was quite a paycut, was surely enough to fund all her dreams of posh dresses and nice things... if only for a little while. But above everything else that was so totally awesome with this plan: she wouldn't have to give up her girlsish figure! She could just watch these fat girls eat themselves silly and a considerable amount of the rewards for herself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so how are we going to go about doing this anyway?\" Tenten asked the brains of the operation, \"I mean, do we train or what. because I'm not really too good with training... or running.\" Ino grimaced, \"I-I don't know, I guess you two just stuff your faces until the contest, like that's not all either of you do anyway.\" she said haughtily, raising her nose at the bun-haired fatty, \"Just practice eating a lot more and you should be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that'll work.\" Tenten didn't look too convinced, scratching her head with one of those chubby fingers of hers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, out of all three of them, Sakura seemed to be the only one having doubts.

She didn't quite like the idea of the whole village (or at least attending party, which may as well have been the whole village in her eyes) eyeballing her while she stuffed herself. She looked down at her ginormous body, what she could see of her belly bunching up into rolling collections of fat underneath her simple casual tank top. Her spare tire was clearly distinctive, she could feel it as she self-consciously ran her hands down her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't think we should do this!\" Sakura exclaimed worriedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Tenten asked in a concerned tone, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" Ino barked flatly, not at all pleased at the thought of her dreams being crushed by Sakura's dumb excuses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Sakura wove up a simple fabrication, one that didn't make her sound like a big baby. \"I mean, you said Shizune-sama and Kurenai-san were going to be competing right?\" the pink headed porker gesticulated towards the barbecue hut behind them, \"And they're big, way bigger than me- maybe even bigger than Tenten\" here Tenten turned bright red \"And I don't think there's any way we can compete with those two alone, forget about the rest of the competition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno narrowed her eyes, \"You just don't wanna look like a fatass in front of the whole village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not it at all!\" however, Inner Sakura had to comment on Ino's shrewdness, \"I just don't think we can win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno sauntered over and leaned on one of Sakura's well padded shoulders, \"Oh relax Billboard Butt, from what I gathered from the twin wonders of blubber back there, we've got a whole month to prepare!\" she slapped Sakura's proclaimed \"billboard butt\" for emphasis, \"And Tenten's just as big as they are, it doesn't matter who wins, we'll all split it the same way right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could only nod, her fears not completely put to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not THAT fat!\" Tenten grumbled, \"And if you want to win so badly, why aren't <i>you</i> competing?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno gulped, having been caught in the metaphorical headlights, \"I-I'm your manager! Yeah, that's it!\" she lied, \"And besides, I'm a <i>ninja</i> unlike you two fatsos, I'd never have enough time to bulk up enough... well, ever, let alone between missions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten narrowed her eyes, \"Yeah, whatever, come on, I'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her two friends receded back into the barbecue hut, Sakura was left to herself. Left to contemplate on what she had just agreed to do. Her hands traveled to her soft, squishy gut that hung from her waistline. She squeezed it remorsefully, \"Oh man... this is so not good.\" was all she could muster. She was going to make a total pig out of herself. And for what, money?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...actually, not that bad of a trade-off, considering her already substantial head start.

Shizune and I will be joining you to make sure Ino's getting the right kind of food, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fat young women nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And so it was decided that Sakura and Tenten were to be roped into yet another one of Ino's crazy schemes. This time, however, things would be different. No matter what the three girls tried to do together in the past, it all just seemed to blow up in their faces. But this time, the cards were in <i>her</i> favor. The competition was in her court, and there was nary a chance that she could lose (except maybe to Tenten, but either way, she still gets paid.) But on the flip side of that, there was <i>no way</i> she could lose thanks to becoming such a fatty; instead of becoming a ninja like Ino. It was embarrassing. But thankfully for Ino and her get-rich-quick scheme, whenever Sakura was upset, she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another serving dear?\" her mother asked politely from the head of the table, not waiting for an answer before plopping down another industrial-sized serving of chicken and drenching it with barbecue sauce, \"You sure do seem to have a healthy appetite tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was nonresponsive, she simply continued her feasting without even acknowledging that something new had been put in front of her to gnaw on. Full of chicken, rice, and sauce, her chubby cheeks bulged outwards at their capacity. She swallowed, the swelling went down, and she repeated the process. Her green eyes had glazed, the natural habits acquired over nearly an entire lifetime of hedonism and sloth taking over. Her heavy upper half leaned in over the table in an effort to get the food to her mouth faster. However, her soft body's leaning was cut short by her boobs cutting into the table, meaning that she would have to hunch over her plate and guard it from her parents with a barricade made of her soft forearms. She took deep breaths inbetween big bites, looking very much like a savage animal in her food lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her, the pale dome of her belly had filled as well. The contents of her devoured plates still sat heavily between her legs, pushing out her padded stomach further than ever. It bulged our from her muscle shirt, the lowermost roll clearly exposed should one drop a fork underneath the table. It rested on her doughy lap for as long as it could, but the last two plates pushed it's swollen taut form past her knees; making it dreadfully uncomfortable to support with her legs, so she subconsciously spread her legs far enough to alleviate some discomfort. However uncomfortable she may be, she may just as well have been twice as \"hungry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father chuckled, \"Now now, slow down honey, save some for your mother and me!\" he said in a teasing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use, Sakura was long gone. Only Inner Sakura and her dissatisfaction at being so fat remained; oddly enough fueling her to eat more and more until the hurt went away. She grunted dumbly as she tried to stuff more and more food down her throat, like an animal unknown to it's own limitations, until finally there was simply no more food left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...\" Sakura moaned, leaning back in her chair as she digest. Her soft, creamy backfat enveloped the back of her seat, and her blubbery rear spilled from the sides as her overall bulk bent the legs. She dare not touch her stomach, it was far too taut and sore for anything that required touching. She would just sit here all night until this pain went away. \"I am... hic... never eating again...\" she said aloud, completely oblivious to the watching audience of her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother turned to her father, and back to her daughter with a concerned look on her cherubic face, \"Honey, is there something the matter?\" she began sympathetically- until she was caught off guard by the loud splintering of wood. Sakura's body was sent tumbling to the floor, landing on her padded rear and letting out a weak moan of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she mustered weakly, \"I'm... fine... ouch...\"</span></div></div>",

It would be a whole agonizing two minutes before the bread was done and Tenten could drench it in some sweet butter, enhancing the taste of the baked goods....Oh that taste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Sakura, Tenten found sheer joy in food. She loved eatingit, and making it, but tasting it was on a whole other level. She loved the textures of ramen as it slithered across her tongue, the sweetness of dumplings, the burst of flavor every bubble of fat on a piece of pork gave her. She was going to take her time on this meal all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the timer went off and her bread was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEagerly, Tenten struggled out of her chair and on to her mountainous thighs, waddling to the oven and retrieving her last part of her feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it was done being buttered she sat down, uttered a hasty prayer, and took bite after bite of the bread, taking in it's warm, fluffy goodness before slurping down the savory ramen noisily, entering euphoria. She grew more and more delighted as each meal went into her maw and put her taste buds into ecstasy before being gobbled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore fifteen minutes were up, the brunette had consumed everything and was completely satisfied, rubbing her round expanse of flesh called a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...That was great~\u266a!\"  She said quietly to herself as she closed her eyes and enjoyed the lingering aftertastes on her tongue.</span></div></div>",

With painstaking caution, piece by piece she popped the dumplings into  her tentative mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She won't make it,\" Shikamaru chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...\" Her pale stomach had begun burbling. Ino had made a mistake; she knew it. She had overestimated her body's limits, had pushed herself too far. And was going to pay the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to him, you're doing great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that she got those  dumplings from your house, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my...?\" The bulky young man abruptly straightened up, his jaw going slack. His best friend said nothing, though did grant himself a rare grin as he allowed that information to process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, that's way too much!\" Choji exclaimed finally, \"Stop before you hurt yourself! \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam InoShikaCho sat together in Ino's family's dining room. The night before, Ino had talked to her longtime allies about her latest get-rich-quick scheme. As she waited for admiration towards her cunning, however, both Choji and Shikamaru quickly realized the rather glaring flaw in her \"foolproof\" plan; she was sending two amateurs, undeniable gluttons, no doubt, but still amateurs into a competition of seasoned eaters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Choji stated, Tsunade had been glutting herself beyond reasonable limits for years and, as Shikamaru stated, the massive med-ninja had been to the point of bursting more times than Kiba had woken up in dog urine. If Ino was to win, had to increase her chances of winning <i>somehow</i>. Unfortunately, both for Ino's now taut belly and Shikamaru's budding headache, Ino's solution for the amateurs vs veterans dilemma was to add another amateur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why her teammates were sitting with her, watching her strain with dozens of sweet confections that she had previously denied herself of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" she finally groaned, laying a hand on her belly. She'd been at it all morning. The blonde kunoichi was so full, she was out of breath, \"That's.... it! I'm done. Shikamaru, how many... urp... was that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two sticks,\" Shikamaru deadpanned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An anorexic butterfly could've done better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno gritted her teeth. A lifetime of dieting had severely limited the amount her stomach could handle. She thought she was doing good, but in reality, most people ate more for dessert every night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" she exclaimed as she shot to her feet, her rage overcoming her full belly, \"How in hell am I going to win if I can barely stomach <i>two freaking sticks of dumplings</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you wanna get fat anyway?\" Choji asked curiously. Already knowing the what her reaction would be, Shikamaru leisurely leaned back in his seat, closing his eyes to wait for the storm to blow over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't 'wanna get fat',\" Ino snapped. Perhaps it was a little harsh, but she did not enjoy being questioned, especially when she was in such gastronomic turmoil, \"Why would I want to be fat? So I could be like Sakura? Like that pig Tenten? <i>Is that what you're saying</i>??\" She advanced on Choji and, even though he stood over her by almost half a foot, he cowered in her wake, \"What I want is the obscene amounts of cash they'd pay me for doing so! With that much money, I could <i>pay</i> to be thin if I wanted! If that isn't worth it, I don't know what is. But, <i>unfortunately</i>, I'm - not - a - gluttonous - pig!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you <i>are</i> is a ninja and one of the few thin girls in Konoha,\" Shikamaru pointed out. With an apathetic eye, he gazed at her pale stomach, a low gurgle emitting from her washboard abs filling the room, \"Why bother with all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's face burned red and she began to puff herself up, getting ready to unleash a full tirade upon the lazy shinobi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I meant was,\" Shikamaru hastily added, \"Why not just get Sakura and Tenten to eat more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" she mused and Shikamaru sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She is such a bothersome woman. Maybe I should just keep my mouth shut until she's done scheming.\"</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Choji,\" Ino finally called. Her rotund teammate's head popped up from his hiding spot under the table, \"I don't have the time to work on them both. Which one would you suggest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot eager to piss her off again, Choji sincerely contemplated the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her eyes shoot open at the sound of the alarm by her bed, prompting an upset moan from the sleepy mound of flesh that was Sakura Haruno. The incessant mechanical buzzing of her bedside antagonist had roused the sleeping giant from a night deprived of sleep and much angst. Slowly she unblanketed her expanse and threw the covers off of her, remarking how much harder it seemed to make the initial first swing across her own girth. Her clumsiness only enhanced by the girth surely acquired by last night's big pre-celebration binge, she fumbled around uselessly for the stop button on her alarm. With a thick pointer finger, Sakura suffocated the button underneath her thick finger flab until she felt a click and reeled in her doughy appendage. After safely returning her arm to her side, Sakura's sleepy eyes traveled downwards to the flower-patterned mountain that rose from her bed, a mountain that had grown distinctly larger since training for this contest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge and squishy, her prideful gut stood tall even when Sakura lay down. Even now, after a long night of digestion and churning, it gurgled and ached for more and more sustenance to feed its gluttonous demands- having been spoiled quite a bit this past month and developing quite a bad attitude when deprived. Sakura's hands traveled upwards to touch her stomach, applying pressure on its soft exterior to feel just how deep her hands sunk into the quivering midsection. She winced, the demanding gurgles from her stomach combined with even the lightest touch did little but upset her. It rested atop her thighs, even now in a reclined position, which had grown equally thick and overheated as their inconsiderate neighbor crossed their property line. They touched constantly, the friction caused by their constant domestic squabbles and the effort of lugging all of the equally expansive junk in Sakura's trunk leading to some very uncomfortable chafing every time Sakura so much as made an effort to keep up with her lighter, more mobile friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts lay flopped to either side of her, not sagging so much as renovated for better release of air. When standing and in a bra that actually fit, Sakura's turkey neck not only touched, but rubbed against her ample cleavage now; so while she slept, bra-less, her breasts simply moved to allow more adequate breathing. It wasn't comfortable, especially when factoring in the fact that her bulging upper-arms also required substantial amount of space on her bed, but it seemed to get the job done. Or at least it had for the past few weeks. There was another violent rumbling coming from the primadona paunch Sakura sported, growing angry that she had not been fed yet. With a sleepy sigh she began the tedious and overwhelming process of lifting herself from bed. After which, she stood red faced and out of breath in rather illfitting pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, they weren't ill fitting more than a month ago. Tight, granted, but she could at least force the bottom to her lowermost roll. At this point, an even month later, the poor flowery pj's could barely wrap around her spare tire! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at herself in the mirror, distraught at the sight of an even <i>fatter</i> Sakura Haruno staring back at her. \"Oh man, this isn't good!\" she said as she grabbed two handfuls of her gut and shook it violently. Every inch of her bounced and did the vertical can-can with her stomach, right up to even her facial flab. Turning sideways, she struggled to catch a glimpse of her violently expanded derriere. Even that proved to be a challenge as with the ever growing lack of neck present and at her disposal, Sakura was losing more and more mobility as she became rounder and rounder. \"I am gonna <i>kill</i> Ino for this!\" Sakura said with her usual fiery attitude as she waddled over to her closet in hopes of finding something -anything, really- that would fit her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe settled on something simple, a red top with her clan's white oval on the tummy (however it looked more like an oval at this point) and some shorts that she had borrowed from Tenten. Sure she looked like a total whale in these clothes as her fat tried desperately to escape, but there really wasn't much of an option for her at this point...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock on her bedroom door. \"Who is it?\" she bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Ino!\" a muffled, though familiar, voice resounded, \"You up yet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat, just the person she didn't want to see. \"Yeah, come on in, I'm just getting dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened with a slight creaking sound before shutting, light footsteps trailing into the room as Ino made herself at home. \"Don't bother, I already got your uniform for you.\" the blond said confidently as she threw a heavy set of folded garments Sakura's way. \"Hey!\" Sakura said in slight annoyance, \"I'm already dressed, Ino-Pig!\" Ino put her hands on her hips, pivoting out her hip defiantly, \"I just figured you wouldn't want to get all that food on your clothes since you'll have to give them back to Tenten once I whip you back into shape after this contest.\" she said flatly, \"Well, whatever shape you had before.\" The pinkheaded porker rolled her vibrant green eyes and resigned to changing, \"Okay, fine, I'll change.\" she said in a resigned tone, \"So you're serious about helping me diet and exercise, right?\" she said as she struggled to pull off her top, \"You're not just saying that so I'll keep going along with your stupid plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, sure.\" Ino said unconvincingly as she sat down on Sakura's bed, quietly noting how little give there was left in her mattress. But of course, Ino didn't really have the time or motivation to train a lazy cow like Sakura. Childhood friends or not, Ino just knew that some people were born to be fat. Sure, in some parallel universe she was probably an awesome ninja who went on missions and got to be on a team and, knowing how smart she was, was probably the best in her class. But no, this Sakura was just lazy. No skin off of Ino's nose, she was still a great friend... so long as boys weren't involved or she wasn't calling her that dreaded \"pig\" name of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Tenten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to train her too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl's a lost cause.\" Ino said enthusiastically, \"Now come on, we've got to get to Hokage's Palace before she eats the whole arena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura emerged from her closet dressed even more plainly than she was when she entered. In a white t-shirt donning the village's symbol in black, her dangerous curves were accentuated. Even going so far as to stretch the Hidden Leaf Symbol across her tummy wasn't enough to disguise the fact that she looked like a giant white blob. And her red sweats, also embroidered with white hemming and an epically proportioned village symbol on the buttocks, did little to conceal her cankles, nor her thighs or chubby calves. Her ass looked huge, which it was, and even as uncomfortable as they were- Sakura <i>still</i> jiggled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, do I really have to-\" Sakura was cut off abruptly when Ino grabbed her chubby wrist and yanked her out the door, superior ninja training reigning superior over the lazy ways of pretty much Sakura's entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I haven't even eaten breakfast yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time, more room for you to fill!\"</span></div></div>",

Every year had a kind of theme and the theme this year was a picnic, hence the outdoors area. There was a massive plaid blanket on the ground and several industrial strength reinforced chairs on one long table that stetched from one wall to the next. There would be roughly twenty participants and the quantity of tucker was going to be massive, just like Sakura herself. As the porcine duo entered the field the immediately came upon Tenten, eating a bowl of ramen in a way that would put Naruto himself to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Washus guysh?\" the plump brunette asked asshe slurped down her meal nonchalantly, she was dressed similarly to Sakura, her massive figure being shamelessly emphasized by her ensemble. Her gigantic ass, bigger than Sakuras, was put on full display, each cheek large and firm. While her belly had slightly more coverage than Sakura's, yet still her shirt clung to it, highlighting her flabbiness in pink fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, did you get here early?\" Sakura asked back. Ino would've chided Tenten for eating, but she knew better than to insult a..plus sized person while they ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" she announced as she finished off the last of her meal. \"We've got some stiff competition too.

Surely they had the skills, both Tenten and Sakura's gelatinous forms could attest to that alone. And again, they were plenty practiced in the art of eating and gluttony, being keen on being able to fit as much as possible into their tummies and developing their own unique styles of consumption (jokingly named eatjutsu between the three of them). But the obvious remained just that to Sakura: Tenten was a renowned eater throughout the village, and as was she... but these women had grown exponentially, only since the new Hokage had been indited- about three or four years ago- was when most of these women started expanding. Their stomachs must have been composed of rubber to put on such an astonishing amount of weight so quickly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten, busy munching away at her bowl of noodles until now, actually put down her chopsticks for a moment to contemplate what her rationalistic team mate had just put forth. It seemed to resonate with her the fact that while she, again quite the seasoned eater, would hold up well in a contest of amateurs; this contest was between professional gourmands from all across the Ninja World! There was a good chance of a girl like her not winning, or even placing at all! Slowly and sadly, Tenten's utensiled hands fell to her dough sidemost collection of fat as Sakura's words of reason reached her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly fat girl!\" Ino said confidently as she touched Sakura on the padded shoulder, \"Of course you can, you two are the biggest eaters I've ever met- I work with Choji, I would know- if anyone's gonna win us that million Ryo, I know it'll be one of you two.\" she moved her hands down to Sakura's many bulges and tummy rolls and gave them a quick slap, \"This tummy's made of iron, you can handle anything these hogs can throw at you, and I'll be right beside you to cheer you on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely enough, at the conclusion of Ino's pep talk, Sakura actually felt <i>better</i> than when she did before Ino started talking! She raised her head to look her longtime friend in the eyes- green meeting sparkling blue- before a smile creased her chubby chipmunk cheeks. \"You're right, I can <i>so</i> do this!\" Sakura said passionately, her confidence returned to her. Tenten looked up too, finishing up her noodles with gusto, \"Yeah, that's right, let's show these tourists how we chow down in Konoha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, all three started towards the competor's arena, only diverting when the two of the supposed three eaters of Team Ino started heading towards the stands, rather than the eating stage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino!!\" Sakura hollered, \"You said you'd be right beside me!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In spirit.\" Ino said haughtily, \"After all, can't waste my perfect figure. That's a job for girls who don't have figures to lose!\"</span></div></div>",

Sakura, Tenten, and several other competitors were seated in the chairs while the Emcee stood in the center of the field. Behind him was a monitor which had his image broadcast so that those far away could see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies, gentlemen, good folks of Konoha and beyond! Welcome to the 27th annual Konoha Stuff-a-thon. Today, all of these brave eaters before me will compete to see who can eat the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt his pause the audience gave a loud roar. Sakura clapped her meaty hands together as well, while in the stands Ino held her hands over her ears, anting the noise to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have with us today our champion and Hokage, Tsunade \"Debukage\" Senjuu!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother round of applause went off as the mountain of lard known as Tsunade raised a blubbery arm to wave to the crowd while she stood. In excess of 800lbs, she was more than likely the biggest and most powerful of the villagers. She sat in her own specially made chair that Shizune carried for her most of the time, but thanks to her inhuman strength she was able to stay mobile. Her most prominent feature aside from her girth and might was her impossibly large breasts, an object of much of Jiraiya's research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With an incredible eating habit and nearly insatiable appetite she has been unmatched since her debut, this year we may have an upset but that remains to be seen. Now then, we will begin with a randomized pairing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the monitor switched to the faces of the twenty contestants and split in half. Then it began to show two faces on screen and mix them so fast that only the Sharingan or other optical jutsu could see it. Finally it stopped, and Sakura's overworked heart skipped a beat. It was her versus...  </span></div></div>",

As her eating quickly accelerated to meet the demand she heard her friends cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Sakura!\" shouted Ten-Ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpurred on by her friends Sakura continued shoveling food into her mouth when she suddenly noticed that her arms were bigger than before and she could barely see past her swelling breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food is enhanced with jutsu to make it extra fattening.\" she thought. She was unnerved by this fact, but continued to eat. She had already piled on an extra 20 pounds to her previous 350lbs. About ten minutes later she heard a buzzer and the food vanished. Kurenai was unconsious and groaning on the other side of the table. Sakura then took in her new swollen body. She had gorged herself to 480 pounds, and was just as big as Ten-Ten, and just like Ten-Ten she was in nothing but her bra which was barely on.

Her fat frame started bloating bigger with every bite of the spiked cake. Within minutes she had passed the 600lb mark and was still eating with outeven looking at herself.

Her breasts were the next biggest part measuring in at 200cm each, which gave her a 400cm bustline that was completely exposed to the world.

Waiting for her friend at the door, Sakura panted from the physically intensive 'jog' that she had just performed, her generous chest rising with each breath, and due to the savory smell wafting out from the restaurant, Sakura began to drool slightly as well. A few moments later and Ino caught up, perfectly fine due to the lack of flab on her petite figure. Seeing Sakura in such a state, she knocked her out of it with a hearty pat on the back, sending ripples through her figure and causing her gut to jiggle randomly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Wait was that for?\" yelled the puffed up pinkette, turning to face her smirking friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you were the one who was in a trance because you can't control that gut of yours.\" said Ino, pointing towards Sakura's pale gut sticking out through her too small red top. With a blush matching the color tone of her pink covered head, Sakura let out a huff and barged into the restaurant, eager to chow down on Ino's behalf, and Sakura resolved to go all out to get back at her teasing friend. Having been greeted by the plump waitress, the pair were quickly seated and Sakura eagerly began to browse the menu, finding each entree equally delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I did say that this was my treat, but I think you might want to cut back a bit.\" said Ino as she also looked through the menu for her favorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" said the other girl in a familiar grouchy tone.  With a sigh, Ino pointed out all of the obese customers happily chowing down in the eatery and how many of them appeared to be squished into their booths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, you're not that big but you're getting there. Do you really want to end up like those chumps?\"  Looking down towards her belly, she did noticed that it was pressing slightly against the table and that just a bit of flesh was flowing over the surface. One part of her felt that she really should diet down, she never did choose to be overweight, her mother's cooking simply gave her bad eating habits and she always felt that she never had a 'chance' to be thin in adulthood. However, another part of her grew quite excited at the site, for the sheer fact that she was so big already and had the 'chance' to get even bigger. Sakura remained in thought, causing her friend to remain quiet as well. She was simply teasing the poor girl, but perhaps her words were put to good use. And if Sakura was going to cut back, she could always indulge a bit more to tease her even further!</span></div></div>",

But it just feels like something bad will happen and our ninja won't be at full force owing to our heavy populace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say you've been hanging out with Shikamaru too much,\" Sakura replied, scarfing down another bowl of ramen and signalling the waitress for a few more plates of ribs while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're probably right,\" Ino replied, observing her closest friend in her element. Sakura looked so happy, so vibrant, like this. She had worried, after diving into her ninja studies, that Sakura would end up falling prey to some of the meaner bullies in town.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After watching her pink haired friend put a rather large dent in her wallet, the two parted ways. Sakura was headed back home, while Ino thought it would be a wise idea to seek advice from her Hokage, the immense Tsunade. Ino had been quite familiar with her leader, as she was a ranking shinobi and often came to her when she was lost in thought or confused about certain missions. While the Hokage was quite obese for a woman of her age, there was no hesitation in Ino's eyes that she could instantly defeat nearly everyone in the village, save for the Namikaze family, but they are the one exception to that. Reaching the Hokage's tower, the blonde haired ninja greeted the jolly guards as she made her way up, ignoring the continent elevator that the heavier crowd always used. Approaching the large wooden doors of Tsunade's office, Ino walked up to Shizune's desk and began to chat with the plump older woman. While Tsunade's partner was to be considered fat, with thick thunder thighs and a modest pot belly, she was nowhere near the weight of Tsunade. Eagerly munching on a simple bag of chips, the black haired woman oddly seemed determined. Looking towards the trash can, Ino saw that there were plenty of wrappers flowing out but she pushed that out of her current thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Shizune. I'm here to talk with Tsunade-sama. I know its really short notice, but I just need some advice about a certain friend.\" said Ino honestly. Pulling away from her sodium filled snack, Shizune gave her a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello there Ino, didn't notice you there. Its been a slow day today for all of us at the office, so there shouldn't be an issue. Tsunade is just speaking with someone right now, so she should be finished up soon. Here, sit down while you wait.\" answered the plump woman as she pointed towards a spare chair right next to her. Giving a nod, Ino sat down, laying back in a lazy fashion. Shizune began to offer her some chips, but Ino declined, having already eaten her fair share of calories for the day. The pair spent the next ten minutes chatting up about recent developments in the village, how 'so and so' hooked up or which restaurants made the top rankings for the month. Soon, a figure exited the room and Ino got a good glace at them. He looked to be a young man with blonde hair in a similar shade of hers and piercing blue eyes. The young man also had three whiskered marks trailing from his cheeks and some rather large canines in his mouth as he was sporting a large, happy grin. As he walked away, Ino was a bit surprised to see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that Naruto Namikaze?\" asked the blonde, shocked to see him up close for the first time.  Normally, this Naruto would be incredibly busy, given his reputation and his family background as well. As a shinobi, people constantly requested him for services and many also pay top dollar. Rumors have it that his services actually generate enough funds to dwarf Tsunade's debts. Ino could only shudder at the thought of owing that much money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, he had some business with Tsunade, but now you should be able to see her if you'd like.\" said the black haired woman, munching on her snacks once more.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

A part of her was telling her that this was a trap, that she had stumbled into some sort of weird conspiracy and that she was going to be 'silenced.' Shaking off such strange ideas, Ino suddenly stumbled into Tsunade's large rear, quickly placing her hands on the older woman's back-fat to stabilize herself. Getting a hold of her surroundings, Ino noticed that they entered the room, but were still in a dimly lit hallway and that Tsunade had stopped in order to unlock the door farther inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah now, isn't this a bit too early for groping? I mean we only just entered the hallway and all.\" teased Tsunade as her fat fingers fiddled with the keys. Ino's face reddened with embarassment as she bowed for such a 'disrespectful' action. Finally opening the door, Tsunade let out a loud laugh as she raised Ino from her position and gently patted her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now, I'll have none of that ultra polite crap from you when it's only the two of us. Anyways, the door is open so try to pay attention this time, or feel up my bum again, your choice.\" with a chuckle, the Hokage walked into the room, Ino following right behind her behind once more. Turning on the lights to the hidden room, Tsunade sat her hefty body near the desk as she began to fiddle with a few documents. Taking a look around, Ino saw that the room was rather dust and the air was quite stifling. The blonde could only assume that this was a secret room where the overweight leader kept her classified documents. Taking a seat at the front of the desk, Ino remained quiet as Tsunade began to search through her drawers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah here it is.\" said the older woman as she pulled a manila envelope and took out a few documents. Reading it through, she had a satisfied look on her face. She then tossed the documents over to Ino who began to scan over them as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see, Sakura is quite healthy, her chakra levels are quite plentiful and she has no issues with diabetes, asthma and the like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I had no idea she was that fat, wait! This isn't the issue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh then was was the problem then? If it doesn't involve her documents or anything like that, I'm afraid I can't help you.\" Letting out a sigh, Ino placed a hand to her head to gather exactly what she wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it wasn't whether or not she had issues with her health, it was about how she was acting. Lately Sakura does nothing but stuff her face and it's not natural even if most of the women in the village are huge. It's like when she does it, she's a completely different person and that scares me a bit. She doesn't respond, her face turns into a deep scowl and I swear, even her eyes turn darker.  I worry because I feel she's going to hurt herself badly one of these days.\"  Placing her hands on the desk and resting her head, Tsunade tried to think up any reason for such a change. In all of her years of stuffing, consuming and eating, she had never heard of such a thing happening. Perhaps it was worth looking into?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I'll see if I have any info here matching that description. For now, don't avoid Sakura or anything, just hang out with her normally and tell me if anything else happens.\" Nodding, Ino excused herself as she left the secret room and headed back home. Letting out another sigh, the older woman hated it when problems came about. Soon, Shizune came into the room, her wide hips brushing against the aging doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsunade, you have another visitor. You seem quite popular today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh lucky me.\"</span></div></div>",

A simple D rank mission that the lowest level chonin could do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...that might work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...well it better because if this fails it will be your responsibility to take matters of your heart in your own hands. Buckle down and just belt out how you feel. It does no one any good if you hide your feelings from the person you care about, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Tsunade-sama, thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata soon waddled away, leaving Tsunade alone for a few moments until Shizune entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her assistant/lover waddle close, Tsunade smirked at the way Shizune had undone her robe, letting her gut hang heavily in the apron that it was. From there, Tsunade saw just a bit of Shizune's rear end as she waddled to and fro, the flash of more rear devouring more of the back of Shizune's XXXL sized robes making Tsunade lick her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it we have no more appointments for the day, my dear Shizune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None, Tsunade-sama, though there is considerable paperwork still left to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grunted at that, bringing her tubby soulmate close, kissing her fiercely.

He was still feeling aches from the past five missions he had undergone the day before and wanted nothing more to finish up quickly and head back to his apartment for rest and relaxation. His thoughts began to wander and eventually reached to that of his partner for the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hinata Hyuuga.' thought the blonde as he pictured the blubbery girl's face in his mind. Now it wasn't hard to figure out that the long haired young woman had a bit of a crush on him, he was used to such affections due to how popular he was in the village. Hinata however, was a different case as he didn't think he could actually go out with her. It wasn't because the blonde was celibate or shy or any such nonsense. He'd gone out before, had a few successful relationships that all ended amicably and knew the ins and outs of being with someone else in a romantic fashion. He had a great teacher after all, though because of said teacher, Naruto was infamous in the village for feeding, fattening and leaving girls. Of course all of those rumors were unfounded, but they still hurt! Giving out a sigh, the reason that Naruto concluded why he could never go out with Hinata was that the girl was so 'pure.' She was like an angel that deserved to be with someone as 'angelic' with her. His own 'devilish' traits could never mesh well with hers and he would always be afraid of hurting her or even breaking her heart. Though her body was certainly 'devilish' in many ways, especially her rotund gut and those thick thunder-thighs. Shoving such thoughts out of his mind, he reminded himself of his resolve and vowed to never get involved with the innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I should get some ramen after this, let off some steam. Maybe 'accidentally' run into a flabby girl or two.' Of course, he would be the first to admit his own 'devilishness.' Stuck in his thoughts of ramen and soft bodies, he failed to notice the heavyset Hyuuga walk towards him and then try to gain his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" she asked with confusion, tilting her fat face to the side in curiosity. It wasn't like the blonde to daydream, he always planted his feet into the 'present.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hinata, didn't see you there. Ready to head out?\" A smile on her face, she nodded as she began her way outside the village. Naruto right behind her, he let out a pervy smile as he watched her huge Hyuuga rear bounce side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I can have a few accidents with Hinata too.'  </span></div></div>",

No one to interrupt them, no important life-threatening decisions and even the paperwork was simple enough that it was finished within a few hours. Now, Shizune wasn't all work no play as many people thought, she liked to enjoy the small things every now and then, permitted that her Hokage wasn't acting like an arse.  So it was the black haired woman that suggested locking up the office, placing some sound-absorbing jutsu and bringing in enough food to feed a small platoon of shinobi. It would be perfect, they would feed each other in particularly restrictive clothing, enjoy each others company and save the finale at their personal Hokage mansion. Ten minutes into their lovely little session and a rather meek knocking came from the door, much to the utter annoyance. Stuffing the remains of a creampuff into Shizune's mouth, Tsunade quickly cleaned up their little mess, and begrudgingly went to open the door.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello Hokage, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.\" said the ever-shy girl as she had a worried expression on her cherubic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make it quick before I decide to send you to Suna for a few years.\" nodding the girl sat her generous rear down on the chair in front of the desk and began to tell her story of what had happened during that mission, how they were able to connect and actually talk with another in a casual fashion. However, after the mission, their relationship regressed to what it was before, casual greetings and a seemingly lack of interest in her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other day, I saw him hanging out with three different girls. Not that I was stalking him or anything...\" said Hinata as her voice began to trail off into silence. Tsunade let out a sigh, this girl was simply too meek to have a shot with the 'wild' Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Hinata, there isn't much I can tell you. You need to go out an actually talk to him, maybe try getting closer to him as a friend before you take the plunge. I also can't keep putting you on easy missions with him, he's a rather highly sought after shinobi after all and I plan to milk him as much as I can to be perfectly honest.\" With a downtrodden face, Hinata nodded, feeling stupidly week and 'useless' once again. Seeing such a sad showing, Shizune got an idea. Digging through the drawers of the desk, and ignoring all of the empty bottles of sake, she found a few small pieces of paper and shoved them into Hinata's plump hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are coupons for Naruto's favorite BBQ place that we use to bribe him into taking certain missions. I guarantee if you offer them to him, he'd fall in love with you on the spot.\" With a smile Hinata thanked the two as she moved her heavy body off of the chair and left the two in peace once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, can we just go back home? I'm sure there won't be a cataclysmic attack tonight or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you don't drink yourself into a stupor, we can do whatever the hell you want.\"</span></div></div>",

Now go along, relax, because starting tomorrow you're on my schedule.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno nodded, bowing again and moving to grab Sakura's hand and take her along when Tsunade stopped her with a look. \"Just a moment Ino. I'd like to have a word with Sakura here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Sakura, I'll be waiting outside, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ino. Hope you've got your checkbook ready because I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno just smiled, darting out of the office, leaving Sakura and Tsunade alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone was any jovial air Tsunade had had with Ino. Instead, she was glaring at Sakura, her immense figure making Sakura feel small for the first time in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I see when I look at you, Ms. Haruno?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fat person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a person. A pig. A greedy, selfish, hog who just lives to stuff their face. Don't think I haven't heard about you abusing Ino's friendship. Always having her foot your bills, always doing what you want, never what she wants to do. Ignoring her attempts to help you find something to do with your life except eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not like that! I don't...Ino's money's just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why did you come here? Because Ino asked you or because she promised dinner afterwards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For dinner...but Ms. Tsunade-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Hokage to you, Ms. Haruno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, Hokage, I've been abusing Ino, taking advantage of her kindness to me. I just...she's come so far and I...I just eat all the time. I don't have any talent, any type of skill. But she seems to think I do, that no matter how many times I tell her I'm nothing, she doesn't hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why, Ms. Haruno, you're going to do your best to be the kind of friend Ino deserves, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because if you ever treat Ino like I just saw again, I'll banish you from the village, understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go, enjoy your last pig out with Ino. Because after today, you will start your journey towards becoming the kind of companion Ino deserves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded slowly, waddling away and leaving Tsunade alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her temples, Tsunade sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune, hurry up with that paperwork! I need some cuddling time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come and help me and we can get to that!\" Shizune replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, Tsunade got to her feet and waddled towards her lover's office.</span></div></div>",

I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde would have rolled her eyes by this point and just resumed eating her salad while watching (with some morbid interest) her obese best friend wolfing down her fourth plate of ribs. Except there were some things missing from that picture. Some very important things that only a best friend would notice to be amiss. For one thing, Sakura was eating <i>calmly</i>. Yep. Total elegance and minding her manners. No raising the bowl of ramen to her face and downing the contents, no savagely tearing meaty ribs apart with her sausage-shaped digits before doing more tearing with her teeth in a savage manner, and no grabbing her choice of beverage and gulping the liquid down as though she'd been parched for days. What had happened to all her usual eagerness when it came to eating, especially earlier today? Something really was amiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm done...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno blinked two times, then a third time. She eyed her friend carefully. \"Sakura, are you <i>sure </i>you're fine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grunted, leaning back on her creaking chair--an action which made the creaking noise sound all the more ominous--and resting her hands on her big belly, which didn't look the least bit filled to the brim. \"Yes, I told you that already, Ino. Why wouldn't I be?\" she huffed thickly, very much annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's eye twitched and she looked unimpressed. <i>Really Forehead? You want to play this game?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I don't know,\" the blonde spoke in a semi-theatrical tone, mocking the idea of being convinced. \"Maybe it's the water? Must taste salty for you to not be eager to chug it down like you normally do. Maybe it's the ribs? They must not be cooked properly, probably the chef's fault, or maybe the sauce is spoilt. Maybe it's the ramen? The noodles could be underheated, or something, or maybe it just doesn't compare to Ichiraku's. Ooh, ooh! Wait! I know! Maybe it's the fact that you said you were done, when all you've had is <i>two plates of ribs and just one bowl of miso ramen</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your point, Ino?\" Sakura muttered. \"I can go to a public restaurant and not make myself look like a fatass every now and then. Even I can show some restraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno grumbled something about the pinkette's stubbornness.Then, releasing a calming sigh, she looked at her chubby best friend seriously. \"Sakura, seriously, I wasn't born yesterday. Yeah, I'm not a smartass like Shikamaru, but even I know when something's off with my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, really, you're worrying about noth--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I would know,\" the blonde interrupted. \"Because just this very afternoon, all you could think about was eating, <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">and emptying my wallet</font>, and then ever since we left the Hokage's mansion, you've been acting all, well, weird! And not the funny kind of weird. I'm talking the 'I'm-not-myself-so-I'm-gonna-worry-my-friends' type of weird.\" Ino paused, seemingly finished. Then, she blinked two times upon realizing something very crucial in her own words. \"Come to think of it, when you came out of your chat with Lady Tsunade, you've had a pretty down look in your eyes,\" the blonde's eyes got bigger. \"In fact, you looked like you were about to cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Sakura's eyes widened, looking like she'd been caught under a headlight. \"I was, uhh, I was in awe! Yeah, that's it! I mean, it was overwhelming, being in the same room as the biggest woman in Konoha... Plus the fact alone that she wanted to talk to me, eheh.\" The nervous chuckle she threw at the end, combined with the forced smile on her chubby face, only made Sakura's attempt to put her friend's concerns at ease all the more unconvincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ino, this was obvious. Sakura may try to fool her, but Ino would never forget the look in her eyes as she left the Hokage's room. Those emerald eyes, looking ready to brim with tears. It reminded her of their younger days, for those were the eyes Sakura would have some days when she was getting bullied for her weight. The days when Ino would come out of the Ninja Academy, go looking for her best friend, only to find her looking miserable, having been subjected to bullying and teasing because of her appearance and because her ninja friend wasn't there to protect her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a look Ino hated utterly. She is usually a friendly, if teasing, person, but mess with her best friend, and you get the stinger of the Yamanaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura,\" said Ino. \"What did Lady Tsunade want to talk to you about?\" She did not miss how the mere mention of the Hokage's name made the rotund pinkette flinch slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing, it's not important...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, Ino! If you're worried because I'm not stuffing myself like I usually do, I guess it's because I had a big lunch earlier, remember? That plus this dinner? I'm totally full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right there that Sakura's prodigious middle turned traitor and made its presence known with a loud growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno stared blankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's face reddened and she immediately looked down, her chubby hands grasping her huge gut as though trying to commune with it and tell it to quiet down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStartled at the sound of Ino's voice, Sakura jerked her head up, her facial flab jiggling. \"I-I-Ino! Really! All Lady Tsuna--Lady <i>Hokage </i>and I talked about was...was... Argh, it's not important, okay?! What is important is what I have to say...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's eyes widened slightly, startled when Sakura corrected herself on addressing the Hokage. \"Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino,\" Sakura took a deep breath to calm herself, then released it gently before looking her dear friend in the eye. \"Tonight isn't about me, all right? It's about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not my birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point! It's just...\" Sakura's countenance shifted into one of sorrow. \"Y-You've always been such a great friend. A friend so great, you deserve better than having to lower yourself to hanging out with a greedy tub of lard like me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's mouth fell. \"Sakura, what--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me finish. You deserve a better friend than me... All we do is what I want to do, I take advantage of your generosity, and I'm pretty sure your wallet money is broke because of me. And yet you've done so much for me... You always say I'm good for something even though I don't feel like I am, you've always stuck around me for heaven knows why, and...and...\" she paused to close her eyes, already feeling tears building up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was silent, staring in absolute concern at her quivering friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura opened her eyes, tears trailing down her plump cheeks gently. \"What I'm trying to say is I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for being such a worthless, scumbag, greedy hog of a friend. You deserve so much better than me. I'll understand if you don't want to be friends anymore...\" she closed her eyes again and lowered her head, whimpering ever so slightly with every quiet sob. She brought one of her chubby hands to cover her eyes in an attempt to stop her tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, was all Sakura could think. She was about to lose her best friend. And it wouldn't matter. Because she had been such an awful person...no, <i>hog</i>, just like Lady Hokage had said. She wasn't a person. She was just a greedy glutton who abused her friendship for her own selfish reasons. She didn't deserve anybody. She deserved to just be isolated and disappear, unknown and unmourned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pinkette's eyes widened upon feeling a slim, warm hand over her flabby one. She looked to see Ino giving her a gentle, beatific smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa there, Billboard Butt. What's all this about you being a bad friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was stupefied. \"B-But Ino, didn't you hear me? I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh stop it, you're gonna make me get all emotional,\" Ino shook her head, but her smile was intact. \"Seriously, though, where did that idea come from? Sure, you like to eat at my wallet's expense, but hey, nothing a good mission payout won't fix.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura,\" Ino said with mock seriousness, using her free hand to flick the pink-haired heavyweight on the forehead. \"Chill. Ever heard of dynamics? Sure, to some people it might seem like you use me for a free meal, and I hang out with you to make me feel good about myself, but who cares? 'Cause that's what other people think. And who cares what other people think? You and I both know the truth,\" Ino's eyes closed and she gave a beaming smile. \"That we're great friends. Always have been, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino...\" Sakura sniffled, wiping her eyes with a napkin. After finishing cleaning her vision, she returned Ino's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her beaming made Ino's smile widen. <i>Atta girl</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she gave Sakura's pudgy hand a gentle grip and loosened the cheeriness in favor of a little seriousness. \"Now, will you please tell me what Lady Hokage said to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's cheered spirit dimmed just a little bit. \"Ino, I really don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by Ino giving another reassuring squeeze to her hand. \"Forehead, seriously, I think after that melodramatic heart-to-heart stuff we just did, I'm pretty sure this is the part where you feel you can open up to me,\" she smiled. \"After all, you're my best friend. It's my job to listen if something has you worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura absorbed the blonde's words, looking slightly hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Sakura, smiling a little, opened her mouth and...</span></div></div>",

Today's mission entailed carrying roughly a hundred of them from one end of Konoha to the other. In other words, grunt work. \"I'm starving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all are, Naruto. We had to skip lunch to do this mission.\" Said Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasuke just folded his arms and grunted. Today's mission had been taxing on everyone indeed, patience was wearing thin. All the more reason for Kakashi to send his troops home for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on home then, and get some food and rest. There will probably be a more...interesting mission tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we'll actually get to do important stuff!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Just go home Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond ninja pouted and followed his teammates who were turning to leave. Like always, Team Seven was walking home together after a long day, though the silence between its members was almost deafening. It had been a grueling past few hours indeed, no one really wanted to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Naruto dared to break the quiet reflection of his teammates. \"So...What are you guys doing now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chorus of growling stomachs answered him. He chuckled slightly. \"I guess that means everyone's going to get food, huh? Want to head over to the ramen bar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.\" Said Sakura, patting her belly slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dieting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concept was completely daft to her male counterparts though. \"Again? What for? You look fine, Sakura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was glaring at him now, so he quietly backed down. Though he didn't understand diets, Naruto knew well enough by now that arguing with Sakura over them was just not worth the effort. She'd always turn down invitations to meals and free food, even if her stomach growled like it had a tiger in it. From Naruto's perspective, Sakura looked fine. Always thin enough, athletically built, and shapely. But you wouldn't even see her so much as eat a candy bar, she was so insistent on sticking to some sort of unspoken code.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto shrugged, it was that stubborn attitude that made him like Sakura so much. But still, she'd always have eyes for Sasuke. Everyone knew that, even if he ignored her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your house, right Sakura?\" Asked Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Thanks Sasuke.\" She replied, nearly forgetting her stop. She turned and waved, smiling as she left. \"See you guys tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends said their good byes as well, then immediately got into getting on each others nerves. Without Sakura to stand between them, it was hopeless, they had started bickering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what about you Sasuke!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am NOT going to your ramen bar, Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on! What are you? A cheapskate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura continued smiling to herself, expecting to hear a trading of blows in a few moments. Even if they argued a lot Naruto and Sasuke were good friends. Loyal, trusting, they would never hide a thing from Sakura. She opened the door to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd never hide a thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stepped inside, Sakura's expression did a complete one hundred and eighty degree turn. She was frowning to herself, a lingering look of disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer house was empty and dark, her parents had gone out of town for the week so she was all alone. In a way though, she was glad. It was embarrassing for her to walk around with her true nature showing, even if they were her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mirror in the front hall of her home, it was the usual place where her parents left any messages for her through sticky notes. A fresh bright yellow slip of paper beckoned her over. She read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sakura, I know you're still dieting but please try to eat! There's some leftover fish from last night in the fridge. Remember, you're only going to run out of energy faster if you don't have something to fuel yourself with. Stay healthy! -Mom\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura groaned and crumpled up the paper, even if her parents ordered her to she wasn't going to eat. This would be the third time in a row she'd be going to bed hungry. She felt her stomach wobble around like a bag of water, groaning in displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...\" She whispered to it. The strain was probably getting to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to keep the jutsu up for so long during extended periods of the day, especially on missions. And while she had gotten accustomed to it her whole life, it made the end of everyday feel like she had been running a marathon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before she undid the jutsu, she glared angrily at the stranger in the mirror. The thin her. The fake her. An insect in comparison to girl underneath the skin. The most pathetic person Sakura ever laid eyes on. She hated her reflection like this, it diligently obeyed the orders of society. It answered the call for the need to be perfect in every way. But it wasn't to blame, the reflection wasn't the crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura did the appropriate hand signals. \"Release!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the fake her dissolved in the mirror. The wool covering the eyes was pulled back, the reflection was no more. It's cheeks bulged out, as did its stomach, its breasts, its arms, its butt. Everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dress groaned slightly, readjusting itself to the new larger form it now held in place. The sound of her body, when it returned to its true shape, was similar to that of a balloon being filled up with air by a helium tank. And in a way it was invigorating. Like standing naked in the cold rain, feeling every single drop touch your body. Like showing the world who you really were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked somewhat pear shaped like this, her belly stuck out a good ways from her body as did her breasts. But it was her hips and butt that contained the most fat, giving her greater curves then her fake self could ever hope to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked solemnly at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she was born obese, Sakura had tried every single thing imaginable to lose the pounds. Her parents had taken her to doctors, specialists, even surgeons. Nothing could be safely done though to truly solve her big problem. She was destined to be this way for the rest of her life, hiding behind a jutsu that disguised her true self. After she found it in an old scroll at the bottom of a well when she was a kid, she had practiced for months perfecting the jutsu to the point where she could spend days using it. It was the first one she had ever learned, and as a result there wasn't a jutsu after it that she couldn't handle. Still, she hated using the jutsu, she hated that she had to hide what she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't the crime. Tears formed in the pits of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crime was that it was allowed. That she was so weak and so spineless that she'd hide herself behind magic, smoke, and mirrors. That she let the words of others get to her. That she'd conform like every other coward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crime was that she let the fake reflection take control and be her face for the world, while the world remained unaware of the hidden flower beneath the skin. She was wearing a mask, and nothing more. And she hated herself, so much. So fucking much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't the first time that Sakura would stare at a mirror and starting crying to herself, and it probably wouldn't be her last. As the tears feel, she knew she still had the small comfort that she was alone in her home. She had a whole night ahead of her and if what Kakashi was true, she had a busy day tomorrow. What she energy she couldn't get from eating she'd have to get from sleeping. She turned and left to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was her secret. One that she had never told anyone. One that she'd die if anyone discovered. This was the elephant on her back, the skeleton in her closet, the sorrow in her heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was how she had spent her entire life.</span></div></div>",

Today's mission was to help the owner of a brand new resturant unpack and set up shop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived on location they saw a rather impressive building in front of a large fountain. It was three stories high, made from the same material as most buildings in Konoha, every wall had thirty windows. The back where the kitchen was was the sole exception, the bottom floor missing it's windows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the first floor was a simple, spacious room, the floor was made from some kind of wood, more than likely Oak by the color. In the center was a plot of soil, the ground looked bone dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the Genin had no opinion on the place, more or less they were quite irritated. The main reason was because the client had asked for them to arrive at the literal crack of dawn, and Kakashi had been called off on some serious mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could feel herself practically nodding off as she sat down near the fountain, but she couldn't lest her jutsu be released. If it wasn't for her mastery of chakra control, Sakura would've already dropped the jutsu. One thing that helped keep her up was Naruto's incesant complaints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, when are these two going to get here already?\" The blond asked yawning, \"I just wanna get this mission over with and go back to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will probably be an all day mission dunce,\" Sasuke replied, more agitated than usual. \"It'll probably be awhile before we head home so get over it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you-\" Naruto began to yell when a loud honk was heard. The trio looked to see the unfamiliar sight of a moving van in front of them. In another, smaller vehicle came two strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was a brown haired man, he seemed to be in his early forties. He was around 5'5 and about as big as Choji. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was a 17 year old girl, she was relatively pretty. Her hair was the same shade of sepia as the mans, and she was rather plump as well. Her rounded face seemed vibrant and warm.</span></div></div>",

Deciding to be friendly, least they'd all be unpleasant for the rest of the day to each other, Sakura answered the porky man's greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, good morning mister...Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inshouku. Chef Inshouku.\" Smiled the man, he gestured to the girl behind him. \"And this is my daughter, Shirayuri\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri bowed, lifting her rich purple skirt up in the process. Sakura noticed a pair of purple wrist cuffs around her arms, but thought nothing of them. \"How do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, miss? And how about the two grumpy ones behind you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura Haruno. And these are my teammates Naruto and Sasuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charmed, well now that introductions are settled, how about some breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blinked slightly. \"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInshouku laughed slightly. \"Come now, surely you can't hope to work on an empty stomach. There's much to be done today and I'm not a chef for nothing. Call it a thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a rumbling roar of stomachs interrupted Sakura's plea. Her teammates all winced in hunger. She tried pushing in her own in a feeble attempt to make it shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your empty bellies say otherwise. Come, I can wipe up a quick something in a jiffy. I believe the kitchen was said to be in tact by the time of our arrival...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he turned to leave for the building, Shirayuri, Naruto, and Sasuke all followed him holding their stomach in eager anticipation. Sakura reached out to stop them but there was nothing she could do. She slumped and reluctantly followed them into the kitchen. Temptation was the biggest enemy of a diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stepped into the empty restaurant and headed for the kitchen, as they went Chef Inshouku pointed out all the things that needed to be done. The boy didn't appear to be listening though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as you can see we haven't quite set up shop yet. There are tables and chairs to be moved in from the van. I'll leave the heavy lifting work to the boys, for now. After that they'll need to install all the windows on the first floor, then there's cleaning...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Mr. Inshouku. What do you want me to do?\" Asked Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped at the kitchen door. \"Oh, I have a big job for you and Shirayuri to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, he pointed at the empty window stills. Outside behind the restaurant was a massive field of nothing but weeds and roots, cluttering up every single corner of the acre long yard. \"We need to clear out that entire field of weeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura could already feel her back killing her. \"Ahh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't expect you finish today, just try to make a sizable dent in it. Anyway.\" He started up the grill. \"Who wants bacon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\" Shouted Naruto, Sasuke, and Shirayuri at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chef noticed Sakura hadn't said anything. \"What about you, Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bit her lip. \"I'm not hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growling stomach spoke a different opinion. Naruto gave Sakura a concerned look, as did Shirayuri. Inshouku eyed her once but shrugged, focusing on the slices of meat sizzling in the pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself then. If you'd like, you can get started on clearing the field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, Sakura stepped out into the field. The bright din of the early morning light forced her to squint slightly just to see beyond five feet in front of her. She was suddenly very thankful that Chef Inshouku didn't expect her to finish clearing the fields by the end of the day. The brown gnarled weeds went up to her waist, and that was at the lowest places. Some were even taller then her. Disgusting, similar, and tiresome weeds all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sakura decided to get to work. Staring into space wasn't going to make the job go any faster. She reached for the first ugly stem and yanked real hard. The roots ran real deep into the ground, it took several forceful tugs to pull it straight out of the ground, she landed right on her butt hard with the weed in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww...\" She muttered, rubbing her sore bottom. This was going to take awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to pull herself to her feet, something weird happened. She felt really dizzy, like she had been flipped around in circles. She caught herself as her legs gave way and shook in her head in confusion. She stood there holding her knees for a few brief minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah...What's wrong with me...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad it been sleep deprivation? No, she had gone sleepless nights before and never had something like this happen to her. Her stomach, which was growling furiously with her, wasn't helping the problem at all. And with the strain of the jutsu...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to pull them out by the roots.\" Said a female voice behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri was standing behind her, arms crossed with a look of wild amusement like she had been watching Sakura the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeds are a lot like problems. You need to take them out by the roots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gave a forced grin back. \"Oh? Thanks for the tip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Sakura winced again as another wave of hungry stomach growls overcame her. Shirayuri frowned, noticing the pink haired ninja's discomfort as she doubled over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're dieting aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that obvious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something like that, I had been on a lot of them myself. You should really eat something if you're going to be pulling weeds all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like my mom.\" Replied Sakura, brushing the dirt from her dress. \"I'll be fine though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri held up a bag and tossed it to Sakura who looked at it in confusion. \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rice cakes. Relax, they're non-fat. It's basically like eating celery.\" She gave a big smile. \"I used to eat them all the time when I had my hunger pains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura opened the bag, inside were little patty shaped bits of food. She wondered if she could even call them food, they sort of looked like packaging peanuts. Taking one out she sniffed it. Odorless. She took a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Tastes like paper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri laughed. \"Yes, I think so too. You go on ahead and eat, I'll start working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she didn't admit it, Sakura was extremely grateful for the food. Even the tiny cardboard tasting bite she took had soothed the savage growls of her stomach in an instant. She watched with mild interest as Shirayuri proceeded to pick the weeds from the fields, she was doing it with much more ease than Sakura had. The pulled weeds were neatly laid in a pile next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you went on diets too?\" Asked Sakura, attempting to strike up a conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Several, all failed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, that sounds a lot like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri turned around, giving Sakura a surprised look. \"Really now? You sure don't look like you need the diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura mentally cursed herself. Of course it would look like she didn't need the diet, she had the jutsu. \"Well...It's...Uh...It's complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pudgy girl just gave a warm smile, not revealing if she bought Sakura's clumsy excuse or not. The sun reflected brightly in the strands of her hair almost giving her an angelic appearance. Sakura felt safe around her for some reason. She wrapped up the bag of rice cakes; she had finished only half of it but at least her stomach had something besides itself to eat away at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...I'll just...Uh...Start helping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out for the nearest weeds but Shirayuri stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't pull those ones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you should let them grow, they aren't ready to be plucked yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura furrowed her brow. \"But your father said to pull all the weeds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, I'll talk to him about it. Here start over by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Sakura obeyed making sure to grab the weeds by the root this time. A few moments of speechless labor passed until Shirayuri interrupted the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura's a very pretty name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name. You're named after the sakura flower right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of my hair color. Pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your hair is very beautiful. You're very beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed slightly. \"Thanks...You are too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're both like flowers. My father named me after the word for a lily, after when mom died. He told me I was his flower, so he wanted to give me a beautiful name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura didn't really know how to respond to the girl's almost melancholy speech. She glanced over and saw that Shirayuri was still smiling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a little ironic that two flowers like us have to work in a field of weeds. Don't you think?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Replied Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't much time for conversation after that. Sakura had to focus on working, though she had food in her stomach now the pains were slowly returning. Silence filled the air as the two worked for hours, diligently under the beating sun. The pile of weeds steadily grew into a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura stopped for a moment and wiped the sweat from her brow. At least she was getting a good workout from this. Then, someone tapped her on the shoulder...</span></div></div>",

Naruto had asked her out before, but he never seemed so shy about it. Maybe she had been too hard on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry Naruto but Shirayuri and I are...going to go around Konoha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUH?!\" Both Shirayuri and Naruto exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah remember? So you'd be familiar with the area?\" </span></div></div>",

Sakura shuddered slightly, she looked like the cat that had swallowed the canary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right...Sorry, I had almost forgotten about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura felt a bead of sweat of relief droop down her forehead. Naruto slumped in depression though looked mildly relieved himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...Understand. Sorry, just figured I'd...You know...Ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not come with us then?\" Smirked Shirayuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Sakura was the one to be surprised. \"HUH!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri grinned an almost demonic smile hidden delightfully under her angelic face as she calmly played with her purple wristbands. \"Sure. The more the merrier, right? Sakura won't mind, will you Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura gritted her teeth as Naruto's eyes perked up. \"I guess not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time it was Chef Inoshoku to sit up and speak. \"What a splendid idea! This would be a marvelous chance to sample some of Konoha's fine dining! Please, allow me to treat you three for your hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing her 'plan' had spiraled out of control, Sakura tried to discourage him. \"Mister Inoshoku we really don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food would be good...\" Muttered Sasuke, who hadn't eaten since breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get ramen!\" Shouted Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's decided!\" Exclaimed the chef. \"Let's go out to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis man certainly was proving to vexing as Sakura slumped her shoulders. Oh well, at least Sasuke had asked to come along...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late spring on this fine Konoha evening, the coming summer was lingering in the night air. Flecks of pollen and swarms of bugs inhabited the sky, though it was still cold enough to cool down the ninjas after their hard day of work. An outsider might assume there was a festival in town judging by the happy noises and cheers coming from the street. But really, it was a spring night like any in Konoha as the group traveled down the people filled streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura at been contemplating her shoes the entire time, with the crowded streets and the dim orange lights there was little talking she had to do during the 'tour'. Chef Inoshoku and Shirayuri seemed to be having the times of their lives, the chef insisted on stopping at every single food stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh! These are grilled octopus legs! What fascinating sauce they used!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sasuke had paced himself with all the food, Naruto and virtually gorged himself and had become immobile roughly ten minutes into the tour. Begrudgingly, Sasuke was dragging him along on a wooden cart. Sakura hadn't eaten anything since she had gotten there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, she wanted to be alone for a moment. Waiting for a break in the crowd, she ducked before any of her teammates noticed she was missing and crept along the feet of the city streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in an alleyway, she stood up and brushed herself off. She walked into the darkness of the backstreets, escaping the flashing street lights and noisy people that inhabited them. Quiet. Alone. Not a soul but her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along, she spotted a flight of stairs which lead to a small balcony. In the distance the world opened up to her like a book. She couldn't tell where the sky ended and ground began. Konoha's famed Hokage monument was the only definite landmark for the earth below the starry night sky. The building lights of Konoha seemed like stars themselves, Sakura felt like she was looking at the reflection on a large body of water under an ocean of stars. It was beautiful. She reached out to touch the view, expecting to feel a warm velvety sensation on her fingertips. But she felt nothing. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The world isn't so bad, sometimes, if you can just get out of it.\" Said a voice from behind her, surprising Sakura slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri, angelic looking as ever, was walking up the stairs. Sakura still wasn't too happy with her though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was kind of hoping to be home by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you invite Naruto to come with us? I didn't want to deal with him today and you knew that your dad would want to come along didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri frowned. \"Is this a bad time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura wanted to say something but couldn't. The strain of her jutsu was starting to wear thing on both her strength and patience. She bit her tongue and said another lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"...I'm sorry...It's just been a very long day for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri didn't say anything, nor did her saddened expression change. She just walked next to Sakura on the balcony and looked up at the sky. The stars glittered in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're beautiful, aren't they?\" She said at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The stars...Each of them is unique and bright and beautiful. They seem so special out there in the sky, don't they? Where everyone can see them. So beautiful. They make you seem insignificant...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused, as if taking in the picture she had crafted for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto seems to like you, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a mutual feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she seemed content enough with Sakura's answer, Sakura felt that her reasoning wasn't good enough. She struggled to get the words out right, she felt she could trust Shirayuri for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eccentric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just really makes me...Jealous...I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura looked up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we all can't be stars...He's getting stronger, I think. Him and Sasuke too. They're both so powerful, so noticeable. Everyone gets to see them. It just makes me feel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't get the correct word, still. Or rather, she didn't want to say it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insignificant?\" Helped Shirayuri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura winced. She might as well as thrown a kunai knife at her gut. \"Why am I telling you this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri smiled. \"Because you can't keep all your feelings locked up inside of you forever, right? I mean, an actor can wear a mask but at the end of the day he needs to take it off and take a bow on the stage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirayuri put an arm around Sakura's shoulder. \"Stars are really far away you know. They take years to reach us out in space like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked on at the stars mapped out before them, lighting the sky like a group of actors performing a play for them. Sakura could have sworn she saw a shooting star dance across the deep blackness above her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think the brightest stars take the longest to reach us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Sasuke was a little more than peeved because of this. He had been using his Sharingan to scout around while Naruto used his doppelgangers, but in time he grew fed up. He awaited Naruto's return before he sprung the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you can keep searching on your own. I'm heading home.\" He said as he deactivated his kekei genkai and started to leave. Of course the blond boy called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! you aren't just gonna quit, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darker haired boy only stopped momentarily and sighed. \"It's your fault you dunce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?!!\" Naruto yelled in frustration. He awaited a response from Sasuke, who seeming copped an attitude out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hadn't been stuffing your face so much you wouldn'tve choked, and we wouldn'tve lost track of our client.\" Sasuke explained as he turned around. \"You may be a ninja, but you act careless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell excuse me Sasuke,\u201d The jinchuuriki spat in frustration, \u201cat least my brother didn\u2019t kick my ass!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his fury, Naruto had touched a sore spot. One that in a clearer mind, he wouldn\u2018t have ever dreamed to broach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtilizing superior speed he copied from Rock Lee earlier on, Sasuke came upon his teammate, his eyes gleaming, crimson daggers with the Sharingan activated. When he spoke his voice was oddly calm sounding, but he was holding Naruto by the collar of his jumpsuit, his hand like a vice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t EVER mention that traitor.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sakura groaned slightly, groggy from all the early morning training she had been undertaking recently. But she knew well what the risks were for agreeing to become Lady Tsunade's apprentice, though she hadn't counted losing beauty sleep being one of them. Not that it mattered lately, since Sasuke had abandoned the village Ino had been leaving her alone for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree months it had been. Three months of torturous beatings from the Hokage. Three months of intense medical practices that pushed her chakra control to the limit. Three months since both her teammates, Naruto and Sasuke, had left to do their own training. Yet Sakura held on. She wasn't going to be left behind again, she wasn't going to be a burden or someone they had to protect. That was what she kept telling herself, but that didn't stop her resolve from falling short every early morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do these lessons have to be so early...?\" she mumbled to herself, already knowing full well the answer. Being the Hokage, Tsunade was extremely busy and had little time during the day to teach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that any the only free spots in her schedule were often at the crack of dawn or in the late evening. If she didn't feel that she hadn't already learned a lot, Sakura would have assumed Lady Tsunade was using these lessons as a form of stress relief by beating on her pupil. Each day opened new doors to jutsu and skills Sakura would have never have thought possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was no different from any other training day, except for the fact that Lady Tsunade had called for Sakura to come out into one of the open training fields outside the village. Usually this meant what they were doing was going to be too dangerous to perform indoors, the thought of another brutal beating only added to Sakura's grouchy mood. Still, she pressed onto the assigned training field, finding Tsunade standing in its center looking no more excited about the morning than she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you're wondering why I called you out into the training field today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Combat training again?\" she honestly guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grinned in response. \"Not quite. Remember when I told you how the best defense is a good offense? How a medical ninja must never find herself injured else the entire team will suffer as a result?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded, recalling the intense brawls that followed afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there will come a time when a medical ninja will find herself unable to withstand an attack no matter how powerful her offense is. In these situations, she is doomed to perish unless she can come up with an equally powerful defensive move that may save her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all seemed like basic logic to Sakura. \"But Lady Tsunade, isn't that obvious? I mean, you should hit when you can and block what you can when fighting, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True...But what if someone were to come at you with a move designed to destroy you even if you blocked it? What if someone came at you with the Chidori or the Rasengan? Even a light hit from either of those techniques will permanently put you out of the fight if you are unable to dodge it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...We're practicing dodging?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're going to be practicing absorbing the hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura winced in displeasure, thinking she knew full well what would happen next. Tsunade had to laugh at her student's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. Not in the manner you're thinking of. What I mean is we're going to be practicing a jutsu designed to dampen the power of your opponent's attacks so greatly that it will render the attack harmless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still sounds painful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not one bit, here I want you to come at me after I initiate the jutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade took a wide stance, making sure both of her feet were beyond shoulder length. She made three simple hands signs, Bird, Ox, and Dog, before Sakura felt a strange burst of chakra be released within her teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may attack me with your strongest attack, don't hold back Sakura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked, after being pushed around it was nice to finally have a chance to take a swing at Lady Tsunade even if she was her master and Hokage. Sakura prepared her fist, building up the chakra in the same manner Tsunade had taught her these past few months. Though she was no master at it yet, she could easily decimate boulders with the power that she had. There was no way Tsunade was going to get away injury-free after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a fair amount of power built up, Sakura charged right at her master. She swung her arm back when she was in range and closed her eyes as she rocketed it forward and waited for it to connect with her teacher's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no hard hit that Sakura was expecting. Instead, her hand felt like it had punched into something soft before rebounding back, sending her flying a few feet behind herself. As she opened her eyes and the dust cleared, Sakura saw that Lady Tsunade was standing just where she had been before, unmoved and not hurt in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm impressed Sakura. That had a lot more power than I was expecting. Good thing I prepared myself to take the blow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How..How did you take that!?\" Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't see it? Well, no matter. That's what today's lesson is for. You're going to learn how to do that today, or at least the basics. It might take you a whole month to get to that point. For now I want you to practice two things today, the hand signs I did and your breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...breathing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must I repeat myself? This is a highly advanced jutsu with unorthodox requirements, with any luck you'll be able to at least practice it the whole night. Let's meet here again after lunch sometime, I have a brief break then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was still confused but nodded, wiping the dust off from her blouse as Tsunade headed back to the Hokage office to start her day of paperwork. The young girl still couldn't figure out how Tsunade had managed to completely take that attack, she shouldn't have kept her eyes closed when she swung at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What does breathing have to do with it?\" She questioned herself.</span></div></div>",

After all, though she didn't use the taijutsu chakra enhancement for a long time, it still took it's toll on her energy. Her stomach happily agreed with her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the citizens were just beginning their day, though for Sakura it felt like the day was half over already. Stores were just opening up to the public, meaning her choices of cuisine were somewhat limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I wish Lady Tsunade didn't end the session so early...There's no where to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, many of the only restaurants available were for lunch or dinner only. Sakura's gut continued to growl in annoyance, demanding food and demanding it now. By stroke of luck, Sakura passed by a familiar blonde on her way home with the morning paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sakura!\" shouted Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ino...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? You don't look too good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura drooped her shoulders. \"It's nothing...Lady Tsunade ended our training session too early. None of the shops are open and I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno frowned. Ever since her teammates had separated, Sakura had been getting more and more depressed by the day. She was starting to remind her of Shikamaru. \"Well, that's no good. Want to eat at our house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want to impose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense! Breakfast just finished cooking and there should be plenty to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sakura could even give her answer, Ino grabbed her friend by the hand and started pulling her towards her home. She was determined to make her friend smile today, no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. This is really good.\" Sakura muttered between mouthfuls of oatmeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno cast a worried glance. \"Really? It's just plain old oatmeal, you haven't even had the eggs yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care...This is more than enough, thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura put her bowl down just as her stomach gave up an angry roar, suggested that she was not quite as full as she led on. In fact, Sakura's eating habits had been something Ino had been concerned about as of late. Every time she ate a meal, she'd always excuse herself early, never quite finishing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to eat more, girl. Skipping meals while in training is a bad practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't been skipping meals...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you have been eating like a bird lately, despite your stomach growling. Come on, I'm your friend Sakura. What's troubling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's wrong, just haven't had the time to eat lately. Got to train.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...You and I both know that when Naruto and Sasuke trained they had time to stuff themselves silly, even if they ended up puking it all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura laughed slightly, recalling the time they were in the Land of Waves and the ending contests the two got into. Those times seemed so far away for some reason, just thinking about it filled Sakura with a sort of sadness and realization. They'd probably never been the same food eating contest while in training kids again. It was as if everything had gotten serious all of a sudden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least I got a smile out of you.\" Grinned Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Thanks for the food Ino.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. Hey, I know what will make you happy. How about a girl's day out? I don't have any missions today and my parents aren't even home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura would have liked that if not for her training that would start up again after lunch. She suddenly remembered she hadn't practiced the hand signs or her breathing at all, though she wasn't sure exactly what Lady Tsunade wished her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I can't. I got to go back to train with Lady Hokage after lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's still a few hours from now! Come on, let's have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" She didn't have time to protest, Ino had already grabbed her by the wrists and pulled her out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a day that the both of them felt was well earned. They went shopping, did their hair together, cleaned and manicured their nails, flirted with some boys, and just relaxed. Ino tried her very best to make sure her friend was enjoying herself, and it worked. It took Sakura's mind off things, so much in fact that she had forgotten the things she was supposed to be practicing before her next training session. It wasn't until after lunch at the ramen stand did she finally remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That same day training ended and Sakura had gone to the center of Konoha to buy groceries. She was still pondering what her mentor had told her earlier about breathing. Even ninja academy students know that proper breathing is necessary to attain the focus to do many jutsu, but the way Tsunade said it it seemed as if there was something more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pink haired girl went into the shopping district to buy some food for dinner she heard a commotion. Turning to look and see what was going on she saw a group of villagers running away. Drawing near she saw a lone ninja with dirty blonde hair, he was tall and wel muscled, and was wearing a blank ninja headband. His eyes were bright but bored looking, his black and silver outfit attracting much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is that?\" Sakura asked another ninja, a chunin who seemed to be watching. The man shrugged, but his expression was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea, the guy literally appeared out of nowhere. I'm going to check it out though.\" he said before going forward to confront the stranger. \"Hey you, who are you and why're you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger rolled his eyes and started walking away, ticking off the konoha ninja off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I'm talking to y-\" he began before the stranger moved quickly, his palm was covered in darkness. The unknown ninja hit the man once  and suddenly he was covered and rocketed backward into a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde stranger then tried to go forward again, but this time Sakura got in front of him. She remembered she had a duty as a ninja of Konoha to stop anything that threatened her home's safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there!\" she said, standing confidently. She didn't have to beat him, but hold him off until more ninja came. The man looked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna fight me?\" he asked, his voice surprisingly lax and jovial. Sakura said nothing but focused her chakra to her hands and legs for combat she then attacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried striking him with simple and effective attacks, but he evaded and deflected them all quickly. After a couple minutes she realized her attacks weren't working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she want backwards though, the enemy used that strange jutsu again and tried to hit her. Sakura just managed to evade from sheer luck. She knew it wouldn't happen a second time and backed away. She couldn't evade again or take it head on...She was stuck...Unless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This better work..' Sakura thought, breathing heavily as she performed the hand signs for Bird, Ox, and Dog. She focused as much as she could and got an odd sensation, she assumed it meant the jutsu worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stranger's attack came in and...<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Such familiarity was unheard of, especially not from the usually gruff Tsunade when given her tendencies; so everyone seemed a little anxious when, once again, she stressed that their client for this mission was <i>very</i> affluent and that her family held a lot of power in not only the Land of Fire, but all over the Ninja World...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's feet hardly strung an echo as she traipsed quietly down the hallways of the Hokage Mansion, her small whimpers and otherwise didn't warrant anything other than silence as she fretted over her meeting with the nobelman's daughter. What would she say to her? They were both from esteemed families, Hinata had been forced into playing with many other children of noble bloodline as a child, maybe she could build on that? No, that was silly. No doubt that Lady Sanada was a woman about her own age now. Hinata never did have that spark for connecting with people the way that some of the other villagers did. Naruto especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh Naruto... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's thoughts began to wander gently into daydreams as she imagined a yorely Naruto dressed handsomely in a traditional kimono, herself dressed accordingly as the two of them sat perched on her family's grounds; looking upwards dreamily at the sky before their vision loomed downwards to meet eachother's gaze. They smile, look away bashfully of course, and then... only if he wanted to, they would slowly turn back to one another. His lips would curl upwards into a smile, one that brought itself closer to the matching pair of dimples Hinata's close-mouthed grin sported. His lips would pucker slightly, she would let her mouth fall agape as his tongue slowly-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>LADY HINATA</b>!!!\", Rock Lee's boisterous bellowing had pulled a reluctant Hyuuga girl from her innocent daily fantasy, not so much as to her annoyance as much to her disappointment, and rushed to meet her side. Unlike the aforementioned clansman, Lee took quick bounding steps whose sounds were left bounding off the walls and floors as he eagerly rushed to meet his fellow comrade for this mission. \"O-Oh, h-hi... Lee.\" Hinata said with a slight stutter, her mind still fresh with vivid images of that fictional kiss. \"Haa\" he exhaled, \"I am glad to see that I am not the only one who is so nervous about meeting our client.\" the dogbrowwed individual said rather boldly, referring to just how red Hinata's face still was after her fantasizing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh!\" Hinata exclaimed, if one could call it that, as she tentatively touched her face, \"I, um, its nothing.\" she said dismissively, \"So... um, when are we supposed to meet with the Hokage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea!\" Rock Lee said with unnerving confidence. Like, seriously unnerving. \"Wh-What?\" Hinata stuttered. \"But a man of such youth, innocence and purity should hold no reservations when it comes to arrangements carefully set by his superiors!\" he exclaimed with a fist pump, \"I shall rush ahead and ask about the location of our mysterious ward so that I may relay the information back to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis enthusiasm was met with a blank stare, not one of stupidity but one of patronization. Hinata was always more of a people pleaser. \"W-Why don't you just stay here with me until the others arrive, that way neither of us have to be lonely?\" Rock Lee smiled. Like, a normal person smile, not one of those crazy training smiles. \"Sure thing, Hinata.\" he said, happily partaking in the merriment that was Hinata's one-girl team. \"So, do you know anything about our client?\" Hinata asked after a second or two of silence. After all, how much was there to talk about with Rock Lee? \"I am afraid that I do not know any more than you do, Lady Hokage was very brief with her delegations today which is very odd for her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bushy Brow!\" came the familiar bark of yet another teammate as he trekked towards the pair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was Naruto. The jumpsuited ninja happily strolled down the hallways with both Sakura and Sai beside him. All of them had warm, inviting looks on their faces; though upon further inspection one could see a slight stain on Naruto's jacket and a slight roughing up of his cheek, which matched the whitening of Sakura's knuckles. Hinata giggled as she cleverly deduced that Naruto had stopped for an early lunch, Sakura found him and promptly punished him. And somehow Sai got into the mix, judging by some slight bruising and minor contusions. As Lee and Naruto met eachother with a fist bump, Sakura and Hinata began to commune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't know anything either?\" Sakura asked Hinata. The presence in the hallway wasn't one of idle teenaged gossiping; bent on spreading rumors (the absent Ino) and scaring the weaker minded of the clique (Naruto and Lee). No, the congregation going on between now all five members of the present party was one of honest intrigue regarding just who it was they were supposed to be protecting. Sai seemed to be keeping quiet, though there was no doubt he knew just as little as the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if she's some kind of princess?\" Sakura said brightly as her fantasies carried her away, \"Who wears pretty dresses, has long beautiful hair, and kicks all the local mens' butts when they try to grab her ass!\" Lee too, decided to join in, \"I think that this mystery woman is one of more lethal beauty!\" he began, \"One who has mastered every dangerous art of taijutsu known to mankind! She would wear a tight gi and a blackbelt around her slender frame, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Lee, lets not delve into your sexual fantasies.\" Sai said coldly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'd really like to stay far away from those.\" Sakura reaffirmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight commotion in laughter as Lee got all watery eyed before a foreign voice emerged. \"And I'd really like it if you guys would hurry up and get down to the dining room so Lady Tsunade doesn't blow a gasket!\" All eyes turned to face Ino Yamanaka, who had been absent this entire time; apparently because she had been counted present with the Hokage! \"Seriously, you guys are really gonna be late!\" she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor fear of blowing one of Tsunade's gaskets, all ninja in the room shuddered with anticipation and fear.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"Ugh... mpm... that was good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unfamiliar girl sat crosslegged at the head of the table opposite Tsunade. This unfamiliar girl was, most noticeably, quite large for a girl to have come out of an action anime. Starting from the top, this girl had a sort of powder blue shade to her brown hair, where the brown focused in the back and faded naturally to the color of a robin's egg. It was kept very long and in many tails; there was one big one in the back with two smaller ones directly next to it, which sat atop two ponytails that touched her rear bound together into a divided style. Her bangs were kept out of her face, mostly via clip, but a pesky strand of hair that always seemed to poke out had to be constantly readjusted and tucked behind her ear. Her face was beautiful, one of a china doll's given a few too many chins, and her skin had the matching texture of pristine pale; the life of pampering and avoiding anything even resembling work having paid off in its exquisite complexion. Her smooth skin rounded out over her made up face, done in traditional Japanese styling strictly for the meeting, and folded once to give the indent of a second chin. After that, her body fell to pieces. She had narrow shoulders caked in fat, her upperarms clearly defined as they tested the confines of her robe. Her stomach sat slightly away from her, almost as if on its own, as she leaned into her meal. Her bottom, grown wide from many years of posturing on plush objects, was thick and meaty; it bulged outwards even now as she sat atop the most comfortable pillows available to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Tsunade and Shizune were shocked to say the least. This woman was Lord Fuukuraida's daughter, his sole proprietor of his wealth but also the only biological inheritor of many powerful techniques. How had he, such an esteemed and proud man, spawned such a sloth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you liked it Lady Fuukuraida.\" Tsunade said happily as she signaled that her plate be cleared. \"Please, you can just call me Sanada.\" she said humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Tsunade said daintily as she nudged Shizune under the table. She outstretched her palm, to the onlooking noblewoman it seemed like nothing more than nervous twitching, but Shizune's eyes widened as she read the descriptive death threats that the absence of their team warranted. \"I-um, better go see where those kids are.\" Shizune said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need!\" Naruto's brash voice came clamoring into the room first, as usual. Sakura promptly bonked him on the noggin, as usual. \"Excuse us milady, but may we sit with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Tsunade said warmly, take a seat, all of you!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As directed, all six young shinobi took their seats around the dining room table. The Feudal Lady was already seated across from Tsunade, whose right side was filled with Shizune. At the entrance of the six young ninja, Sakura decided to take the seat on Tsunade's left side. Lee scrambled to take the seat to the right of her, but was cock blocked by a certain ninja in orange. Hinata did her best to work up the courage to even <i>think</i> about grabbing the seat next to him, but was herself foiled by the pale ROOT ninja Sai. Settling for second best, Hinata sat next to Shizune and Ino next to her. However once realizing that this would put her the farthest away from the cutest guy in the room, Sai, Ino quickly scrambled to take the empty seat next to the Fuukuraida heir and the seat across from Sai, putting Lee directly across from Naruto and a good gazing distance closer to his own crush, Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now that we're done playing musical chairs.\" Tsunade said, opening with an actual joke rather than her usual bitter sarcasm, \"I think we should probably get everyone started.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more observant of the tardy shinobi, Hinata, Sakura, and Sai, took notice of the fact that rather than waiting on everyone else to arrive the people present in the dining hall had already begun their meals prior to their arrival! Tsunade, Shizune, Ino, and the Fuedal Lady had already started eating! Aside from being rude, this act of indiscrepancy seemed to have occurred at least a good twenty minutes ago, judging by how little there was on everyone's plates. Except of course, for the esteemed Lady Sanada; whose already small amount of elbow room had been cramped with three discarded plates.This of course, was noted by even the bluntest of shinobi in the room. Even Naruto couldn't help but watch as this girl of no more than sixteen devoured her rations in a manner very reminiscent of his own! She didn't seem to acknowledge the arrival of her bodyguards quite yet, as she seemed so enthralled in finding the bottom of her plate. While by no means a messy eater, Lady Fuukuraida was far from the dainty eater that everyone had expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...\" Naruto struggled to find words as he watched the strange display in front of him, he raised a wobbly finger to point at her, but he was met by a matching pair of punches from both Tsunade and Sakura; their fists meeting between Naruto's whisker marked cheeks. Hinata wasn't too concerned with the table manners of their guests, especially not when Naruto's mortality was involved. Her thoughts on the matter were just short of something actually insulting, but those would never be divulged to those around her. Sai couldn't care less, he was simply flashing his smile blankly towards the Lady. Lee was abhorred at such rudeness from one of such distinguished background before realizing that this must have been some sort of eating contest and she was already swelling with the results of how much she had eaten. And of course, not so surprisingly, Ino's opinion came out as little snickers and giggles at the young girl's expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until after everyone was served that the Lady would stop eating, practically slamming her plate down onto the table and pushing it back with a heavy sigh of contentment. \"Ah!\" she groaned heartily, \"I have to say, you've got some pretty talented chefs at your disposal Lady Hokage.\" Sanada said haughtily, \"You have done an excellent job satiating my appetites.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, 'chept we're theh onesh shtill eating.\" Naruto grumbled to himself through a thick mouthful of grilled steak. Sakura, hearing his derogatory remark, nearly broke his femur with the swift sturdy kick she delivered. \"That's wonderful, Lady Sanada!\" Tsunade said in the fakest voice possible, \"Are you sure you wouldn't like to have a little more though, we have plenty.\" The royal girl thought for a second before turning the offer down, \"No thank you, I wouldn't wish to make a glutton of myself in front of your ninja.\" Ino snorted, \"Too late for that.\" she mumbled before she felt her toes crumble at the mercy of another of Sakura's kicks. \"Anyway, um, why don't you tell us a little about yourself Lady Sanada?\" Sakura said nervously as she desperately stretched her legs to keep everyone at the table quiet, \"If we're going to be spending so much time together in the coming months, I think we should all know a little bit about you to make your stay in the Leaf Village easier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe round girl's ego having been stroked successfully, she smiled kindly towards the pink haired kunoichi. \"Perhaps after dinner, young pink-headed girl.\" she said with a sort of social naivety that enraged said pinky, \"After all, you are all still eating, it would be very rude of me to interrupt your meals despite my already finishing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura grumbled something rather derogatory herself, much to the amusement of the still-recovering Naruto, before diving back into her meal. After only a few more minutes, everyone was just finishing up, when Lady Sanada decided to speak not of her life story; but rather to excuse herself from the bathroom. The Lady hefted herself up, inadvertently revealing that she bore quite a rotund bottom and an overall pear shape, and waddled out the dining room and down the hall. It was at this time that Tsunade decided to level the playing field and start acting like herself again. Unable to bear any more food presented to her, she scooped the remainder of her third plate onto the similarly stuffed Shizune's and brought her arms to the table in her usual business manner; everyone could tell by her furrowed blonde brow that they were finally going to get the low-down on their ponderous plumper princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright; for those of you who aren't very bright, <b>that</b> was Lady Sanada of the Land of Plenty.\" she said sternly, \"Yes she's quite heavy, and no she doesn't like being reminded of such. On that matter: Naruto, Ino, keep your blonde mouths shut during this mission. Do not in any way, shape, or form, insinuate that she is overweight or you <b>will</b> regret it.\" both addressed blondes gulped slightly as the listened further, \"That woman's father was Lord Ikeda Fuukuraida, one of the most wealth entrepreneurs in the Land of Fire. Recently he passed and left his entire fortune to his daughter, Lady Sanada. As such you six will allocate all time necessary to make sure that his daughter has an enjoyable stay in the Leaf Village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds easy enough.\" Naruto said confidently<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think that, of course.\" Tsunade said darkly as she silently commanded Shizune to finish what she had put on her plate, \"Lady Sanada is docile enough, but you mustn't let her attitude fool you. She's a little sheltered, so keep any and all bad news away from her, and she's used to getting her own way. Do what and when she wants you to do, or she might not invest in the Leaf Village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she sounds really important.\" Ino piped up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is. Let me put it this way, if she chose to invest in our village, all the debts I have accumulated will be filled three times over.\" Everyone at the table let out the same amazed whistle, much to the chagrin of their superior, \"Yeah yeah, that's a lot. Anyway, I spoke to her about living in the common house where most of our royal guests stay during their trips, but she seems determined to live in the city amongst \"regular people\". I can only post so many ANBU outside her door without her knowing, and unfamiliar guards rather than escorts might upset her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In short, I need you six to be the best friends that girl's ever had for the next six months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had their own take on the matter. Naruto was, in a few words, \"bummed because he would be stuck with this mission for so long.\" Sakura shared the same despair, but found peace in that she would have a lot more time to study with Tsunade. Sai was indifferent, it seemed to be just another mission to him. Ino was the most audibly remorseful, actually letting out a groan before being silenced by Tsunade's sharp glare. Lee took this with as much fervor as he did with anything else, promising to make this \"the absolute best extended time that Lady Sanada has ever spent in a village that was not her own!\" Of course Hinata was exuberant; red faced and blushing at the thought of spending so much time on a mission with Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was only broken by Shizune's hurried eating before Lady Sanada re-entered the dining hall. \"Excuse me, so what did I miss?\" she asked naively, looking around and sending her ponytails back and forth. \"Oh, uh, nothing!\" Tsunade said in her resumedly fake attitude towards the girl, \"We, were, um, just about to get another serving brought out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, I feel like I can handle a couple more plates now.\" Sanada said happily as she plopped her mighty rear down to the cushioned seat, \"I'll have my servants bring up another serving or two for everyone before I dismiss them to your order, Lady Tsunade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ino and Shizune groaned, two plates for each would mean four and six plates respectively! They weren't used to eating this much! \"Wait a second!\" Naruto barked as he pointed towards his Hokage, \"You get <i>servants?!</i> How come we don't get servants?!\" He was silenced with another quick kick and a brash \"Shut up, Naruto!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm sure in these six months, they'll treat you and your adviser as well as they have treated me!\" Sanada said merrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade could only laugh nervously....</span></div></div>",

While Ino was sure that Sanada wouldn't be too enthralled with walking anywhere for an extended amount of time, an opinion which she shared moments before picking up said Feudal Lady in a hushed voice, everyone was pleasantly surprised to see that the girl was in relatively good humor about walking around the village. Rock Lee suggesting a <i>handstand competition</i> around the village wasn't met with the same fervor; but that was to be expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, today was going to be an easy day of relaxation and fun. Something that most ninja don't get to do very often with all the maliciousness surrounding their lives, so they all vowed to enjoy it very much. It was a unanimous decision to begin Sanada's first day as a Leaf Villager to bring the portly young lass to one of the local restaurants so that they may congregate peacefully while banging out the dents in their schedule of Sanada's guided tour. Ino's ideas mainly revolved around shopping; so much so that she even forgot that they were supposed to be treating their client to dinner as well, and had to cancel her option of a jewelry store to make room for supper. As self-serving as Ino's plan was, Rock Lee's wasn't much better; his plans were to meet up with his sensei, Might Guy, and take her on a first-hand experience of the greatest dojos in town followed by an extremely hearty supper of super-spicy curry. Hinata seemed to be the only one with her head on straight about the idea, thus explaining why it seemed that <i>she</i> was the one who actually did her job of guiding Lady Sanada around the Village... albeit rather quietly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, um, this is the Shibusen, its, um...\" she stuttered noticeably as her shyness overtook her, \"Well, I haven't exactly been here before, but my cousin Neji says that the food is really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, despite it all, Sanada looked interested! Granted, her tastes were a little above those of the common people and so she wasn't exactly enthralled all the time, but whenever Hinata decided that something was important or interesting enough that she should know it, Sanada paid as much attention to detail as possible! Her interest first piqued at the Ninja Academy, having never been to school with other children before. After stumbling across the park, Sanada audibly lamented on how she had never actually <i>been</i> to one for an extended amount of time. And finally, here, Sanada was the most vocally interested at the Shibusen. \"So you come here to eat?\" she asked, sounding rather entertained with the notion, \"That's actually a novel idea, I would imagine that it saves you time rather than just ordering, um, 'take out'; would you mind if we stopped here for some lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though that was actually the plan, Lady Tsunade's words echoed simultaneously between each of the three shinobi; in that they should do anything and everything possible to keep Lady Sanada entertained, occupied, and above all happy. \"Uh, sure, that sounds like a great idea!\" Ino said in an over the top manner as she started towards the eatery. \"Absolutely, no doubt our bodies could use a bit of a pit stop!\" Rock Lee said in a manner liking to Ino's, though without any of the faux enthusiasm it entailed, and started after her. \"Wonderful!\" Sanada said with a happy grin, \"I've never had the pleasure to eat in an establishment such as this, forgive me if I'm a little green...<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n\"Yes, a third course sounds wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanada was \"green\" at the beginning of this meal, there was no doubt about it. It was made more obvious than ever when she waddled up to the cashier and placed her order there. Luckily Hinata and Ino were there to spare her the embarrassment and after many apologies, a proper waiter was sent to their table. Again, Sanada's naivety shown through when she had trouble even reading the menu, having no idea what and where to look for what she wanted; even uneducated in what classified as an entree, dessert, appetizer, and so on! In actuality, this was due to her luxurious lifestyle of pampering; she never asked for an <b>entree</b>, she asked for a <b>sandwich</b>, so on so forth. However everyone was there to guide her in the right direction and soon enough, she was ordering her own meals like a pro. Not that she had a problem with giving orders or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything started simply enough with normal conversation about the most generic of topics. Rock Lee, ever the people person, began with his long life story and his inability to perform ninjutsu and how Might Guy took him under his wing and his extreme rivalry with Neji Hyuuga and how Naruto inspired him and how Gaara almost crippled him for life but how Tsunade saved him and so on, so forth. Needless to say, Sanada was a little frightened of such a dark life story; having never been desensitized to anything more than a friend of hers catching a cold. Ino swept in attempting to salvage the Lee-centric conversation with a little bit about herself, but it really just became a narrative on Ino's life so far from there. Sanada was a little less scared, but a little more uninterested. It was Hinata who had the bright idea to ask <i>her</i> for conversation, and she began very much like the two before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe explained about her father, Lord Fuukuraida, and his many interests; among which was diplomacy between large nations. This led to many partnerships between many villages all around the ninja world, the Leaf Village as a pivotal poll in whether or not his very own land could come to fruition. Thankfully enough, the then-Hokage Sarutobi was kind enough to vote for his cause of establishing the Land of Shore which eventually became the Land of the Plenty after many years of specializing in shipping, growing wealthy as a village, and a congressional name change proposed only six or seven years ago. Sanada then went on to tell her a little bit about her own life; her childhood and how her servants had always taken such good care of her, the few friends she could call her own, and of her recently deceased father. Pleased of the interest her personal life seemed to garner, Sanada turned her attention back to Hinata; thanking her for the kind words and interest she had shown her before asking about her own life: namely if there was a certain boy she liked, to which Hinata could only turn dangerously scarlet and thank the Hokage that their first course had arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was a whole two servings of full-course meals behind them now; and Lady Sanada was only just beginning. Prior to their second course, everyone seemed to rise at once as if they were making their leave. Sanada innocently asked if they all had to use the restroom, and if such, could she join the two women as she too had to partake. Everyone chuckled nervously, but went along with her for fear of upsetting the sheltered client. This led to seconds after a quick pee break and then later thirds. Normally no one would have even dared think of three courses on such a strict dietary regime, but the customer was always right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRock Lee; having the most crazy, whacked-out metabolism available to him due to his insane training techniques, wasn't too bothered. In fact, this was just a little bit more than what he usually ate to keep a suitable amount of minerals in his body. He ate with his usual energy and only slowed down after about his second course was over. Sanada too, was just a little past peckish after being starved. She had eaten all the complimentary sushi rolls provided to the party, plus the mints, and even regrettably the wasabi sauce after mistaking it for a beverage. There was no issue of her being full here. However, it was Hinata and Ino who suffered the most, having nor a crazy whacked-out metabolism nor an ungodly appetite. Underneath her purple and gray sweatshirt, Hinata's belly rose considerably as it swelled taut and hard in her indulgence. And Ino, who had made the grave misfortune to sit where Lady Sanada could see her, had eaten all the same, <i>plus</i> anything that her client deemed \"oh you <b>must</b> try this\" worthy and stuffed into her mouth. Both kunoichi were ready to burst, far beyond their natural limitations for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" Sanada said with a satisfied pat to her stomach, \"I'm satiated fully, why don't we try going to one of those clothing stores that Miss Yamanaka mentioned earlier, I would so love to get some commoner's clothes!\" she said excitedly as she attempted to unwedge herself from the booth, \"And after that, why don't we take a nice visit to the park so Mister Eyebrows can show me those taijutsu whatsits he was talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joy!\" Rock Lee said exuberantly, \"I will make sure to wait outside the women's clothing store diligently so that no one may walk inside to peep on such vulnerable women!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No one quite understood what Ino meant when her explanation of their first day out with Lady Sanada; especially not when she warned them about how much she liked food. The poor blonde seemed sore all over, and feverish; almost like she was ready to collapse after her long day with Sanada. However she came back with a new outfit and a stylish pair of bar earrings on Sanada's treat, as she mentioned to Sakura an umpteen million times during their post-mission conversation, so things couldn't have been too unbearable. Sakura had to admit, she wasn't really looking forward to her day out with Lady Sanada. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that wasn't entirely true. She <i>was</i> looking forward to spending time with the obviously socially reserved heiress. Sanada looked like a really nice girl, one that Sakura would get along pretty well with once they got to know each other. Plus, it helped that she was getting a big mission payment, but that wasn't who Sakura was nor had it ever been. What she <i>wasn't</i> looking forward to was a long day out with Naruto and Sai. Sure it was funny for comic relief in hard times, and Naruto was really a sweet guy, but the two of them together- personalities clashing as they usually did- was just a little too much to bear; especially when someone as sheltered as Sanada into the mix, things had a tendency to get pretty hairy. Of course Sai wasn't nearly as socially awkward as he used to be, maybe there was still hope for this little rag-tag Team 7 and Lady Sanada after all? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, so just like the day before Sanada was met with her personal squad of escorts that would, as predicted, escort her royal rump around town. From everything that had been gathered in the mission report from the opposite squad formed of Ino, Hinata, and Rock Lee, her day was spent exploring the centermost region of town. No accidents or mishaps reported, aside from a mostly mutual lack of fervor and morale. Rock Lee even seemed somewhat... less psychopathology energetic after his day out with Sanada. Though, granted, Naruto did catch a glimpse of Rock Lee on one of his rigorous walks around the Leaf Village while handstanding. So there really wasn't any telling just what was up with Ino and Hinata; or their mysterious Lady Sanada for that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Sakura who had the brilliant idea to rotate their individual responsibilities regarding their Lady's security; instead of taking it quite as leisurely as the first group. Naruto, as the one with the shortest attention span, wasn't very observant towards the matter. Not so much dismissive, but it just simply required too much attention to watch every single movement that his overstuffed client took. Attention that was required to make her trip to the Leaf a fun one, so he decided to leave the analytical stuff up to Sakura and Sai and had the last rotation that required outside observation. Sai, being the least social and least attached to the mission at hand, decided to take watchman's post and remain somewhat aloof at all times, only taking the position of full-time tour guide when both Naruto and Sakura had exhausted their turns. As a girl who was relatively easy to talk to but still quite observant, Sakura would take middle ground and fill in spaces left by both positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was really a hard job keeping up the three separate jobs, especially when Lady Sanada asked so many questions at one time. And when she started remarking on the strong, physical build of both Sai and Naruto, it was pretty hard for them to stay out of the conversation as her chubby face grew red with innocent attraction. In short, she was just a people person! It was hard to ignore her! </span></div></div>",

It wasn't that he didn't enjoy ramen, he came here plenty of times with Naruto to have at least developed a taste for it. In fact, just about anyone on Team 7 had been dragged here so often that they could all had become quite the aficionado of the noodle dish. Sai was pretty sure that somewhere, even the native traitor Sasuke had trouble even looking at a bowl. But what had kept him from so readily digging in was his trouble balancing his two duties of escort and lookout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe balanced the chopsticks on his foremost fingers, unamused and relatively bored with the mission... of course he wouldn't say that; according to several of his books on manners and social etiquette, it was considered rude to openly disagree with what your friends thought was fun or necessary. Besides that, it seemed pretty stupid to openly dis the mission altogether, since there was no doubt in his mind that Sakura would wail on him so hard he'd be in a body cast for the next month. From what he had gathered about Lady Sanada already, it was plainly obvious that she was relatively harmless. From what background statements on the Land of the Plenty had gathered, it was a peaceful middleman between villages of all countries; so any attack on it or anything causing a disruption would be almost equally harmful to villages of all nations. So, that being said, an attack on the heiress hoping to cause a panic didn't seem very likely unless it was from one of the very few villages, towns, or companies so in-affluent to afford a contract with the Land of the Plenty. In short, her father's wet fingers had pretty much sealed Lady Sanada's safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that didn't do much for his predicament now, did it? He was still stuck here while all the really important missions went to waste. No matter, he might as well smile and bear it like usual. He took an obligatory slurp and turned back to his client and friends for a moment. \"Sai, if you wanna sit down, I can get an extra stool for you or something.\" Teuchi said kindly as he washed bowls in the back, \"I mean, you just look silly standing there halfway under those flags.\" Sai smiled, \"No thank you sir, I'll stand.\" he said in that couldn't-help-but-sound-fake tone of voice that most of his declarations came out as. It was true though, he'd much rather stand so as to get a better look at the ever-so unlikely chance at attack. Of course, he didn't have to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, the skyline that rose above the dinky shack that was Ichiraku's was just as safe and assassin free as could be. There was a large building right there in front of Ichiraku's, still had no idea what it was or who was in there, right next to another building that came up just a little shorter than the first one.In fact, the stand seemed to be surrounded by tall buildings, probably so as to make it stand out all the more. Anyway, a quick scan over all those windows would prove fruitless; there wasn't anyone in there. He couldn't feel any other chakra, but that wasn't really his talent anyway. To get a better look, Sai discreetly conjured up an Ink Bird to scan the tops of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Lady Sanada asked, her head rising from her bowl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was what?\" Naruto asked, \"You alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I just felt... oh never mind, it was probably just a gust of wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura kicked her pasty-faced partner as he stood. Obviously a sign to be more careful. So, with that out of the way, Sai was more than happy to congregate with his client and teammates for a while before the scout came back negative. And for a while, he was considerably more happy to be in the conversation; but felt a little left out as to his late arrival to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanada, Sakura, and Naruto were having a very similar discussion as the one Sanada partook in yesterday with her alternate escorts. One of backstories and personal information, the kind of drama that Sanada came to find rather interesting. Since she had never done much of anything with her own life, she got a real thrill out of hearing the exciting adventures of her new shinobi escorts. She, of course, started out with Naruto; she seemed to bond with him pretty easily. His story wasn't exactly the whole truth- more like a watered down version for a more sensitive audience- but he got the point across that, while he had hard life, he stayed relatively plucky and joyful. He went on to explain his stories from his youth, his early adventures with Team 7, and exaggerated exploits in a way that required lots of hand gestures, improvised sound effects, and left his ego stroked by the amazed expressions on Sanada's round, doubly chinned face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee hee.\" Naruto giggled as he thought himself the most awesome guy around before a swift face punch knocked him back down to size. \"That's totally not how it happened, Naruto.\" Sakura said darkly. Surprisingly enough, Sanada giggled wildly at the abuse of the fox-faced boy... much to his disappointment. \"Sanada! Whose side are you on?!\" he barked, pointing his chopsticks at the heiress. \"Oh, excuse me.\" Sanada said unconvincingly through her snickering, \"I, um- are you alright Whiskers?\" Heads turned at the adorable nickname. Naruto turned to Sakura, only to find that she was biting her bottom lip with a bright red face and a cheeky expression. \"Whiskers.\" she choked the word out before completely letting loose in an onslaught of laughter. \"What the hell?!\" Naruto barked back, \"Sanada, my name is Naruto Uzumaki; not whiskers! Na-roo-toh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanada, still giggling, tried her best to explain herself. \"Yes, well, according to this book that my friend Uryu bought me, I am supposed to give according nicknames to my friends to show that we are close with eachother.\" Now where have we heard that before? Oh yeah. Sai couldn't help but ask; it turns out that they had the same book! \"You see, so I named you Whiskers because of the marks on your cheeks that, well, look like Whiskers!\" she touched to said birthmarks with a hammerspace pointer, nudging a comically unamused Naruto's cheeks in the process. \"That's hilarious.\" Sakura and Sai said plainly. \"SHUT UP GUYS!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Sai felt that his scout had disappeared. The chakra connected to it was severed. \"Um, excuse me, I have to... use the bathroom.\" he said suddenly. Said shinobi discreetly passed a note to Sakura before retreating to an unseen position. She read it to herself: \"Sakura, trouble, I'll send a scout if I need you, Sai... PS: eat my bowls, don't want Sanada to get upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great.\" Sakura said flatly as she peered over at the massive pile of uneaten ramen Sai's negligence had caused...</span></div></div>",

Sai was shirking a part of his responsibility as a member of Squad 7, but the pink haired girl had to focus on downing all that ramen despite being halfway full and still having a couple bowls left. Still she had to eat quickly and inconspicuously. It would be no big deal for Naruto  because it meant that there would be more food for him, however Sanada might feel like her efforts to befriend Sai weren't working, and if word got to Tsunade they were all in for an earfull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura decided to eat as quickly and efficently as possible, chewing the noodles enough for her to gulp them down easily. What helped was how the ramen was delectable enough to encourage her to have more despite her ailling belly. Still she was filled with a strange contentment after downing several bowls, making her actually want more and wonder if Naruto ever felt like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the blonde with a devil in his belly button, he was starting to like Sanada a little more. Aside from his less likeable nickname and the fact that she was at least as big as Choji she was a pretty nice girl, and cute in a way. Still Naruto was more focused on his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanada and Naruto were still neck and neck when Teuchi returned, this time with his daughter Ayame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but that was the last of our stock folks.\" he said, looking proudly at Sanada. \"I never knew that there was a girl who could eat as much as Naruto, thanks for bringing her by Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it was no big deal. I do it for all of my friends!\" Naruto said, which made Ayame giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she a special friend?\" the previously fattened girl asked (see the anime, she actually gained a fair bit of weight for an episode). Naruto wasn't quite sure what Ayame meant by special, but Sanada was blushing even more than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Sakura began to wonder where Sai was he reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" he muttered to Sakura as he stood in his old spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it.\" Sakura muttered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Due to conflicting mission scheduling and a lacking in common interests, the kunoichis of Konoha never really got to hang out all together very often. Sakura was always one for a good night out once in a while, but she had more important things to worry about like training with Tsunade and keeping her teammates in line. If she was slack just one day in either situation, untold catastrophes could occur that would endanger the lives of others. Hinata was always way too shy about everything, she didn't really go out with anybody except Kiba and Shino. And even then, things were pretty tame. Ino, however, had long been looking forward to a day out with her girlfriends. Choji and Shikamaru were great, but not when it came to the ever-necessary day of feminine entertainment. Sure enough, this was going to be one epic night of girl's only fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno Yamanaka was the one to suggest the whole thing; she and Sakura met up on the bridge after Team 7's go around with Lady Sanada and gave a quick exchange of opinions about the girl. \"I think she's really sweet.\" Sakura said after a quick two person guffaw at how much their roly-poly client could consume. \"Yeah, but that's only because she is what she ate: lots and lots of sugary crap thats bad for you.\" Sakura gave Ino a quick, though crippling, jab to the arm. \"Ino! That's terrible!\" Sakura reprimanded the pony tailed blonde, \"Lady Sanada is a really nice person, you could use a little bit of that yourself!\" Ino rolled her eyes, \"Oh come on Sakura, Lady Tsunade's not around, you don't have to kiss her ginormous ass.\" she said dismissively, \"Sanada just needs to loosen up a little, have a little fun for once in her life.\" Ino continued, letting her cheek fall into the groove of her open palm as she leaned on the bridge's railing. \"Well, she's never going to get another chance  if its not here.\" Sakura said after a bit of silence. Ino wasn't a very complicated person; she was actually concerned that Sanada might get picked on because of her weight. If memory served, Ino had done a very similar thing for Sakura's forehead...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not tonight?\" Ino said suddenly, that mischievous look painted dead on her face, \"I mean, three out of four of us are free for the next six months, counting that fatass we've got four girls- one of whom is loaded- and an infinite amount of shops and stuff to do!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe Sakura was wrong about that last judgement of Ino's character. \"Ino, I don't think Sanada is really ready for tha- Hey wait a second, you just want to get her loose with her money!!\" Sakura hollered as she delivered another one of her killer punches to Ino's arm. \"Well maybe!\" Ino said teasingly, \"But you've gotta admit Sakura, all that girl needs is a good time, and she's never had anybody to do it with; the timing's perfect!\" Ino said slyly... Sakura could only agree with that. \"Alright, but no more making her buy you stuff.\" Sakura said sternly, \"We're supposed to be guarding her, not sponging off of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's quite a lot to sponge-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"INO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*** </div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Ladies' Night!!</i>\" Ino Yamanaka shouted joyously into the night sky as she led her three comrades about the hustle-and-bustle city of Konoha. It wasn't exactly Tanzaku Town, but the Leaf Village had plenty of things to offer up for four young women with time to spend. The enthusiasm faded slightly when Sakura proposed a budget on tonight's expenses, so as to not blow all their cash in one blow. Ino whined and complained, but they settled on a moderate budget that would satisfy all four of the girls. Hinata wasn't saying much, and neither was Sanada; this was their first girl's night out ever and Ino was kind've scaring them. But, never the less, things eventually got started with a simple trip to a standard restaurant to act as base for said night of feminine fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA late dinner (second dinner for some, the Hyuuga household ate rather early) was only the start of one of the best nights of Lady Sanada's life. Sure things started out a little awkward, but now that she had been around the village a bit, Sanada was inclined to make some observations from her rather innocent perspective; some of which the girls just had to find funny. That opened up a myriad of conversations; a good majority of which leaning towards Lee's freakish bodily features. They had lots of fun together and grew really close- and that was just before their meals arrived! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their waitress slowly brought several plates to the young women's table, Sanada looked at it with a sort of awestruck manner. \"Oh wow, this just looks fantastic!\" she said in amazement, reaching for her utensils so that she may dig in heartily, \"I had no idea such good food could come from anywhere but my homeland!\" Ino snickered, and she thought <i>Hinata</i> was sheltered! This girl had no idea what went on outside her bedroom! How drole! Of course, the minor distraction of food stopped nothing at the table. Their corner grew loud with laughter, mostly the buxom blonde's doing, and even got the young Hyuuga heiress to blow her swig of beverage out her nose! It was simply a great time to be had by all. However, as things died down a bit, mostly due to the raging headaches fueled by their incessant laughter, Sanada's appetite kicked in and she was ready to start actually eating. To think, the food in front of her had actually gotten cold!</span></div></div>",

One table away from where the Kunoichi and their charge were sitting and having the time of their lives, a girl in her late teens was busy rapidly pressing and spinning the sides of a metal cube that resembled a traditional puzzlebox. The girl had pale skin, brown hair and eyes of a similar color that were obsucred behind a set of round and rather opaque looking glasses, and was wearing currently wearing a black kimono with white swirls located in various locations across the silk fabric that looked rather tight around the girl's midsection. Granted, the bespectacled girl's belly was nowhere near as big as the one Lady Sanada was sporting, but it was deffinately noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhirl. Click. Click. Click. The brunette manipulated the box's intricate and artfully made moving parts, the motions of the inner mechanisms giving off a sound that practically defined a complex design . As the conversations between the four exuberant females died down for a little while, as the heiress' attention finally returned to her food, the girl sat the box down on the table for a minute and gave her fingers a moment to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waiter,\" the burnette hailed down a passing employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening miss,\" the waiter turned to face the girl politely. \"What can I get for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have the full rack of boar ribs. Oh, and for desert, some vanilla icecream would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course miss, your order will be ready shortly,\" the waiter gave a quick bow, before leaving for the kitchen to have the order processed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick. Whirl. Whirl. Click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA telegram-esq machine was quickly alternating between rapidy stamping a variety of simple shapes onto the sheet of rice paper below it. The device was currently sitting on a small desk towards the back wall of an undecorated room with no windows; giving anyone who entered the building the feeling that they were underground somewhere. Sitting infront of the machine in a large plush chair was woman who looked to be in her mid-to-late twenties. She had jet back hair and eyes, pale skin, and looked to weigh easily twenty pounds heavier than Lady Sanada currently was at the least. She was also wearing a kimono of similar design to the one the brown hair girl in the resturaunt currently wore; only in addition to that kimono, she also wore a ninja-village headband dipicting a mouth filled with sharp, animal-like teeth. Standing next to her was a blond woman who was slightly slimmer than the one who was sitting; though not by mutch. She too wore the same headband and black kimono dotted with the occasional white swirl, only her's seemed to be tearing at the seems slightly; it was evident that she would need a new one similar rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe machine ground to a halt for a moment, prompting the standing individual to pick up the sheet covered in random shapes and began translating the message to her obvious superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Romi has a confirmed siting on the heiress. She is under full time surveillance by a rotating team of six Leaf Ninja. Five chunin, one ANBU special forces member. Amongst the body guards is one Hyuga Hinata, first daughter of the famed main branch of the Hyuga family- another potentially high value target, my lady. Romi is currently on standby awaiting you're orders\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavier woman smiled to herself, causing her round face to dimple slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell Romi that she is to make contact with the heiress and her assigned guards. She is to befriend the group and insure that they don't suspect anything while those missing nin we hired prepare for the eventual abduction. Tell her to stick with cover story A; and remind her to match the Land of Plenty's regional dialect perfectly should the \"Lady\" feel a bit homesick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond woman reached over to the machine and began striking a series of keys; all the while the dark haired woman began sinking into a deep thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon, you backstabing old man, you will pay. Wherever you're retched soul might be rotting now, know that the Land Of Promise will be avenged. It will rise again; and all you're hopes and dreams you had for your homeland will be destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClick. Click. Click. Whirl. Whirl. Click. Whirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metal device was now rotating on it's own. Turning dozens of mechanical parts in unison as Romi rapidy scribbled down the response on a napkin that had been smeered slightly by vanilla icecream. After a few minutes, the device ceased to grind it's gears together, and the pudgy ninja quickly went to work deciphering the various blotts of ink she had made. In only a moment, she knew what had to be done. Fortunately for her, the four girls were still in the resturaunt; only now preparing to leave and head off to their next destination. Immediately, the bespectacled girl switched into the role she was to play and began sprinting up to the departing party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Oh! My Lady!\" Romi said with all the enthusiasm of a rock enthusiast catching sight of their favorite band member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of four paused and immediatedly turned to face the approaching voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why hello!\" The jovial Sanada said with cheer; still elated from the time she was having with her newest friend. \"Yes, it is I, the beautiful Lady Sanada- but who might you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Yes. Pardon my manners. My name is Romi Kato. My father works at our nation's embassy in the Hidden Leaf Village. I-I had heard that you were in town and I was hoping that I'd have a chance to run into you and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah,\" Sakura said curtly, cutting the bespectacled girl's excitement down like an ax to a very loud tree. \"You just happened to be at the same restaurant and at the same time as we were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Pretty lucky, huh?\" Romi responed with a perfectly practiced smile and nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you didn't notice the leader of you're nation until now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\" Romi responed with an over-eager shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Sakura- don't be so nosy,\" Sanada said with a grin; some of Romi's enthusiam over their little meeting clearly transfering over to the Feudal Lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura let out a resigned sigh. \"Fine, I suppose I am being a little to harsh. Look, uh, Romi, we were just leaving and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Oooh! Can I come along with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" It was the Lady's turn to do some cutting, and this time it was to Saukura's belief that this job was begining to be enjoyable. \"The more the merrier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Lady Masada!\" Sakura tried to protest. \"We know nothing about this girl-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I didn't know anything about you guys a few days ago- and we're already great friends! Besides, I'm sure a few ninja like you could handle the daughter of a diplomat if she became to mutch of a hassle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura angerly smashed a palm into her face, leaving a bright red mark that was clear for everyone to see. God, it was aggrivating how trusting Sanada was. Well no matter how fast she decided to invite strangers to come hang out with her, the pink ninja was determined to keep careful watch over this upstart fan of the tuby heiress. </span></div></div>",

I honestly thought I had you beat! You're amazing at this game Lady Sanada!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, thank you Box!\" Sanada replied with a glowing smile. \"You're not so bad yourself! It's just that I have so much time on my hands back home that playing chess is practically all I did before coming to visit the Leaf Village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura let out a weary sigh as the feudal lady and her hanger-on began cleaning up the third \"oh, just one more game, <i>please?!</i>\" that had occured before they left for their usual afternoon of sightseeing. Every day for the past two weeks Romi had shown up at Sanada's safehouse with an impossibly wide grin plastered on her face; and every time she showed up Sanada would insist that she be allowed to spend the entire day with them. More to Sakura's dismay, the bespectacled girl and the feudal lady had quickly become really close friends- as could be clearly seen by the fact that Sanada had recently nicknamed Romi after the girl's obsession-level need to fiddle around with that metal puzzle box of hers. Sakura couldn't help but think about how awkward \"Box\" was for a nickname, but if it bothered Romi at all, she made no indication of it. However, the nickname the pudgy burnette had recieved was the least of the pink-haired ninja's worries right now. She couldn't put her finger on what exactly seemed odd, but Sakura continued to feel off about Sanada's fanatic of a follower. Sure, her story checked out; Sakura had tracked down the Land of Plenty's official embassy in the village and found her name listed on the roster of the staff members easily enough- and yet she still couldn't bring herself to trust her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sakura!\" a high pitched voice belonging to a certain blond ninja suddenly hijacked her train of thought and crashed it into a metaphorical rock, causing her to suddenly refocus in back on reality. Waiting for her by the door was the aforemented Naruto, along with Sai, Sanada, and her favorite sychophant, Romi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe Sanada's right... Maybe I am being a little too nosy...\" Sakura thought to herself as she moved to catch up with her friends. Afterall, she had been closely watching the burnette from the time she joined up with them when they were about to leave the resturant several days ago; and overall she seemed relatively harmless, if a little <i>too</i> eager to be spending all of her time in the heiress' company. And, judging by the size of her gut, she likely couldn't put up much of a fight in case she needed to wipe the floor with her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, the day passed by as uneventful as the last few had been. They started off by taking her to see the massive carvings of the past Hokages that overlooked the entire city- which quickly devolved into Naruto talking non-stop about his dream to one day become Hokage for almost an hour. Since they had gotten a pretty late start thanks to Sanada's little chess session, she suggested that it might be a good idea to stop for lunch- an idea that was immediately supported by Naruto and, unsurprisingly, Romi as well. What Sakura did find surprising was that Romi, while still being significantly thinner than Sanada was, managed to match her plate for plate whenever they stopped in for a bite somewhere- no wonder she was getting fat. Though it wasn't like Sakura was one to talk, as her own red outfit was feeling rather tight around the middle as of late. Unable to refuse eating the inumerable ammount of food Sanada invited her to have at the risk of possibly offending her (not to mention incuring the wrath of Lady Tsunade in the process), she had forced herself to overeat with the feudal lady whenever she had too- and by the look of a small tear that had occured in her shirt fabric recently, the affects were starting to show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have got to find away to get around this,\" Sakura thought to herself as she rubbed her stuffed stomach on the way out of the resturant. Their assembled team was still slotted to serve as Sanada's guards for another five months or so, and if she had to continue to eat like this for that long...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, what's that over there!\" Sanada suddenly said as she pointed at a nearby poster that had been haphazardly tacked onto an otherwise featureless fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a notice informing everyone that the summer festival is set to begin within a week, and will last a total of three days\" Sai said matter-of-factilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds exciting! I've never been to a festival without Father and his assistants watching my every move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you haven't been to a party since you're dad passed a way?\" Naruto added in to the conversation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. The servants at the castle were too afraid that I might get hurt- but with you guys around, I'm sure that I'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap. Sakura had forgotten all about the festival; being far to occupied with her role as the heiress' escort to even remember one of the biggest celebrations of the year. If anyone was going to attempt something, it would be when the streets were flooded with people and it was all to easy to get seperated from one and other. The realization suddenly brought the issue of Romi's pressence to the forefront of the pink ninja's mind. She had to find something to either put her mind at ease or confirm her suspicions before the festival started; otherwise she was sure that something bad would happen. Only problem was, she had failed to convince herself on the issue either way, maybe if she had someone's help, she'd be able to find more conclusive evidence and finally be able to reach a mental verdict on the pudgy hanger-on.</span></div></div>",

If Romi really is up to something, she would have already gathered as much information on the town as possible- where the best hiding places are, what the quickest escape route from any given area might be, or which places have the loosest security. We can't try to spy on her while she visits Sanada's house because she's already seen the layout of the house and probably knows where someone would hide out. Not only has she never been to your house before, but look around- your place is huge!

The pink-haired ninja had made several persuasive points. Still, Hinata kind of felt that Sakura was taking her help for granted by deciding on using her house to carry out her plan in without first asking her if it was okay. However, insuring that the feudal lady was protected at all costs was more important than any slighted feelings she might have about being occasionally used as a metahorical doormat for her friends to walk all over, and Hinata quickly agreed with the plan Sakura had proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright, it sounds good. B-but how do you know that Romi will even show up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave that to me,\" Sakura said with a sly grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sakura expected, Lady Sanada was all too willing to accept an invitation to the party. Also as expected, Romi looked nervous for a split second upon hearing the news, but quickly recovered her usual psychophantic smile and tried to convince the feudal lady that eating out on the town was what she came here to do; afterall, she had spent her entire life eating in stuffy manors and <i>really</i> should spend as much time as possible enjoying what urban life had to offer while she had the chance. The tubby heiress of course was far to excited by the prospect of spending more time with her friends to take notice of the bespectacled hanger-on's words. Once Lady Sanada was on board with the plan, all it took was an offhand comment about how \"box\" should come too, and the heiress practically bombarded Romi with peer pressure until the chubby burnette agreed to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen news of the dinner party reached the ears of the rest of Sakura's teammates, they all reacted with various degrees of excitement. Rock Lee, of course, responded with as much enthusiasm as he did with almost everything; even slightly more than usual as a matter of fact, as normally his friends \"forgot\" to inform him of any non-work related social gatherings. The promise of a free meal was all Naruto needed to hear, and readily agreed to come just as quickly as Lee had. Sai, and surprisingly, Ino, took some ammount of convincing before they too agreed to join them at the Hyuga residence tonight. When Sakura asked why the normally extremely extrovered blonde girl would be reluctant to attend any sort of party, she only managed to turn red from embarrasment and mumble under her breath. For unbeknownst to the pink-haired ninja, Ino had actually outgrown her formal ware; something she found out the hard way only a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'll be there,\" Ino said with a depressing sigh. \"I'll-I'll just be a little late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello, Lee,\" Hinata said with a soft smile on her face \"Thank you for coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my pleasure Hinata!\" Rock Lee said; once again proving that the taijutsu master really had no concept of what an indoor voice was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata merely nodded and let the local workaholic walk inside. Arriving shortly after Lee was Naruto; it took all of Hinata's willpower not to faint on the spot at the sight of Naruto entering her home. The very idea made her red in the face, and Sakura wisely decided to intervene and let the Hyuga heiress cool off while she greeted the rest of the guests. The orange-clad ninja was quickly fallowed by Lady Sanada and the \"guest of honor\" Romi, who expertly mirrored the feudal lady's excitement at visiting the household of one of the most prestigious clans in the hidden leaf village. About an hour later- far after Sakura had expected anyone else to show up, another knock came from the front door, and the pink-haired ninja excused herself from the current retelling of whatever amazing feat that braggart Naruto had managed to pull off to invite who ever it was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, glad you could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's words died mid-sentence as her eyes fully took in the sight infront of her. Here was Ino- normally someone who was so obsessed with looks she wouldn't dare go outside unless she deemed her reflection to be perfect, showing up at the door looking like she just got dragged through a bull pen. Her new kimono (which she bought a few sizes to big for her to try and hide her recent weight gain) was smeered with mud in several places, her hair- normally in a neat pony tail, had come undone, and now lay freely sprawled out behind her, and finally, it looked like she had applied her make up on using her left hand, as it had obviously smeered while it was being applied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, this would be a cause of concern for someone like Sakura, but the image in front of her, coupled with the girl's longstanding childhood rivalry, was too much for the pink haired ninja to bare, and she immediately burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Ino!\" Sakura managed to say through the fit of laughter. \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look,\" Ino said with an indignant look on her face. \" I was running late a lot longer than I thought I would be, so I tried to get here as fast as I could and on the way here I tripped and fell into a really muddy puddle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue-eyed ninja shuddered as she remembered the \"tragic\" event. Thankfully, Sakura was kind enough to let her in without any more jokes at her expense. Since it was clear by that point that Sai wasn't going to show up, Hinata showed everyone over to the dining hall for the main branch of the family, where a rather impressive variety of food and drink was waiting for them. After undergoing their usual competiton of who got to sit next to who, which once again ended with a dissapointed Hinata sitting as far away from Naruto as possibe; and, as coincidence would have it, right between Lady Sanada and Romi. The pink-haired ninja hadn't exactly fared well this round either, as she had somehow wound up in between both Rock Lee <i>and</i> Naruto, leaving Ino as the odd man out and forcing her to sit at the far end of the table away from everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is great,\" Sakura thought to herself. This was going to be a very long night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as everyone was seated, Lady Sanada immediately grabbed a spoonful of the nearest dish and began pilling food on to her plate, with everyone else following suit with a much lower (or in Romi's case an equal) level of zeal. Hinata was rather surprised that the much smaller Romi had an appetite to match that of Sanada's, matching her plate for plate long after everyone else had slowed down or stopped entirely. The Hyuga heiress herself managed to pack a good four plates away, as she was far too distracted with trying to observe the bespectacled girl to her left to notice how much she was eating. It was only after Hinata felt a sharp pain in her middle did she come to realize exactly how much of a pig she had made of herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, dear...\" Hinata's face went red with embarrassment \"I hope Naruto doesn't notice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops,\" Romi suddenly said as she spilled a part of her drink onto the black fabric of her kimono. \"Excuse me, I should go clean this up. Which way to the restroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's through the lefthand door, down the hall, and three doors to you're right\" Hinata said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Sakura drop her fork and make a big effort over getting another one- this was her cue to follow Romi and see what she was up to. Discretely, the Hyuga heiress got up from her seat and slowly made her way towards the side room she and Sakura had picked out in the event that Romi decided to go hide in the bathroom. Once inside, it took little time for her to build up a little bit of chakra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Byakugan!\" Hinata habitually said to herself as the veins around her eyes suddenly rushed to the surface of her skin. Immediately, the walls surrounding her became clear as glass, and Hinata saw the puzzle box being held up in the bespectacled girl's hands. Only she wasn't the one moving it. It was moving on it's own; and making clicks that were very similar to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A communications device!\" Hinata said with a shocked look on her face.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since that deathlock between Sasuke and Naruto, Sakura hadn't quite been herself. Normally \"not quite herself\" meant a little spacey on missions or just general mopiness. She was prone to do that. But this was a different kind of mopiness, the strange disappearance of both former team mates of Squad 7 was a hard blow on poor little Sakura. She had described the event perfectly, when she wasn't bawling, and it was plain to see that Naruto had taken onto his own style of training in order to win Sasuke back from the clutches of revenge. This disappearance of one of the most important people in her life was crushing, but not impossible to remedy. However, one bad day with Tsunade and this new mopey attitude left Sakura with an ultimatum; \"People die in the battlefield, Sakura; you can lose anybody you hold dear in a split second. I realize you're upset, but if you can't focus, then your place isn't by my side or as a medical ninja...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, it was either perk up or pack up. Unfortunately the former far outweighed the latter and Sakura was left with no choice but to end her training with Tsunade. After the War, Sakura had been the one to watch first-hand at the fighting between Sasuke and Naruto; it tore her up inside to see Naruto fighting to bring Sasuke back to her. Ironically enough it was just to see her happy. But it left her desolate and miserable. Both sides were lost and taken to their respective corners for a miraculous healing session. It would take forever to recirculate Naruto's chakra points. And since Sakura hadn't learned that technique, there was no way that she may ease the pain of her fallen comrade while he lay in the hospital bed. No, it seemed that this blossom had shed its last pedal of usefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GAWWWWD!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura bawled heavily as she shoved yet another hamburger into her mouth. So far, this had to be at least the twenty-second. You can understand how hard it was to keep track of things like that. The pinkheaded girl sniffled and whined before opening her mouth wide again for the second half of the burger. She barely chewed, all she did was inhale! It was nuts! All those feelings deep down inside of her were being stuffed down with food! Burgers, pizzas, dumplings, barbecued meat; it seemed that enormous quantities of a myriad of food weren't enough to fill the deep hole left in Sakura's heart... but that didn't mean that she realized that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the months things began to change in Konoha. The trees that Yamato had laid as the village's foundation had come into full bloom when Naruto's Nine-Tailed chakra form swept through the town. Buildings made of wood prospered and flooded the land. The recently revived citizens seized life like never before, the local businesses flourished, and there was always a foreign diplomat here to celebrate the healthiness of the Land of Fire. The people grew stronger and hardier like never before; all inspired by Naruto's drive and determination. There was even talk of Lady Tsunade stepping down and opening up a healing center within the town so that Naruto may become the next Hokage... assuming that he gets better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething else, though only if you carefully observed the phenomenon, one could see the steady inflation of Sakura Haruno. In the rebuilding of the village, there were plenty of buildings left unclaimed; Sakura insisted on moving out an into one of these buildings soon before the tragedy. As the weeks passed, one more observant could see the increasing amount woman that went up into the house. Loud sobbing was heard almost nightly amidst a television blaring and the constant rustling of snack packaging. Occasionally the obscenely loud belch would reach the neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was all that was really left of Sakura Haruno. There was pity for her at the beginning, but it slowly faded as those closest to her lost hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now, it was her last chance. Ino Yamanaka, her best friend since they were little kids, had agreed to taking her out to eat. Of course, she hadn't actually <i>seen</i> Sakura in almost a year now, and she was a little wary when Kiba advised her that she should \"bring her checkbook.\". Of course now that she was seated across from the one-woman pity party, Ino completely understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura hadn't put on worry weight. She hadn't been eating out of distress . Sakura was just eating; and a lot by the looks of her. Ino could just tell that this immense lump of blubber wasn't her friend; the way she stared blankly at everything and the constantly tired look on her face. She seemed dull and unintelligent, among other things. She wore a strapless dress that tightly hugged her overlapping backfat, it allowed her stomach to billow out and rest heavily against her thighs. And her massive, tray of an ass was wide and wobbly. Completely out of control! Her triply chinned face was blank, though she seemed to perk up when she stuffed nachos down her gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, kept relatively the same since the war, was pretty much disgusted. She rolled her eyes as she sat across from this gluttonous pink pig, said porker stuffing herself without abandon. She blew the large singular bang out of her eye in contempt. Ino was so disgusted even think to look twice at her dessert; warning labels paled in comparison to the prime example sitting right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat your dessert.\" Sakura said sadly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?!\" Sakura suddenly hollered, \"Everyone else's left me! Tenten, Neji, Naruto's in the hospital... I'm just... I'm just lonely!\" she whined as her mass slid downwards in her booth seat, \"Lonely and fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Sakura, I just don't want-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat the dessert, Ino!\" Sakura said, now frantic and close to tears, \"Oh, what, you don't wanna wind up like Sakura Haruno, do ya?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up, Billboard Brow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name seemed to call back a bit of Sakura from before; she grimaced a little. \"You look here, we've all watched you sit on your ass for how long now, a year?! And all you've done is mope, cry, and eat. Well look at you now, you're a <b>big fat pantload</b>, and you've got to stop!\" Suddenly, the spark of Sakura was gone as her face flooded with tears. \"I-I know! I know that!\" Sakura cried, \"Its just, I-I need help! I need Naruto to get better! I need to get back in shape; I know I need all those things, but I can't do them alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe broke down crying once again, right there in the middle of the restaurant. Needless to say, it was pretty awkward. \"Look, Sakura, I could always help you out. We're girlfriends, that's what we do!\" Ino smiled as she held the blubbering whale close, \"I'll always be there to help you out. Always.\"</span></div></div>",

It took some coercion to wake up the girl, but with a hearty breakfast and a promise of a nice dinner, she begrudgingly rose from her comfy bed and put on some workout clothes, consisting of sweatpants that fit poorly due to her massive backside, and a long sleeved top that rode up and showed off her plump pale belly. After doing some morning rituals, the two made their way to an out of the way training ground, Ino's reason being that Sakura could use the walk and the fact that she didn't have to embarrass herself in front of any potential passerbys. After a rousing half an hour of Sakura complaining and moaning about doing physical work, they had finally arrived in the clearing, the surrounding area covered with trees, a few stumps and a few training dolls as well.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're here. Want to do a few warmups first before we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Look, I'm still not sure about this, why can't we start off nice and slow?\" asked Sakura, placing a plump hand on her wide forearm out of nervousness. Letting out a sigh, Ino placed her hand on Sakura's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nice and slow. Trust me, we'll have your kick-ass bod back soon enough alright?\" With a nod, Sakura agreed and Ino had led her into some stretching.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Ino simply gave up. A combination of Sakura's unwillingness to actually work out a bit, combined with the humid weather had lead to the platinum blonde to simply call it off for the day and let Sakura know that she did 'really well' for the first time. If any consolation, the walk back and forth was at least something physical that she did. Finally arriving back at her apartment, Ino was not shocked in the slightest when Sakura began to make herself a meal, using the 'healthy' ingredients Ino had bought the other day. With a sigh, Ino simply threw herself into the shower to wash away all of the sweat and small tears that she had amassed at the botched training session. After the long and hot shower, she changed and sat herself down next to Sakura at the couch. Eating a sandwich and glaring at the television intensely, Ino tried to think of anything that could convince her to have a bit more self control.  A small idea gleaming in Ino's mind, perhaps she could get her to address the route of her issues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naruto.'</span></div></div>",

It had only been a few weeks since she had seen the other blonde, he was well on the road to recovery and was looking quite healthy. The initial incident had left him quite scarred and injured and his chakra network was one giant mess. It it wasn't thanks to the Kyuubi perpetually maintaining his body that he was able to slowly recover a near unrecoverable injury. Tsunade projected that within a few weeks he could be released, provided he didn't get himself mangled by the anger-prone Hokage with another one of his little escape tricks. It was only around a ten minute walk to the hospital and Ino used the time to think of what she was going to say to the blonde. If she informed him of Sakura's current state, she would expect him to rush out of that room to see her in no time flat. If she downplayed it too much, then he wouldn't think her current situation was a problem. Still thinking over this 'little' problem, she reached the hospital and was allowed visitation to Naruto's room. Reaching his door, she knocked on the door and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Naruto, how you doing?\" she asked with a smile. Naruto, surprised to see that Ino had visited, flashed her a wide toothy grin. Examining the room, Ino saw that it had changed little since the last time she had visited. There were still the plants that she had given him to take care of on the windowsill to alleviate some of his boredom and there were a good amount of scrolls and books on his dresser that served a similar purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah nothing much, just excited for when I can start up my serious training again.\" said the blonde, flexing his arm which still had an impressive amount of definition to it. \"So what brings you here? Something up?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, it's about Sakura...\" she began, feeling that it would be best to lead him on a bit. She did feel slightly bad when she saw the panicked look on his face.  \"Calm down, it isn't anything to worry about that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what is it then? Does she need my help?\" he asked, his blue eyes shining with concern. Come to think of it, the pink haired nurse had only visited him once when he was first admitted, maybe it was related to that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say she's put on a bit of weight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Diplomatic relations between the Hidden Villages and smaller factions that littered the Ninja World have always been a delicate matter. Being the more powerful, Hidden Villages were looked up to with a certain amount of respect; not only out of courtesy, but out of fear. If, at any time, a Kage were to ignore decency and show out to the other Village Leaders by slaughtering a town and its inhabitants, there was little to be done about it. Kage's will was law, and shinobi were dispensable hardened killing machines who used the very forces of nature to carry out their mission. Fortunately enough, those elected to lead their villages were usually more levelheaded than that. Thankfully, when troubles were roused, it was usually the smaller villages attacking their dignified leaders- having about as much effect as a mosquito on a bull elephant; annoying, but nowhere near frightening enough to cause a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the desperate need to feel recognized or taken seriously, many small groups of ninjas formed over the years decide to present their case to a nation's capital and wait approval for recognition as an honorary \"Village Hidden in the-\" title. More often than not most submissions were rejected. It was at times that most would-be shinobi would take a hard look at themselves, train intensively and sculpt their skills so that they might be inserted into a crappy filler arc where they would show animosity to the slapped-together Leaf Squad, undoubtedly containing the ever-present main character of the show, and slowly be inspired by him and become friends. He then would go back to his Hokage and plead and beg with her until the Village was recognized as legitimate and all was right with the world. However, seeing that said whisker-faced goon had left the village with his trusted older gentleman companion for a three-year long training session, that wasn't much of an option. Instead, times got desperate for those looking for exposure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small group of ninja, having already seen the marvelous handiwork of Naruto and his friends and inspired by their camaraderie and natural talent, decided that the Leaf Village was a wonderful place for them to set ground on being a legitimate Village; having already been rejected by their home nation of Lightening several times in the past. So they sent a squad representing their best and brightest to show the Hokage that they were willing to not only leave the Land of Lightening but also offer their valuable services. They were, after realizing just how useless a Cooking Ninja utterly was, shot down like a duck with the hunting rifle that was Tsunade's sharp disposition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second, did they just say Cooking Ninja? As in the <i>same</i> cooking ninja that kidnapped Teuchi's daughter? <i>They</i> wanted to join the Land of Fire? The short answer is, in that order: Yes they did, yes that's them, and wanted would be the optimum word. After feeling the sharp sting of defeat, instead of sucking it up and taking it like the fully grown men and women that they were, they resorted to angry threatening and complaints to try and sway the powerful Sannin's opinion. This was met with Tsunade literally punching one of their so called \"best and brightest\" out the window of her office. That's a long drop, one that scared the other Cooking Ninja into submission. So they left disheartened and angry. Having been at least smart enough not to send a letter of confederacy to the Village Hidden in the Clouds before they were accepted into the Leaf Village, their people's homes for generations were at least safe from retribution of angry Lightening citizens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, their feelings were still quite hurt. They longed for the plentiful landscape of the Leaf Village, finding their cooking much more fruitful when it was made of the supplies from here instead of the savannah-esque conditions of their homeland. It made more sense that they should be allowed a place here, where their talents would not go to waste on such harsh lands. And, gosh darnit, they wanted security from those monsters that roamed the neighboring islands! To feel better about themselves, the remaining Cooking-Nin decided to, while they were here for the night, just go whacked-out crazy with some of the best sake in the Leaf Village. Anything they did wouldn't be noticed until after they left for the Land of Lightening, and they were at least notorious for not letting outsiders punish those within the country's borders! They could do whatever they wanted as a payback- and of course, their drunken little minds made sense of this little plan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***drunken kidnapping, lots of screaming from the now-sober ninja once realizing just what they've done, \"Can't turn back now\", cross borders with abducted genin***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dish ish...-chomp- rully good!\" a young girl's loud voice says as she fills her mouth with a large amount of steamed antelope meat. \"It doeshn't look like it would be...-smack- but you guysh are rully talented!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir captive, one Ino Yamanaka, was fully aware of her situation. There was no genjutsu placed on her, or some other ninja BS, no mind control, no matter how sweetly ironic it would seem considering her talent for brain-hopping into people's bodies, or anything else terribly cliched. She knew full-on that she had been kidnapped, taken from her village family and friends, on her way back to the flower shop after making a quick delivery to the Haruno house. Her captives had explained themselves several times and felt completely terrible about the entire predicament, even going so far as to assure her that she wouldn't be harmed by any of them or the other villagers. After hearing the whole story Ino was completely sure that her kidnappers were morons, alcoholic morons at that, and was sure she wasn't in any danger. At first she plotted getting back to the Leaf Village, but found the Land of Lightening just as inhospitable as the paragraph above stated. There was no way she'd get there on her own, and the Cooking Ninja weren't exactly keen on the idea of escorting her into a village that was no doubt blaming them. They'd die, every single one of them, slow and painful deaths at the hands of Inoichi Yamanaka- her father, and a damn scary ninja with lots of legends about him and the ShikaCho part of his team -as well as the rest of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat were some kidnappers to do? Make the best out of a bad situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey promised their ponytailed captive that, despite her title as such, no harm would come to her. They offered her the best hut in the village and to be treated to anything her little heart could desire. This meant cooking her meals, wrangling up some more clothes for her and then washing them once they got dirty, and generally everything else that would make a day at the spa look like a spit in the face. Deciding that since she <i>was</i> due for another vacation sooner than she was due for another long mission with her team mates (which would actually be today, had she had not been captured), she agreed on staying in their village for a while- at least until rescue forces came or an agreement was met between the two forces. As, if the Leaf Village openly crossed the Lightening border without permission (something they were not too keen on just handing out, being a feisty nation) it would be an act of war. Avoiding war was good, and Cooking Ninja knew that above all else. So, in short: vacation for Ino, hopefully Land of Fire citizenship for Cooking Ninja. Everybody wins except for the friends and family worried sick about poor little Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, back to where we left off; Ino sitting in her plush bed in her new hut in this strange village eating servings of delicious food brought to her by her very apologetic abductors. As usual, dressed in her purple ensemble sans the stylish wraps around her midsection and the armbands, she looked like the very poster child of comfort. Of course, while on vacation, one was taken to indulge a little in the customs of the people. How bad could that be in a civilization that revolved around food? After all, it beat barbecue after every training session with Choji and Shikamaru. Some diversity might just be what her palette needed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, trembling from the waist down, one brave Cook-Nin stood in front of their \"captive\" and braved the situation. \"N-N-No ha-harm will come to her, Lady Tsunade.\" a grown man trembled like a baby, knowing full well that this tape was going straight to a woman who had sent his best friend soaring out of her office not even 48 hours ago, \"B-B-But we'd like for our demands to be met. We await your answer, as does Miss Yamanaka...<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">sorrypleasedon'tkillme</font>\"</span></div></div>",

It was some sort of steak slathered in a special kind of sauce. The taste was indescribably decadent and yet it was hardly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idsh amashing, bud idsh nod enuff.\" she said munching down several helpings at once. \"Go ohn and make moar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but Miss Yamanaka, we've used almost all the ingredients. At this rate we'll run out.\" said one of the braver guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" she asked after finishing her last scrap of food. She gave that one cooking ninja a rather threatening glare. \"Well maybe I'll just tell Lady Tsunade about you starving me when I go home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone cowered. Despite Ino's protruding round belly, fattened calves, and triple chinned face showing that she was hardly starved the cooking ninja knew that as a hostage she had more credibility in the blonde alcoholic gambler's eyes than a bunch of cowardly chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Ok w-we'll just make something else for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tastier?\" Ino asked, or rather demanded lest her servants suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Right away!\" the cooking ninja said before scurrying away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno chuckled a little to herself before laying back on her plush tower and inspecting her body in a nearby mirror. To be honest she somewhat resembled Lady Fortune from another filler arc that Ino would rather not remember considering she was nearly smooched by an obese idiotic Elvis Presley rip off. The main difference was that Ino's fat was less shapeless and more well placed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer excess fat had culminated in her feminine curves defining them more than covering them. Her most prominent feature being her round, large ass. It was nice and large from all the sitting she did now of days, but her bust and larger protruding stomach were also immense. Although usually Ino would berate herself for getting so plump she figured it was worth it considering how great the food was. Everyday her serva- er, captors would make her food and fill her ever growing gut while she was pampered. Still that would get boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she fully intended for the cooking ninja to continue to feed her Ino wasn't going to just waste her time being all alone. She was a talented, willful, and beautiful kunoichi (if you ask her) and she had to accomplish something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was what would she do exactly? What was worthy of miss Yamanaka's time, effort, and attention?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In all actuality, it would probably be unfair to give Ino credit for this magnum opus of a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had during the course of her incredible gain, Ino was contentedly cratering the plush mattress with her ponderously swollen posterior as she merrily scarfed down whatever wasn't ceramic bowls or chopsticks that happened to be within an increasingly puffy arm's length. She, as per norm, dug in with ravenous gusto- her stomach long stretched to contain the ludicrous amounts of food that found its way down her throat. Her mouth spread open and wide, she somehow managed to stuff a hearty amount of rice and beef into each chubby cheek before choking the whole down loudly and repeating the process. Occasionally she would grumble something threatening regarding her \"lack of\" safety towards whoever might be in earshot, or when the mood strike her throw out an honest-to-goodness compliment, but for the most part the only sound that filled the tent was the contented sound of Ino's gorging; something of a cross between a quiet moan of pleasure in each bite and a squeal- topped off ever-so-slightly with a whetting of her now pouty lips and a sultry \"Hrrrumph\" when she managed to fill her tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't so much that Ino was a fan of being so greedy and gluttonous, as evidence had never pointed us towards that conclusion in the past. In fact, deep down there was certainly a part of her a little wary about such dramatic overindulgence. It was really the lifestyle that attracted her- food or no food. It was the deeper meaning <i>behind</i> the food, if you will. She had always been a bit of a Daddy's Girl, albeit a somewhat more brash ninja-y version of what comes to mind, so the concept of a little pampering wasn't too far gone to be believable. And in a village pretty much centered in the ways of the Culinary Arts, what other way was there to be pampered other than obscene amounts of cuisine? In a way, yes, these poor helpless Cook-Nin were slowly killing the once proud Leaf Shinobi with kindness, but there was definitely no part of her that didn't enjoy it. Her needs were met every day, she was well fed and coddled, it just seemed to bring out the inner prima donna in her naturally; and in whom wouldn't it?! So the more they brought, the more she ate. And the more she ate, the more they brought; so on, so forth until it was less of a \"they bring, she eats\" arrangement and more of a \"she demands, you bring, she eats\" autocracy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this wasn't to say that she had become some sort of ruler to these people in the short time she had been \"captured\". That would be completely undermining the Cook-Nin's rule. In fact, very few of the Cooking Ninja knew that Ino was even back there- swelling and growing unrecognizably fat -due to the very shame that the leaders thought it would bring upon the clan. They were secretly just hoping that this entire ordeal would just go away as soon as possible and they could ship Ino Yamanaka back to where she came from, all being forgotten in the process. However as the weeks became months and pounds became inches atop their captive's frame, it seemed to become much more of a pipe dream. As the days grew longer and Ino grew wider, the five Shinobi who kept this growing secret from their clan slowly began to give up hope on ever getting word of amnesty from Lady Tsunade and the Hidden Leaf Village...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was during one of these hopeless days that it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, again, nothing usual. Ino sat atop her enormous rump amongst her many blankets and pillows- saddlebag thighs and swollen rear flaring out from underneath her sitting shape as it fought to stay inside a once-loose kimono -while the leaders brought her platter upon platter of delicious food. Now of course, this food was nearly orgasmic to those with even the most typical of culinary palettes. But Ino, having been spoiled by much better, could only swallow it down as if it were a live cockroach; she knew there was far better for her to eat in this stupid camp. Slowly setting the tray to her side and dumbly wiping her mouth with the squishy back of her arm, Ino took a deep breath and let out a nearly contented sigh. <i>Nearly</i> contented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" she moaned, visibly straining to turn her neck to face her captors, \"This ishn't...-swallow- the best you've got, right?\" she asked indignantly, \"I mean, like... I've gotten way better meals than whatever was in that Bento Box before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this, that the youngest of the five (a dark-skinned woman who, had it not been for the special circumstances at play, would have lost her temper a long time ago) inwardly fumed. Actually, a little bit of outer fuming occurred along with it. She nearly lunged at the portly princess for one of her prized recipes being called a Bento Box. Considering the sheer size of it, the similarities between the two should be incomparable! She was held down by the senior-most chef in the room, who seemed to take criticism much better than his pupil. \"Of course.\" he said gruffly, \"The customer <i>is</i> always right, of course.\" he said in a very professional tone, \"However our current situation should be kept in mind when you hand out your reviews, Miss Yamanaka.\" The kind girl that she was, Ino could only turn her head slightly at the morose way he seemed to say the word; \"Situation?\" she parroted innocently, \"What, keeping me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a congregation of clearing throats, whistling nervously, and innocent humming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You see,\" the elder began, \"Before all of this started, there was plenty of food to go around for everyone in the clan. We, of course, got first serve so as to keep ourselves strong. Then came the women, children, hunting class, the working class, so on so forth, and things had worked out like that for quite some time.\" He then stepped forward slightly, \"However, in light of... recent events<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\"> and their appetites</font>... we've been forced to cut food costs so as to meet your... growing-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To keep you happy, we've had to sacrifice almost all of our reserves!\" the youngest piped up, \"Honestly, what was so hard about that?! You just say it, and its done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno looked down, pinching an inch of her fat bottom between her forefinger and thumb, \"Perhaps I have... gained a <i>little</i> weight from all the food I've been eating...\" she said, ironic in all sense of the word because as she peered past her incredibly swollen bust to see her fat ass, her third chin was almost visible in her craning neck position. \"But what's the big deal, can't you guys just ask for more supplies from the Raikage?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... Raikage A, he has denied financing our clan for years now.\" the one on the left to the eldest said matter-of-factly, \"Its one of the main reasons we wanted to join the land of fire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, somehow finding an unattended stick of dango to occupy herself with, absentmindedly munched on her treat while lamenting, \"Oh gosh, thash too bad. You know, my clan ish all about mind tekneekeshs. I betcha if I could -gulp- get into his head long enough, I could get him to sign that contract and you could get all the money you wanted!\" she said innocently, \"I mean, I could get him to say that you were the official Chefs of the Cloud Village or something... and poof! That's it. You're official cook people...\" she scratched her puffy cheek as the other ninja in the room looked to her as if she were the Holy Grail herself. They congregated quietly amongst themselves, practically drooling at the mouth, before turning back around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss Yamanaka, c-considering that you're obviously going to be here a while longer, though we by no means hope so, a-and assuming that you're willing <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">andnottoooutofshapeforninjutsu</font>, do you think you could... do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno's big blue eyes blinked for a second as she processed their request, \"G-Gee, I don't know... I guess, but...

It would be difficult to pull this off considering that collectively they knew practically no practical jutsu and their captive was in...Less than prime condition. Even so they were going to risk it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week of planning the Cooking Nin strode into the Cloud Village as if they were holding some sort of parade. Ten of the cuisine shinobi were struggling to pull a huge float which had a giant covered platter on it. In the forefront some of the Cooking Nin played a catchy tune while others drummed poorly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the villagers watched the spectacle. Some amused and glad for a bit of liveliness, and others a tad surprised to see the offbeat ninja back in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfidently they strode to the Raikage's manor, where a few guards appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What business do you Cooking Nin have throwing an unwarranted parade? And why are you here?\" asked a burly looking dark skinned man, sounding like a stereotypical musclebound minion. The dark skinned female chef from before, called Natsume, was chosen as spokesperson for the cooking ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she smiled and bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've come to show our good will to the Raikage through a grand feast, served by his humble subordinates.\" she explained, \"We promise we mean no harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guard looked he saw a the platter's lid lifted to reveal a veritable mountain of food beyond comprehension. It was no wonder the carriers looked so tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, he spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to check, but it should be ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Thank you sir.\" Natsume replied smiling as she went to close the lid. Secretly Natsume smirked, glad the genjutsu that she cast worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the guard watched the lid open she had cast it, making Ino appear as food. Some time passed before they were let in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it got tricky!</span></div></div>",

Built into the side of a mountain, along with most of the Lightening Village's architecture, the capitol building extended upwards and outwards in a conical fashion- resembling something of an upside-down seashell or perhaps an ice-cream cone. Blue in color and bronze in trim, the cone extended upwards until it rounded out slightly at the top, where more foliage was fashioned into a sort of 'fro for the giant building. And crowning the structure was another tower, curiously taking on the appearance of the Ohio Space needle towards the tip. Below and around, the village flourished and went about its daily business, doing its best to put the awkwardly assembled Cooking Parade out of mind as it clumsily lumbered its way into the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, about that. Its probably worth mentioning that in order to get up to this building you are required to basically climb a mountain. So, with that in mind, one could imagine just how hard it had to be for the six wannabe shinobi lugging around almost 21 stone of cumbersome Leaf Ninja blubber, only about two of which knowing just what was in their presentation to the Raikage. The others, now inside, simply walked along beside their comrades in a perfectly symmetrical fashion, keeping sharp for anything that might stop their plan. The village elder and his two most trusted disciples kept bells on their toes as they nervously peered from side to side, relishing the awkward glances from the occasional Cloud jonin wandering the palace. Inwardly they panicked at every slight bump inside their offering, easily losing faith in Natsume's genjutsu skills... which were shoddy at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, after what felt like a million steps (a quite possibly accurate estimation, regarding just how ballzoff crazy this building really is. Seriously, go look it up.) Those poor overworked cooking ninja were about ready to call it quits and go home, except that meant that they'd have to make all those infinity-plus-one steps again. Whatever food was inside must have spoiled by now due to the heat, magical cooking shinobi or not. But no, everything smelled just fine. Ripe even. Like the hotter it got in that platter the better. Being made of only the most valuable materials at hand (usually kept in reserve for special occasions around the village) it was practically a glorified sauna in there. Ino's now soft spongy skin wasn't used to even the slightest of discomforts, and she was dying in there! Her soft, flabby body was just going to give out if she didn't get something to eat- quick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, <i>finally</i>, they made it to Raikage A's door. They did all that panting, overworked people could do at this point: pant, wheeze, and weakly knock on the Raikage's door. Their leader, a ginormously muscular man with stark-white hair and crazy eyes who was (of course, as I'm sure we've all read the latest manga) shirtless and glistening with the sweat of a long day of training answered the door, looking very much like he was going to thank these wonderful citizens for their meal by biting off their heads and viciously raping their bodies. Of course, he didn't. He just sort of grunted, his frustration at developing his Lightening Armor clearly showing in his inhospitable nature, and gestured the cart in- having long been paged about their arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what would hopefully be the last time, several more men carried the disguised Ino into his office...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere she would sit for about two hours stewing in her own sweat while her poor neglected belly gurgled in pain. A, apparently so intent in his training that he had immediately tuned out the strange churning sounds coming from this most massive meal he had allowed to sit there, went right back to his training without a second thought. Of course now, two hours later, he was hungrier than he'd ever been in the last fifteen hours. His brother, B, would be out for quite a while. So why not have a nice peaceful rhyme-free meal for today? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the lid and nearly crapped his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, in the center of this fine platter, was the biggest ball of fat he'd ever seen. Her hair, limp from the sheer humidity she'd been forced to endure, fell over one eye and rested heavily on her padded shoulders that heaved with her labored breaths. Her stomach, going through severe withdrawals from not stuffing her face nearly constantly, had caused her so much pain that she was moments away from sobbing. She was, of course, naked. Oh, wait, <i>that's</i> why his eyes bugged out. You could probably guess that one so accustomed to constant comfort such as Ino would have taken off her skin-tight dressy kimono (that was really just cutting inches into her gut anyway) in an effort to cool down, right? Anyway, yeah, that's what happened. However, her massive stomach folding over onto her thighs kept her crotch warmer than Summer embodied, she was sweating in every nook her flabby body had to hide, and she... she just looked awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....\" she moaned weakly, \"H-Hello Raikag... Raikage-sama...\" she smiled weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, she was rustier than she had assumed earlier. Months of neglecting practice for obscene amounts of food would do that to a girl. <br>\r\n<i><br>\r\n\"The Hell?\" </i>A asked himself, <i>\"This bitch is hyooooge!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Can I... uh, talk to you about the... uh, Cooking Ninja? Over some... food, maybe? I'msostarving!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ever-hulking mass of muscle that was A the Raikage was caught off guard. There had been much better, more organized attempts at getting into his office performed by those selected few who managed to escape his murderous rampages; in fact, between now and their last plea of recognition, A had almost completely forgotten about those talented little buggers. Here he was thinking that they had been trying to butter him up with a nice meal, and instead they send the absolute strangest possible peace offering stuffed underneath a giant platter. There was no food, and that was hard enough on this muscled maniac's stomach. But to think that they had sent <i>this</i> ball of blubber to try and convince him? That's just poor planning and strategy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was about as far from an assassin as a kunoichi could get. So very young and so very, very wide for a girl her age. Pretty, for sure, but still. Her pale skin was a flushed pink due to the collected heat inside of her carriage. Her belly, a collection of thick rolls that heaved inward and outward rapidly with her labored breathing, was covered in a thin veil of perspiration that made her look damp to the touch. Her blonde hair, not exactly vibrantly mountainous before, had fell downwards due to the humidity of her breathing. Her single bang rested on top of her eye, leaving only one deer-in-headlights baby blue for A to see. Then again, at one time there was more of it visible. Her cheeks had grown so consuming that they had started fighting her peepers for space. She looked a little squinty at all times these days, due to that and in no small part to the weeks being hidden away from the sun in her hut where the Elder Chefs kept her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at him, he scowled at her from his impossibly large stature. It was a stand off between them, and there was no doubt that A was going to throw her out of his office in a manner reminiscent of her own village leader. In a rare moment of quick thinking, Ino's plump fingers instinctively <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">pretended she was holding a burrito to her mouth </span>formed the Yamanaka Clan's signature hand sign and concentrated all of her barely-used-at-all chakra for the first time in months. She felt it, the familiar sensation of floating. In what had been a long missed sensation, Ino's body was no longer weighted down by all the blubber she had accumulated in her lethargic overtaking of the Cooking Ninja's village. Her astral projection form remained slender and beautiful, the girl she had been before all this kidnapping mess started. It almost made her realize just quite how fat she had become, but her thoughts were interrupted as the objective flaunted its glistening mocha-skinned muscles directly in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flew in, as usual, but found that she was all but instantly rejected by him. It was a shocking feeling. Literally, the man's aura was so strong that it actually shocked Ino's projection. A foot over, her own body quivered in discomfort as they shared the pain. She tried again, and once more before becoming angered. Her time was up, and she was forced back into her own body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha.\" A grunted, a sadistic smile crossing his face, \"Yamanaka's huh? My dad told me about yer grandpa. Good man.\" the frightening man's smile was even moreso- intent to kill or otherwise, he was just all around intimidating. \"Yer a long way from Konoha.\" he said curtly, sitting down to face Ino, \"And I take it you're a patron of the cooking nin, huh?\" he reputably pat her sagging gut for emphasis. Inwardly, Ino fumed. Had he not been so terrifying, she might have just ripped off and then ate his mustached face. However he was pantswettingly so that she decided against it. \"Y-Yeah, I may be starting to put on a little weight.\" she said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those cooking ninja'll do that to ya.\" he said forewarningly, \"You can see why I cut their funding, couple years back they all but ruined more than a dozen perfectly good  squads with their cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But hold on Mister Raikage!\" Ino said, not entirely aware of the plotline up until now, \"M-My team mate Choji and our friend Naruto said that they've developed a miracle diet ramen!\" she said hastily, \"I-I'm sure they could work something out with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh'yeah, somehow I don't believe that they've quite gotten into mass producing it yet.\" A said flatly, obviously (to everyone else, of course) eying Ino up and down like a rejected pig from the slaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that a kunoichi was given two options. Option one was to suck it up and take it like the battle-hardened death machines that female ninja were supposed to be. Here, she would say that she understood completely and promise one last chance at acceptance before the deal was called off. Had Ino followed this plan, she would have gone back to the Chef ninja with her tail wedged between her overpoweringly flaring cheeks and ate them out of house and home until she was pawned back off onto the Leaf Village. Option two on the other hand, worked much more into Ino's strengths: drama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, out of fear of getting her face ripped off and eaten, was already a little misty eyed. Her stomach pains were terrible, and she had gone more than three hours without something delicious passing through her lips. She was emotionally distraught and frazzled already, but the fear of not even getting back to the Cooking Ninja frightened her even more. Because that meant she'd be in <i>here</i> with this scary s.o.b. It was here that she put her plan into action:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-W-Waaaaahhh!!\" she suddenly bawled, catching the emotionally reserved man completely off guard once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now hold up-\" he started, only for Ino to simply start crying louder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno explained the story, with a few minor details conveniently forgotten (namely her being the prime reason that they were almost out of food) through broken sobs and harsh snotty sniffles. Her body quivering, she wailed hysterically and cried loudly throughout the entire thing until she was through. A, having absolutely no idea what to say, was taken completely aback. \"S-So you say that they're running out of food?\" he asked, stuttering not out of sympathy, but of simple emotional discomfort at having a crying woman he can't sucker punch into solitude. Ino sniffled again, \"U-Uh-huh...\" she said like a small child. \"And if I don't fund them, they're all going to either die out or abandon their village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-Yeeeeessss...\" she said pitifully, \"Its so sad, buh-because the food they make is soooo good!\" she somehow managed to ignore the massive squishy cushions that her plump fingers brushed against, \"S-So do you think you could... I don't know... help them out? Help <i>me</i> out? All I wanna do is go back home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA was silent. He stood up solemnly and headed towards his window...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I refuse?\" he said kindly, smiling back at the still-blubbering butterball situated on the silver platter, \"You tell them that they've got a deal- and that they've got you to thank.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the chapter title reads it was some time later when Ino Yamanaka was sitting in her quarters in the Raikage's office building, her team of personal chef's from the Cooking nin had made her a worthwhile meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was living it up in the Raikage\u2019s office, having a blast. It was getting close to lunch time and the porky blonde was busy stuffing her face full of a sweet vanilla pudding, savoring every bit that the Cooking nin had conjured, and wondering when her next dish would  arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt had been awhile since her less than formal meeting with Raikage A, but since then many changes had taken place since then. For example the cooking ninja had finally acquired all of the ingredients they needed to make their ridiculously fattening meals. Oddly enough though they opted against this and began using the skim recipe they received from Teuichi and mysteriously forgot to use until now. With it they began concocting healthy and delicious food stuffs for the use of the Cloud Village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSurprisingly the plan worked and the Cloud ninja finally began to get something vaguely similar to respect from the other villagers, and attention through their connection who was talked about amongst the Cloud ninja. Rumor had it that she was some sort of jonin the cooking nin had captured to curry favor from the Raikage. Other rumors said she was a traitor with valuable information and was supposedly a great beauty. The less popular idea was that she was an overweight kid who had a few skills, but overall wasn\u2019t much of an asset. The truth was close to the last one, except she was only an asset to the Raikage as a bargaining chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ino held no useful info A could use her to get the leaf to finally give his village the Byakugan or maybe give them their jinchuriki. If they wanted they could also give her back and use the gesture as an example of good will among shinobi, possibly allying themselves with the village. Still Ino was unaware of this and was busy stuffing her already gargantuan stomach. As she ate several fresh slices of blueberry pie, Natsume groaned in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t understand for the life of her why Ino was still being such a pig. She was even offered the less fattening food, which by some miracle made everyone who ate it thin in a matter of days, but the offer was rejected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m too used to the way the normal food tastes. I like it way more.\u201d Ino  had said as she swallowed some barbeque and moved on to miso soup. Still Natsume was assigned to be her main bodyguard, and it was pretty much being her lackey, serving her food, and helping the blonde tub of lard to her feet so she could waddle wherever she needed to.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis sucks.\u201d She said. \u201cI hate being a grunt\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno heard Natsume\u2019s complaint and\u2026<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ino's twenty-some-odd inch around jiggling masses of upperarms slapped against her padded overlap of breast as she suddenly stopped eating, her pouty lips sticking out even moreso as her chin fought for space to scowl. Her little blonde brow furrowed as her expression, riddled with the debris of her last culinary conquest, twisted into a pout. \"Hmph.\" she said indignantly, \"It's not my fault your diet food is crappy.\" she grunted, placing her now empty bowl of miso amongst the other forgotten containers of her pre-lunch snack. \"I mean, when I've had all these great meals brought to me day after day, a girl tends to learn what she likes. And I like my regular meals.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course a little diet food couldn't have hurt. In fact, it probably would have helped. No, it <b>definitely</b> would have helped at least slow the great increase in mass that Ino's body had undergone (and was still undergoing). Due to a hedonistic lifestyle the pertained to as little movement possible from whatever brave sitting apparatus that she had overtaken, Ino's once toned body befitting of a kunoichi was completely lost underneath a sea of pampered blubber. Rough calluses earned after hard training sessions with Asuma and Shika-Cho remainder of the Team 10 Threesome in the Forest of Death had grown puffy and soft. Her hair, cut short due to her scuffle with Sakura during the Chunin Exams, had almost grown back to its former length but had yet to be placed in a ponytail due to the simply exhausting amount of energy it would require on Ino's part. Even her nails, always well-off enough, had grown weak and easily broken due to her luxurious lifestyle of no worries what so ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and of course on top of all of this, she was really fat. But that should really go without saying, considering we all know the title and purpose of this interactive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwollen and engorged with meals past, Ino's figure had outright ballooned unto ridiculous proportions. Had Ino ever stood much at all, and had she not had a massive cushioning between them, Ino's breasts would surely have been pendulous on her old body. Engorged and massive with fat, they swelled up and out until they simply grew too large to look over. Heavy and soft to the touch, Ino spent many a foodless hour or two subconciously exploring her new bazongas, having never had much for the boys to paw at back before this whole mess started. They lapped over the side of her upper-most belly roll and rested heavily on the next. Acting as a pagoda, Ino's relatively bottom heavy shape (if one could still call it a shape anymore) got wider and wider as one travelled down it. At her narrowest around the torso, once could just barely wrap their arms around her and get smothered by her melons (Natsume would know, on her more lethargic days Ino had to be hoisted out of bed and into the bath) and at her widest she was... well, very wide. Her fat belly spilled over her hips and completely censored her from the waist down. Censored her from any <i>hint</i> of any genitals, actually. Her doughy muffin top was squishy to touch and deep to poke. And of course the hips they over-rode were only an inch or two narrower, supporting a posterior that was unbelievably mountainous in its own right. Lumpy and riddled with cellulite, Ino's rear was just a large cushion for her to plop her enormous bulk down upon. When sitting, it spread almost half a foot wider than when she stood! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this was all lost upon her. Beyond the tip of her stomach, little else existed to Ino anymore. Oh sure, on the nights when she lay atop her mountain of pillows fighting through the night until her pre-breakfast breakfast, Ino would often fondly think of her home. Some nights she weeped openly about how she missed her family and team mates, even billboard brow and Naruto were on her list of those to-be-missed. However her worries and cares vanished when she was brought something nummy for her to choke down with reckless abandon. She would greedily indulge herself for hours as whoever assigned to guard her (usually the unfriendly Natsume) would watch in relative disgust at how far Ino had fallen. And of course she did so without looking back- metaphorically speaking of course, there was no way Ino's deep accumulation of neck fat or hanging chins would allow her to look back much farther than a half-hearted turn- or worry about her once girlish figure. She had simply grown too used to the lifestyle and had grown addicted to the rich calorie intake. In the few times she went without food, Ino was harsh and jumpy in her withdrawls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsume grumbled again as she watched Ino's bulk plop lazily against the pillows used to support it. \"Sure, whatever.\" she rolled her eyes and took a few steps towards the bulk, \"You done?\" she asked curtly as Ino's displeasured gaze travelled along with her every move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now.\" Ino said, her voice a little on the deep side due to the heavy accumulation of fat around her neck, \"Are you sure you're not giving me that crappy diet food?\" she asked breathlessly, still a little winded from her meal, \"It sure took me a long time to get full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, Cheif Natsukasa definitely didn't make you diet food.\" she quipped dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince being exposed to the great pampering that the Cooking Ninja had put her through in an effort to keep her quietly appeased, Ino's once only somewhat bratty bit of a girly-girl personality had undergone a full crowning ceremony. The slightest inconvenience was enough to turn her sour these days, so it was an understanded fact that she was either left alone during these spells or given something to snack on- depending on the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... I don't know.\" she said lazily, \"Could you draw me a bath? I feel a little dirty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just had one a few hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe I just want to soak a little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, even if she didn't want to, Natsume was <i>going</i> to draw that bath. Since realizing just how rusty she had gotten, Ino had picked up her signature jutsu once again. Every now and then she would abuse it for things that required a little more mobility than what she was granted, but boy did it tire her out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiine...\" Natsume grumbled, rolling her eyes and retreating to the bathroom</span></div></div>",

Natsume watched disgusted, as Ino made like a pig in mud; the blondes flesh slurping and practically absorbing the water in its fold. Now submerged in the tub Ino could move a little better than when given the full gravity of gravity. She closed her eyes, enjoying her temporary buoyancy while enjoying the hot waters bubbles as the caressed and cleaned every inch of chub. When she opened her eyes, she found her skin had turned a nice shade of pink almost like the color of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d she shouted at the poor nin Natusme who was on her way towards sneaking out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Yes?\u201d Natsume muttered begrudgingly beneath her breath and cursing her lack of \u201cBody Flicker\u201d jutsus (A.K.A The puff of smoke technique.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDidn't I ask for some beef and rice bowls?\u201d said the commanding voice of Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...\u201d Natsume said properly recalling the entirety of meals ordered over the day. She had just eaten minutes ago; she couldn\u2019t possibly still be hungry <i>could she</i>?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I am now! Get on it and make sure the inside is as pink and perfect around the middle as my wonderful skin.\u201d Ino ordered licked her lips at the thought of a hot and steamy delicious bowl of rice and cow.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Disgusted by such gluttony, Natsume did not give the customary bow as she went to put in the order, electing to curse as she left the room instead. \u201cThat blonde bitch!\u201d Who was she ordering her around like that? When was she going to get some time back to herself?  Hopefully she could sneak out for a bit while the \u201cprisoner\u201d (if you could even call her the prisoner now) was gorging herself. Better to keep her busy eating, than to have to do more of her degrading commands.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive bowls of Beef and rice!\u201d she shouted to the head chef or should I say head Cheif Natsukasa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive?\u201d He shouted in disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s more than I eat in a day!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFive.\u201d she echoed, simply shrugging. Chief Natsukasa mirrored the shrug knowing he didn\u2019t have a choice if they wanted negations to go successfully with Konoha. \u201cWell at least she likes my cooking\u201d he muttered as he started cutting up a fresh slice of beef.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later Natsume returned to the tub with the bowls in hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout time\u201d said Ino haughtily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease enjoy\u201d said Natusme customarily but through her own gritted teeth. Ino needing no sign to start eating helped herself. There was no way Natsume was going to stick around and watch this\u2026but somehow\u2026strangely\u2026much like a shinobi battle the vicious energy Ino was attacking the bowl with was drawing her in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick and fatty pieces of meat were instantly inhaled into a pair of pink massive cheeks, cheeks already rising full of rice to begin with. The grunt and gulps (or were they moans?) emanating from the pampered plumper were also not unlike those of the battlefield. The obese Ino was oblivious to her observer; too focused on fighting her bowl and getting more food to her stomach.  The beef was cooked to such a sizzled perfection that she hardly needed to chew. Ino loved the flavor. This was the food she\u2019d wanted and she simply could just not get enough of it!  Natsume saw as the first bowl fell empty to the floor, and then the second moments later. Wide eyed she realized the blond had already devoured half of the massive order. So much for getting away for some free time\u2026 That realization was when Natusme saw her future flash before her eyes; the spoil teenager in front of her eating and eating day in and day out, growing larger and heavier after every passing meal. Natusme would have to learn the multi clone justsu just to carry her around if she got too heavy! Quite the horrifying thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only there was some sort of change in the negations between the nations.  Something! Anything, was better than this\u2026Then as if an answer to her prayer a fellow cooking nin suddenly burst into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have just heard the news!\u201d he announced at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Tsunade sends no regards towards the rescue of Ino Yamanaka... so it is our duty to...\" the cooking ninja took a deep sigh as if forcing the words from his mouth with an unsteady feeling of growing woe, \"To keep Miss Yamanaka under our care until we receive word... be it positive or negative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room grew quiet as this nameless ninja's words permeated all those within earshot. He, the nameless one himself, already seemed to be rather down upon relaying the message to his chief and superior officer. Most of the common cook-nin, as well as almost all Cloud-nin, still remained in the dark towards Ino's \"captivity\", however his working directly for Chief Natsukasa had lent him insight towards the gluttonous grip that the growing blubber ball held on the Cook-nin as a whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chief shared similar concerns as his subordinate. Despite his people prospering in the Land of Lightening since Ino's arrival, her usefulness was all the more slipping. Granted, through her crying and cunning his people had eeked their way into being a staple of Kumogakure's diet, but her own diet was a steadily increasing slope of difficulty. And since he, his four most trusted assistants, and Ino Yamanaka herself had been promised residence in the Raikage's Mansion all Ino had done was grow steadily larger and larger while his workload grew heavier alongside her. Despite being the head of his people, he spent a good majority of time tending to his special diplomatic project and it was exhausting his frail body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever no one was more exhausted than poor Natsume Hojohoshi, appointed since residence in the manor as Ino's personal attendant. Anything she needed, it was Natsume's job to make sure she got it. And since most of it pertained to food, her cooking skills became less of an honored family skill passed down from generation to generation and more of a gimmick for Ino to abuse. And not only was it her job to cook, but whenever Ino needed to be hoisted up or assisted in dressing or cleaned or any other embarrassing task yet to come or to be mentioned. It was just awful. Ino had become a fully-flourished brat with a severe eating disorder since she had been abducted and Natsume was earnestly considering lugging the fat tub over the border herself... if it wouldn't have broken her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough no one seemed to be as affected as Ino Yamanaka herself. This was most evidenced when she took a full two minutes to resume feeding on her third bowl of rice, and further speculated when she simply threw the bowl to the side and yanked the next two together simultaneously. She seemed to be scarfing down the food angrily, as if it had done her wrong and she was getting revenge. There was no tasting, there was no pleasant moans of satisfied gluttony; only sucking down whatever remained in her bowl for her to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More!\" she roared from her seat in the tub, shifting her bulk and splashing around, \"I said I want some more!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss Yamanaka, are you-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm alright you idiot!\" she barked at the Chief now standing outside the bathroom with his eyes covered, \"I'm just hungry okay! Is that alright?! Don't tell me <b>you guys</b> are gonna forget about me too, huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Miss, I'm sure we'll here from the Lord Hokage in no ti-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And stop looking at me like that, this is in no way comfort food, you slack jawed pervert!\" she hollered as she tried fruitlessly to hide her dangerous curves with swollen (though still far too small to do anything but enhance her cleavage) forearms, \"I'm just hungry because you guys slack off too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOAR FOOD!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatsume stood in the kitchen with the Chief, still completely within earshot of Ino's developed windpipes. She recoiled slightly at just how loud that girl could get. It made her like her all the less, considering that she would have to put up with <i>that</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Lord, forgive me for asking, but what are we going to do?\" Natsume asked her trusted father figure, \"We must convince Lady Tsunade to take Ino back, why hasn't she responded yet?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder sighed and turned the rice, leaving it to sit as he stood; left weary and frail from his constant job of cooking. What used to be a labor of love for his people and cuisine itself had lost its appeal due to people like Ino Yamanaka. Those who just ate for the sake of eating and overindulgence. He is obviously overworked and tired and wishes for nothing more than to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not quite that simple.\" Natsukasa said wearily, turning slowly to his fifth-in-command, \"Lady Hokage has the entire Land of Fire to preside over. Judging from what I've seen from the Raikage, it seems like a stressful job... though our own predicament seems much more strenuous now, I'm sure that she will receive the message in due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its been eight months and we've sent seventeen letters, three postcards, and a video tape!\" Natsume roared, \"What started out as a simple quest to get into the Land of Fire to start life anew has snowballed completely out of control. Forgive me my Lord, but something has to be done about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am more than aware, Natsume.\" the chief said calmly, \"I am old, and tired, and my days are all but used. If Miss Yamanaka keeps treating us like this, I will certainly perish. Though I am pleased that she has grown to love our food, I feel that she has succumbed entirely to it and lost herself... if only I had more time. To make more people smile with delicious cuisine like the old days. To spread our lovely recipes to those who truly deserve them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that, believe it or not, brilliancy struck Natsume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You don't say?\" she said coyly, \"Do you think that the Lady Hokage would be more willing to listen to us if we provided her with a few samples?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natsume? What are you getting at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if we each provide a few of our specialties and procure them for the Hokage, she might see just how lovely our food is and how beneficial it would be to the Fire Nation. And as long as we <i>get her attention</i> she might even <i>take a few things back.</i>.. you catch my drift... erm, my Lord?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do...\" he rasped, \"I certainly do...\"</span></div></div>",

I mean that one with the beef looks super yummy!\u201d Shizune was busy practically begging at Tsunade\u2019s robes as she made for the trash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes earlier the diligent assistant to the Hokage had received a large package addressed to the Hokage from the Cook-nin. The package seemed to contain multiple boxes of bento inside along with a note. Said boxes had been sent as a last chance option to get the Hokage\u2019s attention, the hopes and future of all the cooking-nin as well as Ino, relied on what the Hokage would do next.  Shizune read the letter to Tsunade after she had brought her the bento filled crate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Great and Powerful Hogake,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease except this last offer of apology from our troop. We have made these with the very last of our draining resources and we only humbly ask that you try one box, and if you deem it fit, allow us to make more, not just for you, but the entire land of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and we promise to bring back Ino too, as soon as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigned the Chief of the cooking-nin</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was suspicious the offering immediately, anticipating the goods inside to be laden with poison, and so she was now just about to throw all of the bento boxes away.<br>\r\n\u201cShizune! Has all of your training taught you nothing?\u201d said Tsunade in her ever so strict tone. \u201cA kunoichi warrior and especially a Hokage must always be suspicious of gifts from rival clans.\u201d Shizune could only sigh as she Tsunade went to wipe the delicious looking bento straight into the garbage.  \u201cWait! C-couldn\u2019t I at least try one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Shizune but your too important to lose, and if you were poiso-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if we got someone else to do it? I mean you are the greatest medical ninja ever right?\u201d Shizune insisted, although this time is was more for the plight of the cooking-nin than the chance to sample some food. Her ego thoroughly stroked, Tsunade agreed under the pretense that someone else tried it first. Shizune quickly left and returned with the first ninja she could find, a very sour looking Shikamaru<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man,what is it now? Shikamaru groaned as he entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cShikamaru,\u201d Tsunade began, \u201cWe think we may have a lead on Ino\u2019s case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d a fearsome and urgent tone suddenly entering his voice at the mention of his former teammate. \u201cWhere is she! What do you need me to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, well we just need you to try this\u201d Tsunade said setting one of the many bento boxes down on the table before him.  \u201cShizune seems to feel that we should accept the cook nin\u2019s peace treaty and this offering, but I don\u2019t trust it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026You\u2019re\u2026 joking right?\u201d Shikamaru asked all intensity gone. Tsunade\u2019s silence and serious face confirmed that this was indeed no joke.  He sighed to himself, sometimes this town got too damn wacky. Begrudgingly and  after calculating that this was probably his quickest option if he wanted to get out of here, he picked up one the boxes before him and using the pair of  included chopsticks, he expertly tossed a piece of food that had been designed to look like the symbol of Konoha into his mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began chewing the food, Tsunade and Shizune watched transfixed as the ch\u016bnin's usual scowl distorted into a small grin. \u201cHey, this is pretty good\u2026\u201d Shikamaru said attempted to keep his cool. He took another bite and then another, eyes widening in awe of the foods incredible flavor. Tsunade then stood up and swiftly grabbed him, a pink glow suddenly emitting from her hands as she closed her eyes in deep concentration. \u201cWell\u2026 there doesn\u2019t appear to be any fast acting poison in these, an if they were using a slow acting agent it would have showed itself as soon as it made contact with your stomach.\" Setting the surprised Shikamaru down she went on \"Hmm, if they were trying to kill me they weren\u2019t being that stupid about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo does that mean\u2026\u201d Shizune began, looking to the Hokage for approval before she helped herself to that awesome looking beef one she had her eye on earlier. \u201cSure. Fine. Help Yoruself.\u201d Said Tsunade flatly as she sat back in her chair and slumped over her desk. It was actually a little disappointing that the food hadn\u2019t been poisoned. She could have declared that such poisoning was an act of war on the cook-nin and then swiftly sent a squad or two of ninja\u2019s to bring Ino back but, since the gift was apparently friendly in nature she was back into a political stalemate. Shikamaru figured he had served his use so he left, taking the bento box along with him as he silently left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune had found a box herself and was rapidly helping herself to its contents; her eyes began to sparkle as her taste bud began to savor the magnificent taste.  \u201cThish ish really good.\u201d She announced through a mouthful of rice to the unimpressed Hokage. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to try dish stuff! Here have some Ton-Ton\u201d and a she said this she placed an open bento down in front of the Hokage\u2019s pet pig. Ton-Ton began to scarf her own bento down like a dog does from a bowl, giving a chorus of oinks in approval as she started to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking two going on about?\u201d Asked Tsunade as she finally gave in and helped herself to a bite of one. \u201cThis is just regular-Whoa! These are pretty good!\u201d said helping herself to another bite. Tsunade was now eating with great speed, her taste buds exploding with rich and savory flavors. Shizune had never seen the Hokage turn this wild except for the extremely rare instances where she won at gambling.  Having tried only one a piece, they felt there was no reason they might not try one of every one of the pre-made meals that had been included, \u201cJust to check for poison\u201d said Tsunade rationalizing their gorging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon all of the bentos were gone to both of the kunoichi warriors shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we *hic* overdid it huh?\u201d said Shizune as she sat back in a chair, gut slightly distended from being so full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we did, *hic* but Shizune that was the best damn thing I have ever tasted. My tastes buds will never be the same. I must have more!\u201d Tsunade concluded resolutely. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI must\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The harsh mountains that surrounded the Land of Lightning were never really inviting to the neighboring villages. Almost like a big picket fence made of rocks with a big \"Beware of Tazer Effects inside\" hung over the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever in light of the country's recently suspicious activity of doing squat in the global scheme of things (not taking missions from outside countries, refusing to meet other Kage's for important meetings, and cutting off all trade to the outside world) it had become an unspoken goal between the remaining countries that they were going to find out just what was going on behind those earthen gates of protection that the Lightning relied a little too heavily upon. Time after time, ninja squadrons from all over the focal continent were deployed with missions that pertained to infiltrating the suddenly shady village. In the beginning alone only a scarce amount of spies returned, all with nothing to report that was out of the ordinary. Soon after that, the squads stopped returning at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd however unknown the predicament in the Land of Lightning was or had become, at least it's matters could be kept secret. For, as I'm sure we all remember the one insignificant cooking ninja that was literally punched out of the Hokage's office in the beginning of this whole affair, Tsunade had been dealing with her own problems as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong story short, said Cooking Ninja had survived. As soon as he was able to get up and about, he soon put his mind to regaining the cognitive functions that Tsunade's iron fists of drunken steel had knocked out of him. And from there he gained enough awareness to realize that not only had his team left him stranded in a country of whose leader had just attempted to murder the balls off of him, but that they had done such quite some time ago. With nowhere else to go, said cook-nin meekly cowered his way back to the office of said murderous Kage with his tail between his legs and desperately pleaded for a way to get back home. Tsunade apologized for their little dispute (an incident that several sake binges and a replaced window had completely wiped from her recollection) and promised that, when she had the time, she would work towards rounding up an escort team in light of his \"special\" needs of not being an actual ninja. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever as anybody who's at least made it to the pre-Sasuke's Exodus point in the series knows, between all the paperwork that Shizune has her buried under and an unhealthy obsession with booze and gambling sessions Tsunade barely has enough time to slack off and make herself interesting as a character- let alone balance one more mission on top of a mountainous pile of paperwork!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, as the focal point of our story played out, the poor abandoned cooking ninja (let's call him Y-Mei) stewed in his own feeling of abandonment and general uselessness- whipping up delicious meals out of what have might as well have been gruel and handing them out to the local children (he was slapped by many protective mothers) until his culinary abilities caught the eye of the ever-frightening ever-blonde and ever-hammered Tsunade, who ordered him at once to make her something delicious right then and there on the spot. After amazing her with his ability to turn a common stapler into an egg-beater, he jiffy-rigged up a downright delicious meal for the woman who had punched him through a window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you see where I'm going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, as it wouldn't be a quality weight gain story without it, the cook-nin became very much a staple in getting anyone in the Hokage's office throughout the day. Without her daily portions of ridiculously portioned meals, Tsunade wasn't exactly the happiest of campers. She demanded only the most delicious of foodstuffs for her consumption, things that would normally take hours through regular preparation only took mere minutes with the mystical magic of the suddenly-useful Y-Mei. Normally, since making such delicious food was such a time consuming process, one would have to weigh the want to the need of said cuisine. Not with this handy little bugger around! Tsunade had herself so stuffed at a constant stream that she was pretty much eating all day every day for months at a time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course, was bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only for her girlish figure (we'll get to that later) but for the village itself. At this point, the hype for the missing Ino Yamanaka had died down overall save for her closest friends. As such, people were getting on with their lives; the economy needed to be regulated, missions needed to be dealt out, and that damn cat needed to be found at least four times since Ino's disappearance. You know the one who always claws out Naruto's eyes on his first mission? Hilarious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever now that Tsunade's field of proactivity was dictated purely by the amount of food she had devoured that day, things became just a little unstable. Money was invested into wild gambles, the Ryu was no longer a countable currency to the rest of the ninja world. Businesses shut down while new ones sprang up constantly. The ninja academy suffered more than a few blackouts and no one was really going out and doing super-cool ninja stuff anymore. Times were hard thanks to this newfound gluttony that Tsunade boasted, and they weren't getting any easier with her just sitting around eating all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, on the off chance that Y-Mei's reminiscing over his home country had fallen upon Tsunade's usually deaf ears, the subject of the Cooking Ninja's occupation of the Land of Fire came up once more...</span></div></div>",

With his clearance, the two of them along with their tag-along Shizune successfully made it to the Village in the Clouds after a long, out-of-breath trek across the continent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to be left more out of breath when they were met with afformentioned crazy-ass stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, the first thing that someone would see on a dead-level view from the top of the stairs would be a chubby black haired lass awkwardly hobbling up the steps. Her round, doubly chinned face flushed a full red as her robe clung to her sweaty arms. As she climbed upwards, however, one couldn't miss the massively flaring backside that she sported. Only a foot or so short of being as wide in the backside as she was tall standing up, the booty-licious Shizune would be the first to clear the massive set of steps. Her breasts, quite generous in her more than slight obesity, were still not much to speak of when compared to the reverberating balls of flesh that weighed her down from behind. Her demeanor was the least affected by this new change in appetites, leading her to be the serious one out of the two of them- most concerned with diplomatic responsibility and keeping a reign on her now freely indulgent Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade!\" she chided from the top stair, bringing a hand to her swollen busom, \"You've got to hurry; the Raikage's acceptance letter said that he agreed to see us from 2 to 4, we've got to make it on time or he might not listen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar down below, almost two entire staircases. a loud grunt can be heard: \"Shaddap Shizune!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrown gruff and grumpy without her daily meals, Tsunade was going through withdrawls. Bitter and angry with everything, she was finding it hard not to snap Shizune's neck. She might have too, if she just weren't too damn fast for her. Yes, I'm leading to the fact that the near 350 pound Shizune was a challenge for a once proud, mighty kunoichi become Hokage. That was the point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResembling more of a living ball of bloated flesh than an esteemed ninja at this point, Tsunade's flight up the stairs was all but impossible to finish. With a massive, sagging belly that hung well to her knees, a full arm's length out in front of her, maneuvering up stairs was enough of a challenge. Her breasts too, grown twice the size of her own head, provided much strain to her back- much to her chagrin when she actually had to stand. What's worse, her overall girth and rotunditude didn't sit well with the narrower parts that led to the Raikage's office, her squishy flab getting wedged more than once as she was overall just as wide as Shizune's bum. On top of being ludicrously out of shape, this was no picnic for Tsunade. She would have loved a picnic at this point... oh her kingdom for a picnic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-Huhh- I'm coming!\" she spat back huskily after a deep inhale. In awkwardly deep grunts and waddling maneuvers Tsunade would finally make it to the bottom of the final flight of stairs, \"Ugh this is... so... hard!\" she moaned, her can-do attitude long spoiled through immediate gratification courtesy of Y-Mei, \"Why couldn't he have.... just... ugh!... met us at... my place?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune, doubled over past her belly in an attempt at catching her breath and exposing the shape of that massive ass of hers, chided her leader lightly, \"The letter said that... he'd only be accepting visitors from us... I didn't think that we should... that we should push it by asking him to come out to see us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why... why wasn't I-uh.... why wasn't I informed of this letter?!\" Tsunade's deeper voice bellowed from the bottom of the stairs, \"<i>I'm</i> the Hokage, I should really get these.... these things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were busy with a serving of fried chicken at that moment, I felt it wise not to bother you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-And.... and... ugh, these steps!\" Tsunade whined as she lifted one heavy leg up to the next level, \"And what is that.... supposed to mean you oversized heifer?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, as soon as we get back, I'm putting you... I'm putting you on a strict diet...\" she said coldly, \"Now move, your bubble butt is blocking... is blocking the hallway.\"</span></div></div>",

After all that stair climbing and managing to move their more than plus sized bodies into the main office room they noticed that the meeting room was actually the dining hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing a pile of food that looked as tall as the crazy ass tower Tsunade managed to run forward, enticed by the scent off food and began shoveling anything edible into her maw, chewing noisily. Shizune was only a bit more reserved and only grabbed one slice of cake (or rather her definition which was little more than half of the cake) and nibbled on it as she took a seat that surprisingly didn't break under her titanic tush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we wait for the Raikage before we start eating his food?\" she managed to ask between chomps, to which Tsunade gave her one of the worst possible glares.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet Shizune, it's his fault for not being present for his own meeting. Besides that I'm hungry. If he wants to gripe he can do it to my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I think I will gripe.\" said a somewhat familiar female voice. A few moments later the duo felt tremors run through their fattened folds as the stranger waddled over, each step threatening the integrity of the building. A second later none other than Ino Yamanaka, or some incredibly obese woman who dwarfed even Tsunade's rotund frame. She was probably somewhere above a half ton weight wise and by comparison made Shizune look anorexic. She tried her best to wear a smug expression, but food crumbs were around her massive cheeks and her extra chins. The Kage's robe was open though, to reveal her bear gut that was probably as big as a grown man, even open the garment threatened to rip open. Without looking at her barely covered backside one couldn't tell if Ino was wearing underwear, and her top barely covered her enormous tits that threatened to pop out at any moment. All the while she muttered under her breath about needing some more grub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino?!\" Tsunade and Shizune gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, but you can call me Lady Raikage.\" Ino smirked. The other blonde woman couldn't believe that her former subordinate was now on equal terms with her ranking wise, but the question was how? She wasn't even a villager from the Cloud village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell did that happen?\" Tsunade gasped, still chowing down despite her disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting story.\" Ino said eating as well. She ate with a gusto that even Tsunade never had.\"Actually I became a legal citizen of this village and...\"</span></div></div>",

Breathing heavily, the mountainous blonde bit into whatever several items of food could fit between her fat fingers before repositioning her cumbersome legs. \"Yup...\" she puffed curtly before taking another large chomp out of what now resembled a hand-fruit made of candy and fried dough, \"I told you... I told you that already.\" she wheezed stupidly, \"Why bring it up again? Just accept it... I hate to repeat myself... Lady Shizune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl before them barely resembled a ninja, let alone a trusted Raikage. To a spectator's point of view, it was understandably how such a rotund little wiseass like Ino Yamanaka had managed to outfox the Big Black and Bowerful Raikage. But then again, Tsunade's own thousand yard stares lately weren't that encouraging either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the end of the table, what Shizune could see past the food towering above the table, Ino had grown into a monstrous ball of living obesity. Sitting down, she was six feet across from roll to roll, and she had to sit two feet from the table; her belly still cutting into the edge. Plump hands, any trace of nerve or bone within them having been devoured like so many cakes they had led to the slaughter, sporadically went from struggling past their own top heavy upperarms in hopes of feeding Ino's gluttonous requirements to habitually lazing on one of her rolls. Her blue eyes, once big and exciting, had grown glazed and squinted not due to age but due to her suffocating cheeks with a set and sparing pair of dimples. Ino's chins had grown so engorged that the lowermost one had completely engulfed her neck, flab resting atop flab rather comfortably as she continued to speak in short sentences and stuff her kraut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a massive belch, momentarily halting her exhibition into cuisine before beginning again anew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an awkward pause between the three of them, only the sound of both blondes grunting, masticating, and swallowing breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... are you gonna tell us how?\" Shizune said impatiently<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a full minute before Ino had deemed herself full enough to continue on. Unfortunately it wasn't exactly the straightest answer. Apparently it took a lot more energy to curse out one's former superiors than explain the no-doubt extremely complicated procedure it took to impeach the leader of a ninja village. Good to know for those history reports. \"God, you are so stupid!\" she finally concluded, \"I don't know how Lady Tsunade even puts up with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Tsunade!\" Shizune whined, \"Are you really gonna let her talk to me that way?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet Shizune.\" Tsunade said aimlessly through her meal. \"You're just mad because anything you eat will go straight to your thighs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Lady Tsunade?!\" she hollered once more with a distinctly red demure.</span></div></div>",

Sakura couldn't help but watch, sometimes she wondered how the kunoichi could eat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko had just finished eating a massive meal while Sakura enjoyed a much more normal sized meal. The two had grown pretty close and spent a good amount of their free time together. This wasn't the first time they had eaten together at a restaurant nor was it the first time Sakura had seen Anko stuff herself. The pinkette really had no idea how Anko could eat so much and still remain slim. But she knew that it was only matter of time before her gluttony caught up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you don't cut back on the food you're going to get fat.\" Sakura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I \u2013UURRP- doubt it. I've been eating like this \u2013UUURRRP- for a long time, Sakura. If I was gonna get fat I would've gotten fat a long \u2013URP- time ago.\" Anko argued as she rubbed her big belly. \"You should order more food next time. Enjoy yourself! UUUURRRP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks. I'm trying to stay in-shape.\" Sakura stated, looking at Anko's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit your \u2013URP- self. I'll show you tomorrow at \u2013UUURRRRP- training how fat I'm getting!\" Anko said, a competitive grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take Anko long to prove Sakura right. It took her less then a month, in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh, guess I should've listened, heh heh!\" Anko let out a nervous chuckle as she observed her 215 pound body in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of her weight had gone straight to her gut. Anko had a big belly that jiggled and wobbled with every step she took, big breasts that that would jiggle and bounce whenever she jumped, a big ass that completely filled up any chair she on and was just as jiggly as her gut, and a round face with with plump cheeks and a small double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko grabbed the sides her belly and gave it a good shake, she watched as it continued to jiggle and sway even after she stopped shaking it. A large blush appeared on Anko's face. She couldn't recall the last time she ever blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Sakura is never going to let me hear the end of this. I hope I can still keep up with her during training.\" It didn't take long for Anko's optimism to return. \"What am I saying? Of course I can!\"</span></div></div>",

When I woke up I was in the other Tsunade's office. Does that mean that the other Tsunade is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tsunade began to struggle even harder out of the binding jutsu Shizune had placed on her. Shizune was startled by the sudden amount of resistance, but wasn't going to give up. She wouldn't rest until Tsunade was back healthy and obese again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Shizune would stop feeding her, Tsunade could tell her what's going on. Unfortunately she could tell that this Shizune was just as loyal and tough as her Shizune, which would make it difficult for her to escape. She wasn't going to quit resisting though, because she realized that the other Tsunade must be in her village. She was worried abut what the obese version of herself would do to her village. Judging from what she had seen in this universe, she could only guess that her double was as powerful as her, but believed that obesity was healthy. She might force people to gain weight like this universe's Shizune was doing to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunch was correct, because in her home Universe, the overweight Tsunade had awakened from drunken state in the alternate universe, and ran into a thin Shizune and realized that something was wrong. This Tsunade however, over powered her assistant by doing a body slam, trapping Shizune under about her fat. She also looked around and saw that everyone was was suddenly thin. Though she jumped to the conclusion that instead of being in an alternate universe, she assumed that some kind of jutsu had had changed the village while she passed out last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune struggled greatly under the Alternate Tsunade's stomach trying to figure out what was going. She saw Tsunade last night and she was her normal self, but now looked almost like an entirely different person. She had a stomach that could hold an entire cow, maybe even two. Her breasts were triple her normal size(and since Tsunade's breasts are pretty large, that's saying something). She had gigantic hips and thigh that touched. She also surprisingly had an outfit just like her old one, but it was clearly for a larger size. \"Lady Tsunade! What has happened to you? You're so fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're not! Something must have happened to the village last night. Everyone's suddenly too thin! Don't worry with some medicine and jutsu, this village will be on the right track in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hokage, what are you talking abo...\" Her question was interrupted by Tsunade sticking a vile into her mouth. The contents quickly entered Shizune mouth, and she unwittingly drank it down. Soon her thoughts became cloudy and she began to relax, despite still feeling the pressure of the hefty Tsunade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade got off her assistant and said \"Sorry about that Shizune, but what ever jutsu affecting the village seems to be affecting everyone's minds as well as their bodies. I normally don't like resorting to using my special hypnotic medicine, but there's no way you'd listen to me while the jutsu's still affecting you. But don't worry once I've fixed the village, you'll all be back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hypnotized Shizune only nodded in agreement. The medicine did it's job and now, Shizune was even more loyal to Tsunade, and wouldn't question her. She would be helping Tsunade fatten the village under the influence of the medicine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After things had settled a bit, namely her own stomach, Tsunade began to formulate her plan is restoring her village to its status quo. First she figured out that she could not simply out the truth of the true form of the settlement. the strong jutsu used to reverse their weights could have severe mental backlash. Second, this must be done subtle as well, no opening up several buffets and calling it a day. Lastly she must also hide her true appearance.  If anyone else other then those who are under her control discover her true weight, it could lead to many troublesome problems arising.  Sitting down at her desk, the narrow chair cutting into her generous lower figure, the fat spilling from every conceivable position, she formed a few hand signs and in a puff of smoke appeared Tsunade in her 'normal' appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that this is settled, Shizune, here is what I want you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nNaruto walked the path towards the Hokage's office, his mind wondering exactly why he was being called. It was rather quiet of late and despite his own haughty nature, the teen did appreciate breaks from time to time. Reaching the doors, he was let up as usual by the guardsmen and made the small trek up the stairs. Awaiting him at the entrance of to her office was the ever kind Shizune at her desk, simply munching away on a bag of chips. This was to be seen as normal behavior to the common folk. but it was part of Tsunade's plan. After all, what was more dangerous then careless snacking?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shizune, Tsunade is expecting me right?\" he asked. The older girl looked up from her own paperwork and properly greeted Naruto. She had a feeling that Naruto would enjoy what Tsunade was going to assign for him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and you can go right in. Let me be the first and say have fun!\" This was said with an added giggle, an action that confused the 'fox boy.' Since when did Shizune giggle like young girl?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right thanks,\" was his response as he entered the room. Shizune went back to filling out her paperwork. While she found this boring, it was necessary for the well-being of the village.  Digging back into her bag of chips, she frowned when she reached the bottom. Quite quickly she trashed it in her bin and pulled out one more from her drawer. The job as the Hokage's assistant was tiring so she needed as much energy as she needed, or that is what she 'thought.' Clearly still under the affects of Tsunade's control, the fact that she was not bothered by a small layer of fat caking to her stomach was quite the surprise for her. Continuing on with her work and snacking, she began to prepare the paperwork for the arrival of a few new eateries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nNaruto entered her office, the sounds of snoring could be heard. He gave a soft smile, she always seemed so cute when she fell asleep at her desk. Slowly walking over, he gently shook her shoulder.  A groan escaped her lips, the drowsy feeling still encompassing her being. Looking up to what startled her sleeping form, she realized that Naruto was here, a key part of her grand plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Naruto, pardon me, I was up all last night with paperwork and whatnot.\" she said, letting out a big yawn.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's fine. So Grandma, what's going on? Do you have a mission for me, or is there some Intel?\" Tsunade had noticed that Naruto seemed a bit less eager then usual. Perhaps he had been affected as well? From what she remembered, Naruto, as a male, had a fit figure; it was partially thanks to his rigorous training regiment and his special 'tenant.' Her 'Naruto' also has managed to form a relationship with her 'Sakura.' The pink haired medic in this new world seemed to forget all about the time she had spent with the blond shinobi which disheartened the leader immensely.  First messing with their figures and now erasing private relationships? If Tsunade ever found the person or group to do this, she would have some 'fun' teaching them about anatomy.  For now she needed to get both Naruto and Sakura, her most loyal shinobi to back her up on her plan. Unfortunately for her, the Kyuubi would prevent her from any attempt of controlling the teen in the same way that Shizune was controlled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, there's something I must address with you. Lately Sakura, my darling medic, has been stressed out lately. I keep telling her to ease up on the shifts at the hospital, but she won't listen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Sakura is always a hard worker, but I doubt she would take on more than she can handle.\" his thoughts flew to his pink haired teammate, the one who he had been enamored with for quite some time. Though as of late, she did seem to be somewhat distant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is most likely a reason for this, but I'm just worried. I do consider you and Sakura to be my family after all.\" Her touching words never failed to pull Naruto at his heartstrings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want me to do? If Sakura doesn't listen to you, then I doubt I'll have more luck with that.\"  Out of all the Rookie 10, Sakura was the most adverse towards listening to what he had to say. Granted he is an air-head a majority of the time, but he could prove himself to be cunning every once in a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I want you to take her out, you know, show her out to town ,turn up that Uzumaki charm. I want you to show her a good time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?\"</span></div></div>",

I really needed a break from work.\" said Sakura with a hint of red on her face, a shade a tad bit higher from her normal cotton candy colored hair. After receiving the suggestion from his Hokage, Naruto nervously went over to Sakura's apartment, flowers in hand and asked the fatigued girl if she had wanted to accompany him for dinner. Thinking it over, the girl decided after some subliminal suggestions courtesy of Tsunade. They found themselves at a nice barbeque restaurant, not too pricy and not to casual, both of them had been there a few times but never together. Seated at a booth, the small talk was abundant and the two waited for their meat to cook on the little grill implanted into their table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Sakura. I just noticed how hard you were working at the hospital and figured you needed a little break y'know. So tonight its all about you, feel free to ask for whatever; I have it covered. exclaimed the blonde with a wide smile plastered on that whiskered face of his. To be honest he was less concerned with his standing with Sakura and more on her well-being. Sakura returned the gesture with a bashful smile but it dimmed when she realized that he had dropped the endearing honorific he had used since they were young. \"If you insist, howabout getting some pork and some bowls of miso soup?\" <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAround an hour later their meal was finished, both of them were rather satisfied and Sakura herself was rather stuffed. She had long since moved from sitting across the booth to sitting next to her date. Placing her head on his shoulder, her eyes were closed as she felt rather sleepy after her large meal but for some reasons, she still felt like she could go for a bit more food. Naruto was rather content that the girl was this close to him, but he was happier that she was relaxed. His arm had reach around and wrapped around her midsection, gently rubbing her soft middle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto why don't we go somewhere for a little desert?\" Something told Naruto he needed to say yes. </span></div></div>",

Did that ole Uzumaki charm do any good?\" asked the blonde woman, sitting in her grand office currently munching on a small turkey leg. Naruto though the snacking was somewhat weird, but he figured she simply skipped a meal or two. From her words, he began to recall his time spent with his crush in the past few days. While not spending money on food for her, they hanged out in their apartments simply talking and getting to know each other better. Since the new Tsunade arrived in their world, missions were rather rare and she proclaimed that the village deserved a little time off. In reality it wasn't just a move to get the villagers to gain some weight, rather the other Tsunade was running them a bit ragged after the war ended. This older woman gave her precious little shinobi a smile, happy to hear that the two were progressing so rapidly in their developing relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know the next step right?\" Naruto tilted his head to the side as in a confused manner. Naruto figured that it would be better to remain in such a state, as close friends. Truth be told they haven't done any physical 'things' yet. Hell they haven't even held hands yet! Though Naruto had a hard time resisting the urge to hug Sakura tightly, to feel her soft body under his wandering hands, to simply feel her warmth against his. While this was a rather normal wish for a teen of his age, he chalked it up as something abnormal and blamed it on the fox inside him.  \"Hm, I don't think that's for the best. I mean I'm comfortable with the way that me and Sakura are right now.\" Placing the turkey leg back on the plate, Tsunade folder her arms and sat back into her chair, thinking of the best way to solve this little situation. Her experiences with her Sakura in the other world gave her the answer. \"You don't want to pursue her and yet, is that what she really wants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" said the blonde, his heart skipping a beat or two. If Sakura herself truly felt that way, then he would have no idea of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you not seen the way she glances at you? Those small looks she gives you simply because she wants to? Or those blushes that she gets if you stare at her for too long? Face it, she wants to be with you Naruto, just as much as you do her.\" All of these new thoughts were plunged into his mind, confusing the poor boy. But regardless of what his mother-like figure told him, he still needed some time to think things over. He said his goodbyes and left Tsunade to her own devices. The woman let out a sigh as she canceled her genjutsu returning her to her rotund form. She wanted to convince the boy using her genjutsu but tricking someone into a relationship was wrong no matter how you put it. She just needed to see how things would play out even with her little shove in the right direction.  <br>\r\n---<br>\r\nNaruto began the walk back to his apartment still deep in thought. A part of him wanted to follow what Tsunade had told him, but he didn't want to be so hasty. Things like this needed to be planned out. Letting out a sigh, he mentally shoved this thoughts out of his head and continued on his path home. Maybe a nap would do him good.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nThe pinked haired girl laid in her pinky and comfy bed, a bit drowsy from the lunch she had eaten earlier. A rather large pizza was ordered due to the new delivery systems in place in the village and Sakura managed to eat it in one sitting. She had no idea why she was hungry but Naruto didn't seem to pay any mind to it. A hand instinctively went towards her softend belly, noticing how it had change in such few days. Dresses in a long sleeved red shirt and some boy-shorts, her apparent weight gain was spread throughout her figure. A belly had grown and softened with just a small bit of overhang that made it a true gut. A rounded waist, it did well to complement her thickened thighs and widened hips. Even her face had become more rounded than usual, the ivory surface making her look much cuter than before. Overall, it looked to be a gain of about twenty pounds, modest but not satisfactory for Tsunade. Her mind began to wander to thoughts of Naruto and how he had treated her these past few days. Taking her out to eat, simply spending time with her, it was romantic in a minimalistic way. A smile grew on her face as she recalled the times Naruto had awkwardly hugged her goodbye. Raising an arm towards the ceiling, a single thought was present in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see you, Naruto.\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto tilted his head in slight confusion, of course he knew the proper way to treat a girl in a relationship. His master was Jiraiya after all. The girl giggled at the face he was making, figuring that Naruto was over complicating things again. Sakura then pointed towards her belly, which grabbed Naruto's attention.  Gently patting it, she smiled when she felt such softness to it. \"You just need to make sure that I'm well-fed, that's all. That shouldn't be to hard right? After all the motivation is pretty big isn't it.\" Naruto slowly nodded, almost mesmerized by such a concept.

Generally, having a mass physical inspection would take care of all of her problems, but that would not be subtle and she could not afford for her plan to become compromised in any way, She had to approach this from another way. The obese blonde would target family members of those who worked in the hospital first, considering that most of the hospital staff had gained a considerable amount of weight. 'Dropping by' at an employees house would be easy enough to explain and she could even have Shizune do visits as well. However, before that can happen, Tsunade wanted to target families of her personal pupils, which would be Sakura and Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune, how are Sakura and Ino coming along?\" The raven-haired woman walked up to Tsunade, her belly stuffed nearly to the brim, making the surface a tad bit hard. She handed her mentor the files from Sakura and Ino's last physical which took place around a week ago. The blonde used this as an opportunity to rub Shizune's belly as she looked over the files. \"As you can see, Sakura is coming along nicely, with a gain of sixty pounds and an increase in measurements all around. However, Ino has failed to meet your expectations, she gained only fifteen pounds and that was thanks to her eating lunches with Sakura from time to time which was stated by our intel. Ino has so far dodged the pounds and keeps up an active lifestyle.\" Now it would make sense to go after Ino's family as they could easily influence Ino to get fatter. She would leave that task to Shizune, Tsunade had her own reasons for targeting Sakura's family first. <br>\r\n---<br>\r\n\"So Naru, this coming weekend, are you free?\" asked Sakura as she pressed herself into Naruto's side. She had just had dinner at Naruto's house, a rather large meal that he had cooked himself, and the pair were resting on his couch in the living room. Dressed in one of Naruto's orange undershirts and a pair of boyshorts, her gain was quite apparently. Her bulging gut spilled onto her lap and her rear was slowly expanding, causing each cheek to jiggle with minimal movement. A hint of a double chin was present, with a more rounded face as well. Her breasts had swelled out, and were now at c-cup range, something that both of them enjoyed immensely. His arm wrapped around the girl's midsection, Naruto played with her fat, jiggling it and gently patting her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am, what's up?\" Gently kissing her on the top of her head, she gave out a small giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom want to finally meet you! Isn't that exciting?!\" exclaimed Sakura, as she hugged Naruto tightly, pressing her soft breasts against Naruto's broad chest. Naruto could not have a more deadpan expression as he subconsciously placed on hand on the small of her back and the other on her rounded rear.  He had been afraid of meeting Sakura's mom after their relationship had began. He could only imagine what kind of woman she would be, taking into account Sakura's immense temper. Looking up a Naruto, her cheeks were flushed due to the hand placed on her bum and had a rather lewd expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naru, if you wanted to have fun, you could have just asked...\" said Sakura as she captured Naruto's lips in a deep kiss and caused them to fall onto the floor. Any of Naruto's previous thoughts were wiped out as he focused on Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe meeting Sakura's mom won't be so bad after all.'</span></div></div>",

Hopefully the pair of Naruto and Sakura could help him out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would her husband say about her body the bigger she got, Nabiki thought. But then a soothing feeling filled her and she decided he'd love her regardless. He remembered how much he'd adored her growing figure when she was pregnant with Sakura and now there would be so much more of her than her biggest when she was with child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that would take a lot of eating, she decided, and added a few large bags of rolls and plenty of butter and jam to go with the rest of the feast that was just about done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The older man attempted to hurt Naruto's hand by squeezing hard, but Naruto wasn't phased by the action. After all he had been through so much worse. In fact, he reciprocated the action by giving a nice squeeze of his own. Quickly pulling his own hand back, Ein nursed it behind his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thank you sir. I was actually quite nervous about meeting the two of you. I really am lucky to have your daughter be with a fool like me.\" said Naruto as the two men began to set the place mats, utensils, glasses and other materials needed for a hearty dinner. Naruto had sent Sakura to go back and help her mother as he wanted to get to know her father a bit better. Of course this was a good opportunity for Sakura to snack on whatever was being prepared. Eying the father of his girlfriend, he could easily see the age and experience in his eyes. Having a dark pink hair color that was cut very short, he could easily see where Sakura inherited her trademarked cotton candy colored hair. Having a medium build, it seemed that old age had failed to affect him too much. From what he's heard from Sakura, Ein was a jounin level nin with a few secret techniques that Naruto hoped to learn. Sakura's mother was a novelist and had written a few popular children's books as well. Truly, Sakura had a rather unique upbringing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I think we're done here Mr. Haruno.\" walking over to Ein, they looked over their handiwork; it wasn't perfect but it was doable. Ein walked towards the kitchen while Naruto simply sat down, waiting for everyone to return. The blonde was glad that everything was going swimmingly and that the awkward moments were kept to a minimum. What had he been so worried about?! About a minute had passed and Ein was practically thrown out of the kitchen and nearly hit the adjacent wall. Naruto nearly leaped out of his chair in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you okay Mr. Haruno?\" The only response the blonde received was a weak thumbs up.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAfter around twenty minutes of Naruto attempting to nurse Ein back into consciousness, dinner was ready and the two females of the household brought out dinner and laid out the spread on the dinning room table. Luckily Ein had recovered before his wife became annoyed of waiting for the meal. Naruto sat down next to Sakura who was rather inattentive; she was more focused on how delicious the meal looked. Nabiki had managed to cook a pot roast, garlic mashed potatoes, grilled chicken and plenty of buttered rolls and garlic bread as sides. For desert, she prepared a strawberry cheesecake as a treat for her and Sakura. \"Now dear, you know better than to disturb me when I'm in the middle of something. Honestly it's like I married a child. Oh, but I still love you so much darling.\" cooed Nabiki, giving a gentle kiss to her husband on the cheek. Naruto found the action quite cute and Sakura was still focused on the food in front of her, waiting for the go ahead to fill up her growing gut. Daintily pouring her husband a dish of sake, motioned for everyone to eat. Just as Naruto and Ein were about to dig in, Nabiki slapped both of their hands with record speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you call yourself gentlemen? Wait for the ladies to fill up their plates, and then the men can go.\"  Pouting, the males shrunk back into their seats, feeling the sting of being scolded.  Sakura and Nabiki proceeded to fill their plates with a rather large amount of food and then began to eat. By the look on Sakura's face, Naruto could tell that he would still be pretty hungry after the meal. Ein however showed interest in his wife's actions. She had not eaten like that since she was carrying Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, she can't be... is she pregnant!?!'  </span></div></div>",

The woman had been a bit frail since her youth and often came for routine checkups. As Inoichi was a close friend to Tsunade, Luka was seen by either herself or Shizune, making sure to give the woman the best care possible. In her universe, despite her frail health, the woman plateaued at a hearty two hundred and twenty pounds, a far-cry from her initial weight of one hundred and ten pounds. The woman had long brown hair that was done in a long braid that cascaded down her back, and had brown eyes. Her skin was as pale as moonlight, another sign of her frail nature. Luka was dressed in a long green casual dress that had begun to hug her generous curves as of late. The woman had a bit of a belly and her hips began to widen. While this was a small gain, it was going in accordance to Tsunade's projections. Adjusting the scale, Shizune saw that the woman had put on twenty pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it says one hundred and thirty pounds.\" Luka nodded as she sat back down on the bench, awaiting any further instructions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know that it isn't the best to put on weight, but I've been feeling much more lively lately. It's like I have more energy in my system.\" Giving out a light chuckle, the black haired woman patted her own belly, causing it to jiggle under her black robe. As Tsunade had been focusing on the village as a whole, she hadn't much time to personally oversee her gain, but it was fine. After all. midnight feedings were adding onto her figure quite wonderfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense, don't believe those tabloids that say women have to be thin. As long as your healthy, it doesn't matter what size you are. In fact, I've gain forty pounds and I've never been healthier.  And all signs show that you're incredibly healthy as well.\" Luka let out a sigh of relief, glad that her recent gain had not put her health in any danger. It also gave her an excuse to try out those new recipes she had received from Nabiki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since I've got a bit of time, why not some smalltalk? How's Ino doing?\" As Tsunade's partner in fattening the village, she was quite curious on how the young girl was coming along. After all, Sakura had put on ten more pounds since her last weigh in. By the mention of the name Ino, an angry scowl had presented itself on Luka's usual kind face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That damn girl! She's on another one of her fad diets again! The ungrateful brat isn't eating any of my cooking that I slave away to make!\" screamed Luka, her face becoming more and more red as she seethed through her teeth. Shizune flinched and could have sworn that she saw steam emitting from her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Now now, calm down Mrs. Yamanaka. I'm sure Ino has her reasons for a diet...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She had no damn reason! That stupid girl is just so stubborn, she can't even see how much she's in love with the Nara boy and then she ends up diluting herself that being even more thin means you're more beautiful!\" Finally realizing that she was entering her 'rage-mode' once again, the woman took many deep breaths and settled down. Such anger was unbecoming of a proper lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, would it be fine to have either Tsunade or me have a little chat with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, that's is fine. But don't be to harsh on the dear, she is young after all and I recall many of us were fools doing that age. My I recall my first date with my beloved, you wouldn't believe at how nervous he was...\" trailed on Luka as she gushed about her youth and her husband's past actions. </span></div></div>",

It was no surprise that their daughters would become close friends and mirror their rivalries as well. Luka and Hibiki would often go to one of their favorite cafes, so catch up and give each other friendly advice.

As she was still a tad bit frail, it had been quite difficult to keep up with a larger intake of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you flatter me. And you've been looking well lately.\" a small blush on her face, Luka was a sucker for flattery, especially from her husband. The pair ordered french onion soup and club sandwiches, something small as dinner was always hearty at their homes. The pair gossiped about their daily lives, talking about the less than bright actions their husbands had committed as of late, others in the village that had gained weight and the advice that they had received from Tsunade and Shizune. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and I'll tell you, my Sakura has been eating nonstop ever since she made the darling Uzumaki boy her boyfriend. And they are simply lovely together.\" said Hibiki, giving of a small giggle as she recalled how shy Naruto acted towards Sakura when he first came for dinner. It reminded her so much of Ein when they were younger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I'll admit I'm jealous. Ino, until a few days ago was on one of her terrible fad diets. It wasn't until a few days ago that Tsunade talked some sense into her. I've never been so grateful to her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're looking for her to eat a bit more here and there, I know the perfect recipe!

Naruto, Inochi, and Ein all looked at each other, fearful to even try and grab more than the single plate they'd managed to get so far. Luka had been the one cooking that night and, aided by Nabiki's recipe and some of her own know how, the feast had been a massive success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura smirked a bit as she noticed Ino slow down after her sixth plate. Sure, her blond  best friend had been porking up recently with a nice hefty belly and a much rounder rear, but she was no match for her own impressive gain. Feeling just a bit of the huge gut she now sported, Sakura moaned in pleasure as she took a larger helping of Luka's pot roast. It tasted surprisingly similar to her mother's own but just a tad different as to be even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno, for her part, just rolled her eyes at how Sakura's gut started touching the table the more food she crammed in there. Her best friend's forehead wasn't the largest part about her anymore. No, that would be the rear end she had managed to cram into one of the chairs at her home, fat spilling over the sides. Her gut wasn't far behind though. Full as she was, Ino managed to finish her seventh plate and gave a big belch afterwards, rubbing her stuffed middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuka, hearing that belch, beamed at her daughter and crammed another buttered roll into her mouth. Since the checkup two weeks ago, she had been delighted to see her figure become even rounder. Though the smallest out of Nabiki and Sakura, she was still a tad larger than Ino thanks to her delight in gaining. Looking over towards her best friend, Luka grinned as she saw Nabiki's blouse start to rip a bit. Just a bit more and the outfit would be ruined, Luka knew, reminding her of the time the pair had dared one another to eat some of the Akimichi's chakra-infused feast and bloating them up like balloons for a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki gave a mighty belch of her own and flashed a smirk towards Luka as she pointed out just how huge her daughter was compared to Ino. Luka didn't seem upset though and pointed towards Nabiki's stomach. Looking down, Nabiki blushed crimson as she saw her white gut rolling over itself and onto the table! Still, her embarrassment was short lived as she returned back to feasting, placing a few more heavy slices of beef onto Luka's plate. Winking at her best friend, Nabiki started on her own slices of beef, Luka following afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fattest daughter and the fattest woman, no, this rivalry was far from dead, Nabiki thought as she pigged out even further.</span></div></div>",

Naruto had become a welcome addition to the Haruno household with Nabiki doting over him and Ein teaching him a few techniques that he picked up in all of his years as a shinobi of the village.  At the moment, it was a sleepy afternoon in the village. Naruto was in the Haruno kitchen along with Nabiki. The teen was helping her prepare dinner, the older woman inviting the blonde to stay the night over once more. Nabiki had filled out quite nice due to her own wishes and Ein's help. Wearing a green colored dress, with long sleeves and a white apron, her gain was presented nicely. Her belly rolled over her waistline, pushing against the fabric of the shirt. The apron tied around her flabby waist, outline the soft contours of her stomach, making the flesh look all the more alluring. Her legs had grown much thicker, her thighs now touched and her wider hips now swayed with her pace. Her rear nearly caused her green dress to be pushed up, the two cheeks filled with a healthy layer of fat. The older woman's face had rounded out as well, with a double chin and she had fluffier cheeks as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you again for helping me out Naruto.\" said Nabiki as she stood in front of the stove, cooking a few pieces of breaded chicken. Giving a bashful smile, Naruto continued to cut up the vegetables to go with the stew that Nabiki was cooking as well.  Naruto had been enjoying himself as of late. While he did get to meet his parents within his mind, being around such a kind family was very comforting to say the least.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Nabiki, do you mind if I talk to you about something? It's about Sakura and all.\" said Naruto, a tad bit nervous to be speaking of Sakura in the presence of her mother. One wrong word and he knew that his head would be through the wall in no time flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear, I'm always willing to give advice about my darling (not so) little daughter. Unless she has been cheating on you! If so I'll tear her a new one!\" shouted the older woman as her eyes seemed to go red. Gulping, Naruto felt chills go down his spine. So that was the face of death?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no its nothing like that. I'm just a bit concerned about her weight.\" Naruto had recalled the past few weeks spending time with his pink haired girl, how she outgrew her shorts, how she would lounge around his house in nothing but a tight white t-shirt and her underwear and how 'affectionate' she had been of late. Naruto didn't mind her weight one bit, in fact, he loved how soft her figure was whenever he was pressed up against her. He was more worried about her health and if there was an underlying problem. Letting out a laugh, Nabiki turned to Naruto, placing his hand on her soft stomach, which caused the blonde to stutter out and grow a rosy tinge on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, us Haruno woman were meant to be healthy, its in our blood.

Since their previous dinner, the pair had made an effort to up their weights and the ever motherly Nabiki had a clear advantage. Since beginning her path towards obesity, she had managed to pack on around sixty pounds, with a majority of the weight centered on her waist, forming a nice fluffy gut that flowed from her midsection and oozed out whenever she sat. Her hips were now incredibly wide and brushed across any surface that she came across, especially door frames. A hefty butt and some ample sized breasts presented the woman as the pinnacle of femininity. Humming a little tune, Nabiki just nodded along with whatever her friend was saying. While she was still a frail woman, she could easily talk up a storm if the topic was interesting. The brown haired woman had only managed to gain a small bit of weight, in addition to her initial gain. Her midsection was now rounder and her face had a hint of a double chin to it. Her rear was softer and was approaching the state of overflowing from her chair. Finishing up the touches to her soup, Nabiki placed two bowls on the kitchen table, along with a stack of breadsticks and a heaping bowl of ceasar salad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then I heard that Anko had recently had her way with Kakashi, I really do hope that they manage to make something out of it, both of them had suffered a lot already.\" said Luka, parroting a particular tidbit she had overheard the other day. The pair then quickly began to eat their hearty meals, something that was nutritious and high in calories as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how is your Ino doing? I've seen her around with the Nara boy and she looks quite healthy.\" Dipping a few breadsticks into her tomato soup, the woman enjoyed the savory taste and quickly devoured the baked dough. \"Oh, she's been doing quite great, and I thank you for all of those recipes.  All of them had been working wonders on her figure, mind too as embarrassed as I am to admit.\" said Luka, a bit miffed that she had to rely on her rival's knowledge to bulk up her weight. Giving the woman a warm smile, on the inside she was cheering due to the humility her rival had shown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't fret at all! I enjoy helping others enjoy themselves. It's why my Sakura has been eating like a queen these past few days. If she isn't with that darling Naruto, who treats her amazingly by the way, she here having meal after countless hearty meal. It's wonderful to see your own child as content as they could be isn't it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes quite.\" The frailer woman made a mental note to make sure that her own daughter wouldn't be left behind in this rivalry of theirs. </span></div></div>",

Aoba!! Go get that desk before all the papers fly out!!\" she bellowed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hear the nervous pitter-patter of grown ninja scurrying off like frightened children at her command. The blonde lay down on a nearby loveseat, God her head hurt so bad!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy were these ninja impersonating an official hidden village? From what she had gathered, they had a great economy and had striven even since the great ninja war! Tsunade had sent squadron after squadron to infiltrate this \"Debugakure\", but only about half of them ever came back. From the information that she <i>had</i> gathered, however, Debugakure's namesake was it's incredibly obese ninja. They had special chakra stealing techniques, were surprisingly strong, and their official colors were purple and gray. They proved to be worthy adversaries indeed, they had plagued Tsunade's attention for months. And without any counterattack from the village itself, Tsunade had no idea what to expect from Debugakure! If they launched a surprise attack, they were completely in the dark in regards to how to counter this special chakra absorbing ability!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCombined with the stress of losing perfectly good ninjas by the handful and the tension of not knowing when the enemy will strike, Tsunade hadn't eaten in about three or four days. She had lost a lot of weight (her boobs were unaffected, much to her delight)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks were starting to sink in and you could see her ribcage through her skin. Tsunade sighed as she fell asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade snorted as she awoke abruptly, her brow furrowed with anger.

Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen to me when I'm talking to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze traveled over to the massive shadow behind the bars. A fat man, a HUGE man, stood proudly. His gut hung out of his shirt (which only covered his manboobs and a little of the ribcage area) and his face sported an extra chin or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade snorted again, nearly choking with laughter, he looked absolutely ridiculous! \"DON'T YOU LAUGH AT ME!\" his eye twitched, \"You are hereby a captive of the great almighty Debukage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I'll just bust out of here and hand your-\" Tsunade stopped when she realized that her chakra flow wasn't flowing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big man pat his stomach, \"You like? It's a special technique to Debugakure, our body mass feeds off of nearby chakra!\" he mocked the Hokage as he pointed a fat finger at her. \"You bastard!\" she yelled, \"Do you have ANY idea as to what's going to happen to you AS SOON AS I BREAK OUT OF THIS CAGE?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHour four, Tsunade's boredom had reached it's peak. She had tried circulating chakra, but that was no good as long as those guards were around. She tried squeezing through the bars, her boobs just HAD to be so damn big! She even tried desperately digging out of prison, but the floor was made of tile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that all Tsunade could do was just wait until someone came around and saved her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, were those footsteps? Yes! Yes they were! Had someone finally come to save Tsunade?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it was just some guard. Some guard with food. A lot of food...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner!\" He cried jovially, \"Soup's on!\" in his chubby hands was gripped a tray of very fine foods. Tsunade raised an eyebrow as he approached her cell, \"Come on then, it's chow time lady!\" the Debugakure Ninja smiled widely as he placed entree after entree inbetween the bars<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah, what's with all of this food?\" Tsunade narrowed her eyes suspiciously, they were trying to fatten her up.

As soon as he slipped out of sight, Tsunade immediately slammed her fists into the bars surrounding her with all the force she could muster; only to see that the bars had not only wistood her blows, but that her attempt had only succeeded in causing her hands to bleed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT!\" the sannin cursed as she readied another blow. Same results as last time. This was getting her nowhere. Someone must have placed a seal somewhere on the cell that had the same chakra draining effects that it's creators possessed. She just couldn't back her punches up with enough energy to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was left to fume in her cell for almost an hour, before the same guard from earlier returned to the room she was currently stuck in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Debukage wishes to see you now,\" The fat ninja said as he slid a key into the cell's built-in lock. \"Don't try anything funny, or you'll be torn to shreds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 5th shot the purple clad ninja infront of her a death glare, but quickly realized that it would be more prudent to go along with what they said until she could lay eyes on this so called \"Debukage\". That way, she could eliminate the renegade village's leader before they became any more of a headache for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was led down a series of winding passageways. Judging from the complete lack of windows, the Lady of Konoha assumed that she was currently underground somewhere. After about ten agonizing minutes of wanting to break her smug captor's face in two, they finally arrived at a much larger door that had various large animals intricately carved into the woodwork. The guard knocked twice, and the door began to slowly open, revealing a level of wealth and oppulance normally reserved for the most powerful of feudal lords. The entire room had been covered in wood panelling of various kinds; and in each of the far corners of the room, there sat an enormous jade statue of an elephant. Alongside the walls, someone had put int the effort to dig two rather large koi ponds, complete with a surrounding of rocks and local plantlife that was somehow able to be maintained in this underground lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of these impressive things however were what caught Tsunade's attention. What Tsunade was starring at now was the massive woman sitting dead center in the room surrounded by an honor guard of four fat ninja - two male and two female- wearing various animal masks. The large woman motioned for the escorting guard to leave them, before turning to match the sanin's gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, my Lady,\" The sitting woman, who had to atleast be about 400 pounds and looked to be in her late 20's said in a cordial tone. \"I appologize that we had to meet under thse conditions, but it seems that there was no other way; as none of our letters or messenger hawks were ever answered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that's because your little gang here isn't a real ninja village!\" Tsunade yelled as she made a bee-line for the mountain of flesh infront of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chubby kunoichi wearing a boar mask quickly made a series of hand gestures, before slamming her palm into the wood flooring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninja Art! Demon's Tongue!\" the masked ninja yelled as a purple tendril suddenly shot out of the ground and wrapped itself around the charging sannin, stopping her dead in her tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Kasumi,\" The Debukage nodded to her subordinate, before returning her attention to her whould-be attacker. \"Now, now, there is no need for violence here. Although you do have a point- we are not officially recognised as a ninja village by the council of feudal lords. However, if we could prove ourselves to be stronger than our neighbors, I'm sure that they'd begin turning to us whenever they needed someone to do their dirty work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how -ungh!- do you plan on doing that?\" The 5th Hokage said as she struggled against the fleshy mass constricting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By going to war, obviously!\" The Debukage said with a shrug of her massive shoulders. \"If we can conquer one of the minor villages huddling around the Land of Fire, then we're sure to gain recognition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese leader nodded, and the tendril attempting to crush Tsunade began to relax it's grip slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we needed to get in contact with you so badly, Lady Tsunade, if we can win the backing of one of the major villages, then there would be no way any of the smaller villages could oppose us. What I propose is an alliance between your village and mine in a war against the minor nations. In return for your military and financial support, we would be willing to teach up to a dozen of your top ninja our special techniques, and any land that we aquire may be claimed by you- afterall, we're not in it for territory, we only want prestiege.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, my lady,\" the Debukage said as a toothy smile began to spread across her face. \"What do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

Shizune, her loyal assistant, said nothing about this weight, though Tsunade knew Shizune found it highly irresponsible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a weight of four hundred pounds, Tsunade was more often than not called the Debukage by some of the meaner adolescents in the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tsunade didn't care. She loved her fat, she loved the jiggling sensation that went through her every time she moved, and she loved food. Of course she would often stuff her face back when she was skinny but as a fat woman she found food much more enjoyable somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, while she watched Shizune come in with a cart of food for her, she noticed Shizune's tired expression. The bags under her eyes and the dangerously skinny frame Shizune had caused concern to flare up within the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go My Lady, enjoy.\" Bowing, Shizune turned to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Shizune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing so, Shizune turned around, thinking her boss wanted more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you join me for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune spared a glance for the massive amounts of highly fattening, greasy, fatty foods heaped on the cart before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...will, just this once, you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade nodded and motioned for her to get two plates for both of them from the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the first piece of food passed her lips, a donut covered in chocolate frosting, Shizune's eyes widened. It was so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade encouraged her assistant to go back for another plate after she was done with her first. And another, and another, and another until, two hours later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooh....\" Shizune moaned. She had managed to eat four full plates of food, her stomach now stuffed tight and poking out slightly from her robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade, who had eaten eight plates, felt full but not stuffed. Hearing another moan from her assistant, Tsunade reached out a flabby hand and placed it on Shizune's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you...ugh...doing My Lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can really put it away, Shizune.\" Tsunade made gentle, slow, circles with her palm around that taut surface, Shizune moaning a bit from the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BURRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune's face turned beet red at the loud belch she had just done, Tsunade smirking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Shizune...how unladylike of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Lady Tsunade...ugh...I'm just so...HIC...full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's good to be this full, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune, her mind half woozy from all the food she'd eaten, responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to do this with me, say once or twice a week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...yes...that would be nice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yes, her irresponsible Lady Hokage should be about due time for a checkup... <i>should</i> be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd missed so much work in these last few hours, there was no telling what kind of shenanigans Tsunade might have been up to in her absence? The whole place could have burned down without dear old stick-in-the-mud Shizune around to keep things in check. But, from what she could make out of the Hokage's Palace just over the rooftops of Konoha, there was no discernible chaos that needed rectifying. No flames, no smoke, no ninja flying in or out of any windows, nor any desks doing the same. Things looked pretty tame inside that building over there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo maybe another hour or two wouldn't have killed Tsunade? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, she had obviously done such a good job of keeping things in line so far. Maybe this was a sign that Shizune needed to loosed up on the older woman's figurative leash a bit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too much of course; but just enough to warrant a little Shizune time of relaxation and peaceful digestion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune plodded her way up the stairs to the Hokage Palace some hour or so later not fully digested. The still-present contents of her stomach bulged outwards in a waterbelly that sloshed and gurgled as it struggled to do away with its maxxed capacity. The flight of stairs certainly wasn't the best thing that Shizune could have done with such a full tummy, and the postpartum stress of getting back to work was just twisting the knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo doubt Lady Tsunade was going to be royally upset at her for leaving for so long without notice. Especially if she noticed how full her stomach was; she'd never hear the end of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, taking a deep breath that was part \"soothe my indigestion\" and even more \"lets hope my boss doesn't kill me\", Shizune knocked quietly on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade...\" she squeaked, \"I-I'm back from my lunch break!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her surprise Shizune found that instead of the usual drunken banter or homicidal threats to those interrupting her drinking, the voice behind the door was one of jovial air, joined by two lighter voices sharing the same humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Shizune come in!\" Tsunade said happily from behind the door, \"Sakura just made lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Lunch?'</i> Shizune asked herself quietly, <i>'And a late lunch at that. Prepared by Sakura? What's going on here?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door, trying not to seem put off or conspicuous in any light, Shizune was pleasantly surprised to see that young kunoichi Sakura Haruno and Ino Yamanaka had joined her, an aproned Sakura caught midaction as she gingerly placed a modest chicken dish in front of Tsunade while Ino still sat opposite from her Hokage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well this is nice.\" Shizune said pleasantly as she approached the desk, \"You both decided to join Lady Tsunade for lunch today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, placing a plate down in front of Ino and standing to face Shizune, smiled kindly. \"Well normally I'd have lunch with Naruto, but I've gotten into cooking lately and he doesn't eat much of anything that isn't cooked in broth or instant.\" she said kindly, \"So I decided to make Lady Tsunade a meal and see if she liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a natural by the way, Shizune.\" Tsunade said with a happy smile on her face as she delicately pierced a small piece of chicken with her fork<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Ino decided to come along too, once I told her that I'd be cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe addressed blonde acknowledged her name with a wily smile, \"Well you may not be the best looking girl around, what with that monster forehead of yours, but I'll give you this- my days around the Flower Shop have been made a lot more bearable by those muffins you bring me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet Ino-Pig!\" Sakura barked back quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune noticed something rather odd about Ino in that instance. She couldn't quite place it, but she seemed just a hair's width wider than before. Maybe it was just because she was sitting down- she'd never seen her sit before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a big whiff of some pre-cooked chicken, Shizune's concerns regarding the Yamanaka girl were quickly cut off at the tail. While the mere thought of more food made her want to vomit, a bigger bust line certainly held lots of appeal that made it well worth the effort...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, how long did you say you've been cooking?\" Shizune asked politely as she took another deep inhale, \"You must have had a lot of practice, your chicken smells great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blushed slightly, \"Well actually, I only found the cooking book about two weeks ago. But Ino says that I've gotten really good, and now Lady Tsunade's giving me high marks too. I must really be a natural cook after all, huh?\" she laughed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune's belly grumbled, not out of hunger but of fear. Fear because it knew the next words to pass from the breast-envious lips of its bearer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is there any left?\" Shizune asked with a slight grimace, \"I'd love to see how well you're coming along for myself.\"</span></div></div>",

As she speared a bit of cut chicken with her fork, she brought a bit to her lips and chewed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura this is wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so wonderful, in fact, that Shizune speared an even bigger chunk of the poultry for her next bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the chicken had joined her twenty bowls of ramen in her stomach, Shizune was well and truly stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno and Sakura had left, Shizune also noting that Sakura herself looked a tad bigger as well but didn't bring it up. She didn't want to hurt her feelings after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the two younger women were gone, Tsunade leaned back and let loose an impressive belch, sighing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, that hit the spot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune sighed at her mentor's lack of manners, wondering, for the thousandth time, how someone like her was the Hokage. Of course, Tsunade was a fine Hokage, but it was displays like this and her constant sake-binging and gambling, that made Shizune often ponder fate's machinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pondering, however, was cut off by a belch twice as loud as Tsunade's and one that actually silenced the Hokage for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, stammering out an apology, Shizune made to leave, groaning a bit as she clutched her truly stuffed stomach, when Tsunade stopped her with an imperious glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay a moment Shizune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Shizune sat back down and Tsunade got up, moving around her seated assistant with a smirk gracing her features. A hand reached out and prodded the chicken and ramen-filled stomach, eliciting yet another belch from Shizune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's really enjoyed themselves for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes my Lady,\" Shizune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good thing, because I've decided that Sakura will serve as our own personal chef from here on out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune again nodded and finally got to her feet, her mentor helping her steady herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Shizune, I want you to take the rest of the day off. Rest and digest, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune nodded but managed to point a finger at her boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you make sure you finish the paperwork on your desk, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade groaned but nodded, plopping back in her chair and watching as her beloved assistant left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was certain Shizune was gone, Tsunade pulled out the twelve pack of donuts and two jugs of sake she had hidden away in her drawers, eating one of the pastries and slowly, very, very, slowly, getting her paperwork done.</span></div></div>",

No reason to aim for Top Chef or anything... not that I'm complaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no real reason... I've always liked to cook, but I've never been any good at it.\" Sakura said modestly, \"So I'm coming home from training with Naruto and Sai and it's displayed in an old antique store window. I asked about it, and it was pretty cheap. End of story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looooove Story, you mean.\" Ino jeered, \"Don't lie, you wanna make that spiky haired foxface team mate of yours something special, don'tcha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ino!\" Sakura hollered with a heavy blush across her face, \"That's totally not it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suuure its not.\" Ino said, making a mock kissy face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can hit you again, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, Sakura.\" the blonde said dismissively as she began to part from her pinkheaded companion, \"This is my stop, dinner should be up in about an hour or so; so I better go ahead and change.\" walking towards the Yamanaka Flower Shop, Ino turned back, \"Don't forget, you promised to make me lunch tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you bailed on me yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine.\" Sakura grumbled, \"What do you want Ino-<i>Pig</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The works, gimme what you're best at.\" Ino said vaguely as she started towards the doorway again, \"Just come get me before you start at the Hokage's Office, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>***</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, not Ino's order, that was fine. The real problem was sitting right in front of her. On her bed, over the covers, tossed casually and allowed to flail out and about on her mattress. Her apron, rather the one she borrowed from her mother, was what had upset her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPink and white patchwork with a large frontal pocket, it was hard to believe that such a thing could really upset anyone other than a Women's Rights Activist. Yet there, in Sakura's mirror, was the absolute worst mark marring her otherwise flawless reflection. On the sides, where the apron's tied had been strung, were tiny red marks that indicated the worst- it had dug into her side ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't have been so bad if she hadn't been wearing the same apron since she started cooking; and not once had it left those horrible impressions around her middle like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I must have put on a little weight...'</i> Sakura thought woefully to herself as she stared at an otherwise flawless and toned reflection in the mirror, <i>'I have been working with food a lot lately, maybe I've been sampling a little too much...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen, at the worst possible time (considering that she was topless) the oven timer dinged loudly throughout the Haruno household. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" she hollered, hurrying over to the apron and wrapping it around her exposed torso. She rushed down the stairs and into the kitchen, dove into the oven mitt and removed several cookies from the oven for dessert tomorrow. On instinct, to see if they were done, Sakura leaned in slightly to grab at one of the molten confections before pulling back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not tonight.\" she chided herself aloud, \"I've already put on too much weight, I can't afford to get out of shape...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the tray beckoned her, called out to her lovingly... it seemed such a waste if they weren't going to get eaten before they were stale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I know!'</i> she said thought, reaching for the three preprepared meals and placing them on the counter, <i>'When they cool, I'll divide this batch up evenly into three; four for Ino, four for Shizune, and four for Lady Tsunade!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, two, three four...\" she ran a quick head count, \"Damn, thirteen... oh well, I guess Ino's a lucky girl.

Shizune was the last, making sure to appear tidy, despite the fact that this was her third meal of the day, having paid a visit to the ramen stand on her way to work that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Shizune finished, covering her mouth before smiling warmly at Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious.

I wasn't going to eat all of it. You need to eat more, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was about to ask why Shizune needed to eat more when she noticed a bit of her stomach was showing.

While usually it is reserved for important meals to be shared with diplomats or other foreign agents, Tsunade was not above hosting a quaint dinner arrangement there for herself and a few guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight however it would just be her and Shizune on either end of the long table provided for them, with young Sakura Haruno providing culinary services in the kitchen. This wasn't the first time she had been cordially invited to dine with the Hokage, in fact on Lady Tsunade's lonelier nights the two of them went out drinking together. However she usually preferred to keep an air of formality between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, as usual, was never really one for formalities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other end of the table, already soused to the gills, sat the Fifth Hokage in all of her drunken glory. Apparently an hour before dinner was just enough time and just enough liquor for her to get past tipsy. It was a little off putting for both of her younger assistants; Sakura because she was a rather loud drunk and it made her nervous while she cooked, and Shizune because she actually had to keep conversation with this atrocious alcoholic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sakura, how much longer till we can start eating?\" she asked in a drunken stammer, \"I'm starved off my ass, and Shizune's not getting any younger over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just sayin' your not.\" the older woman said frankly, \"I mean really, you're not. Not getting any younger I mean. I mean, come on I'm starvin' over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the younger women simply sighed; a sure sign that they had grown far too tolerant of this behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Sakura will have things ready for us as soon as possible.\" Shizune said in a soothing voice, \"Right, Sakura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? Now why don't you calm down...\" she cooed, \"Have some water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Sake.\" Tsunade chuckled dimwittedly as she poured and downed another cup. \"Looks like water, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hopeless.\" Shizune said with a light facepalm of shame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner's ready!\" Sakura said triumphantly as she emerged from the kitchen, stained apron and all as she carried two hearty platters of simplistic peasant dishes. \"It's nothing fancy, but I think you'll enjoy the steaks.\" Walking dutifully over to her Master first, the pinkette laid one of the platters down in front of her, \"Just in case you need it, I put some steak sauce in the middle of the table there.\" now to Shizune, she served the second plate happily, \"I made a quick one for Naruto earlier and he said that it would have been better with steak sauce. But then again, he's an idiot. Bon appetite!\" she said smiling as she headed for the door<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An' jus' whur do you think you're goin'?\" Tsunade asked in her drunken slur<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why Sakura?\" Shizune pleaded, \"You should stay here with us, you worked so hard on these meals! You should be able to eat too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura let out a cautious giggle, \"Oh no, I already ate before I came.\" not a lie, \"Besides, I've got late-night training with Kakashi Sensei.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well, okay.\" Shizune said defeatedly. Now she was to be left alone with the buxom blowhard with her lips wrapped around the bottle... and on a full stomach too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes it's true, Shizune had already eaten. Not out of gluttony or out of boredom, but because this whole \"not having breasts\" thing was really bothering her. Now that some of the girls had developed, she was starting to look petite around the bustline by comparison. Sakura was pretty safe, Ino and Tenten were about equal, but that Hyuuga girl? Talk about blown out of the water! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, if pain was beauty, then her breasts had better be killer by the time this is over with...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhh...\" Tsunade moaned dumbly as she sucked through her teeth, one thoroughly used toothpick pressed between her forefinger and thumb as she leaned back slightly in her chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...\" Shizune whined as she cradled her inflated paunch. Hard as rock, her tummy pooched out slightly as it swelled in all its occupants. From two days of stuffing herself silly, the younger kunoichi was starting to get the hang of overeating. The exciting sensation that seemed to radiate within her on her very first binge had lost all appeal by this point, however; all being left now was contempt for even the four letter word \"food\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I can take that as you enjoyed the meal?\" Tsunade asked, her head a little more clear now that there was some food on her stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, why not?\" she asked with mild concern, patting her own full tummy in jest, \"That girl's got some real talent in the kitchen, I don't see why she hadn't started cooking earlier, she's a natural.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... the food was good.\" Shizune said meekly, \"But... my stomach really hurts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still at this whole \"getting breasts\" thing, huh?\" Tsunade said frankly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade!\" Shizune chastised out of habit, \"Don't be rude!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying that you're going to hurt yourself if you keep this up.\" she said, reclining further back into her chair, \"That or eat yourself sick. You've really got to be careful with this Shizune, I don't want you developing an eating disorder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade...\" Shizune said quietly, feeling awful now that she was making her mentor worry about her, \"I-I'll be fine. Promise. No more overeating. I'm just going to research things that are... um, <i>specific to my problem</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your problem being small breasts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Tsunade.

She had even skipped a meal once or twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the end result of all these attempts at discipline only resulted in her hitting the food twice as hard the next available meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now, she was starting what was considered a light breakfast these days. Said breakfast consisted of two omelets, three bowls of rice, and two glasses of milk. It filled her but didn't quite take the edge off her hunger, so Shizune stopped by the ramen stand before going to work, smiling warmly at the vendor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow no longer feeling hunger gnaw at her insides, Shizune was prepared for her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the office, she saw her mistress snoring at her desk, a half-eaten box of pastries right by the currently drooling Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing the sigh of the long-suffering, Shizune put the box back in one of the many drawers Tsunade had on her desk and wiped up what drool she could before whispering in her lady's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade, time to get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response Shizune got was a grunt/snort combination that made the assistant think of Tonton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP MY LADY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuzzat? Hmmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade was definitely awake now, blinking rapidly and sniffling a bit as she returned to the world of the wakeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...hey Shizune...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Now here are the latest reports from our jonin currently on assignment. They need to be looked over and stamped by you. Then you have the trade agreement with the Land of Sand, then we'll have a light lunch, then more documents to sign.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade groaned and placed her forehead on the wood of the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really hope this is all a dream!\" Tsunade whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sorry my lady, but you're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Tsunade said miserably as her head once again met the hard surface of the desk. \"Ow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune chuckled silently to herself, trying not to take slight humor from her mentor's plight; she had her own work to be doing, after all. When Tsunade's drinking started, what little paperwork that got done already stopped dead in its tracks, and it was usually her job to resort and file them after one of Tsunade's little drunken episodes in the office. Today however, or rather last night, Tsunade seemed to have behaved herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere papers usually mountained atop the very desk that the ever-elegant Lady Hokage was so brilliantly using as a pillow, lately things had come to less of a \"mountain\" per say, and more of a \"steep hill with several climaxing areas\". So naturally when the workload was light, there was much less of a mess for Shizune to pick up afterwords. In fact, the last three Thursdays pertained to almost no mess at all compared to the usual where she had to search for TonTon amongst the stacks. So she couldn't complain when there were only a few files here and there with paper scattered about the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo casually Shizune began skimming the relative area for papers that needed to be resorted into their rightful files, her usual demeanor about her which consisted of a generally positive attitude and a relative mix of toleration, slight admiration and contempt for her lazybones boss. Letting out a slight grunt as she leaned over to pick up a stray (probably very important) document regarding the Sand Village, Shizune could only bear with the seemingly daily wedgies that seemed to plague her lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking at her underwear from outside her robe, Shizune frowned slightly to herself, consciously putting an effort towards pushing her sudden change in diet from her mind. She simply didn't like to think about the effects of eating such hearty meals and how it might be affecting her girlish figure as it troubled her so. Ironic, considering that this was undoubtedly related to her recent search for curvage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Maybe tight undies means that I'm finally getting curvier?'</i> Shizune asked herself meekly, <i>'But why would it be my panties and not my- no, I'm sure that soon I'll have a bountiful chest just like Lady Tsunade!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune stood, upset by her straining bottoms, and ran a hand down her middle; it had grown softer, but what could possibly be the problem? She only ate her fill, and she tried to keep her promise to her Hokage by cutting out binge eating in hopes of yielding bigger breasts. Perhaps she would have to cut out a few things? Shizune didn't want to get soft around the middle, only in the chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh no... what am I going to do?'</i> she woed once more over her failed attempts at dieting, <i>'I don't want to gain any more weight, but I have to if I- ... hey, what's that smell?'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, as if on command, there came a light rapping on the Hokage's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Lady Tsunade!\" Sakura's voice came cheerful and chirpy through the light doorway, \"I thought I'd stop by early today so we could perfect that Liver Transplant procedure we started last Tuesday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the opening of the door, Sakura was shown to have two large platters in her possession, on stacked atop the other wrapped in wax paper. She fumbled slightly with the dishes before placing them down noisily in front of Tsunade, who could only groan miserably to herself at her youngest disciples' noisy entrance. How dare she decide to show up early, carrying noisy plates and knocking so loudly on the door when she knew very well that Thursday was her \"I drink alone every Thursday Night\" night?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home, Sakura.\" Tsunade said bitterly, \"No training today. Hokage has a hangover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small frown creased Sakura's lips before Shizune intervened <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Hokage, don't be so rude!\" the robed woman declared, \"the least you could do would be to take her food from her and apologize for staying up all night drinking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't all night, Shizune.\" Tsunade grumbled, \"It was most of the night. Now both of you scat... I've got to beef up on this foreign policy for the Sand Village...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's frown increased, \"Oh... well, would you at least like the food?\" she asked politely, \"I know it's early, but I think it might at least help with your headache if you eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth women watched as Tsunade, still face down, slid a plate from on top of the other and over within smell range. \"Smells good. It'd be a shame if I vomited it up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Tsunade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't yell, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just saying its a lot of food.\" Tsunade said grumpily, \"Its not a bad thing, but I'm gonna be really full on top of a hangover.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a point, Sakura.\" Shizune said, wary of her mentor's weak stomach, \"If she eats too much now she may throw up all over her office...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its so much food... I'd hate for it to go to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God just stop talking and <i>go</i>!\" </span></div></div>",

It was a pleasure to observe the joy the younger ninja took in the food, Shizune slightly taken aback at how quickly Ino devoured hers. But she was also surprised at the way Sakura ate hers. It wasn't nearly as refined as the dinner a few nights ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune tucked her own meal away and was idly rubbing her stomach before Sakura called her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sorry...it's just do you have some more food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura blinked a bit at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune blushing, nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura's puzzlement soon turned into a wide smile as she left the shop, telling Shizune to wait for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                     ***<br>\r\n\"Ugh...damn crappy sake...\" Tsunade muttered, waking up and rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't feel like she was going to vomit, which was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the Hokage pulled out the remainder of her pastry breakfast from earlier in the morning and dug in, not caring how much of mess she made on the documents. Shizune wasn't here after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsunade finished, she noticed that her hand met her stomach a lot earlier than it used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA closer inspection revealed that the Hokage now had a gut in place of her toned abs. It was stubbornly rolling outwards and resisted all attempts to hide it despite her best efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Tsunade just laid back and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't fat, just he stomach was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, she decided, closing her eyes and deciding to take another nap, she wasn't fat, just her stomach...</span></div></div>",

The earlier fear somewhat returned, but it was countered by the joyfully full feeling she had now. Sakura's meals really were the best, as they often didn't send her searching for more food to fully sate herself after eating them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune sighed happily as she decided that a nap was in order. Because if her Hokage wasn't feeling her best, there wasn't much the assistant could do in her stead that she hadn't already done what with the organizing of the documents, the soothing of tensions the Hokage had insulted during a drunken meeting a few weeks ago, and just generally tidying up the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, Shizune thought, I deserve this nap.<br>\r\n                                                                                                                       ***<br>\r\nWhen Shizune woke up, it was dark and the Hokage was not in her office chair. Frantic, the assistant got to her feet and started inspecting the other rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer panic subsided when she opened the door to Tsunade's private chambers and found the Hokage passed out again, alcohol not responsible for once. No, this time the Hokage's sedate form was due to the pasty white belly on display to the whole world, the robes meant to contain said belly lying untied as the Hokage snored loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, Shizune giggled, finding the sight adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving closer to her sleeping lady, Shizune reached out hand and gently stroked the burgeoning mass that was Tsunade's stomach, surprised at the softness she felt. Of course there was a tautness as well, but the majority of the belly she was feeling was actually fat. Maybe it had been the taste that had laid Tsunade low, as Sakura's meals were exquisite in that regard as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade snorted a bit in-between snores at Shizune's touch but didn't wake up. As Shizune removed her hand from her superior's tubby stomach, she noticed one other detail that made her clamp her hand over her mouth, effectively stopping the loud laughter that wanted to escape: on Tsunade's cheeks, which were quite round, crumbs and sauce stains dominated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, but smiling, Shizune finally covered up her boss and left the room, sparing one last glance back before she slid the door shut and headed for home.</span></div></div>",

When is she ever?\" Shizune jested playfully at her absent boss' expense, \"All she does in that office of hers is drink and not do paperwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do these go again?\" Sakura interrupted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, over by the water cooler.\" Shizune said quickly, her long days of hunching over a desk finding vengeance in making this simple labor unbearable on her back. That and the uncomfortable chafing between her legs made the entire ordeal unbearable. Even though she had realized some weeks ago that there was a problem in her eating, her weight continued to rise as if nothing had happened at all. It was always \"I'm starting tomorrow\" or \"Tomorrow being Thursday\" or \"When Lady Tsunade gets that stack of paperwork done so I won't be bored in the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd of course her waist continued to expand as her overall mass increased ever so slightly. Now sporting a bit of a belly that swelled ever so slightly over the waistband to her... I don't know what you call them, ninja pants? Anyway, the bottoms under her robes hand begun pinching at her softer tummy ever so slightly lately, and where once spacious was starting to get a little tight around her bum. Much to her dismay, she was still wearing the bra from two months ago. Shizune figured that, at least with so much food being eaten, <i>some</i> of the weight might just go to her breasts. But where could it possibly be going? Her stomach? It was squishy sure, but it wasn't quite a belly yet. Her thighs were a little thicker, but that didn't account for how heavy she felt lately... maybe she was just imagining more weight on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned, failing to notice the unaccounted for bulging butt cheeks she had so unknowingly sprouted, she placed her stack down on the floor in front of her. Her crack, almost on fire with another one of those horrible wedgies, was picked at lightly before grunting as she rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura, still slender as ever due to her restrictive diet and harsh training regimend, placed her pile of paper down across from Shizune's<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, she's been drinking a lot lately.\" Sakura said worriedly, \"Is everything alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine.\" Shizune grumbled, \"You just haven't been around her long enough to know what \"a lot\" is. But she promised to stop drinking so much... at least around us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Sakura giggled, \"I hope she at least eats the get-well brownies I made her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune led her younger student out the door of the storage closet, oddly out of place in the Hokage's Mansion, \"So, how's your training going with Lady Tsunade anyway?\" she asked politely, \"All your sessions lately have been private, I haven't gotten to see how much your medical ninjutsu has progressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura frowned, \"It's been slow. I really only work on my training every other day or so because Lady Tsunade has some new recipe for me to try out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Shizune frowned back, \"That's awfully abusive of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I don't mind.\" Sakura sighed quietly as she let out a small smile, \"In a way, this is what I wanted; my medical training had hit a bit of a stalemate, so I must have been subconsciously looking for a hobby. I found cooking, and now Lady Tsunade is helping me with that too, so either way I still have my mentor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now by helping, you mean she actually <i>cooks</i> with you?\" Shizune asks dumbfounded. The mentor she had come to know and fearspect hadn't picked up a kitchen utensil since time immorial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... no.\" Sakura says frankly, \"But she's always telling me how much I need to add or make, how it tastes or what I did wrong. Between you, her, and Ino I'm going to become the best chef in the Leaf Village by no time!\"</span></div></div>",

And by this time yesterday, Shizune's soft, supple breasts had started spilling out of the cups! So this would be her first day in a new brassiere for the first time in a long time, and she was really beginning to enjoy herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of constant shaking and wobbling in the back, Shizune's attention was diverted entirely to the small increase in mass of her front. And while she didn't like to look at it this way, when one puts on a significant amount of weight in the middle and the back, it was only a matter of time before a tiny fraction of it went to her front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that, combined with the secret shame of knocking a few scrolls off the shelves in private not fourty-five minutes ago with her bodacious bottom, her day was going pretty well!

It was a lot like a gruesome accident, not to be rude of course, but she just couldn't help herself. It was much harder than usual to picture a Shizune that wasn't thick around the middle and heavy in the back, but Sakura knew that she hadn't always had that much to fill out her bottoms before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shizune bent over to fasten her sandals, she felt a sagging sensation throughout her middle, doughy potbelly drooping along with gravity. Her chest, much to her dismay, wasn't quite so heavy at this angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, she was subject to the ritual jostling of her heavy rear, usually going unoticed due to her confining robes. Now that she could feel the full jiggle to her wiggle, things seemed a little too unbalanced for her tastes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if she were just noticing it for the first time, Shizune's hands traveled around one plump cheek. Soft to the touch and all but bakeably doughy, it felt like she was fingering a cloud instead of her own ponderous fleshy bottom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to seem conspicuous in front of Sakura, she acted as if she were adjusting her bra so as to get a better, more enlightened feel of her \"bigger\" breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile certainly greater in mass, if only by a cup size (and that was simply for comfort) Shizune felt that things were a little unfair. How had her bottom grown so... <i>large</i> so fast while her breasts remained moderate to below average for so long? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Shizune?\" Sakura asked in a concerned tone, seeing that her superior seemed troubled by her large bottom, \"Are you... alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" the black haired woman responded dimly, \"Oh yes, I'm fine Sakura. I'll just... um, pay for these and head home. I think I'll surprise TonTon and spend the rest of my lunch hour there with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Are you sure?\" Sakura asked knowingly, \"I mean, if you need someone to talk to, I could-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, you... you go by the Flower Shop or something and visit Ino.\" Shizune said with a weak smile, \"I'll go home eat lunch, and then go back to the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist, Lady Shizune.\" Sakura said defeated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nSakura timidly rapped on the Yamanaka doorstep after seeing that the lights were off in the Flower Shop. Standing rather awkwardly on her on-again off-again BFF's doorstep, she waited eagerly for some sort of response from within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" Ino's voice came from behind the light oaken door; which soon opened on its hinges. \"Sakura? What are you doing here?\" asked the underdressed Yamanaka girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDressed in slacker chique, as she was notorious for cosmetically relaxing on her days off from training and work at the Flower Shop lately, Ino's clothes much like Shizune herself seemed to be rather illfitting... though in a much more obvious way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a can of diet soda gripped in one pudgy hand, it seemed to register with Ino that a sly crescent moon of pink belly flesh was exposed from her simple navy t-shirt, thought to be carefully tucked within her gray sweats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I thought we were supposed to meet for <i>dinner</i>!\" she groaned, hurrying up the stairs before Sakura stopped her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we were, but Lady Hokage gave me the day off.\" she said simply, \"What's with... all <i>this</i>?\" Sakura teased, gesturing towards her friend's underappealing (and underfitting) clothes, \" I thought you wore makeup 24/7\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of us can pull off the natural look.\" Ino scoffed as she bobbed up the stairs, ready to change, \"But you wouldn't know about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER!!\" she hollered, \"SAKURA'S HERE, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE, JUST LET ME GET READY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn their day out at the barbecue joint...</span></div></div>",

Whether it be dressed in her uniform for the flower shop or whatever sweats still fit her for training, she would definitely have been dressed, make up on, and already waiting for Sakura's delicious lunch delivery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this morning was different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the insistance of her mother, Ino was told to take the day off from working the counter at her flower shop. Apparently they had been making enough money to warrant a day off here and there, though Mrs. Yamanaka probably could have waited for a better time to break the news before Ino had already gone through the painstaking process of applying her makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't allowed to sleep in, but she was more than priviliged to sit at either their traditional low dining table or on the couch watching whatever television shows broadcasted in this whacked-out series about ninjas. Naturally, she chose the television over staring at her mother's butt in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning somewhat as her fat rear plopped down, Ino's sweats tore ever so slightly at the back as she forced her blubbery bum inside the constricting gray fabric. Unbeknownst to her, as she was juggling listening to the clanging of pots and pans in the kitchen and whatever was on TV, her tee had ridden up ever so slightly to reveal a pooch of a belly peeking from underneath. Even her socks seemed tighter these days!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like this the Yamanaka girl sat for a good half an hour before the grand secret was finally revealed; a warm batch of pancakes to be delivered by her mother. Drenched in strawberries and whipped cream and on a TV tray, it was placed right on the bulge of her belly. Somehow, Ino couldn't seem to place it, but somehow the dish seemed familiar... as if she had already eaten it before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, you didn't have to.\" Ino said thankfully as she struggled to sit up under her own lazy power, \"I mean, we can't close down the shop just because you feel like making breakfast every now and then. Sakura would gladly-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ino, hush.\" her mother said gingerly, placing a fork on the right side of Ino's tray, \"I really don't mind cooking every now and then. I'll be home from missions for a while and I'd like to spend time with my Baby Girl. So could you please just enjoy the pancakes?\" she said sweetly, \"I got the recipe from Sakura, and she said that this was the way you liked them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno smiled, getting a little teary eyed at her mother's kind words. \"Oh Mother...\" she smiled before cutting into the pancake stack with her fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know how you like them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thish ish rully good!!\" Ino said overenthusiastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot entirely an exaggeration, but also not the truth. While it was the same recipe that Sakura followed down to the letter, Sakura's expertise in the culinary arts definitely showed more when she prepared it. Not to say it wasn't good, but not quite up to Ino's standards these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" her mother nearly squealed, \"Good, because before she left last night, I asked Sakura to write down a whole bunch of your favorite recepies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ino asked dumbly through another bite of strawberry flapjack, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because she's really blossomed into such a wonderful young chef, and you really seem to enjoy her cooking...\" Ino's mother said softly, taking a seat next to her daughter on the couch, \"And like I said, I don't get to spend much time with my baby these days. But I wanted to make you happy with your favorite treats while I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now take your time, we'll go shopping for new clothes and go out for lunch.

It has been a long 2 and a half months since Ino's mother was able to get Sakura's recipes, and once again the flower shop was having a day off as it had enough money to survive a off day. Ino and her mother were having their second breakfasts of the day, and they both have seemed to have packed on some great weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was mostly growing wider all around from having been in contact with her mother's meals. Her belly had multiple rolls of fat that each were filled with food at the moment. Her breasts were almost the size of her chubby face and were currently unrestricted while she was waiting for her new bras to come in the mail. And her behind was now so filled with fat that she had to use three chairs to sit down without breaking them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother, meanwhile was not only growing fat, but she also looked a bit taller than usual, something Ino noticed when her mother accidentally hit her head on the top of the doorframe.. Her gains were slightly bigger in size to her fat daughter, and her curves were barely contained by her big robes. She was in the middle of her fourth plate of pancakes, and she was finishing of the remaining eggs as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that, I think you might be eating too much, and it could take into our budget...\" Ino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom then finished off her current plate and moved on to her last plate. \"Well I'm sure if you were in my shoes, you'd know that a girl needs food to keep her happy. Besides, it looks like I'm not the only one to eat so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you please think about it a bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh fine, I'll try to diet starting tomorrow, if you want.\" Ino's mother then finished her last plate and all of the eggs, and went back to the couch to rest off her meal. Ino tried sitting next to her mother, but there wasn't enough room on the couch for the two of them.</span></div></div>",

At first I was really stressed out about it but my mom calmed me down. She made me realize that being a bit heavy isn't so bad. Now we have lunch dates all the time and Ino and her mom come as well! It's awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it,\" Shizune replied, allowing the younger ninja to go ahead of her and giving the assistant a prime view of the bulging butt Sakura was gaining slowly but surely. Her hands felt her own butt then and she cringed when she felt that there were actual rolls and quite a lot of them too, to say nothing about how her hips were starting to touch both sides of the stairs, despite the fact that the stairwell was almost four feet in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling up, not wanting to think about her own heavy condition, Shizune hurried into the room and ran smack dab into Tsunade's globular gut. Shizune was sent onto her rear, fat body jiggling as she noticed just how much more of her mentor there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to Tsunade's laziness, Shizune rarely got to see the full impact all of those empty calories had had on her lady. But now...now Shizune saw just how obese Tsunade had become. She was a titan of fat, a monument to adipose, an obese woman's obese woman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs were a bit red from chafing, seeing as how they were just mashed together, even though Tsunade had her legs apart a fair amount. Her hips...Shizune couldn't think of a word to describe them to say nothing about the rear that was casting a shadow over the tubby Sakura standing behind Tsunade. Tsunade's boobs were probably half the size of Shizune's whole upper half and made her actually shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow...how had they allowed this to happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was helped to her feet, panting slightly, she noticed just how winded Tsunade was, her pants sounding like a dying pig's. How many chins did Tsunade have now? And how many chipmunks could live in those cheeks of hers?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this fat overwhelmed the assistant and she hurried out of the room and into the empty bedroom of the Hokage, fat hand wiping away some sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...okay...think Shizune...there has to be something more going on here...\"</span></div></div>",

She would eat and eat and eat, grow accustomed to the amount of food, thus causing her appetite to increase, only for Sakura to make more to keep pace with her expanding appetite. It all seemed so simple, but so very hard to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey hadn't done much of anything these past few months, actually. Sakura handled the book keeping and organizing straight. She must have been gaining weight sometime there too, though Shizune couldn't quite place when the pinkheaded girl's toned body became quite so round. Tsunade's job was taken care of, and anything that needed doing she would (and often did) send Sakura in her place to do it, or an equally qualified individual. So it was no shocker as to how <i>she</i> got so fat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her? What happened to her morals? What happened to her self control? More importantly, what happened to moderation?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey certainly had snuck up on her, those big four-foot hips of hers. Her walk long ago had become a waddle. And then later an awkward wobble to and fro. Sure there was always a period of woe when it came to how much she ate on a daily basis... why couldn't she just go back in time and listen?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetter yet, why couldn't she just have destroyed that stupid cookbook Sakura found?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Th-The cookbook!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat had to be it! It contained some sort of ancient recipes that made people gain an astonishing amount of weight! There was no way esteemed, dignified ninja such as themselves would lean so dangerously close over the edge of mindless gluttons! And especially her; she was the levelheaded one in the office! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that did little to change her paunch now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune grabbed at her lowermost roll, the doughy texture filling and spilling from her equally chubby palm. It was delicate and soft to the touch. Not perfectly round but broken into segments through gravity, her lovehandles being the widest and her breasts the smallest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever at this point Shizune cared not that her breasts were still quite under average size for a woman of her impeccable bulk, but that she carried around more than enough weight to satisfy four Shizunes! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was all that damned cookbook's fault! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll those mindless meals where she simply stuffed herself silly! Her inability to refuse food from anyone anymore! Her weight problem and all burdens associated with it! The thundering footsteps that followed around her Hokage as she waddled around the office like a hopeless heifer! All on that damndable book!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Shizune!\" Sakura called, \"I was just about to pull lunch out, would you like your bag in here or in there today?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was on instinct that Shizune's reaction was based.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a snap, all worries were temporarily cleared from her mind. She could suddenly smell whatever it was that must have been in Sakura's bags on the way up to the office much more clearly now, able to pick out the very ingredients used to make today's smorgasbord. She drooled slightly as her mind went blank and her appetite took over, moving one super-thick leg in front of her clumsily as she lumbered towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...\" her stomach grumbled loudly, forgetting the impeccable breakfast that Shizune had fed it earlier, \"Well I suppose... <i>one</i> more meal wouldn't kill me.\" she reasoned, \"After all, I could always look at that cookbook after lunch... or dinner.\" she said dimly as she took another step forward, \"Or tomorrow. Tomorrow would probably be better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Shizune failed to notice her flaring thighs getting dangerously close to the doorway, and where she completely ignored the slight pinch of her massive rear squeezing through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good you're here!\" pudgy Sakura said kindly as she smiled, \"Are you ready for lunch? I thought we'd go simple and I'd just make some sandwiches today. Tsunade just headed towards the dining hall and Ino should be here soon to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure...\" Shizune trailed off with a hungry look in her eye, \"Sounds good to me...\" </span></div></div>",

Meats of all kinds were scrunched together and doused with a rainbow of condiments, the most prevalent being mayo and a kind that looked more like lard than regular mayonnaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there were forty of the sandwiches on Shizune's plate alone. Sakura's plate held fifteen, Ino's fifty, and Tsunade's a whopping eighty, stacked in layer after layer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to speak up, to warn them about what she considered the root of all this softness, but she picked up her first sandwich instead, cramming it deeply into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, the minutes becoming hours, she observed the Hokage finish off all eighty only to demand more, a demand Sakura was happy to supply, pushing twenty onto the Hokage's plate.

It wasn't practical, but she had only really needed to hide it for a short bit anyway. Shizune knocked on the door rather nervously, not really knowing quite to expect in Ino's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door swung open to reveal a pleasantly plump woman, whose hair and eyes matched Ino's almost exactly. \"Welcome!\" she said. \"I assume you are Shizune?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... yes, I am.

In the picture, Mrs. Yamanaka was HUGE! She had massive breasts, each the size of a watermelon, a ponderously large gut, obviously her most prominent part, that seemed to be the size of an over-inflated beach ball! Her butt was by no means small, either, having massive butt cheeks the same size as her breasts crammed into her robes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right? I was huge! Now here you go: 5 pairs of sweatpants, a tank top, a sweat shirt, and a few shirts. There are some panties and bras in there, too. Change into something, then join us at the dinner tale when you are done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune had changed into a set of grey sweatpants and the tank top, and she was pleasantly surprised by the fact that everything was still big for her. Sitting down with Ino and Sakura at the table, they waited expectantly for Ino's mom to finish cooking. And when she finally did, they weren't let down: Each girl got a massive serving of spaghetti, a whole chicken, and a bowl of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph... Wow Mrs. Yamanaka, thish ish great!\" said Shizune with a mouth full of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! And please, just call me Rena.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, and everyone was stuffed to the gills. Sakura and Rena had managed to eat a chicken, 3 plates of spaghetti, 2 bowls of ramen, and a few slices of cake. On the other side of the table, Shizune had just devoured everything in sight... and Ino had matched her plate for plate. They had eaten an entire pot of spaghetti apiece, managed to put away 3 whole chickens, 8 bowls of ramen, and some how still had room for  pieces of cake each. Needless to say, they weren't going to be doing much of anything for the next few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shizune, will you need a place to stay tonight?\" asked Rena casually, knowing full well how difficult it would be to walk on that full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShizune blushed fiercely. \"Yes please...\"</span></div></div>",

They'd also have to accompany whichever character you chose initially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far that's it...have fun!</td>",
