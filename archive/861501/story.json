He was just going to take Keiko for a nice walk around town, something he couldn't care less about but Keiko wanted to do, so he begrudgly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he's shrimp size, with a giant Keiko standing over him. Keiko just stared down at him, not believing her eyes. Seeing Yusuke, her long time friend so small stunned her a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Earth To Keiko!\u201d Yusuke said in a sour mood \u201cKeiko get your head out of the clouds and answer me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Yusuke, i almost didn't see you down there\u201d Keiko said in a joking manner, after getting over the initial shock. She wore a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeiko, why the hell did you shrink me!\u201d Yusuke asked straight to the point. Keiko just turned her head and moved her brown hair out of the way from her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that Yusuke, your gonna have to speak up. I cant here you from all the way up here\u201d Keiko teased again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeiko!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh your probably wondering why i shrunk you, right Yusuke\u201d She said looking at him again \u201cWell i shrunk you because, I'm sick of it Yusuke. You ditching school and ruining your future! Im here to put an end to it\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d Yusuke said a little surprised \u201cYou never gave a damn about it before\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes i did! You just wouldn't listen!\u201d Keiko argued back, her voice being much louder \u201cThats why i did this\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shrunk me down to Scold me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, at first but looking at you now. I think we can have some fun with you at that size\u201d Keiko said with a sly smirk. Normally when they play, Yusuke is the one to tease her out of enjoyment. Always living up skirt and poking her bum. Now... now its Keiko\u2019s time to have some fun \u201cNow let me get you inside, before my Neighbours Cat comes and eats you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko crouched down and with her free hand grabbed Yusuke. Yusuke of course tried to resist but there wasn't much he could do to Keiko at this size. Granted unless he wants to blast her with his Spirit Gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko brings Yusuke to her face smiling at him. Deciding to tease him a bit more Keiko said.\u201cYou know your a lot more manageable this size\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what! We still going around town!\u201d Yusuke snapped back as Keiko shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot now. I doubt you'd be able to keep up with my pace. So i think we can just hang out in my room. And we can have fun, you know like we did when we were kids.\u201d Keiko said \u201cAnd maybe i can actually get you to listen for once\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko didn't even wait for his response as she lowered her hand and started walking up to her room. ideas racing through her mind about what to do with Yusuke. So many opportunities, and since she's in charge. She can take as much time as she wants doing it</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hearing Keiko's voice again was the last thing he needed. Yusuke did not really understand Keiko's motives for shrinking him nor did he even care. He wanted his usual freedom, deliquent style, while not on Spirit Detective duty. He could only watch from his glass imprisonment in the girl's room as he waited for his captor to come up. Whatever Keiko had in store for him, Yusuke was ready to deal with the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Yusuke!\" Keiko's voice rang louder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreat... What does she want now? Yusuke thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko returned upstairs, holding another reversed styrofoam cup in her hands with several tiny holes on its bottom and a tiny piece of cardboard covering its mouth, on top the pal of her hand. She opened the top of Yusuke's confinement and out came from her possession Kurama, Hiei, and even Kuwabara, shrunken down to Yusuke's diminutive size. The three allies landed near their friend with Kuwabara landing headfirst on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also shrunk your friends too,\" Keiko said, winking without a hint of remorse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in hell did you do that?!\" Yusuke shouted. Kurama rubbed his head, shaken from the ride while Hiei looked indifferently at the clumsy Kuwabara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I orginally thought about keeping you small to keep you in order,\" Keiko explained. \"But this fun thought came to mind! While I do respect the four of you keeping order between the real world and the spirit world, I think that shrinking you guys will help you lighten up from all of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, not my idea of lightening up,\" Hiei said, glaring at the giant girl. Behind his white headband, the dark light silhoutte of his Jagan lit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiei, what are you doing?\" Kurama asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke, I mean no offense to you or your girlfriend, but she made the biggest mistake of her life by messing with me like this,\" Hiei said, holding his right arm up. It looked as though he was going to summon the Dragon of the Darkness Flame to punish the giant Keiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiei, you do realize that she used Botan's Mystic Whistle to draw you here after successfully deceiving Kuwabara and myself,\" Kurama said. \"She shot you first before you recovered from the whistle's call and escaped and we were easily prey to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, which is why she's-ugh!\" Hiei shouted, falling on his knee. The black flames that surrounded his arm dissipated. \"Wh-where's... my dragon?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama looked at him ponderingly, taking out a blood red rose that he kept in his long red hair. Holding it in the air, he swung at it down, testing his theory on why Hiei's Darkness Dragon disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose Whip!\" Kurama shouted. The rose did not extend into the throny whip he often used in battle. He remained the same, save it for a few red petals drifting off its head from the swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurama?\" Yusuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I thought; our shurken state has weakened our spirit powers and abilities,\" Kurama explained. \"We can't use techniques to break free from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since I know you won't break out of here, I'll be back for the real fun,\" Keiko said, making a peace sign and winked. \"I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner! Be right back, boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko left her room, leaving the shrunken team to themselves. Whatever they had to break out was worthless now due to their shunken states. And who knew what Keiko would do to them as punishment if they were caught free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this sucks,\" Hiei sad, lying on the glass wall. \"We've been captured by the detective's girlfriend and forced to be her playthings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, Hiei,\" Kurama said, optimistic. \"I don't think Keiko would do anything bad at us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but she's a smart girl,\" Yusuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, she knows a way to torture us without... torturing us?\" Kuwabara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think, Kuwabara, or whatever's left of your brain from your fall will melt,\" Hiei scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got something to say, even shorter shrimp?!\" Kuwabara shouted, all in front of Hiei's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, stop fighting!\" Yusuke shouted, pulling Kuwabara away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right,\" Kurama said. \"Let's at least try to escape before our captor comes back. We all know she's too nice to give us any horrible punishments.\"  </span></div></div>",

I don't belong here!\" Kuwabara cried, slamming his fists upon the glass containment that trapped him and his allies within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, throwing a tandrum; why am I not surprised?\" Hiei scoffed, looking away from the approaching, enraged Kuwabara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got something to say, shorter stack?!\" Kuwabara shouted, attempting to grab Hiei by his white scarf, but failed after forgetting about Hiei's swiftness. Hiei disappeared and reappeared next to Kuwabara, holding up his shrunken katana near his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never try that on me,\" Hiei adviced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara trembled, unable to fight back since his shrunken state had prevented the use of his own Spirit Sword. He relaxed when Hiei finally withdrew his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys should not be fighting,\" Kurama said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And instead, help us on getting out of here before Keiko comes back!\" Yusuke added. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small team started to hear voices coming outside of Keiko's room. Familiar voices. They were higher-pitched and feminine. One thought races across the minds of the shrunken guys; their faces were appalled at the thought of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke, this is your final warning,\" Hiei said, pointing at Yusuke. \"Your girlfriend is definitely going to 'get it' if she humiliates me like this again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiei, chill,\" Yusuke said. \"I still don't know why Keiko shrunk you guys when she only wanted me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here they come!\" Kuwabara shouted, frantically pointing at the slightly ajar door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door opened up with Keiko leading, followed by the female friends she made since her discovery of Yusuke fighting supernatural creatures: Botan, the cheery Spirit World guide; Shizuru, Kuwabara's older sister; and even Yukina, an innocent ice maiden/apparition who was known as Hiei's sister to all but herself, Keiko, and Kuwabara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There they are, girls!\" Keiko pointed out the durable glass jar left on the table, containing Team Urameshi. \"I told you girls I've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Botan exclaimed, peering up close with Yukina on the tiny captives. \"You guys are cute for being small, not counting Hiei at his former height!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiei fumed, crossed his arms, and looked away from the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yukina!\" Kuwabara greeted, running up to Yukina's face, but collided with the transparent glass barrier that trapped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! So you've got Kazuma, Yusuke, Kurama, ... and Hiei,\" Yukina said, focusing her glimpse on him. She could not help but feel something for the one who secretly watched over her with his Jagan, making sure she was safe and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't surprise me that you got Kazuma, but how did you even get a hold of Kurama and Hiei?\" Shizuru asked, disposing her last cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple: Kurama did not suspect me, of all people, to pull this kind of stunt and I stunned Hiei with the Mystic Whistle and shrunk him first before he got away,\" Keiko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so now what?\" Shizuru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeiko picked up the jar holding Yusuke, Kuwabara, Kurama, and Hiei in with both hands, slowly opening the hole-tattered top. She unsealed the top and held it in front of the small group girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we each take a boy to play and spend time with?\" Keiko suggested. \"Just don't pick Yusuke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotan, Shizuru, and Yukina grinned, glancing at the jar while the guys made no attempts at escape. Yusuke glared back at the giant girls, Kurama paced about slowly upon their current predicament, Kuwabara was blowing kisses to Yukina, and Hiei sat at the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure it's okay by them?\" Yukina asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not going to hurt them, we're just getting the advantage over these guys,\" Keiko said. \"They really need to lighten up in spite of all the fighting they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukina! Pick me!\" Kuwabara shouted at the top of his lungs, hopping wildly for his love interest's attention. A hand swooped in and grabbed Kuwabara tightly. \"... Oh, man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bro, but she's way out of your league,\" Shizuru said to her tiny brother in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn!\" Botan exclaimed, looking upon the remaining choices. Yusuke was already taken by Keiko so the only choices for the perky guide were Kurama and Hiei. \"Hmm... I think I'll toy with Hiei!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotan reached down to get him, but then felt a stinging sensation on her index finger. She reeled her hand back, seeing a scratch on her finger with little blood slowly dripping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrunken or not, I will not be made a fool!\" Hiei declared, sheathing his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yukina, you can have him,\" Botan said, winking at the confused Ice Maiden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, you sure he won't cut me?\" Yukina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me! You two are practically the same kin!\" Botan exclaimed. Hiei glared at her, sending her a telepathic death message. By her body language, Botan turned away, shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay,\" Yukina said. She reached into the jar to get Hiei. The latter looked at Kurama for advice, who could only shrug with a sheepish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Only for her, Hiei thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiei accepted his fate into Yukina's large, soft hand, not wanting to offend her as much as he dislike be \"played\" with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that leaves Kurama with me then,\" Botan said, using her other hand to take him out while sucking on the small wound Hiei left for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ladies, we have our guys!\" Keiko exclaimed, taking out Yusuke and placing the empty jar back on the table. \"What shall we do with them as a group?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

No one spoke any ideas due to none coming to mind, Yukina was too pure to think of anything, Shizuru's ideas were too rough; the only people suited for coming up with something were Botan and Keiko, and they seemed to know it too. But even with this knowledge there were no ideas coming to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally ever so bluntly Shizuru muttered, \"How about we just have em give us a foot rub while we think this through?\" Everyone, shrinkees included turned to look at Shizuru as if she had the plague. But after a couple minutes Yukina smiled and nodded, \"Sounds like a good idea to me Shizuru. If they agree to it of course, I mean...I don't want to impose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotan jumped in, \"Oh relax, they'd love to do it...not that they have a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing at all!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith three girls approving it everyone turned to Keiko, who appeared slightly nervous. She nodded, \"Well with all the yes' I don't wanna stand out. Sounds good to me.\" Every girl got close with their shrunken companion and held them close enough for all to hear. \"Do you guys agree?\" It was Yukina who bothered asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no! Little or not I ain't no masseuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A real man doesn't submit like that! If it was Yukina maybe, but not for you sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would never even think of degrading myself to something such as massaging a foot, even if it is Yukina's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd love too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" Yusuke, Kuwabara, and Hiei all looked at Kurama as if he had gone off the deep end; in fact, Hiei had his hand on his blade already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama smiled softly and gave a peaceful gesture, whispering words too low for the giantesses to hear. \"We have to play along, use your heads for a second.\" Clicking their respective tongues the rest of Team Urameshi fell silent; Kurama was as always, right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like they agree!\" Botan exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's do this.\" Shizuru grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly each girl removed their respective footwear and sat on the floor, in an X-Shaped pattern with Keiko across from Shizuru and Botan from Yukina. Their feet together seemed to wall the four who were at their soles. \"Get to it!\" Keiko mischievously winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach member of Team Urameshi looked at their companions barefeet with apprehension. Yusuke wasn't too happy with Keiko's feet, being ever so busy she had a fair amount of sweat and Yusuke wanted no part of that. Botan was in a similar boat so Kurama was more or less in the same situation. Hiei apparently lucked out, being an Ice Maiden Yukina had no sweat along her soles and her feet were as pure as she was. Poor Kuwabara drew the short straw, Shizuru's feet were as sweaty as both Keiko and Botan's feet combined and appeared very tense; right now Kuwabara wished his sister didn't excersise daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara pointed to Hiei. \"Hey shorty! Only I deserve Yukina, I would show her feet the proper respect of a man. Hell I'd even kiss em to make her happy, but you...you don't deserve it. You two have nothing in common!!\" Yusuke and Kurama had to bite their lips not to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Hiei could respond a loud voice from behind Kuwabara spoke, \"Oh is that so lil bro? In that case I'm sure you'll do the same for your <i> Big </i> Sister. After all, we are family, and you would never trade me for some girl you're crushing on. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes Mistr- Sister!\" Every girl (Except Yukina) looked at Shizuru almost fearfully, the shrunken men shook their heads at Kuwabara who had begun eagerly massaging to please his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKurama sighed, \"It may not be ideal but this helps us think too. I recommend we begin before they grow impatient.\" With no delay Kurama got to work as well. With a click of their tongues Hiei and Yusuke wordlessly did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments it was clear how the massages were going; all we doing good but had very different effects. Yusuke was doing little more than barraging Keiko's feet with punches in an attempt to put enough force behind it; the end result being he was almost hitting <i> too </i> hard, he was doing a little bit more harm than good in the long run, but it felt sort of good. Being faster than holy hell Hiei was all over the place, in seconds he covered all of both of Yukina's feet, but he continued over and over so he could properly please his sister. Kurama massaged like he battled, like a tactician. He mentally evaluated the best spots and struck with precision, massaging almost as well as a professional. And again Kuwabara crapped out; because of his loud mouth he was forced to both kiss AND massage his sisters feet. And due to being forced to kiss, Kuwabara was unable to effectively massage, so he was doing little more than rubbing his hands into the squishy flesh of his sister as his lips made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results of each massage were clear on the girl's faces. Yukina and Botan appeared to be in heaven, smiling and even giggling occasionally. Keiko was smiling but every once in a while she'd make a small wincing sound. As for Shizuru....she had her eyes closed and her lips locked into a frown like she was a dominatrix....poor Kuwabara. All in all it could've been much worse, the feet of each girl wasn't that bad (Shizuru excluded.) and once the gang got into the massage they made sure to do it right. All the while Kurama was thinking up a plan and the others were leaving the plan to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they soon finished, Yusuke was panting, Kurama and Hiei had faint sweat on their brow, and Kuwabara was collapsed in exhaustion. And there was still more to come...</span></div></div>",

And, on top of that, we would probably be killed by the broken shards waiting for us at the bottom.\" Hiei stated calmly, angering Kuwabara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Kurama, \"If we were to push just enough over the edge to leave a gap we could squeeze through, we might be able to somehow climb down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team quickly agreed to this idea(no one could suggest anything better) and began the process of pushing the glass.

I just thought I should get to have some fun instead of the icy cold getting to have you instead. You may like it! Besides the pain and all. My skin always smells of sweet flowers, and I'm very soft.

It felt...different as if it belonged to Keiko and wasn't just the result of Yusuke's energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain in Keiko subsided and was soon replaced with an odd feeling, not necessarily a bad one just odd. \"What's happening?\" Keiko asked aloud as she miraculously...began to grow!</span></div></div>",

People began gathering around the amazon sized giantess, murmuring to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit staring at me!\" Keiko shrieked, slapping her hand against the crowd and actually swiping them all away, she was now thirty feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is this going to stop?!\" Keiko screamed as she placed a hand on the top of a small building, her clothes had large tears everywhere in them at this point. Keiko's bare feet were the size of small cars now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn on coming car didn't see the growing giantess until it was too late, with a horrific sounding screech the car swerved to its side and slammed into Keiko's ankle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" The giantess yelled, feeling as if she had been punched in the ankle. Another series of ripping noises told Keiko her skirt was gone and her azure panties stretched to their limits. Keiko had now approached fifty feet in height and was still going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking nervously down at the town Keiko shuffled her feet in an attempt to avoid crushing anyone but her left foot found its way onto a car and caused Keiko to fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!!\" She screamed as she fell back, she could hear the terrified shrieks of people getting crushed under her massive frame. With her head on the street Keiko kept growing, her body was becoming to big for the street to hold her so buildings began to get forcefully pushed aside by her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet another loud rip caused Keiko to look down, her top had come off and her bra didn't look like it would last.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop staring at me!\" Keiko pleaded to the random citizens who could see her, she began to raise herself back up only to see she was now big enough to be seen by the entire town. She rivaled the tallest buildings and showed no signs of stopping her growth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud pop was heard as Keiko's top literally burst from its hems leaving her chest exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing wildly Keiko shrieked and grabbed a nearby skyscraped, literally tearing it in half and using the part she ripped off as a cover for her chest. The feeling within Keiko didn't subside, in fact in continued to grow until Keiko felt her body would burst, This next growth would top all of her last ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud moan that held a mixture of terror and pleasure Keiko's body began to expand once more, crushing several buildings beneath her growing feet. Keiko's forced her eyes shut, hoping it was all just a horrible dream but she opened them eventually and to her relief she seemed to have stopped growing; to her horror she was now at least 200 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Keiko saw that she was completely exposed, the building she held gave way to her increasing size and strength. By her feet were people half the size of her toes who were just staring at her.....assets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stare at me!\" She screamed as she raised a foot and stepped over them all with it, crushing their frail bodies beneath her bare sole. Raising her foot Keiko gasped as she saw small splats of blood where the people were, examining her sole she saw blood oozing all over her foot. The last thing those people would ever remember was the smell and feeling of Keiko's bare foot.</span></div></div>",
