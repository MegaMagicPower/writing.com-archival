Having decided to ditch school after what had happened in the morning. Once behind closed and locked doors, Adam opened his hand and looked down at the jewel. It was about half the size of a post-it note and was a deep blood Red. Yet there was something about it that made Adam steal it when walking through the mall that morning. He always walked through the mall on the way to the bus stop. But today something had told him to go inside that creepy antique store. While inside, he saw the jewel and just knew he had to have it. Staring down at it now, Adam couldn't believe what he had done. \u201cI've never stolen anything in my life. Why would I steal something like this?\u201d In the back of his mind, he suddenly heard a voice.</span></div></div>",

Every want and desire you have will be granted!** Adam winced in pain suddenly as the voice quieted and a throbbing pain filled his hand. Looking at the jewel, he dropped it. Or at least tried to. Right before his eyes, the jewel began sinking into the palm of his hand. <br>\r\n     \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Reaching over with his right hand, Adam tried to pull it out his palm. It wouldn't budge. Just when he thought it would be stuck there forever, the blood red jewel began moving down his palm and settled on the underside of his wrist. A small part of the jewel now showing above his skin. \u201cOkay... this is weird.\u201d Picking at it, Adam's face paled. He could now feel through the jewel. As if it was a part of him. \u201cWait! If that voice was right, all my wants and desires will be granted. So... I wish this jewel was out of my wrist.\u201d Looking at his wrist, Adam waited...and waited... but nothing happened. \u201cGreat, so wishes don't work.\u201d Groaning, Adam decided to head upstairs and put on a long sleeve shirt to at least hide the jewel till he could think of a way to remove it.</span></div></div>",
