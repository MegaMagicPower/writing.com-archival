As if there weren't enough wars throughout the realms before. However, this didn't seem to be an ordinary war. He had set upon a land being threatened by phantom warriors- known as Einherjar. Nobody knows where they came from, but they had a knack for destruction, and this place was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the world of Nordion was enveloped by the war against the Einherjar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the knight squad up to the front! Don't give them an easy pass!\" commanded Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said a soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg had no experience in war, but he was a trained fighter himself. He had studied a bit as a tactician, but not very much. Still, it was enough to get him through. He was a competent fighter, and could hang with some of the best from his home. However, that sometimes paled in comparison to other realm soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that was beside the point. Greg had to duck again to avoid a sea of arrows, inching up against the side of the trench. He was just traveling when he got roped in by the locals, hoping for a fighter like him to help them. Greg hated being in a war but, thanks to his nature, he ended up helping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was surely regretting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got half a mind to leave, but then these people might die. Ugh, think Greg!\" he reprimanded himself. What would Dad do in this situation? Probably joke about it while Mom hit him. Greg amused himself with a little laugh there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chuckle was interrupted with another nearby explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, Einherjar pack a punch.\" said Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one Einherjar jumped up and appeared to have the edge on him. However, light poured through Greg's fingers as he held his hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Book of Naga!\" His light spell repelled the warrior, killing it easily. However, the spell took quite a bit of energy so Greg had to catch his breath for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No end to them.\" he groaned.</span></div></div>",

It became harder and harder for Greg to hold them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many are there?\" Greg yelled over the roar of the battlefield. He soon felt that the next wave was on top of him when he saw a massive explosion, which Greg recognized as a spear tearing apart the incoming Einherjar.

But ended up with swords and lances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked across the line and saw something glisten through the smoke. An arrow through flew and pierced his chest. He fell off the horse which ran off and clutched his chest. Greg jumped from the trench and ran toward him. \"You alright?\" Was all Greg got out before he heard roaring and saw another wave incoming. He pulled one of Jacob's arms over his shoulder and shouted, \"Fall back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg ran, trying to get Jacob to safety when...</span></div></div>",

I think I can live.\" said Jacob, trying stay on his feet as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's at least get you away from the line of fire.\" said Greg as he limped with Jacob away from the armies and into the nearby woods. However, he could still feel arrows and magic spells being launched into the woods, a few of them almost hitting them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, these Einherjar don't give up.\" grumbled Greg as he and Jacob limped through. As they walked through, Greg suddenly saw something in the distance. It looked a bit like an Outrealm Gate, but it was smaller, and the blue energy inside swirled differently than a normal gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go through the gate? It could give us some time to recover from this.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a retreat would be wise right now. I'm not much use with this wound.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate it is then.\" grumbled Greg as he tried to rush them both towards the gate, avoiding any wayside arrows and magic spells coming through. One javelin nearly missed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who are they aiming for?\" grumbled Greg as he and Jacob approached the gate. The differences the gate had from a normal gate worried Greg a bit, but he didn't have time to analyze the situation. He had to do what was best for him and Jacob right now. Greg hoisted Jacob up and jumped them both through the gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy inside the gate felt like nothing Greg ever felt before. He couldn't even keep himself awake as the energy swirled around him. Jacob soon lost consciousness, and Greg soon followed as the energy engulfed him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>After a while</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg slowly woke up to a bright blue sky, his body feeling groggy as he tried to move. He couldn't put his finger on it, but he felt....wierd. Like something was off. He slowly moved his head up, and his view was obstructed by two small mounds on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" cried Greg as he sat up. He was wearing a grandmaster outfit, but not one for a guy. His limbs were smaller, and he could see his thighs beneath the outfit, with slight heels on his boots. He push his hand to his head and felt short purple hair on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned around and saw a red-haired girl wearing red armor and yellow clothes underneath slowly get on her hands and feet. Their faces met for a split second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\"</span></div></div>",

She then realized that her wound was still there, but healed a bit. She saw Greg stand and reach a hand out. Jacob took it reluctantly as she stood with Greg. \"Thanks.

Looking up at the sky, she imagined that it was a little past noon or so. The horse even seemed to be slowing down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I think we should take a break.\" said Greg. \"No one seems to be following us, and the horse could use the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" said Jacob as she turned the horse a bit off the main road they found. There was a nearby stream, where the horse could get a drink and Jacob and Greg could finally clean their face after who knows how long in that war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jacob splashed water on her face, she looked at her reflection. She looked considerably older than before, perhaps in her early 30's. However, she looked fairly beautiful for that age, looking quite youthful. Her white armor looked rather clean against her red clothes. She looked to the side, seeing the other girl with her, a considerably younger one, possibly in late teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I never introduced myself. My name is Jacob, or at least it was anyway.\" said Jacob, holding her hand out to Greg, who took the hand as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Greg.\" she said before looking over Jacob. \"You look like Titania, the Scarlet Paladin. I heard she was quite the warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smirked. \"Not quite as famous as who you are. Katarina, the Lost Tactician. Said to have led great armies for the Hero-King.\" she said, making Greg blush a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm hardly able to live up to her legacy. I'm not that good at strategy.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were good enough to save me, so I think you're alright.\" smirked Jacob before helping Greg up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked through their inventory, seeing that they even had new weapons to help out with their new forms. Greg had a Katarina's Bolt and an Eliwood's Blade. Jacob had a silver lance and a Titania's Axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was a good break. Shall we get going? We need to see which realm we're in.\" said Jacob who mounted the horse, Greg following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" said Greg. \"Funny, I figured you and I would be freaking out more over this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, war has a tendency to get other things off the mind. Who knows what will happen once it settles.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.

She felt a hand on her shoulder, \"You feeling okay Jacob?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked back and smiled. \"Thanks, but I'm fine. Just tired is all,\" Jacob said smiling back to Greg warmly when they reached a hill on the road and saw a city in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we found civilization,\" Greg said. \"Come on, let's hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob made the horse hurry toward the city as it galloped closer to the gates. Upon reaching it, Jacob dismounted the horse as Greg stayed in top and walked toward a stable. A few people stopped to look at them as they passed by. \"Why do you think they're looking at us like that Greg?\" Jacob asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably surprised to see the co-leader of the Greil Mercenaries and the tactician for the Hero-King in the same place at once.\" Greg said with a smile. She hopped off the horse's back as Jacob placed her horse in the stable. She turned and walked by Greg as they entered the city. It was large as people roamed the streets every which way and that. \"This is incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob nodded. Greg looked over and saw Jacob with tired eyes. \"I suppose this day has been a long, hard and surprising one at that.\" Greg said with a smile. \"Let's rest somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two found an inn and sat outside it, not yet going in. \"So what do you think?\" Jacob asked Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do you think we'll be like this?\" Jacob asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg shrugged. \"Not sure, but I'm too intrigued to leave now.

She felt like she needed to do something, then she saw a training barracks nearby. \"Maybe I should train a little as Titania.\" Jacob said as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the soldier who kept the barracks records was a bit shocked to see Jacob. With as little much as a \"Hello\" and a \"Please\" she was allowed for training. She held her axe in her hand, which felt good for some reason and began swinging at targets filled with hay. She switched between her axe to a sword to a lance to a spear and everything inbetween.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally walked out with a bit of a sweat, a little exhausted when she decided to see her horse at the stables. She entered and found the horse. It was armored from head to hoof with metal. She detached the headpiece of armor and brushed the brown horse's mane. \"Not only am I Titania but I have her horse?...I don't know if I should enjoy this or not.\" Jacob mused to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood a little later and walked through the town in blazing heat. When Jacob finally returned to the hotel, she was sweating.

Quite a few of the merchants there actually tried to suggest stuff to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there pretty lady, I bet this will look perfect on you.\" smiled one merchant who was selling a necklace. Greg wasn't quite sure how a girl would act in this situation, but she tried to let him down nicely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, it's okay.

Something inside her seemed intrigued by the little store, and before she knew it she walked inside and began looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny. I never read that many books in Kirada.\" said Greg as she grabbed one random book off the shelf. To her surprise, it was a book on battle strategy. Immediately, Greg felt intrigued by the book, and found a nearby seat to read. As she opened it and began to read, she found her entire attention span taken up by the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this book is fascinating. I could use this later on. Perhaps there are others.\" said Greg, getting up with the book in hand. She walked through the book shelves, finding at least 3 more books she was interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she found them all, she went over and paid for them. They didn't cost a lot, so that was good for her. When she got them all, she walked out of the store, her strategy book underneath her arms, and the rest in a bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny, I never had that much interest in books. Is there a reason I like to read them?\" she asked herself. As she said that, she saw a cloaked figure walking around near the alleys. It looked a bit suspicious, so Greg followed the figure closely. The figure seemed to see him, but didn't panic and turned a corner to an unoccupied alley. Greg walked in behind it, until they were out of common view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think I would see you here so soon.\" smiled the figure who flipped his cloak back, revealing itself to be Marth. Greg gasped a bit at seeing the Hero-King right in front of him. However, something seemed to trigger inside him. Something that felt different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Marth! What are you doing here?\" asked Greg, as if she knew him personally. Marth chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I enjoy walking among my people sometimes. Unfortunately, a cloak is the only way for me to do it without being mobbed.\" he chuckled again, which made Greg giggle. to her slight surprise. \"I must say though that I didn't expect you to be back so early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Early?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You left some time ago to see new places, explore, and learn new things. You seem to be a bit more well traveled now.\" he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I have been exploring for sure.\" mumbled Greg.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

They then parted ways as Greg walked through the streets carrying her books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I should find the inn. Jacob's probably there,\" Greg said. She soon found the inn and entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of looking through a guest logbook, she found which room Jacob was in. She ascended the stairs and opened the door to the room when she found it. She walked in to see something a little unexpected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob was wearing a nightgown of somekind, but it seemed too small. She fidgeted with it, trying to get it around the new weight on her chest. And when she did it as best se could, much of her legs were exposed still.

How's it going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's face blushed red as she tried to reposition her nightgown. \"There wasn't anyway I was gonna sleep in that armor, so a merchant offered me a nightgown.

He was so happy with all the battle strategies I told him.\" smiled Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Jacob. At that, Greg shook her head and refocused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I did meet him honestly. He did seem happy at everything I told him. He's every bit as nice as the legends say.\" smiled Greg. Jacob smiled as well, feeling happy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good for you. At least you met somebody today.

Some time later, Greg got a bookmark and closed her book, fascinated by what she read. She had a new appreciation for reading after what happened here today.

As they walked through the gate, they still retained their current looks, although the air felt quite heavy around them. It was definately unlike any normal gate Greg had gone through before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully we get out soon then.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he said that, a light that normally signaled the end of a gate appeared, engulfing both of them in a burst of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>The new realm</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg slowly woke up to a bright blue sky, although the air felt thin around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" he asked before gasping and moving his hands to his mouth. His voice sounded higher, more so than it did in the last realm. He didn't seen any obstruction in his view, so he slowly tried to sit up. He was wearing a red mantle and robe over a simple dress, with simple sandals on his feet. Further more, his body looked....smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" cried Greg as she stumbled to her feet. Looking down as she stood up, she saw that she looked like a child. She moved her hands over her body, feeling that it was about between 10-12 years old. She felt around her head, feeling purple hair tied up into ponytails on the sides of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I?\" she asked herself. She looked around, seeing that she was in a rather mountainous region, with some plains. However, she was on the summit of a really high one right now. Looking to the side, she saw a small creek running by. Running over, she looked at her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I'm Myrrh, the Great Dragon?\" she asked herself. Wait, that meant she was a Manakete! The very idea of being part of the legendary dragon race both excited and frightened Greg. They were hailed for their power, but also feared for it. In all the legends he heard, from Elibe to Tellius, dragons always lived in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind her, Greg saw a small round stone, shining yellow in the sunlight. She picked it up softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this must be my dragonstone. Heh, <i>my</i> dragonstone.\" giggled Greg, the very idea of actually having a dragonstone sounded so far-feteched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, where was Jacob?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob?!\" called Greg, hearing no response. \"Did he end up on another mountain?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, in the distance, she spotted something. A small town on a nearby summit. Greg wondered how anyone could live in this air, but she had no choice right now. Maybe Jacob ended up on another summit. She was sure Jacob would probably go to a town as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll luck out and it'll be this one.\" said Greg as she held her dragonstone in hand. Of course, she had no idea how to use such a thing. How does one use a dragonstone? She grasped the stone in both hands, trying to figure that out. However, as that happened, two golden wings popped out of her back, thankfully harmlessly. The rest of her body glowed as she transformed in to a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal.\" said Greg, feeling a bit unnerved but also empowered by it. Anyway, she now had a way to get to the the town. Flapping her wings, she flew off, thankful that she could figure that out quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Myrrh (Greg)*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender: Female (formerly male)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItems: Dragonstone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills: Limit Breaker, Wyrmsbane, Swordbreaker, Sol, Strength+2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****End bio*****</span></div></div>",

She quickly covered her mouth with one hand, it was another female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sat up as she saw her body had gotten much smaller. She gasped at her new body. She was significantly smaller than her last two forms. She wore a light pink cape around her neck and a pink garb on her midsection with purple bands wrapped around her hands.. Jacob found a small pond and looked at her reflection and saw Tiki's face with her special ornament in her green hair. She couldn't believe, \"Am I...Lady Tiki?\" Jacob said in her voice. Jacob was shocked by this when he saw a pouch hanging from her waist. She reached in and pulled out a small stone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, is this...?\" Jacob began in her new voice. She held it in her hand when she suddenly saw a pink wall surround her. As fast as the change was, it was exhilarating as Jacob came out as a Divine Dragon. \"Whoa...\" Jacob said awestruck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't have time to look at his new form, where did Greg go? Jacob flew up and saw a town, but he also saw a large dragon fly near him. Heading towards the town. Jacob chased it down. \"Greg?!\" Jacob yelled. The other dragon turned it's head and stopped flying as the two floated above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jacob! There you are, I was wondering where you were!\" Greg said in a high-pitched voice. \"What happened to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like a Manakete realm,\" Jacob replied. \"Look, let's land at the town and catch our bearings before we do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg agreed as the two dragons floated down toward the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nName: Jacob (Tiki)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecies: Manakete<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapons: Dragonstone+ and etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGender: Female<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills: Limit Breaker, Wyrmsbane, Swordbreaker, Movement +1, Defender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Greg thought about it for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. From what I hear, there weren't really different dragon types in Magvel. There seemed to be just one tribe, or at least one that was still alive when the Demon King supposedly returned.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Then again, she was the daughter of the leader, so maybe she was a divine dragon in a sense.\" said Jacob before smiling. \"Which makes you kind of like a Manakete Princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? So are you? Tiki, the Little Divine Dragon? Only daughter to Naga? You're in a new class of royalty.\" said Greg. That caught Jacob a bit off-guard; she obviously hadn't considered that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but it feels strange. I mean, being daughters of dragons. It's kind of weird, yet exciting.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm glad that flying seems to come second nature, otherwise we'd be stuck on those summits.\" said Greg.

As they did, both of them released their dragon forms, seeing each other as little girls for the first time.

The city castle was on it's own little piece of land, only connected to the town through a bridge. Of course, for Manaketes, the trip was no problem, and they often assisted any humans who needed to cross carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a long fall.\" said Greg as she took a quick look down. Perhaps it was because she had wings, but she didn't feel scared by the heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fly you across Mar-Mar.\" offered Jacob. Marth chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kind of you, but I can walk.\" he said, gong ahead to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for me!\" called Jacob as she began to follow him. Greg followed soon after. They crossed the bridge easily, getting to the entrance and getting past the guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this place is so different from Slovenia.\" awed Greg before putting a hand over her mouth. Where did that come from? She had never been anywhere else since coming here. Or did she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The throne room is just ahead! Come on!\" said Jacob, grabbing Marth's hand and pulling him along excitedly. Greg sighed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's natural that Tiki would be such a kid right now.\" said Greg. Once again, she stopped. It was as if she was thinking of Tiki, and not Jacob. Shaking her head, Greg kept up with the others. Soon enough, they reached the throne room, where they were met with an amazing sight. It wasn't often that someone got to meet Naga in person, looking ever as radiant as ever. Greg awed at the dragon queen, never imaging that there was still a realm where she was alive. This truly was a special realm indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom!\" chirped Jacob. Naga smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you are Tiki. I was a bit worried as to where you had gone. Did you have to find her, Prince Marth? I apologize for any inconvenience.\" apologized Naga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's all right. I enjoy Tiki's company.\" smiled Marth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy to hear that, especially due to the reason why I asked you to come.\" said Naga.</span></div></div>",

Cordelia herself really couldn't figure it out either. It felt like the Outrealm Gates that they had gone through with Chrom's army so long ago, and yet something about it was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder, maybe this goes to some different kind of place. Perhaps not like the ones from years ago.\" said Cordelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if we'll be able to get back at this back.\" said Sumia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure we will.

She felt...bigger, it that made sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a voice interrupted her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Marth!\" called a male voice. Somehow, Cordelia turned \"his\" head and saw a green-haired mage approaching, offering his hand to help Cordelia up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are sir. I was a bit worried after fighting those Dolhr forces. Everyone seemed to pass out.\" said the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" asked Cordelia, a bit taken back when he looked down at his appearance. You would think that appearing as the legendary Hero-King, Marth, would provoke some large reaction, but Cordelia seemed to have some hidden feelings that thought that it was okay. Despite that, Merric took his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Caeda passed out too. Everyone's tiring after all those Manaketes came out of the caves.\" explained Merric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCordelia had zero idea what was going on, but didn't have time to say much before Merric was dragging him away.</span></div></div>",

There was no argument there; he had to be defeated before they got to Medeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Thabes was very far, as in the corner of the continent far.

My house is a ways inside, so follow me.\" she said. As they walked in, many people gave signs of respect towards Elincia. Some even bowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, they really like you here. Do you do something for them?\" asked Katarina. Elincia wasn't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Maybe I did and I just don't remember.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, they finally reached the house after getting through more crowds of people.</span></div></div>",

Elincia walked Katarina to a chair and helped her sit as Elincia looked for some water and food. \"Thank you so much, er....\" Katarina said, not knowing her friend's name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elincia. And don't mention it Katarina,\" Elincia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatarina looked up at the sudden sounding of her name. \"How'd you know my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I don't remember...Maybe we should talk about our amnesia,\" Elincia said as she sat placing food in front of them both. \"Or at least what we remember about our amnesia. So Katarina, what do you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much. I remember a place called Guardia and a few people.\" Katarina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia was silent for a moment and then asked, \"These people...What do they look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatarina leaned back a moment. \"One had long red hair and rode a Pegasus like you, another had a regal suit and blue hair, and another was a man that vaguely looked like me and had red hair, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Elincia interrupted. \"I also remember a man with red hair that reminds me of you. But I also remember another Pegasus rider, but she had sliver hair, a knight with red hair, another Pegasus knight with blue hair, and a paladin with short brown hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, a thought was triggered in Katarina's mind of a man matching that description. She held her head as Elincia knelt by her side, \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...just remembered the man you described.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElincia nodded, \"Let's rest. Here.\" Elincia then left and returned with a nightgown for Katarina. \"Here, wear this.

He struggled to look up, trying to look himself over. He could see that his clothing was radically different from the Dread Fighter he was before.

The top had short sleeves, and he had some gloves on his hands, and his pants and boots looked typical enough, although perhaps a tiny bit weird for a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only that, Greg could feel something brush against his neck.

Of course, he imagined people might not recognize him the way he was right now. He wondered how long this new form would last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw signs of reconstruction around, and wondered how long the war had gone on. He decided to ask a random passer-by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me sir, but we've come here from a bit out of town. I heard there was a war here once.\" said Greg. The man didn't seem fazed by the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was. Started about 5 years ago or so. However, a few months ago, those warriors just went up and vanished.\" said the man, who walked away. Greg pondered the man's words as they found themselves an inn and sat down in their rooms not too long after. Jacob felt light-headed from it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he really say 5 years? Has that much time pasted?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. I can't seem to remember much from these past years, except that I have this feeling that I had a family of some sorts.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird, so did I.

The war seems to be elsewhere, according to that man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope my family back in Kiradia is still doing fine. If 5 years really has gone by. Then again, since we first went through that weird gate, I feel like we're not the same.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it. I mean, your whole physique is different, and the hair almost makes you look like a girl.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself.\" muttered Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the conversation went on for a while until they finally retired for bed.

She had long brown hair, most of it underneath a white garment on her head. She wore a brown dress that went down to the knees, with a white top covering her assets, as the dress didn't cover that area. She wore brown boots to complete the look.

A few villagers stopped and turned to look at Gabrielle, a few even bowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The village seems to be doing well, Julia,\" Gabrielle said as they continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things got better after Grima was finally settled with. Things are still tough out here, but we do our best to make it by. Come on, I'll show you my home.\" Julia said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Soon enough, on the outskirts of town was Julia's home. There were fields all around, either it had crops growing or it had animals grazing. The house was small with a hay roof, but it worked. \"Here it is. I know it's not much, but...\" Julia began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely,\" Gabrielle stated. \"You seem to be doing well. I'm glad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. I bet Donnel would like to meet you. Come on!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia went back around the house and, to both of their surprise, Donnel was stabbing bails of hay for no reason, holding a pitchfork like a spear. \"Donnel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel turned and blushed for a moment, looking embarrassed. \"O-Oh shoot! Hey ther' Julia!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing Donnel?\" Julia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel leaned the pitchfork against the shed and walked towards them. \"I thought it nice 'fer me to 'git a bit of training in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia smiled. \"Always getting stronger...\" Julia kissed Donnel on the cheek as he blushed again. \"Donnel, I want you to meet my friend Gabrielle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Donnel's pot that was on his head fell off in shock as he caught and turned red. \"Ya mean the one from Caerleon? Oh shoot! Yer' majesty!...er Ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabrielle chuckled. \"Calm down Donnel! You don't need to be so formal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonnel sighed one of relief and turned to Julia. \"So, is she staying with is fer now 'er...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. We need to meet Chrom back at Ylisstol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Guess I'll see ya later, sweetpea!\" Donnel said giving Julia a kiss. Gabrielle and Julia turned and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like he's quite the charmer,\" Gabrielle said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulia turned red in an instant. \"G-Gabrielle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabrielle laughed as they soon arrived in Ylisstol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He then saw a woman with pink hair sit up next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....what happened?\" The woman said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob looked over, \"Alright listen lady, I'm just looking for my friend Greg, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg...I'm...Greg. Where's Jacob?\" Greg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed. \"Great. The freakin Outrealm turned us into chicks!\" Jacob said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg saw herself and sighed, frustrated. \"Great. I guess we're stuck like this until we figure out something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob stood and realized that her body was in shape. Almost like the person he became was a thief already. He picked the woman up and saw her as a Myrmidon with not much covering her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked down her hands; gloved but smaller and nimbler than what she was used to. She looked down her body; a lithe and lean frame, although with a bit of muscle. Her black top covered her ample breasts snugly, and her short skirt revealed much of her lean legs, which were smooth yet strong. Her arms were much the same, lean but strong, as if a blade felt so natural in her hands. She put a hand to her head, feeling long light purple hair, most of it in a ponytail. It did a good job of keeping it out of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at who she assumed was Jacob. Her new form looked considerably older, and like a thief as he used to be. She had long blonde hair, and was quite taller than Greg was. Greg could swear that she had seen that look somewhere before but where?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, that wasn't important. She was furious right now. She walked right up and grabbed Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going genius! Your bright idea not only put us in the middle of nowhere, but now I'm a girl!\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it's any consolation, you're a good-looking girl.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point. Ugh, I left home to explore new worlds, and now I've become a girl.\" she groaned. Putting a hand on her hip, Greg groaned. This was not the best day for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm sorry about that. We'll try and fix this, alright?\" suggested Jacob. Greg looked at Jacob and sighed, calming down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Sorry for flipping out on you.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. I'm a bit surprised I didn't flip out as well. At least you got a good look. You look just like Marisa.\" said Jacob. That surprised Greg. She didn't think of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Crimson Flash? From the Magvelian legends?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The very one. Go take a look in that stream if you need proof.\" said Jacob, pointing to the nearby stream. Greg ran over and looked at herself in the reflection, seeing her smooth face, with eyes that matched her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Marisa. Unbelievable.\" said Greg. With that, she turned to Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I became a past warrior, I guess you did too. But I don't recognize yours.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I, but oh well. Let's see if we can find a town somewhere.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" sighed Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two of them began a walk down the plains, hoping to run into some kind of town.</span></div></div>",

Jacob thought to herself, even her mental voice being a female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where you from Greg?\" Jacob said, hoping to make some form of conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg sighed but said, \"A small village in the Outrealms.

To be honest, she was feeling a bit self-conscious in the short skirt, although a part of her didn't mind it. However, she didn't get much time to think about it, as she saw Jacob already heading towards the village. Greg sighed and ran up to catch up with her. Soon enough, they reached the village, which seemed to be rather ordinary from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least it looks good enough to sleep in for a night. What do you think?\" asked Greg. However, when she turned away, Jacob wasn't there. Greg turned behind him and saw Jacob sneaking around, making her shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what a waste of time.\" she sighed as she starting trying to find an inn. I mean, if felt nice being this warrior that he only heard of in legends, but this was going a bit too far. Anyway, Greg looked around until she finally found an inn off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally.\" she sighed as she immediately entered the inn. She walked up to the registration and got a room for both her and Jacob. The lady at the desk happily gave her a set of keys. Greg said thanks and promptly left, deciding to tour around while Jacob did who knows what. Sighing again, Greg again walked outside. However, as he did, she honestly didn't feel like being around all these people. She briefly out her left hand on her sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't concentrate with all these people. I could use some privacy.\" she said, not really aware of what she said. She went out behind the inn, finding an alleyway that no one was walking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" said Greg as she drew her sword with her left hand, beginning to take some sword strikes. She had a reputation to uphold after all. A memory of her father flashed through, one of many where he had placed blunt swords at her sides to prevent her from rolling over in her sleep.</span></div></div>",

Kirada is a quaint little town surrounded by plains and hills, with the ocean some distance away. Large mountains loom in the distance.<br>\r\nRace: Human<br>\r\nClass: Mercenary (Level 15)<br>\r\nUses: Swords (Level A), <br>\r\nAsset and Weakness: Speed and Luck<br>\r\nEquipment: Zenith (forged brave sword), Steel Sword, and an Elixir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****End*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing Greg really wanted was to be stuck in traffic in a market place. However, that was exactly where he was now. You see, Greg had just left his home or Kirada, leaving via the Outrealm Gate that laid outside his home village. This was all out of some sense of adventure, hoping to see what was beyond the city. He also hoped to hone his old skills so he could be useful in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, with what little gold he had, he was paying for some supplies. He thankfully had the capacity to keep his items in check. Karen, his cousin, would probably chastise him if he was unorganized. His cousin was a pretty strong healer, in the War Cleric class. He knew that he couldn't cross her, even more than his own mother. Well anyway, at least he didn't have to worry about her in another realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sun still low in the sky after staying the night, Greg was just getting his vulneraries and other such items in check when he happened to see someone bump into him. The two ended up falling to the ground, though Greg thankfully held on to his items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Greg to the mysterious stranger.</span></div></div>",

No offense, but I can tell that you're not from this land. So....\" Jacob scratched the back of his head, since Greg didn't look convinced. Still, Greg was curious, and despite not fully trusting him yet, had a thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's sit down over lunch for a bit. I could use a break anyway.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Greg moved them over to a nice area of the village, finding themselves a good spot to have a little lunch. Greg was pretty adept at this point of making lunches on the go. Thankfully, so was Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, you never even told me your name.\" spoke Greg as he took a bit of his sandwich. Jacob's face went a little red with embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...guess I forgot....I'm Jacob. I'm from the main capital of this land, traveling about for experience.\" Jacob explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg nodded in understanding. \"Pleasure then. I'm Greg, and I'm from Kirada.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kirada? Hmm, definitely not in this land.\" spoke Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, I came through an Outrealm Gate.\" said Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I've heard of those. Never been through one myself though.\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've only been through it once, coming from Kirada to this land.\" said Greg. \"I actually haven't been traveling for very long. Only a couple of weeks or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" said Jacob. He paused for a bit as he finished his own meal. \"Well, I can say for sure that you're a man who knows what he's doing, and frankly, I could go anywhere right now. Guess that adventurous vibe of yours stood out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say. Well, I will admit that it's been a bit boring by myself. I guess you can tag along.\" said Greg as he got up. \"Though, the minute you begin to feel like dead weight, you're on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is that how it is?\" smiled Jacob. \"Well, we'll see who ends up dead weight partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg just smirked as he accepted the dark knight's handshake. As he didn't want to waste too much time, Greg insisted on getting moving. Besides, it was a good way to work off lunch. With that in mind, the two of them set out from the village, though Jacob wouldn't shut up about his time in the capital city. Needless to say, Greg got annoyed quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, after about half an hour, Greg spotted another Outrealm Gate in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so there's even more of them.\" Greg spoke to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go?\" asked Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I've seen enough of this world for a while. Might be worth it to check out others.\" spoke Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, true enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, the two of them walked into the gate, though it wasn't too long before it engulfed them in light.</span></div></div>",

Second, was how easily she could stand while wearing the armor. It felt like air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThird, the fact he was a SHE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob soon looked in a nearby pond in the area nearby at herself. She was a young girl with short brown hair reaching below her chin and with firm facial features. She looked through her inventory to see a Silver Lance and Silver Axe. She soon looked around and saw another girl nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to me?\" Jacob shrieked, feeling her own hair.  Soon the girl across from her began waking up. She realized that the girl was probably Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg was in the armor of that of a Pegasus rider. She also had two blue pigtails hanging off her head. She seemed perky and happy already as she woke up and stretched, a Silver Lance and Cure staff at her side. The two looked at one another. \"Excuse me-\" Greg began, but stopped when she heard a higher pitch voice. She went to the reflection as well and turned back in shock. \"Wait...Jacob?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob sighed, \"Yeah.

I'm used to keeping a level head.\" said Jacob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least one of us is.\" pouted Greg as she looked down at the blue and silver pegasus uniform she wore. \"And why did that gate turn me into a pegasus knight of all things?

Surprisingly, despite the uniform, there was no pegasus in sight. Not only that, they were in some kind of field, so where exactly were they?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got any idea where we are?\" asked Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue. Never been outside my own realm remember?\" said Jacob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Guess we'll start walking then.\" sighed Greg. With that said, the two of them began walking, albeit awkwardly thanks to the newer bodies.

He had been traveling for quite some time. And by that, he meant about 2 weeks. Yeah, things had been a bit rough since he left his hometown. He had never been known much for being the assertive type, but he really wanted to go more about the Outrealms. Unfortunately, after one trek through a village in one world, and then another, he ended up in this desert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smooth move, Rey. Nice job.\" He groaned sarcastically. He was only through about 3 realms now, didn't learn a thing, and was probably close to running out of water. Well, he supposed he could try to head back through the Gate, though that didn't mean he would return to that specific realm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, he didn't have much else to do as he sighed. However, just as he was about to start walking, he could have sworn that he saw something down in the sand....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
