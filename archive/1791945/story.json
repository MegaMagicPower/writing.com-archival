            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the break of dawn in the calm town of Konohagakure. Our hero, Naruto Uzumaki, lay fast asleep in his bed, his black t-shirt lifted slightly and showing off a little bit of his abs. Naruto lazily scratched them in his sleep, groaning as a stream of drool slid down from his lips. It seemed like nothing could stir the young man from his slumber! That is until there was a loud pounding on the door! It was like thunder in his own home, and the resulting sound caused Naruto to jolt from his bed and fall to the floor! His pillow smacked down on top of his head, his leg still half on the bed and covered by the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmgh...\" Naruto groaned to himself as his sleepy eyes peered open. He gazed about his room briefly, along the floor riddled with scrolls, ramen cups, and a few training weights. He slowly got to his feet for a better look around. \"What the heck was that sound...?\" Naruto muttered to himself. He then made his way out into the living room. There didn't seem to be anything wrong here either. The kitchen was still in one piece, the couch was fine, not even his table or chair was knocked over. So just what could that sound have been?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto soon made his way over to the door just to make sure the village wasn't under attack. As he opened the door, there was not a soul to be seen. Naruto gazed left then right, before finally looking down. It was there that he saw that he had a box on the ground with a card on it. Naruto rose his eyebrow lazily as he gazed at it briefly, as if it were some foreign object not of this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember ordering anything...\" Naruto mumbled, before taking the box and bringing it inside. After all there was no use leaving it out. Naruto walked over and set the box on his table before taking a seat in his chair. It nearly took a whole three minutes before Naruto realized he would actually have to open the box to find out what was inside! But first of all was the card that lay right over the top, taped to the box. Naruto gently tore it off to keep it in one piece, before opening it up to read it. The card read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">I've really done it this time! My novel to end all novels! This one will go flying off the shelves in no time, I just know it! In fact, I'm so confident about this one that even YOU will like it! I'm sending you the first copy. Don't let anyone else read it!</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Jiraiya</div></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grumbled briefly to himself. \"So that's what he woke me up for? Another one of his stupid books...?\" Naruto disdainfully opened the box just to see what the book was like. After all, pervy-sage went through all the trouble, he could at least read ONE chapter of it before likely re-gifting it to Kakashi-sensei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto help up the book that was buried beneath some packing foam within the box. He held it up, the purple hardcover book gleaming in the low light of the kitchen. Naruto grumbled to himself yet again. There was simply a white figure hovered over a book with a pen in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make Out Your Own Ending?\" Naruto read the title aloud, \"... Geez pervy-sage, how lazy can you get?\" Naruto flipped the book open, only to find that it was completely blank! Not a single word to be written on any page! Naruto dutifully flipped through page after page for a word, ANY word, but there was not one to be found! Naruto grumpily slammed it down onto the table, before groaning, \"What is this?! It's not even a real book! It's just a buncha blank pages!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat there in his black tanktop and navy blue boxers, arms folded over his chest as he gazed grumpily at the book. In a little fit of anger, he got up to fetch a pen from his room before returning to the book. He sat back down and looked at the pages for a moment before deciding what to write. It took every fiber of his well-being not to slander Jiraiya's name upon the pages, so in the end, Naruto ended up writing little more than a simple sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like ramen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sat there for a moment, pondering the simplicity of the sentence. He then was shocked as he suddenly saw the words melt into the page! It disappeared without a trace! Naruto immediately picked up the book and turned the page! It didn't melt through, the words were just simply... Gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?!\" Naruto muttered as he shook the book, half expecting words to fly out and land onto the table. When he finally realized that nothing was happening, he decided to try writing something else. He thought about it briefly before writing down something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba Inuzuka, covered in sweat and grinning from ear to ear, was walking home from the gym in Konoha, his latest workout a complete success! It was no secret that he was the envy of a lot of the other ninja thanks to his buffed body. He wasn't the biggest guy in Konoha by any stretch of the imagination, but his recent obsession with lifting weights had made him by and far the biggest out of the men in his age group. The ideal ninja had always, traditionally, been sleek and slim, able to move fast and undetected through enemy territory. However, more and more ninja had developed ninjutsu that was powerful enough for a single ninja to walk into enemy territory, decimate it completely, and accomplish their mission in record time. This was considered the advent of \"Modern Ninjutsu\", a movement where ninja were now focused on building their bodies for pure force rather than on stealth. Everyone in his age group, from Naruto and Kiba to even the tactical fighters like Shikamaru were developing their bodies to fall in line with this new wave of ninja. Of course, thanks to their zeal and stamina, Naruto and Kiba were both far better at it than anyone else. Shikamaru had the advantage of using his superior mind to come up with a work out plan that got him maximum results from minimal work but his slothfulness still kept him from making as big of gains as the dog and fox ninja. Naruto and Kiba had been in direct competition this past week, trying to outdo each other in every muscle group. Kiba had fully trounced Naruto, proving that he was bigger, faster, and stronger than the spiky haired ninja, though Naruto was a close second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba flexed his bicep, grinning as he saw the 18 inch lump rise up. He could barely remember the old days when he had been merely athletically toned. Those days were far behind him now! His red tank top was plastered to his sweaty body, accentuating his every curve and bulge, his six pack abs visible through the material! It helped that his work out tops were all made from thin, breathable material. His work out shorts were similarly sticky, showing off his bulging thighs while his meaty calves hardened with every step. With a surge of new confidence at his bigger body, Kiba had also become even cockier and less modest, showing off his respectable bulge without a care in the world. Why should he hide the great gifts he got?~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout one hundred yards from his house, he passed an alleyway, a voice suddenly calling out to him. \"Hey kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stopped and looked down the alley, curious who was talking to him. \"Yeah? You talking to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am~\" the voice said, a little kid stepping out of the shadows. He was wearing a knit wool cap and a thick winter coat, his pants looking decidedly out of place in this ensemble by being thin and flappy, reaching just between his ankles and shins. Sandals adorned his feet, but they were unlike any Kiba had seen before. They looked like they were made out of leather straps, each one following along the bones on the top of his feet while others wrapped around each toe, a flat piece of rubber serving as the bottom. The cap was pulled down over his eyes, hiding them from view, a big grin plastered across his face. He had his hands deep in his pockets and his hair was buzzed nearly bald, leaving only a thin layer of black hair on his scalp. Not that Kiba could see his scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want kid?\" Kiba asked, shifting his bag further up his arm. He didn't have time to waste talking to weird kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to help you of course!\" He said, pulling one hand out of his pocket. \"I've heard that you're the biggest guy around these parts. That true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked and flexed his biceps. \"You tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid snickered and said, \"Yeah, great, but can you guarantee you'll always be on top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can!\" Kiba said, frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that Naruto? I hear he's got some tricks up his sleeve. Hope he never uses those Shadow Clones of his to start working out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba faltered a bit at that sentence. He had never thought of that before. If Naruto created fifty clones and they all worked out at the same time, when he recalled them all, their progress would become his! He could build his muscles up faster than anyone, even him! He didn't like the sound of that at all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't sweat it~ I can help!\" The kid said, holding up a bottle, his index finger resting on top of it while his thumb was situated under it. \"Take one of these before every work out session and I guarantee you'll see amazing results!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What's the catch?\" Kiba said, instantly suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No catch! Consider it a personal favor.\" He tossed the bottle to Kiba. \"It's up to you whether you use them or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba caught the bottle and called out to the kid who was starting to walk away. \"How much do you want for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and waved his hands, still grinning from ear to ear. \"Oh, no money thanks! The first taste is always free!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scratched his head, looking down at the bottle. It looked like your average medicine bottle. Shaking it, Kiba estimated there was about fifteen or so pills inside. He popped it open and looked inside. They looked kind of like his soldier pills. \"Maybe they have a similar base...\" Kiba muttered, turning the bottle slightly so he could get a better look at them. He snapped the top back on and shrugged. Couldn't hurt to try it at least once right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, after a full night's rest, Kiba was running off to the gym, eager to work his body once again and show off just how amazing he was to everyone! The bottle of pills sounded like a maraca in his bag. He had decided to eat just one...just to see if it worked! After changing into his work out clothes he popped a pill into his mouth and took a long drink from the faucet. Wiping his mouth, he rushed out into the gym and headed for his first work out machine!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba sat down at the machine. It was early morning, and he had the whole gym to himself. It was a slight bummer to the dog boy's spirits. Kiba loved having an audience watching him! He got all kinds of looks as he pushed up on those barbells, flexing his bulging pecs and his rippling biceps. All the attention just fed his desire to get even bigger! Not to mention it helped he always seemed to have just \"one\" more follower than Naruto did! Probably because he was better off below the belt than his blonde counterpart! At least, that's what Sai had told him. Of course, as Kiba thought of this, he just started pumping harder, wanting to really assert his position as the alpha male of the gym!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing first at the gym meant Kiba had a pick of any machine he wanted. Of course, he always chose the same machine. It was like a mix of three machines, that worked out every inch of your body and helped you bulk up even further! After a little bit of stretching, Kiba sat down and moved tword the end. Putting his legs under the bar, he started pushing them up and began with his leg lifts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, Kiba laid back on his back and took two handlebars in each hand. They were attached to the weights in the back of the machine, and as Kiba pushed up, it was just like pushing up a barbell on a weight bench. Kiba was already starting to sweat, and he grinned as he was feeling pumped. His legs had a slight burn to them, but it felt so good! He kept pushing upward, wanting to make his arms as big as he possibly could! He let out a loud gruny, pushing himself further than he ever did before! If that weird little kid was telling the truth, then he wanted to get as much as he possibly could out of these pills!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba finished his last set, he sat up, breathing deeply. A quick survery of the gym showed a few of the other regulars starting to make their appearance. He grinned as he recognized a few of the faces of his admirers. Not one to disappoint, Kiba scooched back, and set his arms up against the two bars. With that, he pressed them together, giving his hard pecs a good squeeze as he did! His arms were a little tired out, but as he noticed a few people trying to hide the fact they were secretly staring at him, he found new strength and pushed onward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna... Get... Bigger...\" He mumbled to himself. \"Stronger... Stonger than Naruto... Biggest... In all of Konoha!\" He growled softly. As Kiba kept pushing himself, more people were looking at him, some of them with wide eyes as they looked at the dog boy. Kiba didn't know exactly why they were looking, he just thought it was because he was such a hot piece of ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that wasn't the case today. As Kiba was pushing further, his shorts, which once had much room around his thighs, was quickly vanishing! Kiba's thighs were actually expanding! They coild up, pumping to a thick, full size, like two huge tree trunks. This, of course, was only complimented by his amazingly powerful calves, which swelled up into two tight softballs of pure mass! Kiba was too focused on feeling the burn to notice that his feet were slowly becoming more and more cramped in his shoes! His long, thick toes actually started hanging off the edge of his sandals! If it wasn't for all the sweat that made his tanktop stick to his body, no one would have noticed his abs popping up into place, each cutting into deep little canyons that gave them that perfect washboard look. Kiba's biceps, even as they worked, were becoming larger, harder, and heavier! Kiba smirked as all eyes were on him, not even knowing what was going on! His pecs were quickly pushing out of his chest, almost as if they were inflating with air! Every push just seemed to make them a whole size bigger, until they seemed to stop around the size of soccer balls! And speaking of balls, Kiba's manhood was engorged, only growing bigger and longer in his pants, pushing even further against the material than it already was! Finally, his shoulders and traps were quickly catching up, making the straps of his tanktop strain as the tried to contain the beast within, who was only insistant on making himself bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba finally stopped, letting out a loud, deep groan that actually scared a few people off! He looked up at them as his head was tilted down and grinned. He stood back up, and didn't even notice he was practically a half foot taller than he already was! He lifted his arm and flexed his bicep, not even noticing the size, before giving it a quick kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly four hours of non-stop exercise had tired him out! Decided now was as good a time as ever, he got up and made his way to the locker room for a little break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, not even noticing the way his pecs shook with every step he took. He didn't even notice his new size. That is, until he went into the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba stood at the sink, washing his face off with a splash of cold water. It was refreshing as ever! But not as refreshing as when he looked up! Kiba jumped back for a moment, looking in the mirror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" He shouted, looking up and down the person in the mirror. \"I-Is that... Is that me...?\" He asked himself. He lifted an arm and flexed it, watching as his reflection did the same. \"Hey! Look at that!\" Kiba got a grin on his face as he bent forward and did a crab flex. \"Not bad!\" He chuckled, \"I guess that little kid wasn't joking around! Look at me! I'm a beast!\" He laughed as he looked at himself. \"This tiny little shirt looks like it was just pained on this magnificent body!\" Kiba joked. He turned around and flexed his back, turning to see as the wide muscle only stretched out even further. \"Heh, that is one sexy hunk of man!\" Kiba said happily to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba kept flexing to  himself in the mirror, enjoying the sight of his buffed up bod moving at his every command. He would have gone on enjoying it for quite a bit longer, when he suddenly heard a loud *Smack!* coming from the bathroom stall behind him. He whipped his head around and slowly made his way over there, his feet slapping somewhat ominously in the tiled locker room. He looked down at all the stalls and saw that there appeared to be no one in any of them as no feet were visible. He stayed perfectly still and listened, closing his eyes. He gave a slightly sniff as well. He could definitely detect someone nearby! He made his way over to the offensive stall and pounded on it with his fist. \"Hey! Anyone in there?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no reply. Kiba had initially merely walked over here out of curiosity, but this suspicious behavior was starting to annoy him. With a dark frown he took a few steps back, lifted his right foot up, and slammed it against the stall door, the lock bursting off while the door swung open, revealing a freaked out looking Naruto sitting on the toilet with his legs drawn up. He was clearly not using it. Kiba grinned and said, \"I thought I heard someone back here! Looks like a little fox was spying on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's shocked expression quickly was replaced with a frown of annoyance. \"Yeah right! Like I'd waste time watching you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smirked, taking a few steps forward, filling the gap of the stall, effectively blocking Naruto from leaving. \"Don't act like I can't see you watching me when I'm working out! I see you looking over at me all the time, watching me lift, watching my muscles grow bigger...you secretly love it don't ya?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winked at Naruto who blushed a little and got up off the toilet. \"Shut up Kiba! I gotta get back out there and finish my work out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba shrugged and said, \"Go ahead~ If you can get past me that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto grinned and said, \"Too easy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his palms against Kiba's thick pecs and pushed as hard as he could. His feet slid along the tile, making it difficult to make any head way. Bracing his feet against the toilet, he started pushing again...only to find he couldn't budge Kiba, no matter how hard he pushed or struggled! Kiba bounced his pecs, the meaty orbs dancing under Naruto's hands, and said, \"Geez, I guess the gap between the real deal and second best is a lot bigger than I thought! What's wrong Naruto? Can't you even move little old me?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto huffed and looked down, doing his best to ignore Kiba's...full...shorts and focus on the gap between his legs. He got down on his hands and knees and tried to force his way between them. Kiba merely chuckled and clamped them together, Naruto barely avoiding getting his head caught between them. \"Ah, ah, ah~ Not that way~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLosing his patience, Naruto got back to his feet and shouted, \"You'd better let me out of here Kiba or I'll...I'll...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll what?\" Kiba said, standing up to his full height, his chest expanding out in front of him, taking up the limited space in the stall. \"There's nothing you can do to stop me doing whatever I want to you and you know it! So I suggest you keep me in a good mood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked his knuckles and smirked, gripping the door to the stall in one meaty hand. \"If I can do this to a metal door, just imagine what I could do to you!\" He applied pressure to it, his thick fingers leaving a sizable dent. Naruto gulped and said, \"Y-Yeah...Sure thing Kiba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba ruffled Naruto's hair and said, \"Good boy! Now get back out there and keep working! You're my strongest competition! If I don't have you at my heels I'll get soft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto batted Kiba's hand away with a chuckle, their usual repartee emerging. \"Better watch out! I'm really starting to get some results!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his impressive biceps, once just a few inches shy of Kiba's own, now looking puny in comparison. \"Not bad, not bad~\" Kiba said, gently feeling one with his hand. \"Make sure you're fully extending on your curls. You'll lose mobility if you don't follow through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded and said, \"Yeah, I know! I just...forget sometimes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rush too much!\" Kiba said, slowly flexing Naruto's arm fully. \"Just do this every night so the motion becomes second nature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, I never thought of that before!\" Naruto said excitedly. \"Thanks Kiba!\" He lifted his hand up for a high five. Kiba grinned and slapped Naruto's hand, using a little more strength than he thought. Naruto winced and shook the hand, the palm stinging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba watched as Naruto ran off, feeling something strange within him. He and Naruto always got into arguments over their routines and their developments, but he had never experienced a feeling quite like the one he got when he cornered Naruto in that stall. Knowing that there was nothing he could do to stop him, that his body might as well have been an impenetrable brick wall, made him feel unstoppable! And as long as he had those pills, he would keep getting more and more powerful! Not even the body builder sized guys like Asuma would be able to hold a candle to him! The thought made him feel a little twinge in his shorts...But there would be time for that later! He was ready to head back out there and REALLY show those people what a man like him could do!</span></div></div>",

He gave himself a grin, and flexed his arms a little, before moving back over to the lockers. He looked around for a moment, before pouring a few pills into his hand. If one little pill was making him look <i>this</i> good, just imagine what two could do! Kiba popped them in his mouth, before closing the bottle tight and setting it back in his bag. With that taken care of, he turned around and made his way back to the gym, feeling refreshed and re-invigorated!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba returned, he saw a small crowd not to far away; Naruto's to be precise. He may not have been as big as Kiba, but at least he had a few onlookers. That is, until the beefy dog boy returned. Almost instantly, Naruto lost half his fans, who migrated over to Kiba's side of the gym! Kiba chuckled, a little bit of pink in his cheeks as he suddenly garnered so much attention... Not like he wasn't loving it! Making his way past everyone, Kiba picked up some weights and carried them over to the bench. He was finding them a lot lighter than he did before, a huge fifty pounds feeling more like twenty as he lifted them. Slapping them both on opposite sides of the bar, he added a few smaller ones, making it a whopping 650 pounds he was bench pressing! Without further delay, Kiba laid down on the bench, and gripped the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Can I get a couple of spotters?\" He asked, flashing a winning smile at the crowd. Immediately, a pair of guys got behind him, both in not bad shape, but they were far from Kiba. Heck, they were even smaller than Naruto! Kiba just chuckled to himself as he thought of this. Immediately after, he lifted the bar up and began to pump iron!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting off, it was no sweat! But in due time, Kiba was finding it slightly difficult. Did he bite off more than he could chew? Everyone watched as the brunette was sweating bullets, each little droplet running down his smooth skin, from his pumped, swollen pecs down to his newly enhanced bulge. Kiba's body was started to radiate a phermone that was quickly attracting everyone who was even remotely close to him. Kiba started grunting, pushing even harder than he did before. A few audience members tried turning to the side in attempts to hide their shame. Kiba, on the other hand, was just focused on working even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done!\" Naruto announced over in \"his\" corner of the gym. As he sat up, he saw that there was only two, maybe three, people watching him! A bit saddening, but it quickly turned to a mild anger as he saw there was a crowd on the other side of the gym! \"What the heck is going on over there...?\" He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ungh! B-Bigger...!\" Kiba grunted, before he finally stopped, setting the bar back on the bench. He sat back up, chuckling. His pecs were red and swollen, and as he looked down at them, they touched his chin! Kiba smiled giving them a little bounce to please the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, something happened that not even Kiba himself saw coming! His eyes went wide as he suddenly shot up a good foot or so! His pecs pushed out even further from his chest at an alarming rate, as his shoulers and traps burst out from the tanktop he wore! The straps snapped, revealing Kiba's burly chest, and his erect nipples! His arms slowly grew into large bowling balls, with veins lightly tracing under them just to prove how massive they were! Kiba's abs morphed into an eight-pack, an entirely new layer of muscle emerging as the others bunched up and grew even harder! His thighs, which were on either side of the bench, blew right up like popcorn emerging from it's kernel! His calves were next, each one a softball of pure power as his sandals snapped and fell to pieces at his feet! Finally, to top it all off, there was now an immense pressure in his pants that made everyone blush. It practically left nothing to the imagination!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all was said and done, Kiba scratched the back of his head, looking out at everyone. \"U-Uhm... Heh heh...\" He blushed cutely. No one dared questioned what just happened, all they seemed to care about was the end result!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba smiled out at everyone, flexing his thick arms and making them swoon over his astounding new body!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The admirers who had gathered around Kiba didn't seem to question the massive dog ninja's sudden surge of growth, but there was one pissed off watcher that DID care! It was Naruto of course, who was standing towards the back of the crowd, arms crossed, glaring over at Kiba. Kiba was soaking up all the attention, flexing his biceps for the others to feel, lifting them effortlessly off the ground like they weighed nothing, and overall just showing off. Naruto knew he would be doing the exact same thing if he was in Kiba's place which just pissed him off even more! He <i>should</i> be in Kiba's place! Something very suspicious was going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Kiba stood up, heading back to the locker room (the gym was going to close in about ten minutes), Naruto ran after him, smacking him on the back which actually made his hand sting a bit. The blonde haired ninja winced as Kiba looked around in surprise, a grin slowly rising to his lips as he saw Naruto standing there, reaching only as tall as his burly pecs, shaking his hand like he had smacked concrete. \"Hey Naruto! Came to tell a real man how much you admire him?\" He snickered, loving the reaction he got out of Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if! I saw what happened back there! People don't just suddenly grow like that!\" Naruto said, following Kiba into the locker room. The dog ninja just scoffed, ignoring Naruto's accusations. \"Hey!\" Naruto continued. \"You can't just ignore me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Kiba said, suddenly turning around, Naruto smacking into his chest face first. \"Just watch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved his chest forward slightly, knocking Naruto on his ass, the fox ninja's face slightly red from having been buried in so much muscle. He was a little dazed...before jumping up and running after Kiba again...only to be stopped once again as he saw Kiba pulling down his work out shorts and his briefs (both of which were now much too small and tight) revealing his gorgeous ass, firm yet perfectly round with just a slight bounce as Kiba started walking towards the shower. He wasn't even bringing a towel! Naruto gulped and followed after him, standing outside the stall as Kiba turned the water on. \"A-Anyway! What the heck is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still out there?\" Kiba said, rolling his eyes as he got his hair wet. \"Why do you have to be so suspicious? Maybe I'm just naturally gifted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! I don't care how gifted you are, you can't make yourself suddenly grow like that!\" Naruto argued, leaning against the wall and crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Shows how much you know!\" Kiba said with a derisive laugh. \"You forget that Choji can do just that whenever he wants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto balked, suddenly at a loss for words. Kiba did have a point... \"Yeah...but it's not like <i>you</i> can do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I learned a new jutsu that has that effect.\" Kiba argued, lathering up his body, his muscles gleaming in the light as the water rushed down his chiseled body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Naruto found himself at a loss for words. What Kiba said did make a kind of sense, even though it seemed impossible. Finally, after a few seconds of silence, he came to a decision! \"Oh yeah? Then you won't mind if I spend the night! I'm going to watch you like a hawk for the next few days! Don't think you can get away with doing anything weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba turned off the water and moved the curtain back, revealing his wholly nude body to Naruto who gaped at Kiba's audacity. The dog ninja grinned and said, \"Heh, you're on! I always love having an audience!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked past Naruto, his big bare feet slapping against the tiles. Naruto gulped and shook his head. Now was not the time! He chased after Kiba and watched him as he got dressed, making sure his eyes stay glued to Kiba's feet the whole time. He didn't want to...see anything again. Soon, Kiba was dressed. He slung his bag over his shoulder and started heading to the door, Naruto right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the walk back Kiba made sure to keep his eyes trained forward. His heart was beating just a bit faster. If that guy from the alley came back, Naruto would know something was going on! He didn't think Naruto would go so far as look through his stuff...yet. The guy in the alley was his biggest problem right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto refused to look at anything BUT Kiba, not wanting to miss anything the taller teen might do to give himself away. Kiba eventually noticed the staring and smirked at Naruto. \"Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed and shouted back, \"NO! You know what I'm doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba just chuckled, ruffling Naruto's hair. He loved getting a rise out of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, they arrived at Kiba's house. Despite his best efforts, his eyes still darted to the alleyway. Luckily, the kid wasn't there. Kiba quickly looked down at Naruto who was still staring intently at him...though he didn't seem to have noticed that his eyes had flicked over to the alley. Where exactly was Naruto staring? Kiba stopped at the door to his house and said, \"We're here. It's going to just be the two of us. Hope that doesn't bother you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, makes things a lot easier!\" Naruto said with a grin. He ran ahead of Kiba and made his way to the dog ninja's room. Kiba sighed and tossed his dirty clothes into the laundry bin, the bottle of pills kept safe in his pocket. Even if Naruto spotted them, he could easily lie and say they were just soldier pills. It wasn't like Naruto could win in a fight against him anyway. Kiba smirked and flexed his biceps, the sleeves of the shirt he had changed into straining with every flex. The shirt was so tight, absolutely nothing was left to the imagination. It didn't even quite fully cover his abs! Maybe that's what had Naruto's attention before! Kiba snickered and headed to his room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kiba went upstairs to his room, he could hear some movement beyond his door. Being as quiet as a massive dog beast could, he moved in closer to the door and gave it a listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it... Where is it...?\" He could hear Naruto saying. \"I know that mutt has to be hiding his secret in here somewhere! Some kind of pill or maybe he has some special weights!\" Kiba could feel a little nerve snap as he heard Naruto say \"pill.\" It almost made him all the more suspicious of how much Naruto knew. Kiba ran his hand over his pocket, sighing a little as he was reminded the pills were still in his pocket. As long as they were there, Naruto's efforts would be fruitless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba continued to listen, it started to sound like Naruto was making a real mess of the place! Kiba grinned, and gently held his hand on the door. He cleared his throat, and prepared to give Naruto a good scare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to snoop when suddenly there was a loud slam! The door whipped open, nearly cracking the wall behind it, as an enraged Kiba looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What the HELL are you doing!?</b>\" Kiba shouted at Naruto. Naruto froze right in his tracks, looking back at Kiba. His skin went a little pale as he did. Kiba, on the other hand, was smiling on the inside. He could see just how frightened Naruto was! There was an awkward silence, which was then broken by something even more awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long squeal. It started off quiet but quickly became loud. Along with it came a foul odor. Naruto blushed a little, as Kiba erupted in laughter. The massive dog man fell on his back, rolling and holding his stomach, laughing at Naruto. Naruto just stomped his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Stop laughing!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You farted! You totally did! Better check your pants there!\" Kiba said, still howling with laughter. Naruto was blushing, beet red, trying to cover it up with fury. Naruto didn't even seem to notice as a bottle squeezed out of Kiba's pocket and onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? How about this!?\" Naruto barked back at Kiba. He waltzed right over to Kiba's bed, and held the mutt's pillow up to his rear. He then let another one rip, which was surprisingly easy. That \"fear\" must have still been inhabiting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up, surprised at first, but he immediately turned his anger into tranquility. He got up, a sly smirk on his face as he did, and walked over to Naruto. He snatched the pillow right out of the fox boy's hands, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that!? Huh!?\" Kiba was shoving the pillow right into Naruto's face! Forcing him to smell his own product! \"This is for what you did at the Chunin exams!\" Kiba laughed, as Naruto could only try to get away from Kiba's massive physique. It was no use! Kiba was going to hold him there until he saw the deed was done. As he let go, Naruto flew back onto his bed trying to fan his nose off. Kiba just started laughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... You big bully!\" Naruto barked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big...\" Kiba flexed both of his arms, both of the powerful muscles erputing to their full size. \"And don't you for get it!\" He grinned. Naruto just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the two of them were sleeping soundly. Kiba was in his bed, as Naruto slept on the floor. All was peaceful and quiet, until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of Naruto's blue eyes opened up. As he peered around the room, he could see Kiba laying on the bed, his back turned on the young blonde man. Naruto snickered as he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" He thought, \"Now that the mutt is asleep, I can get back to exploring!\" Naruto stood up slowly, the study floor not even making a creak under his size. He started to tip toe around the room, only able to use the moonlight to see around the room. Naruto started to think. \"What could have made Kiba so big... A ray gun? No... That's too unreal... Maybe a new jutsu! Yeah! That could be it!\" Naruto thought to himself. \"He probably hasn't known it for long... Maybe he still has a scroll of it around here!\" Naruto made his way to the trash and started to rummage through it. He got a sickened look on his face as he passed a few papers, only to touch something sticky! Naruto just winced. \"Please be gum...\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Kiba suddenly shouted. Naruto froze in his tracks. \"How'd you like to... See a real man...?\" Kiba said, starting to mumble again as he drifted back into sleep. Naruto just sighed, wiping his forehead. Now that he thought about it, what about Kiba's gym bag!? Naruto didn't remember seeing it on him when he returned to the room... He must have left it in the bathroom! ... Or maybe the front door! Either way, he had to be quiet as he tip toed around the house!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Naruto wandered out the door, he heard a rattle that made him flinch! He held his breath, and looked down. There was something there, so he reached down and picked it up. Feeling over the bottle, felt a cap and a cylinder... It must have been a medicine bottle! Naruto was already suspicious of what this could be doing on the floor... So he quietly made his way to the bathroom to get a little privacy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the bathroom, he flipped on the lights and looked around. No one was in here! Truthfully, he was half expecting the toilet to be some kind of tree! Either way, that wasn't what he came here for! He held the bottle up and looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soldier pills...?\" Naruto said to himself. He popped open the top and looked inside. They didn't smell like soldier pills... Naruto took one and popped it in his mouth. He didn't feel that sudden burst of energy that usually happened when one ate a soldier pill. \"Maybe that one was defective...\" Naruto mumbled. He took another, just to be sure! \"Another dud...?\" He said. He decided that maybe just one more wouldn't hurt. After all, it wasn't impossible to get two duds in a row! Alas, it was the same. Naruto didn't feel a thing. He looked at the label on the side. \"Muscle... Enhancer!?\" Naruto said. He then grit his teeth, growling unhappily. \"That cheat! I knew he wasn't getting that huge through hard work!\" Naruto said unhappily. \"I'll show him... He's REALLY going to get it tomorrow!\" Naruto said with a fierce scowl on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Naruto got a devilish smile. He then took the bottle and held it over his mouth, downing every last pill in there! He crushed it in his grip, as he had an evil grin on his face. \"Kiba wants to see what a real man looks like, I'll show him just who's the top dog around here!\" Naruto then quickly and quietly made his way out of the house, leaving Kiba none the wiser! A fire in his belly, he was going to work out as much as he could, all night if he had to! The fox boy could already feel his muscles getting pumped up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Kiba awoke, scratching his pec as he yawned. He looked at the floor, only to see Naruto wasn't there! That was already starting to worry him, but what really made his heart stop was when he reached his hand over his pocket and noticed the bottle was missing! Kiba immediately sprang out of bed, looking under the blanket, under the sheets, and anywhere else the bottle could have fallen! He started to tear up his room, before dashing out into the hallway! He did a quick run of the house to search for Naruto, before heading to the one place the family stored pills! Kiba made his way to the bathroom, and opened up the cabinet! He took a quick inventory, but no dice! Just as he was about to dash out of the room, his large foot stomped on something!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Dammit!\" Kiba immediately held his foot, wincing slightly. He looked down, and his heart skipped a beat. As he reached down and picked up the bottle, he immediately recognized the bottle as the one he was given by that boy. \"He... He didn't...\" Kiba stammered, unable to believe his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba immediately left the bathroom, and started heading for the door...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Kiba's hand closed around the doorknob to the front door, a huge crash was heard in the distance! Kiba froze in place, his heart hammering in his chest. He had no reason to believe that it wasn't just an alley cat knocking over a garbage can but he still felt a distinct feeling of foreboding. He knew that whatever made that crash, it had something to do with Naruto! He stepped away from the door and ran back to his room. If he was going to face Naruto, he was going to need his gear! He pulled open his closet and grabbed a net shirt and one of is usual hoodies. He ripped the sleeves off of them and ripped it down the middle slightly, pulling the shirt on over his head. The hem rested lightly at the top of the waistband of his underwear, his chest bulging out the top of the hoodie while his thick arms were on full display. He pulled on a pair of pants, the hems bursting as soon as he pulled his legs through, leaving him in shredded clothing, giving him a positively savage appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully clothed, Kiba started going through his gear. He stuffed soldier pills into his pockets, strapped a kunai pouch to his leg and strung some shuriken in a secondary pouch on his arm. Some smoke pellets would probably be useful as well and he decided to grab a few paper bombs to complete his arsenal. It wasn't much but he hoped it would be enough! He stood still in the middle of his room, his mind racing as he tried to think of anything he might have missed. In the distance, there was a strange, rhythmic sound, like muffled thunder. He ignored it for a few minutes before he realized that it was slowly coming closer to him, his house beginning to shake slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way...no way...no way that's Naruto!\" Kiba chanted to himself, under his breath like a mantra. Maybe saying it enough times would make it true...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the sounds stopped and everything was still and silent. Before Kiba could react, there was a horrible screeching, squealing sound, like wood warping and being ripped apart. Kiba looked up in horror as he saw what appeared to be the tips of some thick, pink logs. The sound got louder and louder until the entire roof was raised into the air, revealing the massive face of Naruto grinning down at Kiba. \"Well, well, well! Looks like my new doll decided to stay in his house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had been trying to mentally prepare himself for this moment. He hadn't wanted to give Naruto any kind of satisfaction from his reaction. Unfortunately, he couldn't help but feel his eyes widen in amazement as his jaw dropped. Naruto was beyond huge! He stood at least twice as tall as Kiba's two story house. He was bending over slightly, his massive chest stretching wider than the roof of Kiba's house, one of his nipples resting lightly on the wall of Kiba's room, thick and leathery and bigger than Kiba's head! Looking out the window, Kiba could get a hint of Naruto's enormous eight pack, each brick tight and hard. The paper bombs in his pocket suddenly seemed laughably useless. Slowly, Kiba looked back up into Naruto's piercing blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were cheating you little mutt so I beat you at your own game!\" Naruto said, his voice rumbling over Kiba. \"LOOK AT ME! Your pathetic little body can't stand up to a REAL MAN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his biceps, the already thick arms suddenly exploding upwards in size, turning into a veritable mountain of power, veins running over the split peaks. Kiba gulped while Naruto laughed, grunting as he forced his arms to flex bigger and harder! \"Best part?\" Naruto said with a cocky grin. \"I've been working out all night and I still feel like I'm full of energy! I don't think I'm done growing yet either! Here, let me see if I can get bigger right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you going to do?!\" Kiba shouted, finally finding his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't say a word. He grunted, his head dipping out of sight. The whole house began to shake about as Naruto dug his thick fingers under the foundation of Kiba's house, the whole structure lifting into the air! Kiba shouted as his body was pitched all around the room, slamming into the walls and the floor, all of his possessions flying about, striking Kiba on occasion. Naruto laughed, the sound booming across the early morning and still sleepy Leaf Village. Naruto started lifting the building in a curl, his arms and chest bulging as he worked out. Within seconds, the wall of Kiba's house caved in, Naruto's enormous, growing pecs bursting through! Kiba watched in horror as Naruto grew even more! The building began to crumble apart in his grip, chunks of it falling to the ground, breaking even more on Naruto's legs and feet. Soon, Kiba was left in Naruto's palm, his entire house decimated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, not even your house is a match for me!\" Naruto said with a laugh.  Naruto raised Kiba up to his face and said, \"You thought you were making it bad for me? Just wait until you see what I do to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba clenched his fists, glaring up at Naruto, nothing but contempt in his expression. If Naruto wanted him to be obedient he was going to have to work hard!</span></div></div>",

He rubbed the back of his head. \"Well... I guess I can give him another chance... It's not going to be easy though...\" He mumbled. \"And if he fails THIS time... I just might have to find a new candidate...\" The boy then thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba scowled in disgust as Naruto went on flexing, admiring his own hugeness. \"Did you know no clothes could fit a massive man like me?\" Naruto said with his usual cocky grin. He rose his arm and flexed as hard as he could to attest to that. The mountainous muscle bulged upward to the sky, actually growing a size bigger as he did! A split peak formed at the top, and not to mention all the veins running along the bottom, pulsing, feeding the muscle and making it bigger! Naruto chuckled to himself, his deep voice vibrating within his chest, before he reached over and give his arm a nice, long lick. \"Yeaaaah... This is what a man looks like...\" He groaned under his breath. Kiba just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kiba was held captive in Naruto's open palm, something smacked him in the face! He struggled a little, before working it off and seeing it was just a piece of paper. Kiba just sighed, before looking it over. As he did, he found three mysterious words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">\"<i>Open your mouth</i>\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba rose and eyebrow at the strange note, before looking around. It didn't look like it came from anywhere. He looked up at Naruto, who was still too busy admiring his new physique like the gigantic meat head he was. Kiba looked left, then right, before opening his mouth for a brief moment. In that short time, he suddenly felt something the size of a pea shoot into his mouth! Kiba gagged a little, coughing it up in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince whatever it was had already entered his mouth, a taste wouldn't hurt. He rolled the object on his tongue a little, before he immediately realized what it was! It tasted identical to the pills that made him huge! Just to be sure, Kiba swallowed, and looked at his arm. Without raising it, he tensed up the muscle, and just noticed as it bulged just a little bit bigger! Kiba smiled to himself. He didn't know where that pill came from, but he had to have more! Kiba opened his mouth again, and sure enough, another one fired down his throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba kept opening his mouth, only to close it once another pill was safely inside. He'd then open his mouth again only to have another shot down his throat. Not to far away, the boy stood in a tree, readying his pea shooter with another pill. With precision accuracy, and a little chakra, he shot another one right at Kiba's open mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled to himself. Slowly but surely, he was starting to get bigger. His abs were on full display a rock-hard eight pack stretched down his magnificent body. His burly pecs so swollen that they actually drew the collar of the shirt downwards! His biceps were nearly the size of beach balls, and they didn't stop there either! As Kiba sat, his muscled ass bulged outward in his shorts, as his already sizable cock had pushed out the front of his pants, making them increasingly tight! His thighs had already filled out the leg holes, and were now becoming so huge that they formed a tear upside the front! Kiba's huge calves pumped up even bigger, nearing the size of cantelopes! His feet pushed out further as well, expanding to nearly five times the size of a normal man's! Kiba grinned, opening his mouth, and doing small, frequent, unnoticed flexes that were slowly making him bigger and bigger...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba made sure his attention wasn't too divided. It would have been easy to focus entirely on his own growing body, his pecs pushing his shirt to its limits, the collar already tearing while the hem rode up to reveal his splendid rows of abs, while below his thighs and calves made similar work of his shorts. If he did though, he was like to get caught in a trap! Naruto was still too absorbed in his own body and showing off to notice what exactly was happening to Kiba, but that didn't mean he would stay in the dark forever! Naruto had a tendency to be a total dumbass, but even he was bound to notice his growing rival! Kiba crouched down even as his height began to increase, trying to make himself look as small as he could. With a loud *POP* his shorts finally exploded off his body, leaving him in nothing but a tight pair of briefs. His shirt ripped loudly after that as his back flared out and his shoulders broadened. Kiba's tanned body was now almost fully on display, the pouch of his briefs filled to bursting with pure Inuzuka cock. Kiba couldn't help but grin, loving the feeling of his massive body growing even more massive! By normal standards, he was already far taller than any normal ninja in the village, though he was still just an action figure to Naruto. Kiba flexed his arms, grinning even wider as he saw those thick mounds bunch up impressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Kiba's height had surpassed Naruto's slightly curved fingers that the meat headed ninja noticed what was happening. For the last few minutes it had felt like his hand was getting heavier but Naruto barely paid it any attention. At his size, what could possibly affect him? He never dreamed that Kiba would find some way to grow beyond just downing the bottle of pills that had been in his room. Naruto had managed to figure out what the catalyst of Kiba's growth was, but not who the provider was. This gave Kiba a slight edge still. Of course, once Kiba grew big enough that his ass was being cupped by Naruto's palm, Naruto whipped his head down and looked at the slowly swelling shinobi in shock! Kiba merely grinned up at him and, faster than Naruto could react, slashed the bigger ninja's arm! His sharp nails managed to slightly draw blood, but the shock of it was enough to send Naruto stumbling backward, dropping Kiba to the ground. The dog ninja landed with an enormous *THUD* the buildings around them shaking wildly as he hit the ground. Without so much as a second thought, Kiba dashed away from Naruto, moving in the direction he thought the pills had been flying from. He needed to get as far away from Naruto as he could AND get some more of those pills!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, meanwhile, had recovered from Kiba's attack only to find the little sneak was nowhere in sight! Growling in frustration, Naruto quickly began searching for him, every stomp sending a shockwave through the immediate area. Naruto knew Kiba was too big at this point to fit inside a building easily so he set his sights on the alleys and streets. \"When I find that little punk I'm going to make him sorry!\" Naruto growled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween Kiba's and Naruto's constant giant footsteps, it was impossible to think that the other villagers wouldn't notice them, even if it was still early in the morning. It didn't take long for reports to start coming in that there were two giants running around the Leaf Village, causing havoc wherever they went! No action was currently being taken, as there were unconfirmed reports that the giants were actually members of the village and not attacking foreign nations. Until more information could be gathered, now was merely a time to observe. If it looked like the giants were starting to cause too much trouble, action would be taken then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange boy watched as Kiba, crouched down in the streets to remain hidden, all while his body slowly kept pumping up, tried to find his way to him. The boy sighed and pulled a dossier out of his pocket, re-reading Kiba's information. After scanning the document, he replaced it in his pocket, taking another out in its place. This one was for Naruto. His eyebrow rose slightly as he read the information. \"Now that that stupid dog got that fox kid mixed up in this, I'm going to have to change my plans a bit. Phase two is going to have to go into effect a few weeks early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid a small suitcase on the ground in front of him and opened it up, revealing several dozen bottles of the pills. \"Let's see...I'm going to have to start spreading these out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out about four bottles worth of pills and slammed the lid of the suitcase shut, picking it back up and rushing off to his next destination. The Leaf Village was about to have some VERY big problems on its hands!</span></div></div>",

Naruto's too huge...!\" Kiba thougth to himself, \"And I have a feeling he's only going to be getting bigger!\" Kiba thought as he was rushing for the gates. \"Lets see... If they lasted about two horus for me, and he took the whole bottle... Uh... How many was in the bottle again...?\" Kiba tried thinking. However, he couldn't even remember how many were in there! The bottle was filled to the top, and Naruto took every last one! Kiba felt a slight shiver down his spine as he thought just how mind-bendingly large that Naruto would end up! Shaking his head from those thoughts, Kiba dashed out of the village, determined to work out and get as big as he possibly could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Shinobi Gym, where all the boys seemed to gather to pump up their bods, Shikamaru had just finished a set of curls. Being the lazy kid he was, he made his way to the lockers, ready to call it quits for the day. It was such a shame... He really knew how to work a body, and could have been bigger than Kiba and Naruto combined back when they were their normal size, yet willingly chose not to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shikamaru opened the door to his locker, he felt a presence standing directly behind him! As he turned and looked, he didn't see anyone until he gazed down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" A young boy replied. He wore a baggy paperboy cap, a blue jacket with a yellow scarf, baggy pants and deep blue shoes. He carried a briefcase, and Shikamaru could tell just by his eyes and the skin around it that he must have been no older than 10!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah?\" Shikamaru replied. He didn't really see much of a threat from a little boy, but you never knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to give you these...\" The boy said, holding up a bottle of pills up at Shikamaru. \"They're special vitamins that'll help you bulk up if you take them before your workout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru gently took the bottle from the boy, looking them over. \"Bulk up... You mean gain more muscle mass, right?\" Shikamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!\" The boy said, smiling behind his scarf. \"My... Dad's company is made these, and he wanted me to help push product...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a nice man...\" Shikamaru said sarcasitcally, rolling his eyes. He just shrugged. He knew what a pain it was to do something you didn't want to, and it was free, after all. He pocketed the bottle, and looked back down at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" He said with a smile, before walking off. His bright expression changed back to normal as he went back to the workout area. \"Someone with potential... Check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru was in his room, busy doing push-up! On the nearby desk, there was a picture of him and Naruto, both of them shirtless and flexing! Naruto clearly had more mass, but Konohamaru was nothing to scoff at either! There wasn't a lot of mass, but Konohamaru had great definition! As Konohamaru did his 100th push up, he glanced up at the picture, a smile on his face! It served as an inspiration to him! Konohamaru went on to do just a few more, pushing himself beyond the goal he set for himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a faster way.\" A voice suddenly said. Konohamaru stopped, letting his body slam onto the ground before looking up. Right on his windowsill, the same boy who had just met with Shikamaru sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who are you!?\" Konohamaru demanded to know!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I'm... Saburou.\" He replied, making up a name on the spot! \"You're a hard worker, huh?\" He said, noticing how much Konohamaru was sweating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm gonna be a big as Naruto one day! No wait... I'm gonna be even bigger!\" He said, his hands on his hips as he puffed out his chest. Saburou just chuckled. He clearly hadn't seen Naruto lately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cute.\" Saburou replied, hopping into Konohamaru's room. He walked over, picking up the picture of Konohamaru and Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Put that down!\" Konohamaru demanded, running in closer! Saburou set it down before Konohamaru had to force him to. \"Whadd'ya mean 'there's a faster way'?\" Konohamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, to get bigger.\" Saburou replied. \"That's what you want, right? You just said you wanted to be bigger than Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Yeah... But how?\" Konohamaru asked, looking down at Saburou. This kid was about the size Konohamaru was about two years ago...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here!\" Saburou quickly held up a bottle of pills to Konohamaru's face that he pulled from his jacket pocket. \"You just take one of these before a workout. They'll help you gain more muscle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" The guillable Konohamaru said, snatching the bottle right up! \"So I just take one of these before I work out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" The boy said with a smile, \"You'll topple Naruto over in no time!\" Saburou said. It wasn't until now that he learned just who Naruto was, drawing a connection from Konohamaru's ramblings and the picture on his desk! \"Now if you'll excuse me...\" Saburou hopped over onto the windowsill again, \"I gotta get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Konohamaru could even respond, Saburou was gone like a breeze! \"A rising star... Check!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the gym, Asuma glared on with jealousy. Kakashi was a lucky dog, with his Sharingan ability. He was able to mimic the workouts of some of the biggest guys in the gym, and thusly, he had outgrown Asuma in just a matter of months! The once thinly muscled sensei had easily bulked up to three times his previous size, while Asuma had only managed a few twenty pounds and some better definition! Sheer hard work was losing out to someone who was just copying everything! Asuma panted as he finished doing chest pressed, but just across the gym, Kakashi was getting way more looks as he was doing ab crunches! Suffice to say, Asuma was jealous. But he was a man about it! He wasn't about to throw a fit, no, instead he was going to keep working at it! He would easily surpass Kakashi, and reclaim his status as the biggest Jonin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Asuma was about to get up, a boy in dark blue stood in his way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little guy? Could you move for me?\" Asuma asked nicely. He was good with kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually... Would you like to try my dad's company's new product?\" Saburou asked, giving him the same song and dance that he had given Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure... I guess.\" Asuma said, as any normal person who was suddenly offered an unknown product would react. Saburou reached in his jacket and pulled out a bottle of pills for Asuma. \"Here you go. These pills help men gain more muscle mass when they work out.\" Saburou explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma's eyebrows rose. \"Really?\" He took the bottle and looked it over. \"... What's in them?\" Asuma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... T-Tetra... T-Tet...\" Saburou suddenly started acting like a kid who was trying to pronounce a difficult word. Asuma just chuckled and pat his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, kid.\" He said with a warm smile. \"Thanks for these! I'll be sure to use them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaburou smiled and said, \"Thank you sir!\" Before walking off! \"And finally, someone with ambition... Check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a drag...\" Shikamaru said. \"... I guess I could work out just a little longer...\" He sighed, popping a pill in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These things are really going to help me...!\" Konohamaru thought, \"In fact, I'll even take two!\" He said, gulping down two little pills!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess if I'm gonna beat Kakashi, I'm going to need all the help I can get!\" Asuma said, popping a lone pill for himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaburou just smiled. Now it was time to pay a visit to the guinea pig that started it all for him...!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Saburou was fast, nimble, and incredibly hard to catch. He had the unique ability to sink into the shadows, to go unnoticed and unremembered. Anyone who happened to see the strange boy quickly forgot about him as soon as he was out of sight. It made his job so much easier. After delivering the pills to his other test subjects, he had quickly scaled to the top of the gym, moving across the rooftops, away from it, as Naruto started lumbering through the streets toward the gym, a mischievous grin on his face. Saburou grinned as he saw him approach. \"Perfect!\" He thought to himself as he headed for the gate. \"Now, Kiba said he'd be in the forest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba panted and gasped as he pushed himself, doing more pushups than he had ever done before in his life. Sweat was dripping from his body and pattering onto the dirt, his chest and arms swelling with every movement. But it wasn't enough! Kiba was a beast of a teenager, bigger than anyone else his age normally, but he was still only a minor nuisance to Naruto. Something to be swatted aside with a laugh. Or worse, something to be caught and played with! With a grunt, Kiba pushed against the ground twice as hard, rising to his feet briefly before falling backwards, rolling as he landed and immediately going into a series of ab crunches, the thick muscles clenching and relaxing, standing out in stark relief against his tanned, glistening skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had managed to do about one hundred crunches before a voice called out, \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba, startled slightly, immediately got to his feet and held up his fists, his chest rising and falling as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up and saw the strange kid from earlier sitting up in a tree, smirking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're that kid who gave me the pills!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! And you're that guy who let someone else steal them from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba blushed slightly, clenching his fist as he glared up at Saburou. \"That wasn't my fault! Naruto stole them from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and now he's way bigger than you too. And guess what? He's only going to keep getting bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" Kiba shouted, smashing his fist against the tree, cracking it nearly in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaburou giggled, leaping from the branches as the tree fell. \"And there's more! I've been handing out some some more free samples! Three full bottles, just floating around out there. And with Naruto stomping around, showing off, it won't be long before they start having the same thoughts about overdosing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's mouth dropped open as he heard this, gripping his hair in his hands in frustration. \"This is insane! I was on top! I'm not going to let it all slip from my fingers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaburou, his briefcase resting comfortably on his lap, grinned down at Kiba, swinging his legs slightly as he sat on a branch. \"You know, Naruto was never supposed to even be a part of this. I never wanted him to get the pills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba looked up at Saburou and said, \"Yeah? Just why have you been handing these pills out anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaburou shrugged and said, \"I have my reasons. I don't think you really care as long as you get some, right? Right. And I happen to have more right here.\" He popped open the briefcase and pulled a bottle out, shaking it slightly, holding it out so Kiba could see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba immediately stepped forward, his hand resting on the trunk of the tree Saburou was sitting in. It was almost involuntary, like he was compelled. \"How many bottles you got in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than you need.\" Saburou said, snapping the briefcase closed again. \"But I'm willing to hand THIS bottle over to you. If you promise me you'll do one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it? I'll do anything!\" Kiba said, already reaching up for the pills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take out Naruto!\" Saburou said, standing up. \"You don't have to kill him or anything, just knock him out and tie him up or something. I just need him to lie still for about an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...what are you going to do to him?\" Kiba couldn't help but ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaburou pulled out a needle and said, \"Damage control. But if you fail, I'm not against using it on you either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba thought about it for a second before he said, \"Alright! I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you would!\" The boy replied, dropping the bottle into Kiba's waiting hand. \"Make sure you don't screw things up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Saburou jumped away, snickering to himself as he ran. \"This is too perfect. Now we'll see who comes out on top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba had been the last adjustment he needed to make for his plans. Now all five men were engaged, racing without realizing they were racing. Saburou carefully pocketed the syringe and headed back to the village to catch the next show. He landed on the wall of the village and scanned the horizon, trying to spot Naruto. \"You'd think that big doofus wouldn't be hard to spot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly spotted Naruto over by an abandoned building, studying it. Saburou pulled out a little telescope and scanned the village, looking for the gym. Sure enough, the roof had been ripped off and the walls were almost falling down. Shikamaru and Asuma were now aware of Naruto and his far greater size. With Naruto stomping around and making mischief it wouldn't be long before Konohamaru was aware of him as well. Saburou grinned and patted his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever comes out on top, I'll still win.\"</span></div></div>",

It didn't fit perfect, but everyone in the entire gym say the face of the giant who looked down upon them! Asuma, who was still surprised, looked down. And here he was upset over how big Kakashi had been getting, here someone practically half his age was so much bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Asuma-sensei?\" Someone called out, prompting the bearded man to look up. He saw the face of his old student, Shikamaru!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! You...?\" Asuma began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I think it's safe to say everyone did...\" Shikamaru replied, \"And I think I just might know how he did it too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?\" Asuma said, looking up at Shikamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too?\" Shikamaru repeated, \"Are you saying that you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma's body moved without his mind thinking. He reached over into his gym bag, and pulled out a bottle, holding it up to Shikamaru! At the same time, the young man reached into his pocket and showed Asuma his! They were filled to exactly the same amount, and looked identical to each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get yours from...?\" Shikamaru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little kid in a blue outfit!\" Asuma replied, finishing Shikamaru's sentance! \"Yeah! You're telling me you think Naruto got ahold of some of these? And they really work? ... Like that!?\" Asuma babbled on, barely able to believe it had he not seen it himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that much is clear.\" Shikamaru said. \"But the question is, what do you think WE should do?\" Shikamaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma smiled as he heard Shikamaru say this. \"Isn't it obvious? We've got a lot of catching up to do!\" Asuma popped off the top, and took a handfull of the pills, before feeding them down his mouth! Shikamaru was shocked by the sudden, impulsive behavior from his former sensei! But if he wanted even a chance of stopping Naruto, he had to do something! He did just as Asuma did, taking a handful of pills, and popping them right into his mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after, the two got right down to working out! Asuma began crunching his abs like there was no tomorrow, and feeling of fatigue wiped clean from his mind! Even the lazy Shikamaru was getting down to it, doing squats on a nearby machine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were like a blur throughout the entire gym! They would do countless reps in record time! The two of them were sweating up a storm, so much so that Asuma had decided to ditch his t-shirt, leaving his nude, hunky, hairy body on display for everyone to see! Shikamaru chose to keep his tanktop on, but it was just a size too small, making him look bigger than he actually was! The two of them were really drawing a crowd, which was all that was needed to send Asuma into overdrive! He was finally getting what he wanted over Kakashi, and it felt so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, the two of them were putting on immesurable amounts of mass in record time! On one side of the gym, there was Shikamaru. His biceps were already bigger than Kiba's once were, but they just kept growing and growing! Their once fit size was soon surpassed, until they were the size of bowling balls! Veins ran all along them, pulsing with pure power as the ninja worked! His pecs were pushing out further, looking like two overinflated medicine balls, which were like a shelf over the ripped canyon he called abs! Shikamaru's back was huge nearly the length of two boogie boards and growing! He didn't stop pumping iron for a second, even as he heard his tanktop starting to rip, becoming much too small for a growing boy! Those that stood before Shikamaru could see as his thighs grew bigger and heavier, each of them easily twice the size of a telephone pole! Shikamaru's thunderous calves were flexed hard, getting bigger as they held up the massive teen's body! Even his feet were getting bigger, stretching along the mats of the gym, each toe plumping up as he grew! With every squat, Shikamaru's ass stuck out just a little bit more, coming within inches of the ground with every downward motion! Over in the front, Shikamaru's manhood had grown so large and heavy in his shorts that they began to sag, showing off every ab he had! Under that, his briefs sagged even more, a thick black bush at the top of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who weren't watching Shikamaru were probably on the other side of the gym watching Asuma instead! The man gasped a little, his sweaty chest heaving, seeming to push further outward with every breath! A drip of sweat plunged off his leathery nipple, splashing on the ground below! His abs pushed out further and packed on more muscle! Asuma was so large, that his abs alone were the size of a normal muscleman's pecs! Asuma's meaty biceps continued to grow, in a fashion similar to Shikamaru's, becoming two large mountains of power! His forearms grew with them, making the man so powerful he could smash holes in solid concrete! He grew even taller, slowly getting a bit too big for the machine, but it didn't stop him from working out! His legs were spread open and hanging out on either side of the machine, both of his thighs able to crush heads between them with the simplest flex! Calves so dense and muscular that rivaled softballs! And not to mention his huge, musky feet got bigger, taking up more room as he kept growing! Anyone who looked at Asuma would immediately notice the heat he was packing! A cock that was easily over a foot long, and all-out thickness, with balls the size of baseballs! Behind Asuma, his tight bubble butt was keeping up with the rest of his body, smooshed against the chair of the machine!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Asuma began to feel even a little bit tired, he'd just open his eyes, and take one look at the crowd. He had grown so massive, that he could actually see eye to eye with many of them, even while sitting down! He grinned, and put himself right back into it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men were dominating the gym, eagar to catch up to the spectacle of man that they had seen in what felt like a short while ago...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Kiba trained in the woods, Naruto searched for Kiba, and Asuma and Shikamaru worked themselves silly in the gym, Konohamaru was blissfully unaware of everything that was going on outside, too wrapped up in his own training to care. He had been moving back and forth between doing push ups, sit ups, squats, and other home exercises like a mad man, barely pausing to rest! The only time he stopped was to take a drink of water. He had just finished another set of sit ups, his child sized but still impressively athletic body glistening with sweat, when he gulped down a whole glass of water, letting out a happy sigh when he was finished. \"Man! Those pills are awesome! I feel so full of energy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eagerly ran over to the full length mirror he had bought and set up in his room and flexed in front of it. \"Hey! I look huge! Hahaha! This is great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his hands over his rather thick pecs, his shoulders looking broad while his traps rose up slightly around his thick neck. His hands ran over the swollen muscles before touching his abs, each finger gently rubbing the impressive bricks of muscle. He turned and flexed his back, the smooth surface erupting in a series of canyons, bringing a grin to Konohamaru's face. He turned back to the front and suddenly noticed something strange. \"Hey...are these shorts getting smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tugged at the hem, noticing that they only reached halfway down his thigh! \"They are! They're smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran over to his closet and grabbed one of his sandals, pressing the bottom flat against the bottom of his foot. His eyes widened when he saw it was only half the size it should have been! \"Wooooah! I got taller! This...this is crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru still had a grin on his face, however. He tossed the sandal aside and flexed his arms, watching as his biceps bulged upward, looking like two softballs were stuffed under his skin! Konohamaru then brought both of his arms down in front of him, flexing hard, his chest popping out over top of them. \"Oh yeah! I've gotta be the biggest kid in the Academy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put his arms behind his head and flexed his abs, the cobblestone path of muscle tightening and standing out in stark relief to the rest of his body. Konohamaru just couldn't seem to get enough! \"No way I got this big from working out! People don't grow taller just from lifting weights or exercising! But then what...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes suddenly noticed the small pill bottle sitting on his desk in the mirror. He rushed over to it and picked it up, looking all over the label for instructions or side effects. It was completely blank. \"That kid DID say it would help me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru popped the top off the bottle and tossed another pill into his mouth, swallowing it, renewed energy almost immediately filling him. He grinned and said, \"Let's test this out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately launched into his routine once again, the room filling with the scent of young musk as Konohamaru pushed himself harder than he had ever pushed himself before! Sweat began pouring down his body in streams, pattering against the floor like rain, his breathing getting louder and harsher as he kept pushing for more and more! After at least an hour of non stop exercising, Konohamaru sprang to his feet and rushed over to the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooooow!\" He shouted, not quite believing the reflection he saw in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was HUGE! The top of his head was out of view, his gigantic, wide chest, the sweat only accentuating the massive mounds of meat. Konohamaru playfully bounced his chest, sweat droplets shining in the air as they were launched off his chest. His shoulders seemed impossibly wide, disappearing out of view on either side of the mirror. Konohamaru fell to his knees, his grinning face dropping into view as he saw how thick his neck was, his traps rising up even more around them, making the cute, childish face on top seem completely out of place. Konohamaru got back on to his feet, moving back so he could more easily see his lower body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Heh, guess my muscles aren't the only thing that's growing!\" He said proudly, reaching down to fondle his bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shorts were now pulled up around his waist, the front bulging out obscenely in front of him, his cock clearly outlined, his gigantic balls just as easily seen below them. He turned around and saw a thick, bouncy ass greeting him, every contour perfectly shaped. He gave it a sharp smack and grinned when he saw it bounce. His thighs were a masterpiece all on their own, thick and striated, every inch of them perfectly shaped. The way he was standing, they were practically rubbing against each other, forcing his bulge out even more! His calves bulged out behind him, easily able to support his enormous upper body. Even his feet had grown longer and thicker, his hands undergoing a similar transformation. His forearms were thick and strong, giving him a grip no preteen should have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru flexed his enormous biceps, closer to basketballs now than softballs, and chuckled. \"I must be as big as Uncle Asuma! Maybe even BIGGER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pills seemed to work much more effectively on Konohamaru, probably due to the fact that he was still in the midst of puberty while everyone else who had taken them were more or less already fully developed. Konohamaru slowly made his way over to his dresser, his every footstep causing the room to shake. \"And if only a few pills made me THIS big than...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed the bottle with a somewhat evil grin and said, \"Naruto won't know what hit him~!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kiba was in the forest, hard at work! He had taken the entire bottle of pills, and was already packing on unbelievable amounts of muscle! Kiba was already rivialing the size of trees, and that was just when he was laying down to to ab crunches! With no workout equipment big enough for him, he was forced to use his own body as his a tool! Kiba sat there, his back arching as he swayed back and forth, muscles bulging, sweat running down his body in small streams! Naruto may have determined, but anything that dumb blonde could do, Kiba swore he could do ten times better! The feral teen had long ditched his clothes, and was now in the buff, every inch of his massive, toned body on display!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna... Get... Huge! Gonna... Beat... Naruto's... Ass!\" Kiba growled between sit ups! His pecs were now beyond huge, packed with unbridled size to the point they nearly touched his chin when he laid down! His shoulders were like two wrecking balls, only bigger and harder! His biceps could bench entire mountains with ease! Kiba grunted, pushing himself faster and harder as he had the sudden thought of Naruto beating him! Kiba's waistline was kept trim, while his hips were just a little bit wider! His thighs bulged outward, each of them like a gargantuan teardrop surrounded by an entire valley! Kiba's calves were keeping up, packing on just as much size as his thighs, while his feet continued to creep closer twords the village! Kiba had to relocate seveal times just so Naruto wouldn't catch on to his growing body! The special medicine of the pills also made sure Kiba's manhood was nothing to scoff at either! Just as the dog man had finished a workout, his cock alone must have been at least half the size of one of the trees when it was flaccid! Kiba's ass hadn't gone unattended, the two of them leaving large craters in the spot where he lay! As Kiba's workout slowed to a stop, he laid there, sprawled out and defenseless so he could rest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's sweat was making small, musky puddles all around where he lay. His chest heaved, breaking the treeline when he took a big breath! Kiba groaned softly, trying to stay quiet. Even as he laid there, he could feel every single one of his muscles pulsing and growing! All his work hadn't gone unnoticed! It was hard to believe that this morning, he was so small... So insignificant, whereas now he was a gigantic, hulking hunk of a man! Being this big... This strong, it felt fucking fantastic! Kiba felt a little spark of arousal course through his veins as he laid there... It was sexually satisfying, but right now, Kiba had bigger fish to fry! He wasn't about to be as hasty and undisciplined as Naruto would be! Kiba took a little more time to relax, before finally getting to his feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba suddenly felt all his weight as he stood to his full height! He grinned, stretching and flexing his biceps as he did! The thick, bulging muscles made a soft, thunderous sound that only someone with Kiba's ears could hear! The muscles pulsed as blood rushed to them, engorging them with even more power! Kiba smirked, before taking his first step forward, his gargantuan feet crushing countless trees underfoot! Kiba took another step, harder this time! He could see tiny flies known as birds fleeing, as the entire ground shook underneath him! Slowly, he started to make his way back to the village...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, where is he!?\" Naruto grumbled as he tore open yet another roof! He had practically turned the entire village upside down just searching for Kiba! He wasn't smart enough to think that Kiba might have left the village! But soon enough, he would be forced to find out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Tall, buff, and stupid!\" A loud voice called out, making Naruto shake a little! As he turned around, his entire body was engulfed in shadow as he looked up and saw the behemoth that was Kiba Inuzuka! \"K-Kiba?\" Naruto stammered, \"How the hell did you get so... So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big?\" Kiba asked. He smiled, giving his pecs an arrogant flex. \"You know... Working out... Vitamins... All that.\" Kiba then gave Naruto a little kick, knocking him backwards onto the village! \"Now get up, runt! Fight me like a man!\" Kiba ordered!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto did as Kiba said, and Kiba soon found out that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto, his mind filling with questions about why Kiba was suddenly so huge when before he had been small enough to crush in his fist, got to his feet and dusted himself off, debris falling from his massive muscular body, a hotel that had been one of the most profitable in the Leaf Village now nothing more than a pile of crushed wood, bricks, and mortar. He clenched his fists and was about to charge Kiba when he realized that the dog ninja had already casually walked up to him, his shadow looming over him. Naruto's mouth dropped open, his defiant expression changing to one of shock. Kiba took a deep breath, his chest expanding outward, blocking his face from Naruto's sight. Naruto gulped, tilting his head back slightly. The tips of his spiky hair just barely reached the top of Kiba's abs, his eye staring directly into Kiba's belly button. Naruto's attention was brought back up to Kiba's face, a grin plastered across it, his chest rising and falling below his chin. \"Guess we're right back where we were before all this started!\" Kiba said, pressing the palm of his hand down hard on top of Naruto's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto growled and shoved Kiba's hand away, glaring up at him. \"I don't care HOW big you are! I'm still going to beat your ass and prove I'm the strongest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed and said, \"Oh yeah? How about I give you a fair shot then?\" He put his hands behind his head and flexed his abs as hard as he could, grinning at Naruto. \"Give me a punch, right in the gut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted and thumbed his nose at Kiba. \"You serious? You're going to just let me hit you? You're going to regret it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't think I will.\" Kiba said nonchalantly. \"I think you're going to be the only one who regrets anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto didn't waste any more time with words. He made a fist, pulled it back, and launched it directly at Kiba's abs, a resounding THUD like thunder echoing across the village, his massive feet digging into the ground as he put as much force as he could behind it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba let out a little grunt...then chuckled. \"Aw man, seriously? That's the best you can do? Our size difference isn't even that much! I guess my muscles are just really that dense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your head is the only thing that's dense!\" Naruto shouted, embarrassed by his weakness in the face of Kiba. He held out his right hand and gathered his chakra, a blue spinning ball of energy appearing in it. Without waiting for Kiba to respond, Naruto shoved the ball against Kiba's abs, the force of the Rasengan building up against Kiba before launching him spinning backward, his massive body taking out row after row of houses, innocent civilians running screaming as their homes and businesses were decimated, some unable to escape from collapsing buildings. Naruto and Kiba took absolutely no notice off this. Naruto just cheered and pumped his fist in the air, a grin back on his face. \"Hah! Not so tough now are you Kiba?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba groaned and held his abs, the once immaculate muscles stained with black marks from the force of Naruto's chakra. \"Guess I should be glad he didn't use that wind technique...I might have been in trouble then.\" Kiba thought to himself, getting back to his feet. \"You know what Naruto? You want to play hardball? Then get ready for the pain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his hands together and shouted \"Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry! All Fours Jutsu!\" Kiba's body immediately became more animalistic, his teeth sharpening into fangs while his finger and toe nails grew longer and sharper. He crouched down on all fours, growling at Naruto before he charged forward, his gigantic hands and bare feet ripping through the village, tearing a new path of destruction through the village in his pursuit of Naruto! Naruto's eyes widened as Kiba flew at him, his body twisting around so fast he seemed to transform into a cyclone! Before Naruto could so much as block, the point of the cyclone slammed into his chest, forcing Naruto back, his body blasting through even more of the Leaf Village's buildings, the bustling town looking more like a battlefield than an idyllic landscape. The citizens of the village were clearing out as quickly as they could, trying to hide inside the Hokage mountain while the ninja of the village tried to decide what to do about this battle of titans. Naruto was flung onto his back, his chest scratched in several places by Kiba's nails, his body splattered with dirt and blood. Kiba, panting slightly, grinned as he stared down at Naruto, slamming his bare foot down on top of Naruto's chest, earning a groan of pain from his fallen foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...how about you show me how superior I am by licking my toes?\" Kiba asked with a grin, slowly inching his toes closer to Naruto's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kiba could force Naruto to perform this humiliating task, the ground began to shake violently. Kiba looked around in confusion, allowing Naruto the chance to lift Kiba's huge foot off his chest, making him stumble, allowing Naruto to get back to his feet. \"What the hell is that?\" Naruto asked, looking around with Kiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How should I know?!\" Kiba growled, starting to get nervous as the rumbling increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, one of the buildings in the Leaf Village exploded! Which building was it?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Kiba looked around, he could see one of the building beginning to shake! He recognized it as the Gym, thanks to all the windows that let in natural light. The building was starting to curve outward, as if barely able to contain what was inside! As if that wasn't a bad sign, the building curved in another direction! Were there two giants in there!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba soon had his answer as he saw the roof slowly coming off! It had already been torn off by Naruto once, making it very easy to just peel right off! A spiky bush of black hair caught Kiba's eye, but he soon noticed a dark, navy blue bush sprouting right next to it! As the roof began to crumble, Kiba was able to make out the heads of Shikamaru and Asuma! The two beastly giants were quickly outgrowing the gym, leaving it in shambles beneath them! The pair was pressed tight up against each other, Asuma's bulging, hairy chest packed tightly against Shikamaru's pumped, smooth pecs! Their abs were rippling brick roads, Asuma's a little more bulkier, but Shikamaru had an eight-pack, unlike his sensei! As the building fell to pieces beneath them, they both finally stood up at their full heights, everything in front of them touching! Pecs, feet, even their monstrous dicks were brushed against each other! Asuma had a warm grin on his face, while Shikamaru just gave a cocky little smirk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, told you we were about to burst out of there!\" Asuma said happily, \"And check out these guns!\" Asuma rose up his bicep and flexed it as hard as he could! The muscle seemed to burst, doubling in size! It was practically the size of a small mountain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're pretty bulky... But your body isn't as defined as mine!\" Shikamaru set his arms behind his head and crunched his abs! Each hardened mound popped out, so deep and hard you could cut a diamond on them! \"But just look at us...!\" Shikamaru then said, \"I think we're both winners here!\" He told Asuma, trying to keep things friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You guys!\" Kiba shouted, waving from a (relatively) short distance away! Shikamaru and Asuma looked over, their jaws dropping as they saw Kiba! Here they thought they were huge, Kiba was a titanic, hulking behemoth! The two of them started walking over, being extra careful where they stepped, making their way over to Kiba! As the got close, they saw that they only reached up to his shoulders, Kiba still a whole head taller than them! Kiba grinned, puffing out his chest a little when he saw he was still the alpha male around here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how'd you guys get so big!?\" Kiba demanded to know. Shikamaru just looked Kiba over briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, judging by how big you are, I think you already know, you big mutt!\" Shikamaru said jokingly. Kiba proudly gave his bulging pecs a proud bounce!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Asuma began, \"I see you took care of our little problem.\" He said, taking note of the weakened Naruto who still had Kiba's foot on his thick pecs. \"... And part of the village.\" Asuma also noted, looking back at the bit of damage the two had caused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, heh heh, yeah...\" Kiba said sheepishly, looking aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get you two out of here.\" Shikamaru said, looking around the village. \"Kiba, you and Asuma pick up Naruto, I'm going to find a place where we can wait things out. And try not to step on anything!\" Shikamaru insisted, before carefully taking his leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma carefully positioned himself at the feet of Naruto, while Kiba took the head! With a nod to each other, they lifted him right up and began to carry him away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey...!\" Naruto barked weakly, \"Where are we going!?\" He demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting you out of here!\" Kiba snapped back at him, \"You're way too destructive to hang out here!\" Naruto would have made a sharp quip right back at Kiba, but found himself in no situation to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere minutes, they had left the village, meeting up with Shikamaru as they did! \"Alright, there's a clearing not too far from here. There's no people and no distractions. Follow me.\" Shikamaru ordered. Even though he wasn't the biggest, he sure seemed to suddenly take charge around here! Kiba was a little miffed, but at he at least trusted him enough since he proved to be on his side. And by his side, he meant against Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too much longer, they reached the clearing. Kiba and Asuma carelessly tossed Naruto the ground! Asuma then took a seat right on top of Naruto, making the tender fox ninja wince a little. Asuma was practically the second heaviest guy here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, sorry kid. Can't have you running off on us!\" Asuma said, grinning down at Naruto. It felt kind of good to be able to dominate someone this easily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... Now we have to figure out our next move...\" Shikamaru said, taking a seat. The three boys sat in a sort of triangle formation, with Asuma sitting on top of Naruto at the top!</span></div></div>",

All that would be left after that was interrogation and getting an antidote...maybe) the ground around them began to shake violently. Everyone stopped, even Naruto, who ceased his struggling. They all began to look around at each other and only one thought was on their minds: if they were all here, what was making so much noise? There question was quickly answered as a gigantic shadow stretched across them, throwing them all into a premature twilight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous giant, dwarfing even Kiba, was standing before them, his head level with the sun, obscuring his features. Shikamaru, Kiba, and Asuma all looked up with open mouths, shocked at the sudden arrival of such a titanic man. Naruto took this opportunity to begin struggling anew, though he was just as unsuccessful as before. Just when Shikamaru was about to ask this man who he was, he bent down, a playful grin on his young face. \"Hey you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Konohamaru?!\" Asuma said, getting to his feet, shocked again to see his nephew towering over them all like a god. \"How did you get so huge?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru bounced his pecs arrogantly, a dull thud echoing through the clearing like far off thunder. \"Heh, the same way you four did I guess, but you guys must not have tried very hard at all! You're all still so puny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched up to his full height and shouted, \"Hey, dog boy! Get up! You're the biggest so measure yourself up against me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba twitched slightly at how Konohamaru was addressing him but decided it would probably not be wise to antagonize the teen whose toes were clearing the tree tops! He pushed himself up against Konohamaru's leg and was annoyed to see he was only as tall as Konohamaru's ankle! They were all like dolls to him! Konohamaru snickered and said, \"Yeah, that's what I thought! Guess the youngest guy here is still the manliest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and kicked Kiba aside playfully, crouching down next to where Naruto was still lying, slowly trying to crawl away now that Asuma had gotten off of him. \"Hey boss! These guys giving you trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked up at Konohamaru's innocent face and said, \"Uh...yeah! These guys all ganged up on me! Talk about mean, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru frowned and looked down at the other ninja. \"Oh, so you guys think it's okay to gang up on a guy three to one huh? I thought you were better than that Uncle Asuma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konohamaru you don't understand...\" Asuma began before Konohamaru gave him a flick, his thick finger smashing into his chest, sending the older man flying backward, head over heels, taking out a significant chunk of forest before slowing to a stop, leaving a deep trench in the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want any excuses!\" Konohamaru warned, scooping Naruto up and getting to his feet. \"I'm going to have to teach you three a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsuma groaned and picked himself up, his chest feeling painfully bruised. Konohamaru had more strength in his finger than Asuma had in his whole body! He shaded his eyes and studied his nephew, taking in his mountainous pecs, biceps that dwarfed them all in height, traps rising up around a neck thicker than any tree. He had a ripped eight pack, every brick perfectly formed and harder than steel, the deep canyons between them big enough to lose an arm in! His thighs were like massive pillars pushing him closer to the heavens, his calves bulging with his every movement to support the incredible body above them. His feet were wide and strong, able to smash trees like twigs and decimate entire city blocks just by walking! His endowment was equally impressive, proportionally bigger than any of the other ninja, even the much older and more mature Asuma! His balls swung heavily in the wind, a light dusting of pubic hair around the base of his shaft. His ass jutted out behind him like a cushion, round, bouncy, and yet firm and muscular enough to draw all eyes to it, wanting to give it a nice hard squeeze! All in all, Konohamaru was a fearsome sight to behold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru dropped Naruto down onto his shoulder and gave him a thumbs up. \"Don't worry boss! As long as I'm around you won't have to worry about anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto blushed a little, feeling embarrassed that someone so much younger than him was not only so much bigger but was treating HIM like he was a little kid! \"Yeah, yeah, just teach these jerks a lesson already!\" Naruto was in the mood for some payback, even if he wasn't the one doling it out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru grinned evilly down at the assembled ninja, Kiba and Asuma bracing themselves for whatever was about to come. \"Hey! Wait a minute! Where's the lazy guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone started looking around, but Shikamaru was nowhere to be seen! \"No way! Don't tell me he got away!\" Konohamaru said, a pouting expression rising to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?! Take care of these guys first!\" Naruto shouted right into Konohamaru's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young titan winced and glared at Naruto, making the older ninja gulp slightly. \"Listen boss, I'm doing this as a favor since you messed up so bad! So if you keep ordering me around and yelling at me you're going to get the same thing these guys are going to get! Understand?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked to the side and quietly muttered, \"Yeah, yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now...let's focus in on you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Konohamaru reached down for Kiba, he had no idea that when he had crouched down earlier, his massive sack had landed on Shikamaru, getting the miniscule shinobi all tangled up in the few pubic hairs Konohamaru had. Shikamaru was currently struggling, dangling high in the air, trying to escape! Luckily, he managed to break free just as Konohamaru bent down, allowing him to hit the ground safely and run into hiding! The question is, what does he do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About halfway during the night, Kiba suddenly woke up, sitting ramrod straight up in bed. He looked blearily around his room before throwing back his covers and yawning, smacking his lips and getting up. The floor shook slightly as he walked, his foot coming down rather hard on the little bottle of pills that were still lying on the floor. The top of it popped off, scattering several pills across the floor. Kiba cursed under his breath and began gathering them back up, forcing the top back onto the bottle. \"Dammit...how did these things get down here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped the bottle back into his pocket, not leaving anything to chance. Little did he now, one of the pills had shot right into Naruto's mouth, the blonde haired ninja swallowing it in his sleep. He coughed slightly, turned on his side, and fell back asleep. Kiba, meanwhile, stood in front of the toilet, pissing as he stared up at the ceiling, his eyes half closed. He was still feeling out of it. He hated waking up in the middle of the night! Once he was done, he flushed, washed his hands, and made his way back to his room. Once there, he noticed Naruto wasn't sleeping on the floor anymore, his blanket bunched up in the corner of the room. Kiba raised an eyebrow at this but shrugged, sticking the bottle of pills inside one of his jock straps. He knew Naruto wouldn't dare go near those things! He chuckled and headed back to his bed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to discover that Naruto was curled up there! Kiba growled in annoyance, grabbing Naruto by the scruff of his neck and dragging him towards the edge of the bed. Unfortunately, the tricky little ninja had clung tightly to the blankets in his sleep. If Kiba tossed him back onto the ground, he was going to lose all the blankets on his bed! He sighed and shoved Naruto over, getting in next to him. \"There's no way I'm giving up my bed to Naruto.\" Kiba thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive dog ninja turned his back on Naruto, quickly falling back asleep. During the night, Naruto and Kiba slowly began to drift closer to each other in their sleep. An hour after Kiba returned to the bed, he had turned around to face Naruto. Naruto, for his part, scooted so close to Kiba's body that he was nearly buried face first in the bigger ninja's chest. An hour after that, Kiba had reached out his arms. Naruto shifted his body so the arm was underneath him. An hour after that, Kiba closed his arms around Naruto, drawing him close against his chest like he was holding a teddy bear. Naruto wrapped his arms around Kiba's neck. The two ninja stayed in this compromising position for the rest of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly the next morning, Naruto woke up first, his eyes slowly opening to find nothing but a vast expanse of muscly flesh in front of him. He blinked a few times and slowly lifted his head, looking up at Kiba's sleeping face. The fox ninja blushed profusely, realizing that he was embracing Kiba...and Kiba was embracing him back! He tried to move away but Kiba's grip was too strong! He felt like a little kid, trapped at Kiba's mercy. He could have probably kneed the dog boy in the crotch or twisted his nipples until he woke up and let him go...but he had to admit (though it pained him to do so) that lying here with Kiba, all warm and comfortable, felt really...nice! For a brief moment he forgot why he had come here. Then his memories clicked back into place and he remembered. He was on a personal mission! He had to find how Kiba was getting so big so fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slowly began to worm his way downward, out of Kiba's grasp. It was extremely slow moving as Naruto wanted to make absolutely sure that Kiba wasn't going to wake up. He had gotten about halfway down Kiba's body when the dog ninja let out a soft moan. Naruto froze in place, not daring to move but Kiba didn't seem to be awake. Naruto was about to move again when he noticed where he was. Kiba's crotch was directly in front of his face! His body must have been rubbing up against Kiba's junk as he had tried to escape! It explained the moan and it certainly explained the fully outlined erection in front of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could make any more moves...</span></div></div>",

He looked from the mirror to his bulked up body! He immediately noticed the vein throbbing slightly, as his bicep was started to swell up even larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" Kiba laughed to himself, flexing the arm and watching as it grew bigger and thicker with every little pump! But it wasn't just his arms growing, it was his entire body! Kiba looked back in the mirror and saw as the collar of his tanktop was starting to drag down, and his pecs were pushing their way out further and further from his chest! It was mere seconds before they had grew too huge and his nipples had started to peek out from the sides! Kiba groaned a little, his deep voice echoing inside the vacant bathroom. His abs were pushing out a little further from him, each of them like a brick of pure muscle! His shoulders were pushing further apart from each other, as his traps started rising up around his neck! The tanktop was starting to strain, like thin cloth trying to contain rising bread! Kiba's body didn't seem to want to stop, as the dog man felt everything below the belt started to swell up into place! His thighs were starting to strain his pant legs, leaving no room left to grow! They started to rip slightly at the seams, unable to hold back all the beef that was filling them in! His calves were keeping up, each of them a rock-hard diamond of muscle! His feet stretched further across the bathroom floor, large, thick toes pushing their way forward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the teen's ego wasn't big enough already, his pants were filling up with his huge, fat cock! It must have been been at least ten inches long now and as big around as a normal man's arm! His balls were at least the size of a baseball each, hanging just below the giant anaconda of a dick. Behind him, his ass was putting on some meat, each of at least twice the size of a bowling ball! They had a bounce to them that would make them shake whenever Kiba took a step!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba grinned, and flexed his massive body! \"Aw fuck yeah! Now this is what I'm talking about!\" He said with a grin! \"So pumped... So huge... I'm a fucking beast!\" He said, rising his arms into a double bicep pose! The two meaty mountains shot up, split peaks upon the top, with a thick, veiny river that went down each of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba's body was red and swollen, pumped beyond belief! Every breath he took make his pecs push out and then in. He was a sight to see! His tanktop could barely contain him, as was riding up a little from the sheer size of his chest. The shorts he once wore were like hot pants, barely fitting the gargantuan man! He stood there, nearly ten feet tall, and huge as could be! With a big smirk on his face, he fetched his gym bag and started heading out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an average Konoha day, as the sun shone bright in the sky. Our little hero, Konohamaru, was walking in the streets of the village. Everyone who passed by seemed to greet him in the typical manner, saying, \"Good morning, honorable grandson.\" It irritated Konohamaru just a little, because he had wishes that for once, people would remember him for what he was, and not just for being the third hokage's grandson...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Konohamaru!\" Someone shouted. Konohamaru's head jolted right up as he looked up at Naruto! Part of him was just glad that someone recognized him and actually knew his name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Big brother Naruto! What are you doing here?\" Konohamaru said with just a little bit of excitement in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, nothing, just doing some big important mission! The usual stuff.\" Naruto said rubbing the back of his head as he had a cheeky grin on his face. It was at this instant that Konohamaru noticed that Naruto was carrying a medium sized box under one of his arms! On the side, it clearly had a label that read \"Deliver to Aho Tea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru snickered as he looked up at Naruto. \"Important mission? I guess you'd better hurry then! You wouldn't those tea bags to get old!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-- Hey!\" Naruto tried hiding the box behind his back, \"I-It's way more important that it looks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm sure those tea leaves are gonna stop the meteor from hitting Konoha!\" Konohamaru mocked, laughing loudly as he did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup you runt!\" Naruto barked, knocking Konohamaru on his head! Konohamaru shut his mouth, and rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, geez... Can't you even take a joke...?\" Konohamaru whined. There wasn't a bump, but it still hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few people stared, making a flustered Naruto rub the back of his head. \"U-Uh... Hey! How about we go get some ramen, huh?\" He offered. It was the only thing he could think of to get himself out of this sticky situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Konohamaru replied, perking right back up, \"That would be so cool! Let's go! Let's go now!\" Konohamaru said, taking a head start to Ichiraku. Naruto sighed and held onto the box, and quickly followed the young boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short little trip, Naruto was able to catch up to Konohamaru, who was just outside the shop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! I beat you!\" Konohamaru said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Naruto said back, dismissing Konohamaru's victory, \"You only won because I had to carry this box!\" The two of them then entered the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it's not even that heavy!\" Konohamaru said, \"You just need to build some muscle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked sarcastically at Konohamaru. He set it on the table, and it made a loud \"THUMP!\" as it hit. Naruto took a seat in the stool and glanced at Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're so tough, let's see you pick it up!\" Naruto said, \"Go ahead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru glanced at Naruto, and then the box. He got a cocky smile on his face as he put his arms on the box... With one quick heave, he managed to lift it off the table! ... But the box was just too heavy! Konohamaru plummeted to the ground, bringing the box down with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto burst out in laughter, slapping his thigh! \"Ha! See, I told you it wasn't easy!\" He said before getting up from his seat. He bent over to pick up the box and set it under his arm. He used a free hand to then help Konohamaru back up! Naruto sat back down, setting the box gently on the table, as a defeated Konohamaru took his seat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little guy!\" Naruto said happily, patting Konohamaru's head. \"Not everyone can be as strong as me!\" As Konohamaru looked up to reply, he saw that Naruto had rolled up his sleeve and was flexing his bicep! It was a decent sized muscle, maybe about as big as a baseball! \"Nice huh? All my training is getting me pretty ripped!\" Naruto zipped down his sweatshirt a little to show off his chest. The muscles had a little size to them, which became more apparant as Naruto squeezed them together with his hands! \"Pretty cool, right?\" Naruto asked rhetorically, \"Your big brother is pretty strong! I could take on anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Konohamaru replied in a dispondant tone. Naruto just smiled and rubbed his head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Maybe someday you'll be as strong as me! Maybe.\" Naruto told Konohamaru, trying to encourage the young man. It didn't seem to work very well...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru felt a little spark inside of him. A resolve, if you will. He was going to show everyone. Show them all that he wasn't just a little kid, that HE could be the one to beat them all! And it started with...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was totally oblivious to Konohamaru's mood. He smiled as he sat down at his usual stool, already getting Teuchi's attention. \"Hey old man! You got a couple of hungry future ninja heroes here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru kept quiet, a frown on his face, staring at the counter. Teuchi chuckled and said, \"Well I won't be keeping a couple of future heroes waiting! What will you boys have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pass me a bowl of pork miso!\" Naruto said, slapping some money down. \"And today, it's all on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru suddenly looked up with a mischievous grin on his face. \"Okay! Then I'll have a bowl of pork miso too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi nodded and turned to start making the bowls when Konohamaru slammed his hands down on top of the counter, standing up a little (on the chair since he was too short to reach the counter easily while standing on the ground) and shouting, \"And a bowl of beef ramen! And another of chicken! And shrimp tempura! And vegetable! And barbeque!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeuchi looked surprised, turning to Naruto. The orange clad ninja's mouth was hanging open as Konohamaru rattled the names off. \"Uh...y-yeah, okay! Anything you want Konohamaru! It's the least I can do.\" He laughed nervously rubbing the back of his head. He pulled his wallet out and started laying out more bills. Konohamaru snickered and said, \"And after you make all of those and bring them to me, make them all again! And then again! And then one more time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Konohamaru are you crazy?! That's almost twenty bowls of ramen! Don't you think that's...wrong?\" Naruto said, almost pleading a little as he saw his money disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...you're right boss!\" Konohamaru said, smiling sweetly at the older ninja. \"Better make that an even thirty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto started to look a little angry now. \"Listen Konohamaru that's way too much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to say more when Teuchi set down the first two bowls. Konohamaru quickly began to eat, ignoring Naruto, that determined look back on his face. Naruto noticed that Teuchi and his daughter had already made over ten bowls of the stuff, making his complaints completely ineffectual. He sighed, starting to eat his own bowl. It didn't taste nearly as good as it normally did. By the time Naruto was halfway done, Konohamaru was already slurping down the broth, pushing the bowl aside and grabbing the next one. Naruto finished his bowl just as Konohamaru finished his second! Naruto's mouth dropped open again as he saw his little friend stuff his face, practically inhaling the food! \"Is he even chewing?\" Naruto thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Konohamaru ate and ate and ate, the dirty bowls stacking up in groups of five. He paused long enough to let out a massive burp, a small bit of noodle flying out of his mouth, much to Naruto's disgust. He looked down, his eyes widening as he saw Konohamaru's belly poking out from under the hem of his shirt! He watched as with every gulp of soup the kid's stomach seemed to push out bit by bit. Konohamaru winced, his hand absently reaching down and popping the button on his pants, the zipper opening with a metallic whisper, showing off just a bit of his underwear as his belly sagged a bit, showing even more of his belly! Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru slowed down as he hit twenty, groaning a little, his hand cupping around his bulging stomach. Naruto eyed the last ten bowls and grinned, the same mischievous smile that Konohamaru had earlier. \"Come on, what's wrong? You said you wanted to eat thirty right? Guess you really aren't as strong as you say you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire was rekindled in Konohamaru's eyes. He glared at Naruto and said, \"That does it! I'll show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to wolf down the twenty first bowl. Even Naruto was shocked at this new ferocity! One by one, the bowls were all cleaned, leaving not a speck of food behind in its wake! Konohamaru turned to Naruto, opened his mouth wide, and belched as loudly as he could, the force of the wind actually making Naruto's hair rustle! Naruto's eyes went wide again as he stared down Konohamaru's gullet, the uvula bouncing in the wind of the burp. \"HAH!\" Konohamaru shouted, grinning triumphantly at Naruto. \"I showed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you showed me how fat you got!\" Naruto said, poking Konohamaru's hard, food filled belly. The younger ninja looked down at his bulging midsection, his shirt now unable to even cover a portion of his gut! His little briefs were completely on display as well. No matter how hard he tried to do up the zipper, it refused to close even an inch! Konohamaru blushed as Naruto snickered before coming to his final decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Then I'm never gonna stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped laughing and said, \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me! I'm not just some dumb little kid! I'm going to prove how strong I am! I'm going to keep eating and I'm never going to stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Konohamaru, if you do that you're just going to make yourself sick!\" Naruto said, starting to look worried. \"That's not healthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just afraid I'll get bigger and stronger than you!\" Konohamaru scoffed, crossing his arms over his protruding belly. \"You go and do your stupid important mission! I'm going to get more food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru ran off before Naruto could say anything. The older ninja sighed and hefted the box, watching his friend run off. \"I'll have to talk to him after this mission...I didn't mean to hurt his feelings like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly ran off, heading for Aho Tea. While Naruto was doing that, Konohamaru was looking around the village, trying to decide where to go next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So the round bellied little Konohamaru set out to try to find where he would get his next meal. As he was taking a walk around, he noticed a new sweets shop that had opened in town! Konohamaru's mouth had already begun to water at the prospect of devouring delicious cakes and chocolates and who knows what else!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru walked right in through the front door, a big smile on his face! There was a huge display case up front, filled to the brim with cakes, donuts, cupcakes, and all kinds of deliciousness! Konohamaru walked right up to the front with a grin on his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, oh! Honorable grandson! How can I help you today?\" The cashier asked. He chose not to say anything about Konohmaru's large belly. After all, wouldn't want to insult the honorable grandson!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll take... Everything!\" Konohamaru told the man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Everything!?\" He said in shock, \"B-But how do you even plan to afford...\" The man was cut short as Konohamaru held up a little card. It beared the symbol of the Hokage, and was linked to a private account that kept the Hokage's family well-off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just put it all on this!\" Konohamaru replied, \"Now do I have to wait for you to serve me or can I just come back there myself?\" Konohamaru replied. The man was surprised, but more than happy to allow Konohamaru to slip behind the counters! Konohamaru started stuffing his face on whatever he could get his hands on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's hands were filled with cake crumbs and frosting as every bit disappeared down his stomach! His gut was starting to swell and distend as he filled it up! The boy's thighs were pressing painfully against pants as the grew tighter on him! The sleeves of his shirt had grown tight as his fat arms were starting to fill out what little room was left! As Konohamaru started shoveling handfuls of cake into his mouth, his belly had really started to bloat out! What was once more of a basketball had surged out and up into a full beachball size! Konohamaru didn't even realize how fattening this stuff was! As he leaned into the display case, he was able to rest his gut on the counter while he shoveled food into his wanting mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just gonna keep eating and eating and eating!\" Konohamaru thought to himself, \"I'll get bigger than anybody in the village! Then they'll have to know my name! I'll MAKE them respect me if I have to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru continued to greedily fill his gullet with piece after piece of food. And when he finished one display case, he waddled right over to the next! His weight was really starting to show, not only in his belly, but his face as well! He had gained two pudgy, pinchable cheeks, and it looked like he was already starting to get a second chin! But perhaps the most strange thing of all, aside from the almost instantaneous gain of weight, was his height! For some strange reason that no one yet knew, Konohamaru seemed to be getting taller as well! While he was still a short 4'6\" when he entered the building, he must have grown at least half a foot, putting him at a full 5'2\"! Yet still his belly would growl, pushing the ravenous young man to eat more and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru was soon on the last piece of cheesecake that he had found in a chilled display case. Not only was it the last piece, but it was the last little goodie in the entire store! Konohmaru seemed to slow only slightly, biting each piece off, chewing it briefly, and gulping it down! He tossed the tin aside carelessly, and fell onto his ass, causing a bit of a quake in the store!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw yeah... That was good...\" Konohamaru groaned, rubbing his gargantuan belly! His pants had all but shredded to bits, leaving him in the tattered remains of pants that desperately seemed to cling to his waist. His thighs and calves were almost like logs with feet at the end of them! Every inch of them was soft and puffy, almost like a marshmallow! His massive gut laid on his lap, and Konohamaru could barely wrap his arms around his waist! And speaking of his arms, they too had become huge and soft as well! His shirt had become little more than a tattered piece of cloth that wrapped around his shoulders and a small portion of his back! His huge boy breasts were laid atop his gut, completing the entire fat look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru got to his feet and started waddling to the door. \"Thanks for all the food!\" He said happily as he squeezed his fat ass out the door! It was still pretty early in the day, and Konohamaru...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Konohamaru managed to push his way out the door of the sweet shop (the owner quickly locking the door and turning the Open sign to Closed with a happy grin on his face), he saw Naruto across the street, looking around with a worried expression on his face. Konohamaru's face hardened, his happy smile at his sweet feast disappearing. He pulled up the remains of his pants just as Naruto noticed him, quickly rushing over. \"Konohamaru!\" He called out, waving his arm, making sure his young friend saw him. It didn't seem to dawn on him just how much Konohamaru had changed until he was much closer to him. He slowed down, his slightly sad smile turning into an expression of shock. \"W-What happened to you?!\" He said, his mouth dropping open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru smirked and puffed out his chest, his boy boobs shaking slightly as he did so. \"I'm just doing exactly what I said I was going to do! See that sweet shop back there? I just cleaned it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...look at you! You're so...\" Naruto started to say \"fat\" before he caught himself. He WAS trying to apologize after all. \"I-I mean, this can't be...you know...healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?!\" Konohamaru said, frowning, standing his ground, shoving his enormous belly against Naruto, making the older ninja stumble back. \"You're still just afraid I'm going to get bigger and stronger than you! Well guess what? I already am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto glared at his tubby little friend, making a fist. \"Yeah right! Gaining a bunch of weight isn't going to make you stronger than me! It's just going to make you soft and slow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Konohamaru retorted, shoving  his thicker face closer to Naruto's with a grin. \"We'll see about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could react, Konohamaru shoved his body against Naruto's, making him stumble back again, this time losing his footing altogether! He crashed into the dirt, wincing, looking up to see Konohamaru's massive ass coming right down on him! He let out a \"ooph!\" as all that new weight landed on top of his chest, pinning him down easily! Naruto immediately began to struggle, his hands pushing uselessly against Konohamaru's doughy bottom. \"Get off of me!\" He shouted, struggling furiously to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Naruto?\" Konohamaru said with a snicker. \"I thought you said you were stronger than me! I thought gaining a bunch of weight was UNHEALTHY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was starting to sweat, his breath coming out in pants. All that weight pressing down on him was making it hard to breathe. \"Alright! You win! Just let me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...nope!\" Konohamaru said, after thinking for awhile. \"I'm not going to let this little outburst go without some punishment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you talking about?! What are you going to do?\" Naruto asked, staring up at the back of Konohamaru's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ninja turned his head and grinned. \"You're gonna help me out! You're going to follow me to the next restaurant or shop and help me carry the food if I need to, help me EAT the food, and make sure I'm comfortable while I'm eating!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you out of your mind?! I'm not gonna babysit you! I've got important stuff to do!\" Naruto argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you don't help me, I'm not getting up! I don't have anything important to do so I can just sit here all day if I have to!\" Konohamaru said, moving his ass around, pushing Naruto harder into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rrrrgh...FINE! I'll do it! Just LET ME UP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru heaved his mass to his feet, puffing a little as he did so. \"Awesome! Now I'm YOUR boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...let's just...did you get taller?\" Naruto asked, suddenly realizing that Konohamaru was only two inches shorter than he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru measured himself up against Naruto and slowly grinned even wider. \"Yeah! I did! I'm almost as tall as you are! I knew it! It's working!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...why....how?!\" Naruto sputtered. The whole situation was impossible! No one gained weight this fast and grew half a foot taller in one day! Not without some kind of jutsu anyway. \"Is Konohamaru messing around with some kind of forbidden technique?\" Naruto thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?! I'm keeping it up!\" Konohamaru said, patting his big belly with a grin. \"Come on! Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru took off, moving surprisingly fast for his size, Naruto jogging in his wake. His mind was a thousand miles away, still trying to process this insanity. He didn't even notice that Konohamaru was getting some pointed looks, though no one was about to say anything against the honorable grandson. Konohamaru turned the corner and pointed out a restaurant. \"There! Let's go to that one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which one?\" Naruto said, snapping to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru frowned and pointed again, \"There! Pay attention!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at the restaurant and said, \"I haven't seen that place before...what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru shrugged and said, \"I don't know! Let's check it out! Hurry up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gritted his teeth, feeling tempted to pop Konohamaru in the back of his head! \"He got lucky! That's all it was!\" Naruto thought to himself. How else could he have been beaten so easily by Konohamaru? With that somewhat comforting thought, the two boys entered the new restaurant. Just what kind of new place was it?</span></div></div>",

Are you sure you don't want to go somewhere else?\" Naruto asked the young man, trying to bargain with him a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I went here, and this is where I want to go!\" Konohamaru replied stubbornly, walking up to the register at the front!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah, hello... Honorable grandson...\" The man said slowly. It was clear it had come as a shock to him that Konohamaru was a blimp! \"How can I...?\" Before he could ask any further, Konohamaru held up his card, and glared at the man a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Konohamaru. Remember it!\" He told the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right... Konohamaru... So how many will that be?\" The cashier asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One. This guy won't be eating!\" Konohamaru said as he raised Naruto's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! I can't even have one little thing?!\" Naruto whined. This prompted a little hip check from Konohamaru! The card was soon charged and the two boys moved to get a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's chair creaked as the huge boy sat on it. And this was a brand new chair! He crossed his arms as he looked at Naruto, a grumpy look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?\" Naruto asked as he looked at Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go get me my food!\" Konohamaru ordered Naruto, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world! \"What, you expect me to get it myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kind of.\" Naruto replied. Konohamaru puffed out his gut, shoving the table into Naruto's own stomach! \"Ow! Okay, okay!\" Naruto replied, getting back to his feet and walking over to the buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto eyed all kinds of delicious foods as he was there. From teriyaki fried pork to barbequed chicken. Fresh, hot meat buns and large, juicy prawns... Naruto was simply jealous of all this food he couldn't have! He piled on as much as he could onto one place, and brought it back to Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto set the plate on the table, Konohamaru rose an eyebrow. \"That's it?\" He asked his servant. Though displeased, he picked up the plate anyway and started stuffing his face! \"Mmph... G-Go get more!\" He told Naruto, \"And when you come back, you'd better have TWICE as much as this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto rolled his eyes and left Konohamaru to his feasting. As the older teen got his friend more food, Konohamaru was enjoying himself, stuffing his gullet with every little morsel of food on his plate! Each bite served it's grand purpose of making him bigger and fatter! Every little bit that he ate was like pure, delicious jewel meat that filled his cheeks with succulant magic! Konohamaru's mood only brightened as he heard another set of plates being placed down on the table! He rushed to finish his first one just so he could move onto his next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Naruto continued to rush back and forth to bring him food, Konohamaru was growing in size once again! Not only was he getting heavier and wider, but taller as well! In mere minutes, the boy matchd Naruto in size! He was practically a sumo wrestler now, and then some! His gut was swollen and huge, and took up a decent portion of his lap as he sat there! His pants had been shredded to bits, leaving him in little more than his underpants! The elastic was stretched to the max, still able to hide his shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Naruto had brought him his eighth serving, he held up a hand, issuing him to stop. Naruto sat the table, watching Konohamaru engorge himsef, not even noticing the subtle, gradual changes happening to the boy! As Konohamaru slammed his plate down, he glared back down at Naruto. \"How about you get to rubbing his stomach of mine?\" He said, rubbing the side of it himself! \"Get the air outta there so I can fit more food in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned under his breath before moving in closer to Konohamaru. Glancing up at his temporary master for a moment, he put his hands on Konohamaru's soft stomach and started to rub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost like dough... Maybe a little bit more firm, thanks to all the food that was stuffed inside! Konohamaru softly moaned as he felt Naruto's hands trailing across his belly! There was just so much for Naruto to run his hands over! Konohamaru was loving every second of this! Having a slave to feed him, unintentionally making him bigger and heavier, and also to massage his gurguling tummy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alright, Naruto...\" Konohamaru said in a softer tone, \"How about...\"</span></div></div>",

Oh! Sure!\" Naruto said, sounding relieved. \"Finally, we're getting out of here!\" He thought. It wasn't like \"serving\" Konohamaru was hard. Naruto had carried far heavier things than a couple of plates of food and rubbing Konohamaru's gut had been similar to kneading dough for making bread (something that Naruto had had to do as an earlier D ranked mission when he was younger) but the very idea of being forced to do it against his will by his former pipsqueak friend was grating on Naruto's nerve, hurting his pride. He quickly got up and got behind the tubby youngster wrapping his arms around his substantial moobs. With a grunt, he tried to heave Konohamaru up but failed. Konohamaru's wide ass lifted a few inches up off the seat before it crashed back down, making the chair creak and groan even worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you weakling!\" Konohamaru snapped, glaring up at Naruto. \"Put some effort into it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gritted his teeth and squeezed harder, forcing Konohamaru to his feet with a loud grunt of effort. Naruto panted as he hung on to Konohamaru, one hand squeezing Konohamaru's right moob while the other had a handful of Konohamaru's considerable stomach. Konohamaru noticed Naruto still holding on and said, \"Uh...you can let go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Naruto said, suddenly noticing what he was doing. \"Ah!\" He quickly let go, stepping back, blushing a little. Konohamaru smirked and started walking. Naruto followed quietly behind him, feeling embarrassed. He barely registered the fact that Konohamaru was now the same size as him, though much heavier and far wider! He refused to acknowledge that his formerly puny friend was probably stronger than him now, pushing the thought away before it could even properly form. He looked up, about to say something when he noticed something strange. He looked behind him and saw that they were walking AWAY from the doors! \"Hey! Where are you going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru glanced over his shoulder and said, \"Where are you going SIR! Or boss if you prefer. Or maybe master!\" Konohamaru said, chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto snorted and said, \"Yeah right! You wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru shrugged and said, \"Well, maybe you'll be singing a different tune after I'm done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you already were done! Why did you have me lift up your fat ass if you weren't?\" Naruto said irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're too slow, that's why!\" Konohamaru said, frowning at Naruto's insolence. \"I'm practically starving and you're walking two plates to me every few minutes! So I thought, why not just go to the source?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indicated the buffet tables in front of him, every tray full to the brim with delicious, steaming food. Naruto's mouth dropped open slightly as he saw Konohamaru grin. \"You're just going to...EAT everything right from the table?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh! Why else would I have gotten up dummy?\" Konohamaru said, pointing a nearby chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...thought you were done...\" Naruto mumbled, grabbing the chair and bringing it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru laughed loudly, sitting down on the chair heavily, his bulk pinning Naruto's hands down to the seat, forcing him to the ground again, forced to look up at Konohamaru. This pleased him. \"Oh Naruto, you really don't listen. Remember what I said back at Ichiraku? I'm going to eat and I'm going to keep eating and I'm never, EVER, <b>EVER</b> going to stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice took on a dangerous note as he said this. He leaned forward, his belly rumbling ominously, shaking the chair, making Naruto himself quake a little. \"So you'd better get used to looking up at me!\" He grinned and lifted his ass up slightly, letting Naruto go free. \"Now get into the kitchen and start bringing out everything they have in there! Tell them the future Hokage demands it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned away from Naruto after saying this, driving his fat hands into a tray of fried rice, stuffing his face with it, his already chubby cheeks bulging as his chins wobbled as he chewed. His determination was back, his hands moving with a single minded speed. Before Naruto could even take a step towards the kitchen Konohamaru had finished the tray, tossing it at Naruto's feet. \"GET A MOVE ON!\" He shouted, making Naruto jump. He quickly ran into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everyone! Listen up! Konohamaru is out there and he wants food! All of it! So get a move on! Cook up everything you got and send it out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various chefs looked at each other in surprise. Naruto had the reputation of a prankster so it was hard to take him seriously, especially when he said something outlandish like that. They turned back to what they were doing, deciding to ignore Naruto. \"Hey!\" The orange clad ninja shouted, looking annoyed. \"Listen to me! He's going to be pissed if you don't do what I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing he said convinced them. Getting frustrated, Naruto ran back out into the restaurant proper. The buffet tables had been half decimated, Konohamaru sitting, rather uncomfortably, on a chair that was sagging dramatically, the legs almost bowed completely out. His swollen belly was pressed tightly against the table, every bit making it swell out another inch, pushing the table slowly away from Konohamaru. His thick, fat arms moved determinedly, shoveling more meat, vegetables, soup, salads and desserts into his ravenous maw, never stopping for an instant! His wiggling belly hung low between his fat legs, looking more like sausages at this point, his fat feet spreading slowly across the floor. Konohamaru was like a machine, the material of his underwear long gone, leaving his ass bare, his shame covered only by the thickness of his belly, his moobs resting comfortably on top of the gut. Naruto's mouth dropped open as he gazed upon this gluttonous youngster still stuffing his face. He gulped a little as he walked up to him. \"K-Konohamaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hunger filled eyes turned on Naruto, his mouth stuffed full of chicken. He quickly swallowed and said, \"Yeah? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The chefs aren't cooperating!\" Naruto explained. \"They don't believe me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well maybe it's time I taught them a lesson!\" He grinned down at Naruto, pointing at his belly. \"First, let me finish all this food! You get to rubbing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, not wanting to argue with the bloated boy. He rubbed furiously, noting just how much more flesh there was to cover now. Konohamaru was truly something else. Every bite he ate not only urged him on to grow fatter, taller, and stronger, but also seemed to stimulate his appetite. No matter how much he ate, he was never satisfied. Soon, not even a crumb was left on the tables, the chair finally giving up, sending his bulk crashing to the floor, making the whole restaurant shake! Naruto lost his footing, his whole body stretched out on top of Konohamaru's belly, his face planted firmly between the boy's moobs. He blushed and scrambled off, Konohamaru getting slowly to his feet with a grunt. \"Now let's see what those chefs have to say for themselves!\" He said, his voice sounding slightly deeper and more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked straight ahead at Konohamaru, his eyes widening as he realized he was staring at Konohamaru's...</span></div></div>",

He glanced back at Naruto that wicked smile and told the smaller blond boy, \"Stay here, got it?\" Konohamaru began, \"Don't come in here for ANYTHING! Got it!?\" Konohamaru said loud and hard, making sure Naruto understood his point! Naruto just nodded a little, and backed away from Konohamaru a bit. It was just a brief moment before his big, fat ass disappeared behind the swinging doors...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru entered the kitchen, which was nice and hot. It didn't take long for the chefs to notice the gargantuan boy in the kitchen with a huge, bulging gut! Konohamaru could already hear whispers going around the kitchen with his name on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the honorable grandson doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, you see the size of him!? What's he been eating!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Naruto wasn't lying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru smiled, and beckoned for a few of the chefs to follow him. A few of them did as they were told, whereas a few others were too busy with their work to follow the boy. Konohamaru led them off into the pantry, where things were more secluded and quiet. Konohamaru had a grin on his face as he got three men into the pantry. Once they were inside, he closed the shutter doors behind him, forcing them inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...  Why did you bring us here?\" One chef asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru just chuckled before saying, \"I heard you guys didn't listen to Naruto! You shoulda listened.\" Konohamaru replied simply. The chefs just looked at each other in confusion, before one of them was suddenly grabbed up by the ravenous boy before having his head shoved into the kid's mouth! The two chefs just stared in horror, watching as Konohamaru swallowed him up whole, the man filling the boys mouth and making a giant lump in his throat as he slithered down his throat. One of the two remaining felt ill, while the other was still in shock! Konohamaru grabbed another man, forcing him into his mouth, gulping and swallowing fast, forcing the man down his gullet so fast that it almost hurt a little!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man went down, Konohamaru chuckled, patting his gut a little as he let the man settle in. He let out a monstrous burp that shook the entire room, rumbling the containers. Konohamaru looked down at the last chef that had foolishly followed him! He grabbed the man up, his gut growling in hunger and protest, begging for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was busy outside of the kitchen doors, doing some push ups as he waited. After all, if he was going to be forced to serve Konohamaru, he might as well get into better shape! Naruto wouldn't even be able to Konohamaru if he didn't start packing on the muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Naruto could hear a crash in the kitchen! He hopped right to his feet, ready to charge in before he remembered what Konohamaru had told him! He hesitated a little, pulling his arm away from the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust inside the doors, Konohamaru had started grabbing the men up and shoving them into his mouth! The once small kid was growing into a gigantic titan who only got bigger with every man that entered his gut! His belly was huge, round, and fat! Filled to the brim, hands pushing out at some ends! It only served to please Konohamaru as he kept grabbing men up! One man was trying to hit Konohamaru in the stomach with an iron skillet! It didn't even work, and bounced right off the kid's immense bulk and right back at him! He served as Konohamaru's next victim. With every person, man or woman, shoved into his mouth, his stomach seemed to bulge out even further, his arms and legs bigger, his chest softer, and his body taller!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped a little as he looked at the doors. He suddenly jumped back when a man came running out, only to trip! Naruto fell backwards on his ass, and could only see as the man was grasping at the floor, being dragged in my some force! Naruto would have grabbed his hand to help him, but he vanished behind the doors, which swung slightly as they closed. Naruto could only stare wide-eyed, not quite sure what to make of what he'd just seen!</span></div></div>",

Don't come in for any reason whatsoever! Before, when Konohamaru had just been about his height and fatter than him Naruto had treated the whole thing as a kind of unfortunate circumstance, annoying, but nothing more. Now that Konohamaru was nearly twice his height Naruto actually felt intimidated! There was no telling what Konohamaru was capable of, especially with his grumpy attitude. It didn't help that Naruto had been the one to annoy him enough that this situation even came about in the first place! So he stepped back, trying to ignore the sound of screams and clattering as whatever happened in the kitchen happened. The other patrons in the restaurant had slowly filtered out, not wanting to get involved with this situation any more than they already were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like hours but was really only about ten minutes, all noise coming from the kitchen suddenly ceased. Naruto slowly walked towards the doors before a building shaking burp suddenly rocketed out from the kitchen, blowing the doors open, a wave of air blowing over Naruto, pushing him back slightly. His eyes widened as he looked towards the kitchen, the doors closing again before he could get a good look. \"W-What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! The floor shook violently, nearly knocking Naruto down again! The doors to the kitchen vibrated slightly, another BOOM shaking the whole area once more. Naruto gulped, watching the door, his eyes fixed on it. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The shaking grew more violent as whatever was in the kitchen moved closer to the door. \"Is that...Konohamaru?\" Naruto thought, slowly backing away from it. Suddenly, the doors burst open, a gigantic fat gut bursting through the doors, knocking them clear off their hinges! Naruto's jaw dropped open as he saw this massive globe of fat before him, filling the doorway completely! Naruto heard a loud grunting sound, the belly jiggling slightly, barely moving where it was wedged into place. A loud chuckle was then heard followed by a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess I'm just way too big for this place! Hey Naruto!\" It WAS Konohamaru! Naruto quickly rushed up to his friend's enormous stomach and shouted out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Konohamaru! I'm here! What do you need?\" He asked, trying to see around the belly but it was impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got myself stuck in here! Give me a push!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay! I'll try!\" Naruto said, looking at the mound of fat before him. He shrugged and just ran forward, pushing against the giant globe, his whole body sinking into the soft skin slightly, barely making any difference as he pushed. On the other side, Konohamaru was pulling, both boys working together to free his huge body. Finally, with a metallic wrenching sound, Konohamaru freed himself, falling back onto his ass, Naruto landing on top of his huge belly. \"Ooogh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go!\" Konohamaru said with a grin, looking down at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto slowly looked up into Konohamaru's face, his eyes taking in those cute chubby cheeks, and confident eyes before trailing down the rest of his bloated blubbery body. His moobs rested softly on top of his bulging gut, each one looking bigger than Naruto himself! His fat arms were draped over the various tables and counters int he kitchen, his massive ass wedged between the rows as well, his enormous bare feet planted on either side of the door! Naruto could feel his body rising and falling slowly as Konohamaru breathed, the gelatinous mass of his belly warm and doughy. He could feel himself sinking in slightly! His once shorter friend's head was now almost to the ceiling! \"K-K-Konohamaru!\" Naruto stuttered, completely overwhelmed by this unthinkable transformation. \"Y-You're....you're...you're....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just getting started!\" Konohamaru finished, his grin widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped, looking around the kitchen. \"W-Where did the chefs go?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru merely burped loudly again, shrugging. \"Who knows? Those idiots didn't believe you anyway! They must have run off while I was clearing this place out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wasn't sure if he believed that, but getting on Konohamaru's bad side would be a very, VERY bad idea now. He moved around slightly, massaging Konohamaru's gut without intending to, eliciting a little groan of pleasure from his younger friend. \"As good as that feels, now's not the time for it little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stopped and said, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I need to get out here! And get back to eating!\" Konohamaru said as though it was the most obvious thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Back to eating?! Are you crazy?! You're already HUGE!\" Naruto said, shocked by the blimp like boy's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? I can be even bigger! I WANT to be even bigger! I want to be SO BIG that no one can forget my name! So big that no one can stand up to me!\" Konohamaru said, his voice getting louder in his passion. \"And if you're not going to help me, you're just going to get in my way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glared down at Naruto, striking fear into the orange clad ninja's heart. He slowly slipped down Konohamaru's belly and said, \"What do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru smirked again and said, \"Easy! I want you to...\"</span></div></div>",

He shooke his head a little as he looked up at Konohamaru!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Did you say...?\" Naruto replied, gulping a little. Konohamaru just knocked the puny blonde ninja on his head, almost knocking him out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you dumb!? Look at that door! Do you really think I'm gonna fit out of that!?\" Konohamaru replied, \"What other choice do I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was about to open his mouth when he realized it probably wouldn't have been a good idea... He started rushing back to the buffet tables, brining Konohamaru entire trays full of a single food! Konohamaru would do little more than sit there and tilt them upside down into his gaping maw! All of it was delicious, and all the running was good for Naruto's cardio!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment, but Naruto was slowly starting to realize how each trip back to Konohamaru was gradually growing shorter and shorter... And speaking of growing, Konohamaru's head wasn't touching the ceiling while the boy was sitting, last time Naruto knew...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmph, keep feeding me!\" Konohamaru ordered, his large hand rubbing in circles on the side of his huge belly! \"This stuff is so good...\" He bellowed as Naruto handed him another container, \"Keep it coming! I'm not stopping until I bust outta this place!\" Konohamaru started shoveling another tray down his gullet, his gigantic, fat body ever-growing and massive! His feet were stretching further along the floor, his stomach so filled that it laid on the cool tile floor and kept stretching along! Konohamaru would only stop to let out a loud belch! Naruto had to cover his ears when the boy did this, and as soon as he uncovered them, the next sound he heard was always the gurgling of his master's bulging gut!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooooore...\" Konohamaru moaned, \"MOOOOOORE!\" He demanded, slapping his gut as if a warning to Naruto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!\" Naruto shouted! Putting his hands together, he called out, \"Shadow clone jutsu!\" In an instant, ten more clones of Naruto appeared, each of them scrambling to gather food for Konohamaru!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big, fat boy was taking up more and more room! Soon the ceilind had broke, and Konohamaru had to lay down to be fed! He loved doing this even more since it meant he didn't have to lift a finger! Naruto after Naruto would come, dump food into the boy's mouth, which only made him bigger and hungrier! Konohamaru's belly was pushing through the ceiling, his arms easily able to reach either side of the walls! He as another Naruto came by to feed him, he suddenly grinned! \"I'm ready!\" He said wish a mischevious smile! The Naruto's just looked at each other, confused as ever, before they suddenly got their answer! Konohamaru started pushing at the walls of the resturant, his hands crashing through them like they were cardboard! He took a deep breath, puffing his gut out and arching his back! From the outside, it looked as if a small, pinkis moon had suddenly appeared in the building! Konohamaru became more violent, twisting and turning around, making the building crack and break all over! He glanced briefly at Naruto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get outta here while you can!\" He warned, before suddenly really starting to move! Naruto's clones all vanished as he then made a mad dash for the exit!  The building was coming down all around him, and he just managed to dive out of the door before the inside came crashing down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked back, only to see Konohamaru rising up and getting to his feet as he let out a loud (but admittedly cute), \"ROAAAAAR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru stood for but a moment, before crashing back down on the debris of the resturant! His large ass cushioned anything that could have been painful to sit on, while his massive gut laid comfortably on his lap! Naruto gazed up in amazement at the boy who must have been at least twenty five feet tall! A belly twice the size of a wrecking ball and a pair of flabby, soft moobs on top of it! Naruto's lips quivered slightly as he gazed in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru, in turn, was gazing back down at Naruto with a grin on his face. He slapped in stomach, feeling triumphant and powerful! It was a brief moment, before Konohamaru said...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto was so in awe of Konohamaru's towering flab that he didn't quite register what he was asking. \"H-Huh? What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's expression darkened as he looked down at Naruto, his hand rising up. He slammed it down next to Naruto, easily knocking the fox boy off his feet. \"LISTEN UP NARUTO!\" Konohamaru's voice bellowed, heard from miles around. \"I'M THE ONE IN CHARGE NOW! AND I'M ONLY GOING TO GIVE MY ORDERS ONCE! IF YOU DISOBEY, IF YOU REFUSE, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO END UP ANOTHER MORSEL FOR MY BELLY! GOT IT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto covered his ears, his knees shaking slightly. There was some kind of force in Konohamaru's voice, some kind of power that compelled him to listen and obey and fear him! \"Y-Yes...Master!\" He quickly said, hoping the title would please him. Judging by the arrogant smirk, it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now just this once I'll repeat myself so listen up!\" Konohamaru said, lifting his finger up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto quickly moved in closer, looking up at him intently. It was hard to see his face decently from this angle. He looked up and had to get past Konohamaru's mountainous belly and bulging moobs before he could even get a hint of the chubby face behind it. \"How does that shadow clone thing work?\" He asked again, a devious smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Shadow Clone Jutsu?\" Naruto said, smiling slightly. \"That's an easy one! It's my best move! All you have to do is a regular clone but use a bunch more chakra so that it lasts longer! The more chakra you have and use, the harder it is for one to get dismissed forcibly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's devious smile grew wider as he heard this. \"Is that all? Awesome!\" He closed his eyes and started reaching into his chakra pool. He was a bit surprised to notice that it was much larger than normal! \"Guess all those useless chefs were good for something after all!\" Konohamaru thought with a wicked snicker. He opened one eye and looked down at Naruto. \"What are the hand signs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto held the index and middle finger on both his hands up and brought the right pair horizontally behind the left pair, making a plus sign. \"Just do that! And make sure you're concentrating more of your chakra than normal!\" Naruto was so eager to teach (it was starting to feel just like his old lessons with Konohamaru) he didn't realize what he was unleashing until it was too late. Konohamaru brought his fingers together and bellowed, \"Shadow Clone Jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Konohamaru had first broken out of the restaurant, all the citizens in the vicinity had immediately panicked, running in all directions. Those that recognized Konohamaru still fled in fear, his body so radically changed they couldn't process it. It had left the entire area where Naruto and Konohamaru were empty. That left only Naruto to witness the amazing event that followed. In a puff of smoke large enough cover the entire district in a fog, the ground quake impressively as three enormous BOOMS! shook the area, knocking Naruto back down on his ass. He coughed, waving his hand slightly, trying to see what had happened. When the smoke finally cleared he was staring up at the twenty five foot Konohamaru who was looking to the left and right with a satisfied grin. Slowly, Naruto turned his head the same way. To the left and right of the original Konohamaru were two equally fat, equally titanic clones, both of them laughing and rubbing their massive guts. \"This is awesome!\" One shouted, pumping his fist as he got to his feet, not noticing that his appearance had reduced an apartment complex to kindling under his colossal ass. \"Urgh, man I'm so hungry!\" The second clone said, also getting to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Let's just eat this guy!\" A third voice said from behind Naruto. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the fox teen could turn around he felt a vice like grip clamp over his entire body, lifting him up into the air. Naruto struggled but the fat fingers of a third clone, thick as trees and twice as strong, were impossible to fight against! He stared up in horror as the clone licked his lips, opening his mouth wide, hot air gushing out of the cavern, ruffling Naruto's hair! \"NOOOOOOOO! Don't eat me!\" Naruto shouted frantically as he was brought closer and closer to the gaping maw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third clone suddenly let out an \"Ooomph!\" noise as Konohamaru punched him hard in the gut, the mouth snapping closed, his grip loosening enough that Naruto fell into Konohamaru's hand. \"You should know better! He's not food! He's a servant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt a mixture of relief, gratitude, and annoyance, though at least his bruised body wasn't being battered anymore. Not to mention Konohamaru's plump hand was really soft and warm...Before he could get too comfortable, Konohamaru dropped him back down onto the ground. \"Listen up Konohamaru's!\" The original shouted, getting his clones attention. \"This whole village is about to learn who's really in charge! I want every scrap of food to be found and eaten! By the time we're done I want to tower over this village like a god! No ninja should be taller than my pinky toe if even that! My shadow should cover the whole village and then some! I want to be able to see every inch of it no matter where I stand! I want all retaliations to be nothing more than pin pricks against my belly! And I want it all NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three clones cheered, each one lumbering off in a different direction to fulfill Konohamaru's grand design. Naruto could feel his heart hammering in his chest. What had he done? He had just handed Konohamaru the king to devouring the village! If he wasn't already unstoppable now he was going to be very soon! Before he could think more on it, he felt a poke on his back. He looked behind him, seeing Konohamaru's plump toe poking him. \"Y-Yes sir?\" He said, looking up at Konohamaru's cute fat face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Naruto! I'm not going to let you get hurt....unless you deserve punishment of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru chuckled as he walked off, the ground quaking with his every step, his ass cheeks jiggling as Naruto watched him walk away. \"W-Wait! What do you want me to do?\" He asked, not wanting to accidentally do anything that would be punishable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru stopped and thought about it. \"Hmm...Oh! I've got it!\"</span></div></div>",

Enjoy the show!\" Konohamaru instructed, \"I don't want you around when this goes down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, feeling just a bit of relieft. Not needing to be told twice, Naruto bolted for the village gates, to get as far from here as he possibly could! Konohamaru smiled and turned back to the village. Then, like his clones, started causing terror, uprooting the village for all it had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne clone happened upon the market district! Immediately, he started tearing the roofs off of buildings, and raiding them for all the food they had! Food came first, and if it came down to it, people would do too! Entire shelves would disappear down his throat, the gigantic young man not even caring to unpackage anything! Each store left his belly a little bit bigger, making it harder to reach into places with every place he devoured! Nowhere was safe! Konohamaru even plucked up little peddler carts, crushing them up in his teeth like little treats! This Konohamaru soon took a seat between two competing stores. His gargantuan fat ass slammed into the ground, making a crater! He started reaching into either store with both of his hands, and carelessly shoveling whatever he could grab into his mouth! Everything making him all the more bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother clone was off in the food district, having the time of his life! He woould bend down on all fours, much like an animal, and started digging in to resturants like they were a dog bowl of food! Of course, his gut touched the earth, making it a little harder for his hands and legs to touch the ground! This only became more problematic as he kept eating, his gut swelling up bigger and bigger with every bite! He would just crawl right over to the next building and start ravenously detroying that one as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third clone had made his way into the residential district! People were already fleeing at the sight of him, so he had to act fast! He chased people down, their efforts futil in comparison to that of the bloated, starving giant! Konohamaru-clone would grab them by the handfull, like candy, and toss them into his mouth! He stopped for nothing and would even throw his weight into the earth to make the ground quake! The people would fall to their feet, disoriented and unable to move, only to be snatched up by their ravenous god and tossed into his cavernous gullet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the original Konohamaru, however, he had tossed all his cares aside! The pain of hungry from having to create clones was so greath that he had began uprooting the very buildings of the villages and tossing them into his mouth! He couldn't stop! He wouldn't! Anything he got his hands on soon ended up in his mouth and down his throat! Out of all his clones, he was getting the to be the biggest! His body was shooting up like bamboo, height passing seventy five feet, eighty, a hundred! His bulging belly was so firm and round, taking up more and more space! His arms and legs were like overstuffed sausages, and his chest so overstuffed with fat! The only few things that got past him were a certain lucky few refugees that managed to get caught in his belly button!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was far off by now, watching from a cliff. Each of the Konohamaru's had become apparant, all of them growing and filling those black holes they called stomachs! He sighed a little, rubbing the back of his head. He had no idea what would come of this, or what his new master would want of him!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For Naruto, it was like watching various mounds of dough slowly rising up out of a pan, like rolls baking in an oven. Each Konohamaru, one per section of the village, was slowly rising into view, hands full of buildings, food, people, street, anything and everything they could get their greedy hands on, bellies swaying as they stretched higher into the sky, taking out lesser buildings, their fat feet shifting slightly, shaking the whole area enormously, causing even more structural damage. Naruto gulped slightly as he watched this. In the back of his mind, he felt completely responsible for this. He had started this whole fiasco after all! Taunting Konohamaru, feeding him without question, teaching him the Shadow Clone jutsu...no matter how you looked at it, Konohamaru had gained a fierce ambition and Naruto had done nothing except fan the fires of that ambition, bringing them both to this moment! A series of thunderous burps echoed from the village, a warm breeze smelling of food wafting over Naruto. He knees shook slightly as he took a deep breath of the scent, a tinge of breath behind it all. This was getting to be too much!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though responding to Naruto's issues, the three clones suddenly POOFed out of existence, the sudden disappearance of the tubby titans enough to shroud the whole village in smoke. Naruto ran to the edge of the cliff, shading his eyes as he tried to see through the dense fog. Suddenly, he saw a series of brown spikes rise out of the smoke, followed Konohamaru's grinning face, his cheeks wide and fat, still looking completely adorable even as it outgrew the Hokage Faces themselves, his ample moobs ballooning further out, resting on top of a belly that looked like it could fit the entire Hokage's mansion within it, his boyhood guarded by the massive orb, his fat thighs rising up after that, his hands on his hips as he grinned down at the dwindling village. Naruto could hear Konohamaru's laughter, quiet at first, getting louder and louder as more and more of the once runty boy came shooting into view, his shadow extending across the village, the remaining villagers fleeing from his encroaching toes, the fat digits demolishing any building foolish to stand in their way! More and more and more, Konohamaru continued to expand, his enormous gut gurgling and growling the food of three extra giants filled his belly, all the accumulated chakra deepening his pool, making him even more powerful. Every step violently shook the village, even as Konohamaru merely spread his legs to gain more room, his friends, teachers, and former superiors all shrinking away into miniscule bugs as he towered over the village like a god!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's mouth dropped open as he saw Konohamaru's gigantic form appear in all its glory. If he thought he had been fat before, Naruto hadn't seen anything yet! Konohamaru's belly loomed over the village like a moon, his wide ass providing a view from behind that was just as glorious as the one in front. Everything about Konohamaru's form had been amplified hundreds of times over, the buildings of the village barely reaching his ankles. It was like the model cities that Konohamaru had played with as a child, pretending to be a giant as he kicked them down and stepped on them, loving the feeling of distorting plastic beneath his soles. Now, however, he viewed that destruction as a waste. Now there was only one purpose for the village, its structures, and its inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low growling sound filled the air, Konohamaru slapping his wide belly with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GUESS WHO'S STILL HUNGRY?\" His voice bellowed for miles around, his god like hand reaching down to scoop up a nearby cluster of buildings. He brought the handful up to his face and licked his lips. He could just barely make out the sound of pleading voices before he said, \"SORRY, BUT YOU GUYS ARE JUST WAY TOO PUNY FOR ME NOW! BUT AT LEAST I STILL HAVE A USE FOR YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed cruelly, tilting his head back, his thick tongue rolling out of his mouth like a red carpet, the modelesque buildings landing in pools of saliva as Konohamaru emptied his hand, the tongue quickly drawing back into his cavernous maw, swallowing the clump whole. \"MMMMM~ OH YEAH, I'M GOING TO ENJOY EATING THE REST OF THIS PLACE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was able to hear Konohamaru's every proclamation, helpless, watching his as his former home slowly disappeared into the greedy gut of his once little friend. His words sent a chill down the older ninja's spine. If Konohamaru saw the villagers as bugs useful only as food, then what did that make Naruto himself? Just another bit of fuel for the fire? Once Konohamaru finished with the village would he find Naruto and eat him just as easily? With all his power could he even provide a challenge to Konohamaru? And in the very back of his mind Naruto still had to wonder: why? What had caused this incredible transformation in the first place? It was all too perplexing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, completely unaware to Naruto and Konohamaru, a small group of refugees had managed to escape the wrath of Konohamaru. When Konohamaru had lifted the latest cluster of buildings to his mouth, he didn't even register that Naruto's classmate and friend, Kiba, had been amongst the trapped. Thinking fast, the dog ninja had managed to slip out between Konohamaru's fingers, free falling right on top of Konohamaru's considerable belly. Bouncing slightly, he slid down the slope, heading for the ground, only to end up tumbling inside of Konohamaru's navel, landing hard on his back. \"Ooof! Not the most graceful landing...\" He thought, groaning a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey look! It's Kiba!\" A familiar voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba sat up and looked behind him, noticing two other men resting in this natural cave, saved from becoming a meal to the titanic youngster. \"Choji? Shikamaru? Is that you?\" He said, slowly moving closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's us.\" A bored sounding voice admitted, the figure of Shikamaru crouching on the ground, hands in a thinking posture. \"Guess you managed to escape too, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but barely. When did you guys get here?\" Kiba asked, standing next to Choji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shikamaru and I had been on a mission.\" Choji explained, \"When we got back, there was that huge kid rampaging around! We were about to try and subdue him when he suddenly grabbed the entire area we were in, ground and all, and tried to eat us! Shikamaru managed to get us home free by using shadow stitching to make sure we didn't fall to our deaths after we jumped out of the hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we still ended up trapped in here.\" Shikamaru said, sighing as he got to his feet, hands in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane! What the hell is going on here?!\" Kiba shouted, asking the question more to the ether than to either of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever is going on, it's not going to be pretty.\" Shikamaru said, looking out of the navel with concern clear on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUURP!\" Konohamaru let one loose, his mouth wide open, his tongue hanging out, reveling in how he could be as rude as he wanted with no one to tell him what to do! \"AAAAAGH, MAN THE VILLAGE TASTES GOOD!\" He said with a chuckle, rubbing his churning gut. \"I WAS GOING TO LEAVE SOME OF IT BEHIND FOR LATER BUT I'M NOT THE KIND OF GUY WHO LEAVES FOOD ON HIS PLATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a few steps back before driving his hands deep into the ground, the few remaining villagers looking on in horror as the pillar like fingers erupted all around the village, the ground shaking uncontrollably as Konohamaru slowly lifted the remains of the village into the air, drool slowly dripping from between his lips as he looked down at it, reflecting slightly on the fact that he was holding his former home, in its entirety, in a SINGLE hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BET YOU ALL WISH YOU WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED MY NAME NOW, HUH?\" Konohamaru asked, grinning from ear to ear. \"WELL NOW YOU CAN REMEMBER THIS: YOU WERE A SMALL STEP ON THE ROAD TO MAKING KONOHAMARU THE NEXT GOD OF THE SHINOBI WORLD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, he opened his mouth wide, setting the village delicately on his tongue, a single gulp sending the once proud village on a careening course down his esophagus, landing with an almost unnoticeable plop into his gastric juices. Konohamaru sighed happily and wiped his mouth. \"ALRIGHT...NOW TO FIND NARUTO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto watched as Konohamaru slowly moved toward his location. It was like watching an ambulatory mountain. Every step made the ground shake violently, trees crushed flat under Konohamaru's soft soles, his toes ripping into the ground easier than any bulldozer. His arms swung slightly as he walked, even these simple movements kicking up a maelstrom. Konohamaru had become a force greater than anything the ninja world had ever known, more powerful and destructive than even the ten tailed beasts! Naruto was brought to his knees as his former student loomed over him, his belly button level with the cliff he was standing on, easily able to engulf it if Konohamaru so much as took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL?\" He asked thunderously, arms crossed over his flabby chest. \"WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY NOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped and looked straight ahead, opening his mouth to say</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Konohamaru heard Naruto's pleas. They were like music to his ears. Hearing the voice that was calling him a runt and a kid now begging to be spared from an eternity in his massive, swollen gut. Konohamaru got an idea, just in case Naruto planned anything suspicious. Slowly, he started reaching down and picked Naruto up right in his doughy fist! The little blonde ninja was slowly brought up to his face, were he was met with Konohamaru. His face had lost it's former shape and was now like one big face in a mountain of fat! His cheeks were so chubby that they wiggled at least a second more after he would stop talking. His neck was like a frog's when it took in a breath, swelling it out. It was hard to tell where his jawline ended and his face began!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M GONNA REMIND YOU...\" Konohamaru's husky, booming voice blasted, \"JUST WHO THE REAL MAN AROUND HERE IS!\" Konohamaru opened up his cavernous mouth, bringing his hand ever closer to it with Naruto clasped inside!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no! Konohamaru stop! Aren't we--\" Naruto tried to protest, but was cut off as Konohamaru's wide hand stuck inside his mouth, and let his tongue casually slide Naruto out from between his fingers! \"Friends.\" Naruto grumbled, falling flat on Konohamaru's wide tongue. It must have been as huge as several buildings in here! Naruto gasped, barely able to get to his feet! Things were already starting to heat up inside Konohamaru's mouth as his steaming hot breath poured in from the back of his throat! Naruto could only recall a feeling like this once in his life: when he was gobbled up by that giant snake in the Forest of Death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft, yeah, real heroic.\" Kiba sputtered as Naruto was suddenly grabbed up by Konohamaru! \"G-Geez! That kid isn't having mercy on anyone!\" He then barked, watching as Naruto vanished from sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba, focus!\" Shikamaru demanded, grabbing his friend's shoulder. \"We have to plan out a counter attack. I think it's pretty obvious that any attacks on this titan are useless. Shuriken and kunai are just going to bounce off of his fat, and any explosions at this size are just going to tickle him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Right!\" Kiba agreed, getting his head into the game. He was almost instantly broken out of it when he heard some loud moaning nearby. It was Choji, who was curled up in the corner and making quite a fuss over something. \"Hey, Shikamaru, what's wrong with Choji over there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Choji! Hey! I need you to weigh in on this too!\" Shikamaru requested, glancing over at his friend, \"Get over here with the rest of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Shikamaru, you pulled me away from breakfast...! I haven't eaten in a whole twelve hours!\" Choji groaned, holding his stomach, \"How do you expect me to think or even fight without any food...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned. When they were on missions, this was always the bane of their objectives. Choji practically had to be stuffed before he was taken out to battle! Otherwise his growling stomach would give away their position, and if he brought something along, his noisy chewing would produce the same effect! \"Choji, if I didn't come for you when you did, you'd be IN this huge kid right now.\" Choji just moaned again. He couldn't remember a time he was this hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmn... I swear, when this is over, I'm just gonna keep eating and eating and EATING until I burst!\" Choji whined, crawling on all fours over to the others. He laid there on his stomach, glancing up at them as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be playing a key part in this mission, Choji.\" Shikamaru told his friend with a little smile, ruffling his messy, chestnut hair. \"Me and Kiba can't grow to a huge size like you can. You're probably the only on here that can put a stop to all this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah...\" Choji replied passively, his stomach letting out another huge groan. Little did he know, it was such a desire that got Konohamaru where he is now! If he didn't keep his appetite under control... Konohamaru might be the least of their worries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto fell and slid around Konohamaru's mouth as the gargantuan kid tossed him around on his tongue! He would press Naruto up against the roof of his mouth, just to feel the tiny ninja squirm around and try to fight back! Konohamaru gave a short laugh before sloshing Naruto around and putting him UNDER his tongue instead! Soon, just as he'd hoped, Naruto tried standing and lifting Konohamaru's tongue up and off his body, but it was all for naught! Konohamaru took great joy in forcing his tongue right back down, slamming Naruto into the soft, sensitive flesh below!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust below his massive belly, Konohamaru could feel a tingling sensation he'd never experienced before! It kept sending little jolts of pleasure throughout his body, and messing with Naruto the way he was only made the feeling more intense! The inexplicable feeling of dominating another man with such ease! Konohamaru didn't even have to lift a finger for Naruto to be put in a tough spot! Getting this huge was the best thing that had ever happened to him! The young man's head started to bead with sweat as the pleasure increased!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Why not get even HUGER?!\" He though, getting a cocky smirk on his face. Glancing down at what remained of Konoha, he shrugged it off like it was nothing before deciding to move onto a new food source! There were tons of villages and towns dotted throughout the Land of Fire, and as far as he was concerned, they all belonged to HIM! After all, he WAS the honorable grandson! It was only fit that he inherit the land to do with as he pleased!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru continued to play with Naruto, before he reached into his mouth and plucked him out! Naruto was a mess, panting as his sweat mixed with Konohamaru's saliva. The kid grinned down at Naruto, who was now shirtless! The massive boy thought he tasted something come off of Naruto! Because the moment it did, there was a whole new spectrum of flavor that filled his mouth! Indescribable, yet incredibly addictive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto wheezed a little as he gazed up at Konohamaru, who ran his tongue over those plump lips of his, getting them wet just like it did Naruto! Before Naruto could plead once more, Konohamaru had decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Naruto stared up into Konohamaru's fat face, his body sweating slightly as he was sitting on top of the vast expanse of Konohamaru's palm, his body practically nothing more than an insignificant speck to the incredible titan. His mouth slowly opened, a plea already on his lips when Konohamaru suddenly shifted his hand, the plump fingers curling around Naruto like a series of snakes, trapping him in darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'VE MADE A DECISION BUG!\" Konohamaru said loudly, slowly winding his fist up, scanning the horizon. \"I DECIDED I'M GONNA SPARE YOU! BUT ONLY IF YOU CAN PROVE YOU'RE TOUGH ENOUGH TO HANG WITH ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was starting to get dizzy as his tiny body was tossed about like a penny in a dryer, his shirtless torso starting to bruise slightly in places. His heart was hammering in his chest. What did Konohamaru mean exactly by proving himself? What sort of task would he have him perform now? He soon received his answer as Konohamaru thunderously announced, \"IF YOU CAN SURVIVE THIS AND FIND YOUR WAY BACK TO ME AND GET MY ATTENTION WITHOUT ME CRUSHING YOU LIKE A BUG OR EATING YOU LIKE A GRAIN OF RICE THAN YOU'LL HAVE THE HONOR OF SERVING ME AS I CLAIM THIS WORLD AS MY OWN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, at the top of the spin, Konohamaru released Naruto, sending the tiny ninja flying through the air! \"GOOD LUCK RUNT!\" was the last thing Naruto heard before the wind whipped away any sound outside of the whirling maelstrom, his body turning head over heels as he was launched far into the distance! He managed to get a glimpse of a series of rivers before the lush forest scenery was replaced by a vast desert of sand, stretching seemingly endlessly in all directions. Naruto showed no signs of slowing down, his body hurtling towards the borders of the Land of Wind, his stomach clenching, making him feel as though hew as about to throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when he was at his limits, he felt something soft wrap around his body, slowing down his momentum, bringing him closer to the ground without reducing him to a bloody stain on the ground. With a slightly rough thump, he landed on his back on the sand, his heart hammering in his chest, his mouth completely dry, and his head spinning like he had just gotten off a carnival ride. He had no breath to speak. It was all he could do to give out a little squeak of joy as he saw a familiar, stoic face lean over his own, complete with black ringed eyes that made him look as tired as Naruto felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto Uzumaki...\" Gaara said softly, a hint of a quizzical tone in his voice as he stared into Naruto's blue eyes. \"Why were you flying through the air like that, out of control, half naked?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto weakly held up a hand, still trying to catch his breath. \"Y-You...you...you....are not....not....not going to....to....to believe this...\" He managed to choke out before fainting. Gaara sighed and turned his back on Naruto, sand swiftly, gently rising up around the fox ninja cradling him as it lifted him into the air, moving silently behind Gaara as he took Naruto into the Kazekage's mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in the Land of Fire, Shikamaru was outlining the final tenants of his plan. \"Alright so are we clear on what we're going to do?\" He asked, looking from Kiba to Choji. Kiba quickly nodded while Choji groaned, rubbing his still loudly growling belly, practically ignoring what Shikamaru was saying. \"Well Choji?\" He said loudly, trying to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...are you sure we can't eat something first? Anything? I'm soooo hungry!\" Choji whimpered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then chew on your tongue!\" Kiba snapped, getting irritated by Choji's complaining. It wasn't something he had to deal with on a daily basis like Shikamaru did and he had little patience for it. It reminded him of how Shino would quietly complain and that only pissed him off more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough you two! We all need to be working together if we want this to work!\" Shikamaru loudly interrupted, snapping his fingers to get the other two male's attention. \"First things first, we need to get down out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kiba said, taking up the narrative of the plan. \"You're going to use your Shadow Stitching Jutsu to lower Choji and me out of here, making sure we stay safely connected to the kid's body until we hit the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Shikamaru said, turning to Choji. \"At that point, I'll remain here, resting and regaining my chakra. While I'm doing that, what's the next step?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji sighed and said, \"Right...I'm supposed to grow as big as I can possibly get, using any means necessary that aren't going to kill me in the long run. Kiba will ride with me, siphoning off his chakra into me so I can maintain my Expansion jutsu for as long as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And,\" Kiba swiftly cut in, \"hopefully you'll be able to use my chakra to get bigger than you normally can get. While Choji fights, I'll also take a soldier pill every so often to give him an extra boost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect.\" Shikamaru said, nodding. \"With any luck, he won't see any of this coming. I'm guessing he'll be too focused on eating to pay any attention to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji's stomach gurgled loudly at the word \"eating\" eliciting an even louder moan from Choji. \"You better hope I don't eat anyone when I'm big out there!\" He warned peevishly, only half kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, listen up Choji!\" Kiba suddenly shouted, grabbing Choji by the collar. \"If you just shut up and follow the plan, when all this is over, I'll buy you a fucking feast and you can stuff yourself silly! Got it?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji's eyes widened at the promise before grinning happily. \"Y-Yeah! Okay! That sounds great!\" He was much more invested in the plan now that he had such intense motivation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru smiled slightly and said, \"When you subdue the kid, I'll be ready with a sealing jutsu to make sure he won't be able to escape and cause any more trouble. What happens after that...we'll figure out when we get to it. For now, let's concentrate on taking this giant down!\" Shikamaru stuck his hand out in front of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Choji and Kiba both shouted, putting their hands on top of Shikamaru's.</span></div></div>",

The young blonde seemed to mumble in his sleep, tossing and turning not long after Gaara had set him on his bed! He seemed to go on about something needing to \"stop eating\" and how it will \"eat us all.\" Gaara, at first, had just assumed that it was just the ramblings of a wild imagination. However, he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck were tingling slightly... His sixth sense was trying to tell him that there was something far more powerful at work here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour, Naruto finally woke up with a yelp, shooting straight up out of bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAAAH! DON'T EAT ME!\" He shouted, his arms straight up in the air in surrender! Once he realized that he wasn't in Konohamaru's belly, he started looking around, where he saw Gaara sitting in the corner in a comofortable chair, gazing back at him. \"Uh... Ehehe...\" Naruto chuckled nervously, \"I'm... Alive?\" Naruto thought silently. His head turned and gazed all around. He didn't recall this room at all, but through the shutters on the nearby window, he could see a city made of sand and stone outside! \"I'm... In Suna?\" He finally managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Gaara replied, unfolding his arms and standing up. He walked over to the bed where Naruto lay and took a seat right next to him. \"You were flying through the air. I caught you so that you wouldn't splatter on the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Right!\" Naruto agreed. That was a very... Unappealing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you flying through the air anyhow. Or maybe I should ask, how?\" Gaara asked, gazing at Naruto, who seemed to be shuddering at the thought of such a terrible end. Naruto's eyes popped back open, as if he had just now realized he was asked a question!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gaara! You gotta get ready! It's Konohamaru!\" Naruto shouted, suddenly grabbing onto Gaara's robes! Gaara merely took Naruto's hands down off of him, and proceeded to ask Naruto his next question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little village boy? What about him?\" Gaara asked. He hadn't seen much of Konohamaru, but he knew who Naruto was talking about. The little runt that rammed into him when he was in Konoha for the Chuunin exams, and again, when he beat Naruto on a technicality in Suna's Chuunin exams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He's huge! And he ate the entire Leaf village!\" Naruto insisted, waving his arms up and about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, you're delusional.\" Gaara said, shaking his head with just a small smile in the corner of his mouth. \"Konohamaru... He isn't one of the Akamichi... It's impossible for him to grow that big. And especially to have the appetite to consume a village. He--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara was soon stopped as Naruto grabbed his shoulders. The fox ninja stared him point blank in the eyes. Gaara couldn't help but look back at him. \"Gaara... I know what I saw.\" Naruto assured, \"Konohamaru is huge. He's hungry. And he ate the entire village.\" He glared Gaara down with such powerful conviction, such sincerity, that he felt the Kazakage would have no choice but to believe him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara seemed to stare back for a moment, his eyes just a little wide. His heart seemed to scream that Naruto was telling the truth, but his mind kept trying to remind him what logic would dictate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...\" Gaara said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaara, please... You have to believe me!\" Naruto pleaded, his heart hammering in his chest, \"Otherwise... Otherwise Suna might suffer the same fate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how...?\" Gaara asked Naruto, \"How could a child get so large to consume an entire village? And more importantly, why would he betray his own village?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... A long story...\" Naruto woefully admitted, \"I think part of it is my fault...\" Naruto went on to explain everything that he believed lead up to his point. How he taunted and teased Konohamaru for not being strong or manly, or how deeply rooted his anger was for people not recognizing him for all the hard work he really did. Gaara and Naruto soon realized that Konohamaru must have gotten so wrapped up in his own anger that it warped his mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the story was told, all the way up to when Naruto was tossed straight to Suna, Gaara let out a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is madness, you know.\" He told Naruto. \"I trust you. I believe in you. But... What of the village?\" Gaara asked, \"I cannot simply state that a giant child is coming this way to destroy us and expect everyone to believe me.\" Gaara rubbed his forehead. There was no doubt in his mind that Naruto was telling the truth. Now the hard part was being able to rally their defenses. People would need to be evacuated, supplies for survival would need to be gathered... Possibly the biggest obstacle of all was the overcast of doubt the people would hold for Gaara, especially when they heard the reason for all this from his own mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut... If it would save lives, then it had to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?!\" Naruto asked, looking at Gaara the entire time, watching as his friend's face was twisted by stress. Naruto had little idea of how hard it truly was to be Hokage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I shall send word.\" Gaara finally spoke, \"We'll have everyone safely evacuated as soon as we can.\" Gaara stood up and slowly started walking for the door. As he had his hand on the handle, he stopped to speak, catching Naruto's attention. \"I do not know if we can fight back against this force. Especially not if it's as you described it. But we CAN defend. And we will.\" He assured Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Gaara left the room, leaving Naruto to think on this matter for himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shikamaru was focusing every last bit of chakra he had into this singular jutsu. Kiba and Choji could survive a steep fall, but one from this height could be fatal! Not to mention the constant sound of Konohamaru's lips smacking and munching in the background, a constant reminder of the looming danger over their heads. Lower and lower the two went, Kiba going as far to carrying Choji in his arms just so he could exert a little energy as possible so he would be fully prepared to fight off Konohamaru. What's more, Shikamaru, the brains of the whole operation, had no way of keeping in contact with Kiba and Choji, who were the muscle. Kiba kept his eyes on the ground while he held Choji tight. He never really called Choji fat, but damn did he realize how heavy the teen was when he was actually in his arms!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah! Kiba! You're squeezing my butt!\" Choji suddenly squealed when Kiba was reaffirming his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I wanted to grab that!\" Kiba barked back, \"Just hold on a little longer! We're almost to the ground!\" Choji merely whimpered in response, a little blush on his cheeks as they fell. He never had someone groping his butt before. It actually felt kind of nice as long as Kiba didn't squeeze TOO hard. After all, the dog man had some serious nails!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Shikamaru could feel the tension of the jutsu wear down, and he then knew that they were safely on the ground. Shikamaru immediately retracted the jutsu and fell onto his back. It was finally time for him to relax and hope that the rest of the plan went on without a hitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba felt a little out of breath, if only for the fact that his arms were a little sore from holding Choji the entire way down. Choji, on the other hand, was the only one in peak condition!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... You got this, Choji?\" Kiba asked his friend, who was stretching and warming up for this massive transformation!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, ready!\" Choji smiled, giving Kiba a thumbs up. Kiba took his position behind Choji as Choji formed the hand sign. \"Super Multi-Size Jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba immediately had to hold on tight to Choji as the already sizable young man suddenly began to skyrocket in size! It was like a carnival ride, shooting you skyward only it seemingly never ended! Kiba shouted out in dismay as he held on as tight as he could, finding it easier once he was able to climb fully onto Choji's shoulder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuger and huger Choji grew, remaining clothed unlike the massive flabby giant before them. They were soon peaking over the trees, and getting even huger thanks to Kiba's help! Kiba sat as peacefully as he could on Choji's shoulder, focusing on giving him every scrap of chakra he could muster! Bigger and bigger Choji grew, every inch of his flabby body shooting up in side along with him! It didn't cease until Choji was at least as big as Konohamaru, maybe a few tens of feet taller! But Konohamaru was still several hundred tons heavier! Choji grunted, feeling a slight burn in his body from being this gigantic!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push it Choji! We'll make do with what you have!\" Kiba shouted to his ally. Choji whimpered in a reply once more, but his voice was far deeper this time thanks to his gargantuan stature. Choji made a short stride towards Konohamaru. He tapped the kid's shoulder a few times, which made him turn in confusion. Before he could even look up at who it was, Choji didn't hesitate to slam his fist against Konohamaru's face, sending the kid plowing down onto the town he was devouring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, careful! There's people down there! And don't forget about Shikamaru, he's probably still recouperating from lowering us down to the ground!\" Kiba shouted, extra loud this time to make sure Choji heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" Choji replied immediately. It was more than clear that he was extremely nervous about this whole ordeal. And not to mention the constant pain in his stomach from his starving belly. He readied himself as Konohamaru steadily got back to his feet and began to charge at Choji! Choji braced himself, thinking he was more than ready to take the kid on only to get bowled over! Konohamaru landed with a gargantuan \"BOOM!\" on top of Choji, that decimated the entire area from shockwave alone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I know you!\" Konohamaru barked as he looked down at Choji. \"You're that chubby ninja guy!\" He roared. Choji was surprised at first, if only for the fact that he was shocked at huge Konohamaru was! His hands pressed at the titanic teen's belly, pathetically trying to fight him off! Konohamaru snickered as he looked at Choji. \"What's wrong? Mad you can't push me around?!\" Konohamaru sat up and folded his arms against his plumped chest. \"Too bad! I'm the biggest ninja that ever lived! No one's ever gonna underestimate me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Choji, you have to do something! Hurry!\" Kiba barked as he clung tightly to the armor on Choji's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoji...</span></div></div>",

Before he could react, Choji rose with a triumphant roar, tossing Konohamaru clear off of him, throwing him a few feet (a few miles to the normal sized villagers) onto yet another town, smashing it beneath Konohamaru's bulbous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you call me chubby!!\" Choji shouted angrily, a new burst of energy welling up inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba chuckled and bit down on a soldier pill, feeling his chakra pool fill back up. He quickly siphoned it off into Choji, the gargantuan ninja feeling the new flow, immediately reactivating his expansion jutsu, his already colossal form rising up and up and up into the sky, his shadow stretching across the landscape, engulfing even Konohamaru! Choji's sandaled feet stretched across the landscape, his spiky head of hair rising into the clouds, the various towns becoming nothing more than dots on the landscape! Konohamaru shook his head, gaping as he looked UP at Choji! \"W-What the hell?! No way! I'm not going to come this far and get stopped by THAT guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru frantically started grabbing any towns that were in front of him, stuffing them into his mouth, swallowing them down, desperate to squeeze out as much growth as he could while Choji was still using the jutsu. Unfortunately for him, the towns provided little sustenance, his enormous frame only expanding slightly, rising up tens of feet higher but these mere inches were like nothing. Choji quickly ended the jutsu when he felt a sharp pain across his chest, his body already taking heavy damage from having the jutsu active for this long at this level! \"Gotta end this fast...\" He muttered, his voice still loud enough to boom across the landscape like godly thunder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his foot into the air, a hurricane of wind whipping around the appendage, uprooting trees, sending people and buildings flying, such devastation beyond even the Tailed Beasts to create! Choji winced, knowing how much damage he was causing, but still moving, knowing that this was for the great good of the world! The earth quaked impressively as he set his foot back down, taking a step forward, cracks radiating out from his sole, driving deep into the ground, the glimmer of lava practically visible within the depths of the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Choji strode closer to Konohamaru, the now doll sized fatty was starting to panic, shoving anything he could find in his mouth! Trees, ground, dirt, rock, anything he could close his fingers around went into his mouth, his size increasing at a faster pace, but not nearly fast enough! Before he could grow any significant amount bigger, he felt an enormous pressure on his back. Choji was pressing down with his foot, easily pinning the trouble making giant under his sandal. \"NOW SHIKAMARU!\" Choji's enormous voice boomed across the landscape, as audible to the ninja of the world as he was visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Shikamaru panted, barely able to cling to the wall of the navel as Konohamaru was forced to his knees, hands on the ground, arms shaking, teeth gritting as he tried to push back against the foot. Shikamaru's hands moved in a blur as he made the signs of a complicated sealing jutsu, slamming his hand down against the wall he was currently sticking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru could feel his body growing sluggish, strange symbols running out of his belly button and over his chunky body, sealing his limbs, making them feel sluggish and heavy. \"No...no! It can't end like this! It WON'T end like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the last bit of strength in his body, Konohamaru made a simple hand sign, concentrating on a point far, far away from their current location, deep in the desert. If everyone hadn't been so focused on him and Choji, they might have noticed a puff of smoke appearing there. As it was, Konohamaru's arms fell to his sides, his entire body slamming into the ground, motionless. Shikamaru had managed to slip out at the last second, falling to the ground seconds after Konohamaru, sighing in relief, his chakra completely depleted. \"Made it...\" He muttered, passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire world seemed to hold still as Konohamaru lay sealed, this nightmare seemingly over. Choji grunted in pain, his body shrinking swiftly down, down, down, Kiba jumping from his shoulder as soon as he was low enough to the ground, both teens ending up next to where Shikamaru was. Choji fell onto his back, completely drained, his stomach rumbling ferociously. Kiba chuckled, falling onto his ass between Choji and Shikamaru. \"We...we did it you guys...It actually...worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...but I've never felt hungrier in my whole life!\" Choji moaned, barely able to even move his arms to pat his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiba laughed and rubbed Choji's stomach for him, saying, \"Don't worry Choji. Now that this big tub of lard is under control I'll make sure you have the biggest, tastiest feast you could ever hope for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens chuckled, feeling a sharp sense of relief now that it was all finally over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Sunagakure, before Konohamaru had been sealed, Naruto was standing on the balcony of the Kazekage's palace, Gaara standing next to him, watching as the entire military force of the Sand was mobilized. Gaara still had his doubts, but had sent messengers to see if what Naruto said was happening was true. His doubts were completely obliterated when Choji's gigantic body suddenly appeared on the horizon, jutting proudly up through the clouds, miles tall, looming over the landscape! Gaara's mouth dropped open in uncharacteristic surprise, wondering how such a giant could even exist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Choji?! What the heck?!\" Naruto shouted, just as shocked as Gaara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth teens watched as Choji took a few steps, the ground around even THEM shuddering in protest, knocking half the army off its feet! Gaara and Naruto had to hold tight to the railing lest they get pitched over the side! The confusion lasted until they heard Choji call out, \"NOW SHIKAMARU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's confused look of disbelief cracked into a smile. \"Heh...T-They must have come up with a plan! They're stopping Konohamaru! Ahahahahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's laughter was almost crazed, relief dripping from his every word. Gaara, still a bit confused, smiled ruefully as Naruto laughed. \"This will certainly make for an interesting story I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed, his giggles tapering off. He had opened his mouth to say something when a massive amount of smoke suddenly surrounded them from nowhere, making both teens cough loudly. Naruto could feel his heart beat faster. He recognized this smoke. He had seen it dozens of times! And if there was this much smoke it could only mean...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly looked up into the grinning face of Konohamaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAH!\" Naruto shrieked, falling to his ass, looking up in utter horror at Konohamaru!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, you didn't think I'd go down THAT easily did you?\" Konohamaru said, waving his finger at Naruto. \"You should know better than THAT bug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly reached down, his enormous hand able to easily scoop up half of Suna into his palm, dragging half the army up with him! Sand cascaded down from Konohamaru's hand, nearly burying the other half of Suna as he did! He gulped down the village, licking his fingers afterwards, grinning down at Naruto and Gaara. \"A little gritty, but still tasty. Now listen up! The original Konohamaru ran into a small road bump! I'm here to make sure that it's not an issue! So I want each and every one of you remaining ninja and citizens to start gathering up food! LOTS of food! And bring it all here to me! I'm going to eat and I'm not going to STOP eating until Konohamaru is able to break out of that seal! You got me?! Anyone who doesn't obey...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slapped his belly menacingly. \"So GET TO WORK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto closed his eyes, feeling drained. He had been so close...so CLOSE to freedom! He opened his eyes, yelping as he saw Konohamaru's gigantic fingers reach down, plucking him up once more, raising him up to his face. \"As for YOU...I've got a special job for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto gulped and said, \"W-What do you want me to do....master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru chuckled deeply, glad to hear that pathetic plea once more. \"It's something that only YOU can do, with that massive chakra pool of yours. Make me up some clones! Hundreds of them! THOUSANDS even! Keep making them until you run out of chakra! Take some soldier pills if you have to, but do whatever it takes to make more clones! I want MILLIONS of them now that I think about it! Entire populations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing to do with all that?\" Naruto asked, his heart hammering in his chest, unsure if he would be able to do such a feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKonohamaru's gut rumbled ominously in response. \"I'm going to EAT them all of course! Just think of it...a neverending supply of food, all for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...won't they just disappear once you eat them?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe if I was NORMAL. But I'm a ninja GOD now! I can feel it! All the chakra the clones are made up of will just be absorbed into my body, feeding me more!\" Konohamaru insisted, sure of this feeling inside of him. \"So what are you waiting for? GET MAKING!\"</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo quickly ran up the stairs in his house, making a sharp turn into his room before slamming the door behind him all in one fluid motion. He tossed his bag onto the floor before darting around the room, checking the closet, under the bed, behind his desk, in his drawers, and anywhere else Kon might be hiding. He wasn't anywhere to be found in the room which meant he was either out and about making trouble or he was trapped somewhere in Yuzu's room. Either way worked for Ichigo since he desperately needed some time alone to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe locked his door before closing the curtains, throwing the room into a premature twilight. With slightly trembling fingers, the orange haired teen removed his school shirt, tossing it carelessly over the back of his chair before fumbling with his belt. His hands were clumsy as his mind whirled with thoughts of everything that had happened today. He managed to undo his button and zipper, taking a few minutes longer than he normally did, and pushed his pants down until they were around his knees. That was good enough for what he wanted to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying out on top of his bed, his heart hammering, Ichigo pulled down his boxers, revealing his impressive manhood, hard as a rock, and quivering in the open air, able to finally stretch now that it was no longer contained inside its cloth prison. Ichigo drew in a shuddering breath as his hand enclosed around it. For a boy his age, he had an impressive cock, measuring at least nine to ten inches hard depending on how turned on he was. Right now it was probably stretched even farther than that. He had never been turned on quite like this before in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he began to stroke himself, Ichigo's thoughts drifted back to the school day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo had always prided himself on being a chaste boy. He only got flustered when he saw a naked woman because it was indecent, not because it gave him any pleasure. Most of the girls in his school considered him a grumpy weirdo anyway so he had never had much choice in dating, even if it interested him. After becoming a Soul Reaper, and seeing all the busty babes the Soul Society had to offer who didn't seem to care about his attitude...he still wasn't interested in the slightest. There just always seemed to be something more important to concentrate on than women. This had suited Ichigo just fine for his fifteen years of life. However, something unexpected had happened that morning at school. It had started out the same as any other day. He had sat down and Keigo had begun chattering about something he had done over the weekend, asking Ichigo if he wanted to go over to his house after school who bluntly declined which set Keigo into a loud fit about how Ichigo never liked to hang out with him. Totally, one hundred percent normal. His attention had begun to wander when his teacher suddenly said, \"Oh, and we have two new transfer students coming in for awhile...again...huh...That seems to happen a lot in this class doesn't it?\" Her tone was cheerful. It was obvious she didn't really mind in the slightest. \"Anyway! Please welcome Renji Abarai and Ikkaku Madarame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's attention was immediately drawn to the front of the classroom, a look of shock on his face. Only Renji was standing at the front of the room, making him wonder briefly why his teacher even mentioned Ikkaku, before noticing something else...Renji looked...huge! He had to be at least a foot or so taller than Ichigo remembered him being (He had seen him just last week when they took down a stray arrancar together) and his muscles were enormous! His button down school shirt was visibly straining, the buttons looking ready to burst if Renji so much as took a breath. The material was so tight against his body Ichigo could clearly make out a steel hard six pack pushing out from his stomach! His pecs were like beach balls bulging out a good ways from his body. His biceps were equally impressive , straining the sleeves of his uniform to their limit. Threads were already starting to come undone, unable to withstand the sheer mass of Renji's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's wide eyed stare was interrupted by the sound of giggling coming from behind him. He shook his head a little as he heard a girl whisper, \"Oh my God, just look at that bulge! What a man~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo involuntarily felt his gaze drift down to Renji's crotch. The girl was right to be impressed! The dress pants did absolutely nothing to hide Renji's bulging manhood. It looked as though the pants would explode if Renji ever got hard, not to mention his enormous thighs were filling up his pants legs to the maximum, his calves doing their part to make sure everything was not just skin tight on Renji, but skin tight to the point of ripping at the slightest movement! Even his forearms looked thick and strong and his hands had a strong, masculine look to them. His feet seemed to be cramped into a rather uncomfortable looking pair of shoes, but if they bothered Renji he didn't show it in the slightest, his expression one of pure cocky confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gulped as he looked Renji up and down, heat rising to his face as he felt a strange stirring deep inside him. He had never felt anything quite like this before in his life. He wasn't sure what to make of it. He shifted slightly in his seat and found, to his dismay, that he was as hard as a rock! This was an unusual occurrence for him. His rarely found the time to pleasure himself with constantly dealing with homework, family business, and Soul Reaper duties. The most release he got was when his body actively rebelled against him, leaving him with morning wood so intense he pretty much had to jerk off just to be able to get anything done. Ichigo didn't have a frame of reference for what was average, but he had a feeling that his dick was above it and his loads were equally impressive. One time he had been too slow with his tissues and had ended up covering his entire torso with hot, sticky seed. Getting to the shower without running into any of his family members had been a bit of a luck based mission...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was snapped out of his thoughts once again when the teacher said, \"Why don't you go sit down next to Ichigo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji nodded, grinning as he caught Ichigo's eye. He sauntered over to him, slipping easily into the desk even though it was a size or two too small for him. He leaned over and whispered, \"Hey Ichigo~ Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renji! What the hell happened to you?!\" Ichigo hurriedly whispered back, his face still red at this whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji merely chuckled and said, \"Research and Development's been working on some new enhancers. They're completely experimental so only Ikkaku and I wanted to try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is he anyway?\" Ichigo asked, his mind diverted somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though in answer, the door to the classroom was slid roughly open with a sharp BANG! a loud, low voice growling out, \"I'm here, don't mark me absent or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire classroom fell silent as Ikkaku lumbered into the classroom. He was truly a sight to behold. He was so tall, he needed to crouch down just to get into the classroom! When he stood back up, his head smashed into the ceiling, a curse slipping out from Ikkaku as he immediately crouched back down, rubbing his head. \"Damn low ceilings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's mouth dropped open. Ikkaku's muscles were so huge, vascular, and uncovered they made Renji look like a child in comparison. No shirt would obviously properly fit Ikkaku's bulging physique, so he wasn't wearing one. Equally absent were pants. Only a tattered looking pair of black shorts clung gamely to his thighs, the waist band riding low on his hips, the v leading down to his crotch clearly visible. A pair of improvised sandals tied to his feet were the only other clothing that he was wearing. He glared down at the teacher and said, \"Sorry about the outfit. Nothing else fits me. You got a problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis gaze was so menacing, the teacher merely held up her hands and said, \"Not at all! Please, take your seat! Um...we...seem to have run out of desks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku waved his hand carelessly and said, \"Whatever. I'll find a place.\" He made his way down the aisle, students quickly moving their desks out of his way until he was standing just behind Ichigo. He glared at the girls sitting there and barked, \"MOVE!\" They scattered like mice, leaving a large space for Ikkaku to sit down in. With a sigh, he crashed down on top of the desk, smashing it to pieces, his legs stretching out on either side of Ichigo. The young teen's heart was racing even faster, his pants uncomfortably tight. This was going to be a long, long day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo could barely think the entire time he was in class. With Renji constantly at this side, and Ikkaku's pillar legs on either side of him, he easily found himself nervously tapping on the side of his desk, waiting for time to just hurry up and pass. He couldn't listen to his lessons, Renji's powerful shoulders and arms kept pushing into him, at from time to time, he could have swore that he could barely smell a thick musk coming from behind him. Curiosity took hold as he could only IMAGINE what that scent was without looking behind him, and the gigantic Ikkaku seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing his best to calm his libido, he started to think of things that would turn him off. Or at least things that would distract him from his raging boner. \"Come on...\" He thought, his eyes darting all over the room. \"C-Clock! Time... Patience... Boring... So bored... Uhm... Bones! Bones, death... Life, soul reapers...\" In an instant, Ichijo realized what was wrong with heading that direction. Soul reapers mean people like Renji and Ikkaku, and Renji and Ikkaku were huge, bulging, and thick beyond comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji's ears suddenly perked up as he hear a noisy \"thunk!\" He looked about for a second, before looking down at Ichigo. A sly grin slid across his face as he watched the puny man fidget and squirm in his desk, desperately trying to hold back his thoughts. It didn't take a lot of thought on Renji's part to realize what that \"Thunk\" was. He was hot, he was attractive, and he knew it! He didn't mind having all eyes on him! He ate up all the attention like a sponge to water, and every little flex he gave to any admirers that passed by only left more \"water\" for him to soak right up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat felt like an eternity, the bell rang, and thus it was time for lunch. Ichigo let out a long breath. After some rather... Unattractive thinking, he was finally able to control the snake in his pants. With a deep breath, he made his way to the door, waiting outside for the two \"elephants in the room\" to exit. Keigo stopped by in front of Ichigo, surprisingly calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ichigo... Don't you know those guys?\" Keigo asked, trying to be calm about the matter. Ichigo just glanced up, his look firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Ichigo replied. Much to his dismay, this was the trigger that caused Keigo to flip out. His arms flailing about, he began to shout at Ichigo, but Ichigo just did his best to block it all out. As if right on cue, Renji and Ikkaku had squeezed out of the room. \"Hey!\" Ichigo shouted, looking up at them. This was a bit of a new feeling for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji just smiled to himself as he looked down at Ichigo. \"Hey, look who it is!\" Ikkaku, who was standing behind Renji, couldn't quite see from the angle he was at. His swollen pecs blocked the view he had directly below him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well!? Who is it!?\" Ikkaku asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji looked back in confusion for a moment, but then chuckled. \"Who d'ya think, you big lug? It's Ichigo! ... And his little friend.\" Renji gave a glare down at Keigo, who just whimpered and quivered under the presence of the two colossus. Renji gave a fake lunge at Keigo, which caused him to run off screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T SQUISH MEEEEEE!\" He cried out, his voice quickly fading away. Looks like it was just the three boys... And a small crowd of girls behind Ikkaku. Ikkaku quickly caught up on this, and let out a loud \"ROAR!\" that easily scared the lot of them away. He smirked to himself, feeling even more powerful that he was, if that was even possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Let's head outside.\" Ichigo suggested, \"Somewhere more... Secret.\" Although he wouldn't admit to it, Ichigo had got a little twinge in his pants from hearing Ikkaku's beastly roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, the three men met ouside, hiding the best they could behind some bushes and trees. Having just arrived, Ichigo turned to begin speaking to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now--\" Ichigo was interrupted, only for Renji to suddenly press his sizable bulge into Ichigo's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel that?\" Renji chuckled, moving up and down a little so Ichigo was forced to rub against it, \"That's 100% man right there!\" Renji then pushed a little harder. Ichigo tried to push back, but failed horribly. It just made Renji laugh, before he grunted a little, making his dick shake and push the pathetic man down. \"Hey, Ikkaku, why should we listen to what Ichigo has to say?\" He asked his fellow Soul Reaper. \"Who says a pair a huge guys like us have to listen to a pipsqueak like him?\" Ikkaku just looked down at Renji in confusion for a moment, before getting a grin on his face as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Guess you're right!\" Ikkaku agreed, \"How about we have a little fun with the little guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fun!? You guys still have to--\" Before Ichigo could argue with the giants, he found himself with Renji's bulge pressed back in his face, and to make matters worse, he could feel as Ikkaku slammed into him from behind! It was almost as if they knew what they were doing to him! The two of them pressed their flaccid cocks against them, practically engulfing Ichigo between two walls of meat! Renji was laughing at how easy it was for him to control the teen's every action, while Ikkaku shared a similar feeling, he just chose to keep to an arrogant smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a whole five minutes of rubbing, Ichigo wasn't sure if he was in Heaven or Hell. He wasn't entirely fond of being dominated so easily, but another part of him was loving the domination and didn't want it to end. Thankfully for him, it didn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku smiled, picking Ichigo up by the front of his shirt. \"Now it's my turn!\" He threw Ichigo at Renji's torso. To the puny Ichigo, it felt like he was thown against a brick wall that only had a mere pillow over it. Before he could get a word in, Ikkaku slammed into Renji, and the two locked their arms together. They started to rub their bodies against each other, and Ichigo was forced to feel the full, powerful girth rubbing all around his comparatively thin frame. Their squishy pecs squeezing his face at times, while at others he was forced down, and almost painfully pressed between what felt like two washboards. It was hard at times, since Ikkaku was taller than Renji, but the two managed to make it work, almost as if they had practice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the end of lunch this went on. Ichigo was dropped down onto the dirt, as the other two heard the bell ring. They looked back at Ichigo and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the fun, Chibi-go.\" Renji said, trying to insult the orange headed kid. Ikkaku just let out a happy chuckle. The two walked together back to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, on the other hand, was left with such a hard-on that wouldn't quit. There was no way he'd be able to get throught class safely. Once he was sure everyone was back inside, he dashed over to the first floor to pick up his shoes and his backpack from his locker. His head was constantly whipping back and forth to make sure that no one saw him. No matter what he thought of, the thoughts of his torture just wouldn't go away. There was only one way to fix all this, and Ichigo knew how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith backpack in tow, and with god speed, Ichigo sprinted back home...</span></div></div>",

Ichigo's mind was constantly wandering, looking over at Renji or behind him at Ikkaku all throughout the day. It didn't help that neither man was doing much to be discreet. At one point during the day, Renji's sleeves popped open as he was stretching, revealing even more of his toned arms. Soon after that, Ikkaku had leaned forward to ask the person in front of Ichigo to borrow a pen, causing Ichigo's head to become nestled between the massive Soul Reaper's thick pecs. Ichigo remained in a constant state of arousal so bad, he pushed aside everyone that even came close to him at the end of the day, muttering out apologies as he ran as fast as he could home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, finally, he was able to take care of his throbbing erection. He closed his eyes, images of Ikkaku and Renji flexing their huge bodies coming unbidden into his head. Ichigo's breathing increased as he imagined them moving in closer together...groping each other's muscles...kissing...their hands wandering over each other's bodies...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*knock knock!* *knock knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's eyes flew open, a growl of frustration escaping from between his lips. He had barely managed to stroke himself three times before he was interrupted! Irritably, he got up, pulling up his boxers and pants, shoving his erection somewhat painfully to the side as he zipped and buttoned the fly. He pulled his shirt on and was halfway through buttoning it when the knocking returned, louder and more insistent than before. \"Hold on dammit!\" Ichigo shouted, doing up the last button. He quickly pulled open the curtains and smoothed the covers on his bed so no one would get suspicious of what he had been up to and, as a finishing touch, spread out some books and notebooks on his desk so it looked like he had been doing his homework. That finally done, he walked over to his door, unlocked it, and jerked it open. \"What do you...want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice, hard and angry at the beginning of the sentence, grew far softer as he saw exactly who was waiting at his door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ichigo...surprised to see me?\" Ikkaku asked, a mischievous grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm surprised!\" Ichigo said, quickly regaining his senses. \"What are you doing here? I don't want my family to think I'm friends with a weirdo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku's cocky smile quickly turned into a frown. \"Shut up you little brat! Your family is at the park. They won't be back for a few hours at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" Ichigo said. \"You still haven't told me why you're here yet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku, already crouching down somewhat, quickly moved into the room, his bare chest bumping lightly against Ichigo's face. \"Isn't it obvious?\" That grin was back on his face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo rubbed his cheek a little, the blush fast returning, and closed the door behind Ikkaku. \"No...it's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku sat down, his head still rising above Ichigo's by at least a foot or so. Reaching behind the smaller teen, he deftly locked the door to the room. Ichigo backed a bit away from Ikkaku and said, \"What did you do that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku shrugged in response and said, \"Can't be too careful, right? I don't want us to be disturbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's heart had started racing again. He tired to back up slowly to the door but Ikkaku easily cut him off, pushing him over to his desk before moving his body until his wide back was pressed up against the door. \"Come on kid! You're not fooling anyone! Did you think I didn't notice that poking out of your pants all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lightly tapped Ichigo's noticeable bulge with a finger. Ichigo blushed more fiercely and stumbled backward, falling onto his bed. \"S-Shut up! What makes you think it's because of you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku chuckled and moved in closer, bouncing his pecs as he did so. \"You let out the cutest little moan when my chest pressed up against your head. Don't think I didn't hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gulped, feeling slightly shaky. All of this was getting to be too much for him. He was so flustered he wasn't really thinking straight. Ikkaku took this opportunity to grip Ichigo's shirt in one hand, ripping it open with a slight tug. Buttons flew off in all directions, scattering across the floor. Ichigo gasped and tried to pull away, but Ikkaku wouldn't let him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah~ You're not getting away from me that easily kid.\" He said,  his voice low and sensual. Ichigo could feel his body trembling, not with fear, never with fear, but only with desire. He relaxed slightly and let Ikkaku slowly undress him, ripping his pants off with the same delicate but insistent strength. Ikkaku pulled down Ichigo's boxers slightly until he could see the puff of Ichigo's orange pubic hair nestled around the base of his erection. \"Looks like you're already pretty excited. This shouldn't be too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo moaned slightly as he felt the material of his boxers slide over his sensitive head, Ikkaku taking his time in removing the last article of clothing on Ichigo's body. Once the substitute Soul Reaper was fully nude, Ikkaku leaned down, his hot breath puffing against Ichigo's length. Ichigo feebly reached out and gripped Ikkaku's head, holding him down close to his groin. Ikkaku was more than happy to oblige, his tongue sneaking out between his lips and gently licking the engorged shaft in front of him. Even this slight attention was enough to send Ichigo reeling, his back arching slightly as his hips thrust forward ever so gently, pushing himself against Ikkaku's tongue. The older Soul Reaper couldn't help but chuckle, opening his mouth and taking the young man's length fully inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo's vision blurred as he rocked his hips in unison with Ikkaku's sucking, the constant pressure on his cock sending waves of pleasure coursing through his body. He curled his toes, feeling as though the soles of his feet were being gently shocked, his whole body quivering with desire. It was almost more than he could stand and yet it was only the simplest of actions. Within only a few minutes, pre was already leaking into Ikkaku's mouth. He had a slightly amused expression on his face as he whispered, \"This is pretty easy. How long as it been since you've been with anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo could so much as squeak out a response, Ikkaku continued sucking, his large tongue licking up and down the shaft before running all around the head, lapping up every drop of pre cum the orange haired teen could exude. Ichigo's words died inside of a long, shuddering moan, his head falling back as he hugged Ikkaku even closer to his body. Sweat began to bead up on his bare chest, running in slow drips down his own chiseled torso. Just when it seemed like he was going to collapse from the sheer pleasure of it all, Ichigo's body shuddered and tensed up before unleashing a torrent of cum into Ikkakku's mouth. Ikkaku easily swallowed down the entire load and every one that came after it as Ichigo's body was wracked with pleasure. Finally, when it was all over, Ichigo collapsed onto his bed, his limbs numb, his whole body tingling with the after math.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving back, Ikkaku chuckled and licked his lips. \"Geez...I didn't think you'd be so fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo, his chest rising and falling quite rapidly, couldn't even begin to respond. Ikkaku cracked his knuckles and hooked his thumbs into the waistband of his shorts. \"Don't worry...for the next part, you don't even need to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku slowly rolled the young teen over, exposing his muscled ass, before pulling down his own shorts, kicking them off into the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was positioning himself behind Ichigo...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ikkaku pulled his hips back, his throbbing erection pointed directly at Ichigo's tight hole, and just as he was about to thrust his way in...there was a heavy knock on the door! Ikkaku growled and looked over his shoulder at the annoyance. The door was locked so whoever was knocking would eventually get bored and leave. He wasn't about to let something like this distract him from getting what was his! Ichigo, however, was a completely different story. The very second he had heard knocking he had sprang into action. He jumped up off the bed and began scrambling around for his clothes, quickly putting on his underwear before Ikkaku's meaty fist closed around his upper arm, holding him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what the hell do you think you're doing?\" He growled out dangerously, glaring at Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange haired teen tried to pull his arm free but couldn't even begin to budge it. \"Let me go! If that's my dad or sisters I don't want them catching me like this! You need to hide too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku roughly forced Ichigo back down onto his bed before leaning down over top of him, his arms planted on either side of his body. Ichigo felt a slight spasm of fear pass through him as he looked up at Ikkaku's face. \"Settle down and shut up!\" he barked out angrily. \"I didn't come all this way just to leave unsatisfied! You hear me? Now strip!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo gulped and seemed about ready to pull his underwear back down when the knocking resumed, more urgently than before. His face was set in a resolute expression as he kicked at Ikkaku's chest, his small bare feet having no effect on the larger Soul Reaper's thick pecs. \"Get out of my way! I need to get dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like what usually happened after getting a release, Ichigo was back to his no nonsense personality. He struggled and fought and it was only Ikkaku pressing him down on the bed with his chest that stopped him from escaping. \"You owe me at least a blow job you little punk! No one gets free service from Ikkaku Madarame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ichigo could reply, a resounding CRACK filled the room as the door was knocked completely off its hinges, revealing a very pissed off Renji standing in the open doorway. Ikkaku made a \"tch!\" sound as he saw his fellow Soul Reaper and got up off the bed. Renji looked between Ikkaku and Ichigo, the former naked while the latter was only in his underwear. \"Just what the hell is going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo jumped up and said, \"It's not what it looks like! I--\" He was interrupted as Ikkaku grabbed him from behind, holding him against his chest, his hand pressing against the back of the teen's head, forcing his face in between the thick muscles. \"What does it look like idiot? Kurosaki and I were just enjoying a little alone time before you barged in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo tried to protest this, his face burning red, but his voice was muffled by the muscles. Renji looked livid. He squeezed his way inside the room and grabbed Ikkaku's arm, attempting to pry Ichigo out his embrace. It was a meaningless effort. His arms bulged and worked but the experimental drugs had worked far more effectively for Ikkaku than they had for Renji, leaving him at an inferior strength. Ikkaku chuckled and kicked Renji, his body flying backward into the wall. \"Stay right there and watch. When I'm done with him, I'll come back for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji growled and got to his feet, moving back towards Ikkaku. This seemed to amuse the larger Soul Reaper who merely smirked and said, \"Just stay down if you know what's good for you. You're only gonna hurt yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji cracked his neck and said, \"That's what you think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fiery red head held up something in his hand, his thumb popping the top of it off. Ikkaku raised an eyebrow at him before suddenly realizing what he was holding. \"Hey! Don't you even thick about taking those!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe immediately dropped Ichigo who landed flat on his back on the floor before making his way over to Renji. In this instance, his size was a detriment as it made moving around in the confined space of Ichigo's room next to impossible. By the time he was within reaching distance of Renji, he had downed the whole bottle of...something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot! They told us not to take that much of it!\" Ikkaku growled, more pissed that Renji had thought of doing that before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji grinned and tossed the bottle to the side. \"They wanted us to test the effects of this drug right? Well that's exactly what I'm doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? Well two can play at that game!\" Ikkaku said, grabbing his shorts and rummaging through the pockets. He pulled out a similar looking bottle and tore the top off, downing the whole bottle in one go as well. \"We'll just see who comes out on top!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji and Ikkaku glared at each while Ichigo slowly got to his feet, rubbing the back of his head. He still felt a little dazed as he looked over at his comrades. His look of confusion quickly turned to one of anger. \"Alright! That's it! I've had enough from the both of you! Get out! RIGHT NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo was totally ignored for his troubles. \"HEY! Are you two even listening to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" They both shouted, glancing over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo ran over to the two and got between them. He press his hands against Renji's chest and shoved him, trying to move him out the door. Renji didn't budge. However, he did look down at him with a warm smile, ruffling his hair. \"Just watch for awhile okay? I'll kick this guy's ass and then we can spend some time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo blushed a little. Renji's voice and expression were very soft, almost like those of a lover. Just what the heck was going on here? This whole situation seemed completely crazy! And yet...the feelings were real. Ikkaku, not about to be outdone, pulled Ichigo closer to his body and said, \"I don't think so! After I'm done kicking YOUR ass, WE'RE going to spend more time together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted Ichigo forcibly upward and kissed him, hard, on the lips. Ichigo's eyes sprang open, his body going numb at this sudden show of passion. It didn't last long before Renji jerked Ichigo away from Ikkaku, leading him over to a stack of cushions in the corner. \"Just wait! Whoever wins, gets Ichigo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo snapped out of his passion daze as soon as he heard this. \"Hey! I'm not just some damn prize!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Soul Reapers were ignoring him again, however. Ichigo was about to have a total melt down...when he saw something that made his jaw drop in shock!</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ichigo could only look on in shock as Ikkaku's body began to grow even larger! The already enormous Soul Reaper swiftly grew larger, his domed head inching towards the ceiling as his shoulders made for each opposite wall, his thick legs growing longer, his big feet getting closer and closer to Renji! Ikkaku chuckled, low in his throat, the sound coming out rumbling and intimidating. \"What did I tell ya? My body is MADE for growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku's growth quickened, his head slamming into the ceiling, cracking it, plaster raining down on top of him while his shoulders broadened so much they crashed through the walls, his big bare feet pressing tightly against the wall on either side of the door. Ikkaku's laughter got louder as he kept enlarging, his chest puffing out in front of him, his pecs pressing up against his chin while his biceps swelled bigger and bigger, veins popping up to feed the already engorged muscle with even more size! His abs practically exploded off his stomach, each one as big as one of Renji's pecs and growing larger! His cock slowly moved across the floor like a great serpent, the slit flaring slightly as the smooth wooden floor started stimulating him. Ikkaku's laughter turned to moans as his cock suddenly twitched, nearly smashing into Renji! The red haired Soul Reaper barley ducked in time! Ikkaku's firm, muscular ass ballooned out behind him, crushing Ichigo's bed into splinters. His back smashed the window above Ichigo's bed immediately after that. The whole room was starting to get incredibly cramped, Ichigo's small body forced against the wall by Ikkaku's enormous thighs, each one thickening and growing bigger, pressing up against each other. Cracks started appearing where the gigantic man's shoulders and feet were pressing against the walls, the whole room slowly bowing out in all directions. Ikkaku smirked down at Ichigo, watching as the little teen's arms pushed against the massive thigh, unable to budge it even an inch. With a swift movement, Ikkaku picked Ichigo up in his big hand, his thick fingers easily able to curl around the doll sized substitute Soul Reaper's body. \"Don't worry little guy. I'll keep you safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo blushed slightly, his heart starting to thud a bit faster, until Ikkaku suddenly forced him between his massive pecs, the titanic slabs of muscle pressing against his body, keeping it firmly in place. \"I need my hands free for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his palms flat against the ceiling and was about to push when he saw Renji make a break for the door, trying to escape from the room before it collapsed. With an evil grin, Ikkaku slammed his foot against the door, nearly crushing Renji in the process. \"No way Abarai! You're not getting away that easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji glared at Ikkaku, annoyed that his pills weren't kicking in as fast as Ikkaku's were. If he didn't start growing, and fast, there was no way he was going to be able to win Ichigo back from him! Unfortunately for him, these thoughts caused him to hold his place just long enough for Ikkaku to slam his foot against him. Luckily (sort of), Ikkaku used so much force he shoved Renji clean through the wall, allowing the comparatively tiny Soul Reaper to escape. He fled down the stairs just as the wail of twisting wood filled the air, followed by a huge crash. Ikkaku had finally fallen through the floor! The foundation was smashed under his enormous ass, compromising the integrity of the house! Renji ran out the front door as the house continued to collapse around him. He ran across the street and turned around, watching in horror as he could see bits and pieces of Ikkaku's gigantic body through the various windows of the house, his body still growing at a quick pace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a massive arm burst through one of the walls, followed swiftly by another equally massive arm bursting from the opposite wall. Two loud crashes heralded the appearance of two enormous bare feet, one smashing through a window while the other emerged from the door, attached to a titanic pair of legs. The walls of the house started to fall down as Ikkaku's head exploded from the roof, his traps rising up around his thick neck like an impenetrable wall. The house collapsed completely around Ikkaku as his growth came to a halt. Slowly, he got to his feet, his shadow stretching over Renji. He ran his hands slowly up and down his body, gripping his thick, juicy pecs in his hands, pushing them up so he could give them a little lick before running one hand down his massive cobble stone abs, the other arm rising up to his side, flexing, the bicep bloating up taller than Renji and far, far thicker! He leaned forward slightly to look at his gigantic thighs, the muscles so thick they rubbed up against each other, forcing Ikkaku to adopt a wider stance. His calves were just as impressive, balled up and diamond hard. Ikkaku wiggled his toes, loving how the ground trembled under even under this slight movement. With a casual bounce of his pecs, Ichigo slipped out from between the giant orbs and landed on Ikkaku's hand. His fingers closed around the frail human, keeping him in his fist while he scanned the ground, looking for Renji. When he spotted him, he grinned and bounced his pecs again, arrogantly, trying to intimidate Renji. \"Alright...you said something about fighting for Ichigo right?\" He cracked his knuckles menacingly. \"Let's get started then!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renji gulped as he looked up at the massive titan that was Ikkaku. To a human, Renji was massive. To Ikkaku, he was more like a fly... A stag beetle at best, but that was being generous. As Ikkaku's hand started to come down, Renji turned and made a break for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" Ikkaku said, his loud, commanding voice heard even five blocks away! Before Renji could even get ONE block away, a dark shadow encompassed him from above! As Renji turned and looked up, all he could see was Ikkaku's giant sole. It seemed to float in place for but a brief second, before suddenly coming down on top of the beefy soul reaper! Renji put his hands up in a pathetic attempt to stop the foot, but it was all for naught, as the immense force of the foot immediately slammed Renji into the pavement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji grunted, both surfaces feeling equally hard to him. Ikkaku's rough, manly foot had a faint, musky odor to it that actually gave him a little twinge in his pants! As his strong arms wiggled around in an attempt to free himself, all he ended up doing was rubbing aginst Ikkaku's giant foot! He gulped a little, taking a nose full of that bittersweet aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Ikkaku was laughing down at Renji! \"That's what you get for messing with someone far superior to you!\" He said with a grin. He pushed his foot down a little more, leaving an imprint in the ground, as well as pushing Renji down further into the pavement! \"And now you...\" Ikkaku opened his palm and looked down at Ichigo. Like a good little mini, he remained in place, which brought a smile to Ikkaku's face. That smile, however, gave Ichigo a bit of a shiver. Especially when he considered what Ikkaku had just done to him in his own bedroom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What...?\" Ichigo began to stammer, but he could barely get two words in before Ikkaku interrupted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, cute... You're in awe of such a magnificent specimin of man!\" Ikkaku said with a cocky smile. One of his arms rose up, and flexed as hard as he could! After a few flexes, the blood began to flow, pumping the massive muscle up even bigger! A large vein throbbed along the top, feeding the already immense muscle. As if that wasn't enough, a nice split peak formed right along the top, which only made Ikkaku's arm look even bigger! As Ichigo could only look up, it felt as if he was looking at a miniature mountain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the flesh beneath Ichigo had began to rumble. As the orange headed teen looked up, he could see Ikkaku's eyes were wide. He must have felt it too! But was it an earthquake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ichigo's eyes went wide, as he felt his blood run cold. Ikkaku was getting even bigger! Before his very eyes, Ikkaku's pecs immediately bloated out further from his chest, each so swollen with muscle that they actually covered the very top of his upper abdomen! Ikkaku's arms were next, and Ichigo could only watch as the once giant hill really did become a mountain of pure, bulging muscle! Ikkaku finally caught wind of this, and began to grin. He looked down at Ichigo, who looked back up just in time to see the cue ball's traps rise up even higher, making Ikkaku look even more intimidating! His shoulder flared outward, making even more room for his already prodigious pecs to grow! Ikkaku's abs tightened and pushed outward now becoming like a canyon of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the ground, Renji winced as he could feel Ikkaku's weight increasing on top of him! In turn, Ikkaku's foot widened and stretched, leaving Renji about the size of an ant compared to the behemoth of a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah... B-Bigger... And bigger...\" Ikkaku groaned, as his hungry fingers trailed down his massive, inflating pecs. Ikkaku's thighs only grew thicker, until the titan of a man would have to waddle to get around! Not like he cared! As gigantic and tall as he was growing, he could cross miles in mere seconds! His rippling calves were easily keeping up with all this, increasing in size until they were easily twice, if not three times the size of Ichigo's house! Right behind Ikkaku, his beautiful, naked ass which was on display for the whole town to see, pushed out another ten sizes until they were massive and bubbly. To top off Ikkaku and his ego, the man's cock grew even bigger! Ichigo could hear a faint \"slap!\" as Ikkaku shifted around a little. Using his free hand, Ikkaku reached down to feel himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Oh... Oh...!\" Ichigo watched as Ikkaku's smile got bigger with each utterance. Clearly the colossal man was loving what he felt! Ikkaku then looked at Ichigo, who froze. \"Heh, there's no way this beast will fit in that tiny little hole of yours!\" He said without shame. Again, his voice boomed over the neighborhood, though no one dared say a thing. Ichigo was speechless. Compared to Ikkaku, he was no bigger than a flea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo just gulped. Once Ikkaku had looked away, the \"hypnosis\" was broken, and Ichigo was able to look away as well. Turning his head to survey the town, Ikkaku took up about a street and a half now! He gulped, as he looked down, down, down to the ground far below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ikkaku said suddenly. Ichigo snapped at attention, looking up at the gargantuan man out of reflex. Ichigo got a slight chill again as he saw a grin on Ikkaku's face. Ikkaku was planning to...</span></div></div>",

This whole day, his emotions had been rising and falling, swirling and roiling within him, not giving him a slow moment to actually stop and think. Now, as he stared up at the god like countenance of Ikkaku, the massive giant's fingers rising up around like buildings, his mind was a blank of nothing but fear. He opened his mouth to ask Ikkaku what he had planned but realized it would be completely futile. Even if Ikkaku could hear him, his voice squeaking out of his insignificant body, it wouldn't change anything. He would still do whatever it was he was going to do. Ichigo merely gulped and waited to see what Ikkaku had planned for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swiped a few more of those pills when those geeks in research and development weren't looking. I'm not about to let you off the hook! You owe me a fucking and I'm going to take it!\" Ikkaku said, his booming voice vibrating inside Ichigo's very rib cage, his whole body shaking from the noise. \"I stashed them inside some pot thing in your living room. Since your house is nothing but a pile of rubble underneath my ass, you'd better hope you can find those pills! Otherwise I'll just have to use you as you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat predatory grin spoke louder than any words. Ichigo knew his body wouldn't survive any kind of sexual encounter Ikkaku had planned for him. Without waiting for any kind of response, Ikkaku lowered his hand to the ground. Ichigo slid off the side of his palm, still needing to fall a few stories before he hit the ground. Ikkaku shifted slightly, the ground shaking and quaking under Ichigo's feet from even this simple movement, unveiling the wreckage of Ichigo's house. Hurriedly, the orange haired teen began to sift through the wreckage. While Ichigo was doing this, Ikkaku tilted his foot slightly and chuckled, scanning the ground for Renji. \"Hey Abarai!\" Ikkaku barked. \"You still alive or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Ikkaku thought he really had accidentally crushed the red haired Soul Reaper. His look of disappointment quickly turned to one of glee as he spotted Renji's miniscule body, not in his foot print like he thought, but plastered against the ball of his foot! Ikkaku chuckled and slowly scraped Renji off, the worn out man flopping hard onto Ikkaku's palm. The mountainous man lifted Renji up to his face and said, \"You really are pathetic! I can't believe you actually thought you could beat me! You couldn't beat my meat at your size!\" Ikkaku's cock twitched, slowly growing harder as he anticipated taking Ichigo's virgin ass for himself. \"But I guess you can try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji felt the hand tip, his body rolling down the nearly vertical wall until he was suddenly free falling, face first, towards Ikkaku's enormous, hardening dick! Before he could so much as scream, he landed on top of the slightly spongy head, his frail body nearly bouncing into Ikkaku's massive slit. Ikkaku's thick hand gripped the base of his cock and slowly started stroking. \"Mmm, oh yeah~ I hope you enjoy your trip up Kurosaki's ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji's blood ran cold as he realized what Ikkaku had planned. Though his body was bruised and so sore he could barely move, Renji started dragging himself to the edge of Ikkaku's head. He had a better chance of survival falling to the pavement below than getting shoved up Ichigo's hole! While Renji tried desperately to escape, Ichigo kicked over a large board and saw the little orange bottle of pills. He snatched them up with relief and popped the top off, looking at the pills inside. They looked exactly the same as the ones Ikkaku had taken earlier before transforming into the titan he now was. Without a second though, Ichigo tilted his head back and poured the pills into his mouth, his throat working as he gulped them down, one by one. Soon, the bottle was empty. Ichigo flung it to the side and waited, his chest rising and falling as his breathing rasped out of his lungs. He didn't have to wait long. He could feel an immense amount of energy building up inside his body, filling him up from the tips of his toes to the ends of his fingers to the top of his head! The effects of the pills quickly surfaced, his chest bulging out against his button down shirt, his shoulders widening at the same time to allow for more growth, his shirt stretching as his back flared out. His sleeves suddenly exploded open, his biceps bulging upward at an alarming pace, the tops of the muscles already splitting at the peak, thick veins running along the tops of them. Ichigo looked at his arms in shock as his abs all pushed out from his body at once, the bottom three buttons popping off immediately, scattering against the ground. He winced as the waistband of his pants cut into his waist, his boxers growing tighter and tighter as well as his cock stretched inch by inch in length and width, his balls swelling in proportion. The seams holding the seat of his pants together burst with a dull popping sound, revealing Ichigo's perfectly shaped ass to the world. His thighs kept up pace with the rest of his body, thickening, bursting through the material of his pants as easily as if they were made of tissue paper. His calves did the same lower down the pant legs, tearing them to shreds as they balled up, thick and hard, swelling bigger and bigger. His feet mangled his socks as his thick toes burst free, the top splitting in half like a rotted husk as Ichigo's manly feet grew larger and larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo felt a grin slowly stretch his lips as his shirt exploded into scraps around his cut torso, his boxers ripping apart shortly thereafter, his naked, sculpted body rising higher and higher into the air as he grew taller. Ichigo was unlike both Renji and Ikkaku. While Ikkaku grew incredibly fast and huge, Renji was growing slowly. How would Ichigo stack up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ikkaku grinned as Ichigo came into his sight. His cock began to twitch a little more, in anticipation on taking his hot, meaty revenge on Ichigo. Not to mention the look of Ichigo's body! The orange headed teen was nothing compared to the bulging, immesurable strength that Ikkaku held, but it was building! The sight of his little fuck toy growing bigger made Ikkaku feel even hotter! He gently grabbed the base of his shaft and gave himself a few good strokes. A little glob of pre-cum shot out of his slit, ejecting Renji off Ikkaku's meat and sending him to the ground! Renji held his breath, not wanting to take a single sip of Ikkaku's juice! The glob soon landed on the streets, but Renji was kept safe inside the liquid bubble that was Ikkaku's pre. He finally managed to land softly on the ground, not too far from Ikkaku's toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIkkaku had kept stroking himself, geting himself ready, but Ichigo was still growing much too slowly! The huge, lustful grin had gradually worn down to a displeased scowl. \"Come on...!\" Ikkaku groaned. \"Did you take all of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took the entire bottle!\" Ichigo shouted back up, his words just barely reaching Ikkaku's ears. Ikkaku just groaned again, louder this time as he was clearly unhappy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... Just fine.\" Ikkaku said, as he finally stopped stroking himself off. \"You know what? I'm just going to ruin this town to let out some stress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Ikkaku, wait!\" Ichigo shouted, holding a hand out in protest. Of course, it was too late. Ikkaku was irritated, and he had to take it out on something! After a little destruction to get the blood pumping, Ichigo was in for the fucking of a lifetime! All Ichigo could do was watch as Ikkaku walked away, those two big, globular ass cheeks rub against each other as he walked away. Ichigo found himself looking at them a little bit longer than he expected!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Ichigo!\" Renji whispered, as he stoo right over Ichigo's shoulder! Ichigo jumped forward, freaked out by the sudden voice! Ichigo's head whipped around, and he barked at Renji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!? What are you doing!?\" Ichigo said rather noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddup!\" Renji hushed, holding his hand over Ichigo's mouth! \"Quiet! I have a plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo took Renji's hand off of his mouth before saying, \"What do you mean? What kind of...\" Ichigo smacked his lips. \"... What was on your hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Er... That's.. Not important.\" Renji replied, \"Don't worry about it. Anyway, are you really about to just let Ikkaku... You know, plow you?\" Renji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well...\" Ichigo looked aside, blushing slightly. He scratched the back of his head before saying, \"I don't have much of a choice! I mean look at him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... He is pretty hot...\" Renjiy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I meant that he's friggin' huge...\" Ichigo replied, noticing that Renji was now blushing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Yeah! That!\" Renji said. \"Whatever! Like I asked, do you want to overthrow him?\" Renji repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How? He's practically five times taller than both of us combined, not to mention that he ten times as thick!\" Ichigo snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Look at you!\" Renji replied, \"See!? You're already taller than I am!\" Renji pointed out. Ichigo was shouldering over Renji, his pumped pecs just barely touching the redhead's chin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Guess I AM getting pretty big!\" Ichigo replied in an arrogant tone. He bouced his pecs, forcing them against Renji's face! Renji took an involantary breath, getting a whiff of Ichigo's musky, pounding pecs! He could feel, even as they pressed against his face, push out even further, filling out Ichigo's already massive physique! Renji's eyes went wide as he noticed that Ichigo was easily twice as buff as Renji was! His heart sank a little as he realized that he really was at the bottom of the food chain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!\" Renji replied, putting his hands on Ichigo's pecs to hold them down! Ichigo had to fight a little twitch he felt in the corner of his cheek. It felt euphoric, each of Renji's fingers slowly trailing down his beefy, round pecs... \"There's no telling how big you're going to get! You might even wind up bigger than Ikkaku is!\" Renji said, still trying to speak softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But didn't he have some kind of reaction?\" Ichigo whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... Yeah...\" Renji replied, finally seeing the flaw in his logic. \"B-But that doesn't mean we can't try!\" Renji insisted, \"Maybe if we work together, we can still pull it off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo huffed a little. \"... Alright, what's your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo nodded as he stood up to his full height. As Renji looked up, he was just under Ichigo's chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you got all this?\" Renji asked, looking up at Ichigo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Ichigo replied confidently, nodding down at Renji! Just like that, the plan was set in motion!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Message from Captain Kurotsuchi of Squad 12.\" A smooth female voice emanated from the fluttering black butterfly in front of Renji Abarai. He had been on his way to breakfast when the Hell Butterfly had floated in front of his line of sight with a message. \"Please report to the Soul Reaper Research and Development Institute at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji sighed as the butterfly quickly flew away. So much for getting something to eat! He changed directions and began to run towards the R&amp;D Institute. The impressive, and slightly imposing, building luckily wasn't too far off. The very second he reached the door, it slowly swung open to reveal a plain looking woman with long black hair tied up in a ponytail standing just inside, her hands clasped in front of her, looking for all the world like a model student. She bowed slightly and said, \"Please follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji was used to Nemu's submissive attitude. She was always soft spoken and polite, her expression always unchanging. \"So...what does Captain Kurotsuchi want with me anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNemu answered without so much as a backward glance. \"I'm terribly sorry, but I can't divulge that information without Captain Kurotsuchi's permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji grumbled to himself, getting more annoyed by the second. He didn't dare raise any objections while Mayuri might have been within hearing distance however. The last thing he needed was to be kidnapped and used in some strange experiment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white halls had an oddly sterile feeling to them. It made Renji slightly uncomfortable. It was like being inside a hospital run by a mad scientist...which actually wasn't too far off from the truth, given Mayuri's disposition. Nemu suddenly stopped in front of a large set of double doors. She easily pushed open the rather heavy looking door and beckoned Renji inside. She didn't follow him, but pulled the door shut as soon as he was over the threshold. The room Renji found himself in was dark, only one area lit up thanks to a massive computer screen. Mayuri could be seen at the base of it, sitting in a strange chair shaped like a crescent moon, his fingers clacking the keys of a rather large keyboard. His eyes were focused, unblinkingly, on the screen. Renji slowly walked towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not take another step!\" Mayuri's sharp voice suddenly shouted out. Renji immediately obeyed, looking over at the strange captain in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why?\" Renji asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I said so that's why!\" Mayuri replied, annoyance clear in his voice. \"Why do you people think it's okay to just wander about willy nilly in my labs?  What do you want anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji glared and shouted, \"Hey! You sent for me! Do you think I want to be here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMayuri sighed and pushed the keyboard away from himself, the lights coming up as the screen went dark. \"Honestly! How is a man supposed to get any honest research done with all these constant interruptions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe beckoned Renji over with a curled finger and walked over to the upper right corner of the room. When the room had been cast in darkness this corner had been completely hidden. However, now that light filled the room, several barrels could clearly be seen there. Mayuri walked over to one and slapped his hand on top of it. \"This is a failed experiment that is doing nothing constructive and is taking up far too much space! I need you to haul it out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?!\" Renji shouted, stomping over to the barrel. \"You've got to be kidding me! This kind of work is for Squad 4! I'm not your damn garbage man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such impertinence! Are you refusing the order of a superior officer?\" Mayuri asked, his expression darkening. \"It's merely one barrel! Don't act as though it is an insurmountable task!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji groaned but grabbed the barrel, hoisting it up onto his shoulder. \"Fine! Whatever! Where do you want me to take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a waste disposal unit at the entrance of the lab. Put it there.\" Mayuri said, waving his hand. He was already losing interest in Renji, heading back to his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crimson haired Soul Reaper quickly headed for the exit. \"If I stick around here much longer I'm going to put my fist through his teeth!\" He thought angrily to himself. He kicked the door open and headed for the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the door was closed again, Mayuri pulled the keyboard back over to him, the screen lighting up as the room darkened once more. With a swift series of keystrokes the screen showed surveillance cameras. A few more, and the entire screen was filled with Renji's form, carrying the barrel. Mayuri's finger hovered over one particular key as he watched the lieutenant make his way out of the building. The second he entered an empty hallway Mayuri pressed the button. With a loud hissing sound the barrel popped open, releasing a cloud of dark green gas into the hallway. Renji yelled out in shock, coughing loudly, the barrel falling with a clatter to the ground. Mayuri's expression remained inscrutable as he watched the gas fill the hallway. Exactly ten seconds later he pressed another button causing a series of air ducts to activate and siphon the gas out of the hallway, leaving it clear again in no time flat. Renji groaned and held his head, feeling his way along the wall with one hand. He was shaking slightly but this didn't seem to bother Mayuri in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" He muttered, pulling up a smaller window within the screen, typing out his observations as he watched Renji leave the lab. Switching off the surveillance screen, Mayuri brought up yet another new window, this one showing a single red dot swiftly leaving the lab. A slightly sinister smile rose to Mayuri's face. \"Let the experiment...begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji's head was swimming. Out in the open air he slowly began to recover, but his relief was quickly replaced by anger. He turned and stared at the facility, his hands clenched into tight fists. He was tempted to run back in there and teach Mayuri a lesson, but he knew that wouldn't solve anything and it might land him in deep trouble. He settled for spitting on the ground and leaving. If he hadn't been so angry, he might have noticed a slight tingling sensation running through his body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just then, Renji's stomach began to rumble. He held onto it tight, wincing as he held his hand to the wall. It took a moment, but he soon recognized this feeling. \"Oh geez...\" He groaned, running off for the bathrooms as fast as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh, man... What the hell was that crap...?\" Renji asked, wiping his mouth as he stood in a random squad's bathrooms. The only thing worse than that smoke going down was the feeling it produced when it was coming back up! Renji proceeded to wash out his mouth with water, doing whatever he could to get the taste out of him. However, the experiment he had was a gas. It had already go to his lungs, and replenished his red blood cells. The more he moved, the faster the toxin would travel throughout his entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenji took another breath, looking at himself in the mirror. He looked a bit ragged from all the sudden rushing. With a bit of cold water, and after re-tying his hair up, however, he looked much better! Back to his usual, good looking self!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he left the bathroom, he saw he ended up in Squad 4's barracks. How ironic... He had just mentioned them... That aside, he wasn't very hungry at the moment. The feel of upchucking didn't exactly make him feel hungry anymore. Trying to move as fast as he could, he made his way back to Squad 6's barracks, not even noticing that he passed Hanatarou Yamada, who had been watching from a corner...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mister Kurotsuchi? Renji just left... Just as you planned...\" The timid boy whispered into the hell butterfly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good...\" Mayuri replied, his eyes still glued to his screen as he kept typing everything that was reported. \"Continue to pursue him. That is, if you want to be rewarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes sir!\" Hanatarou agreed, his demeanor cute and determined as he continued moving on slowly. Hanatarou, in a way, made the perfect ninja. Sure, he was clumsy as ever, but he was excellent at going unnoticed. Kurotsuchi noticed this in him, and, as far as Hanatarou knew, was the reason he chose him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hanatarou pursued Renji, the flaming headed man made his way to the open fields. From what Hanatarou saw, he was out there, swinging his sword about. He must have been training his body. \"Wow... H-He looks pretty scary...\" Hanatarou stammered to himself. Renji didn't appear to be in the best of spirits either, judging by the expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanatarou yawned as he watched. He didn't have a great night of sleep last night. A squad had returned, with typical injuries. It was far from fatal, but it was enough to keep Hanatarou busy until the wee hours of the morning. The boy laid up against the tree, seeing no harm in closing his eyes for just a few seconds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Hanatarou quickly fell asleep, no longer watching Renji. If he had, he would have noticed the changes that was happening in the man's physical appearance...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grimmjow panted as his back was against his bedroom door in Hueco Mundo. They had just finished a meeting of the Espada, where their leader, Aizen, had presented some kind of pill that resulted from their research. Apparently, after studying the hougyoku, Aizen had developed a pill that could take arrancars a step further than they already were! Their power would be nearly limitless, far beyond that of any soul reaper! One could imagine Grimmjow's dismay when he was told that it was far from done, and all they had was a prototype of the pill, and the few who had used it had resulted in gruesome deaths. Grimmjow, on the other hand, was too tempted by such power, and did not fear death. Was it stupidity? Possibly. However all that mattered to Grimmjow was power. As soon as the meeting was over, Grimmjow broke into the labs, and snatched one of the prototypes, leaving no trace behind. Afterward he had sprinted far faster than he had ever ran before back to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow slumped down, sitting down in front of the door. He pulled the tiny purple pill from his jacket, looking at it. Through his heavy breathing, he grinned as he looked down at the pill. This was all or nothing for him, and he liked the odds, slim though they may be. The thought if he was caught didn't even seem to phase him anymore. He popped it into his mouth, and his teeth clamped down on it, shattering it to pieces. He chewed up the remainder, before swallowing it down. There was practically a feral look on his face, like a wild animal, satisfied after tearing through it's hard-earned meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, you piece of crap, get to work!\" He growled, rubbing along the top row of his abs. Grimmjow was willing to have a little patience since he was so tired out, laid there, catching his breath. It didn't take long, but as he laid there, he felt a hunger within him. Which was strange, considering he never really had to each much since he had become an arrancar, but he winced as he now felt the full pangs of being hungry. Not just for anything either. Grimmjow was hungry for souls. Hollow souls, plus souls, human souls, any of them! In frustration he slammed his fist into the wall, making a crater in it's wake, before his nails dragged across the stone wall, leaving more indents. This hunger was going to make him primal again if he didn't feed it! It felt like his stomach was being sucked into itself, he could practically feel his intestines clench with the pain and desire for food. Wasting no more time, Grimmjow shot out of his room, breaking through his window, and running out into the vast, desert wilderness of Hueco Mundo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow ran, on all fours, dashing through the white sands. Luckily for him, he saw a hollow mindlessly moving about. With the speed of a diving falcon, Grimmjow tackled into the helpless creature, his sharp teeth quickly tearing and ripping apart the flesh. With no tact, he gobbled it down, taking bite after bite, as the creature let out a blood-curdling cry as he was helplessly torn apart by this primal beast. Bit by bit, Grimmjow ripped the meat off of this creature, asserting such power over the hollow. With each delicious bite, Grimmjow could feel the pain of starvation begin to vanish. Piece by piece, the creature was no longer animate, leaving Grimmjow to eat at his leisure. Even so, he didn't stop tearing through, leaving him a bloody mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done, having picked the creature clean, down to it's bone, he laid on his back in the sand, letting out a sigh. The pain had subdued. He could still feel the need of hunger deep within him, but for now, the pain was bearable. As he laid there, he didn't even see as his muscles began to expand, as he grew an inch or two taller in the process! His biceps bulked up a bit, adding about a half inch of mass onto his arms, as his pecs pumped out further from his body. His abs, for what they were worth, having a large hole in his stomach, tightened and pushed outward, making the hole just a tiny bit less visible in the process. Under the bottom of his arrancar pants, his thighs grew larger, which was quickly accompanied by his calves. His sandals, which had a little bit of growing room in them previously, was now filled out. Grimmjow's back not only grew taller, but grew wider as well, adding just a little more mass that would make all the difference in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow didn't even notice the small changes. No, in fact, his mind was on what he would do now... He wasn't dead yet, which was a good sign, and now with all the unquestionable power he believed he had now, he finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grimmjow belched as he laid stretched out on the cold sands of Hueco Mundo. The world of Hollows was a dark and dreary world, with no sunlight of any kind shining its warmth down on the desolate landscape. This world was barren and dying. Nothing but Hollows as far as the eye could see, and even they were scarcely visible. Grimmjow had been lucky to find such prime feasting material in so short a time. It might be hours before he found something else worthy of eating. He carelessly rubbed his stomach as he heard it growl again, softly, but insistently. It wouldn't be long before that gnawing, painful hunger returned and when it did he wanted to be near a reliable source of food. The young Espada stared up at the dark sky, his arms behind his head, as he tried to think of a good place to find a lot of food. There were usually roving bands of Adjuchas and Gillians around but ever since Aizen had set up camp in Las Noches, all able bodied hollows had been (and were still being) rounded up to enlist in his army. Grimmjow would be lucky to find even two or three still left. The thought made him scowl. That damn Aizen...he was so smug! Acting like he already ruled the world just because he managed to trick a bunch of stupid Soul Reapers and steal a magic ball! Big deal! There was only man who was going to be king around here and it wasn't that slick haired asshole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow suddenly sat up, a grin on his face. Now that he thought about it, there WAS actually a place where he could get a reliable amount of food for free! Aizen had forbidden them to ever travel to the world of the living unless they were ordered to but Grimmjow had already went against Aizen's word by stealing that experimental drug so why not add to his record before he was caught? He easily jumped to his feet and sliced through reality, opening the door to the world of the living. Getting between there and Hueco Mundo was ridiculously easy, especially for an Arrancar like himself! He had made the trip many times before. The only thing that was different about this trip was his intention. For once he wasn't going to search for a worthy opponent or create mayhem on Aizen's orders. No, this time he wanted only food. And the humans in the world of the living would be the perfect feast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rip in reality stretched across the sky above Karakura Town, unnoticed by all. Grimmjow stepped through and looked around, the rip slowly mending itself as he did so. His eyes fell on a wandering plus soul, a timid looking young man who seemed confused. \"Heh.\" Grimmjow said with a grin. \"A wandering soul, looking so confused. I think I'll give him a hand. Ease his suffering!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach already beginning to roar at the prospect of another meal, Grimmjow dropped to the ground in front of the soul, cornering him in a dark alleyway. The young man jumped, looking fearfully at Grimmjow who was shrouded in shadow, his glowing eyes the only thing he could see clearly. \"W-Who are you? C-Can you help me? I don't know what's going on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow slowly stalked forward, a feral grin on his face. \"Yeah...I can help you. Just watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man turned to run but Grimmjow was too fast. He leaped onto his back and sank his teeth into his neck, ripping the jugular open in a single tug. The man fell to the ground, no blood pouring forth from the wound, just a stream of reishi. It was all the same to Grimmjow. He sucked down the spirit particles until the flow slowed. He then began to rip into the man's incorporeal flesh, his teeth and claws ripping meat from his bones, the bones themselves crunching  as Grimmjow carelessly stepped on the corpse. Grimmjow ripped the man's arm clean from its socket with a sickening squelch, devouring it like a human would devour a chicken leg, going to far as to crack the bones in half and suck out the marrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the soul was gone, resting peacefully...in Grimmjow's belly. The arranacar licked his lips with a satisfied smirk, his hand rubbing his stomach. He once again took no notice as his body stretched another two inches taller, his muscles bulking up one by one, the hole in his abs growing smaller as the muscles around it grew larger and stronger. Grimmjow irritably rolled his shoulder, his jacket feeling tighter on him for some reason. He shoved his hands in his pockets, the material stretching and nearly tearing as he did so. \"Damn human...barely filled me up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was still growling. The Hollow he had eaten had been a better meal than that scrawny human soul! If he wanted something meatier, he was going to have to do better than chasing down Pluses. It was night currently, the perfect time to prowl around town and pick off unwitting humans, devouring them and adding them to the collection already resting in his belly. Grimmjow had eaten a lot of souls to get to his current level but he was always on the look out for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though responding to his thoughts, Grimmjow saw three burly looking men leaving a building together, laughing and carrying on, their faces flushed with drink. Grinning like the wild animal he was, Grimmjow slipped back into the shadows and began to tail them, planning on picking them off one at a time.</span></div></div>",

Just because I can't handle my alcohol like you...\" He replied. The three muscleheads kept walking, not even aware of the impending doom that awaited them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I better get home before--\" One of the men suddenly fell to his knees, before falling forward!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Are you alright man!?\" The two seemed to say in unison. Just then, another one was struck down, an arm that felt like a steel harpoon jot right through his chest! He gasped for a moment, coughing up blood, before falling on top of the first man. The final friend looked up at Grimmjow as he knelt by his friends. His mouth gaping as he wilted before the might of the arrancar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Who are you?\" He managed to choke out. Grimmjow just grinned, licking the crimson blood from his fingers. \"I'm Grimmjow...\" He replied in a hiss-like voice. \"And you... You're dinner!\" Grimmjow suddenly struck, ripping the man's head right off of his shoulders! He could only scream for a moment before everything went black, the body falling onto the pile. Grimmjow just chuckled, and tore the flesh off the man's head as if it was a piece of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... Meaty... Just the way I like 'em!\" Grimmjow smiled. He got down on all fours and began to tear at the first person he knocked out. It was the only body left alive, but not for long! Grimmjow's insatiable appetite drove him on to voraciously rip the man to shreds, splattering blood all along the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grimmjow continued to feast, his body continued to grow! Every piece of meat that slid down his gullet instantly added mass onto his body! His pecs pressed out further, making his jacket feel even tighter. That was nothing compared to how annoyingly tight it felt around his shoulders! His biceps continued to bulk up, stretching the sleeves of his jacket tighter... and tighter... Until a dull rip began to sound. Grimmjow hardly noticed as he ripped another mass of flesh from his victims. His abs started to tighten and bulk up. As they did, his hollow hole shrunk just a little more, and a second row of abs could just barely be seen! Grimmjows legs and calves seemed to swell up in unison, which would give him even greater speed than he already possessed! His feet began to tear through the socks a little, as his sandals had long popped off, unable to contain the growing limb. Grimmjow's ass had become firm and bouncy, whereas his dick had also gone though some enhancements of it's own, gaining at least a good two inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn but a mere half hour, there was nothing left on the ground but a few cracked bones, and a pool of blood. Grimmjow licked his lips, and stretched a little. His immense body had really put a strain on his jacket, ripping it at the seams, while his pants managed to hang in there for this round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow actually felt the pain of hunger vanish from his body. But even he knew that it would only be a few minutes, maybe an hour at most, until he was ravenous and hungry once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow, a 6'2\" arrancar with the build of an ameatuer bodybuilder, was on the hunt, and no one in Karakura Town was safe.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grimmjow reached to pick a little shred of meat that hung from his teeth. \"Huh... I'm really making a mess here...\" He said to himself. \"Better find a way to keep things clean... Don't wanna draw too much attention to myself...\" Grimmjow began to walk away, his lips smacking every now and again in a manner that might annoy some people. Not like he cared. He was making sure he got every little taste down his gullet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Grimmjow headed down the dark streets, he could feel the presence of a few humans here and there. Lucky for them, Grimmjow's bloodlust and hunger was at ease for now... But just then Grimmjow sensed another presence! It was a hollow, scurrying off not to far away! Grimmjow got a devious smile on his face. \"Looks like I just found dessert!\" Grimmjow turned in the direction of the hollow and ran off tword it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for an arrancar like Grimmjow to find a hollow sprinting off! He felt his predator instincts kick in, and he followed it, waiting for just the right moment to pounce! Little did Grimmjow know, he would soon find himself ending up with more than what he bargained for! After only a brief two minutes of following the hollow, it led him directly into it's nest, where two others just like it remained! Grimmjow wasn't about to turn this opportunity down! He swept down, right into the creature's den.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three hollows, who all looked a bit like armadillos, seemed to converse, they suddenly froze as they felt an immense spiritual pressure fall upon them! Grimmjow walked up slowly, the sounds of his footsteps echoing in each of their ears! Grimmjow didn't saw a word. He just licked his chops like the panther he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe armadillo hollows tried to flee, oh how they tried, but no matter how much they struggled, the pressure was just too great for them to escape! Grimmjow plucked up the first one by it's tail, drooling slightly when he saw just how plump it was! He opened his mouth wide, all of his sharp teeth on display. It was the last this the creature saw before it vanished into Grimmjow's mouth! Grimmjow gave a hard gulp, slurping up the tail as he did! He then licked his lips, and let out a quick \"ahhh\" before picking up another!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow decided not to be as greedy with this one. He held it with both hands and stuck the head in his mouth. He ran his tongue over it's face, which made it whimper slightly. Grimmjow just chuckled before shoving it in a little further, letting his tongue wash over it's fat stomach. Grimmjow's head accidentally tipped back, forcing the armadillo to fall right into his throat! A large lump formed before vanishing behind his pumped chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Grimmjow's body, these hollows were pumping him up quite nicely! After just those two, his pecs had pushed out so far that his nipples stuck out on either ends of his open jacket, all perked up. He was clearly getting some kind of thrill out of all this! His abs crunched together and swelled, and the hole in the center vanished a little more, only about the size of a baseball by now! What would happen once the hole vanished!? Grimmjow's arms filled out the sleeves of the jacket, putting a great strain that nearly made them tear! His broadening shoulders didn't help much either! Below the waist, Grimmjow's thighs were filling with power, pressing up against each other, as his calves struggled to keep up! Grimmjow's toes burst through the front of the sandals, finally able to breathe! Back up a little ways, Grimmjow's cock had grown immense and swollen, looking like a thick, long sausage with a dark pink tip! And behind, his ass pushed out a good inch or two, adding onto his already impressive body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final armadillo was the most unfortunate one of all, since he could only watch as Grimmjow grew stronger from eating his friends! It's misery would soon come to an end as Grimmjow then picked him right up! The arrancar shoved the whole thing in his mouth, and kept him there for a moment to just suck on him, enjoying the flavor. A myriad of tastes flowed through his mouth, as his hand dragged across his thick pec. This was a wonderful dessert, he had nearly forgotten what \"food\" tasted like! After just a few minutes, Grimmjow swallowed it down. He released his spiritual pressure, and got the treat of feeling the little creature struggle all the way down into his stomach. In fact, now he could feel all three moving and rumbling around in there! Grimmjow just laughed, giving his stomach a pat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Grimmjow heard a loud growl! He could see that something had blocked out the light of the moon! Without fear, the arrancar turned and saw a giant hollow, who looked very similar to the ones he had just eaten! It didn't seem to pleased about having it's friends swallowed whole for a mere treat! Grimmjow just smiled as he put one of his hands in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You wanna be next!?\" Grimmjow barked at the giant thing. It held it's ground, snarling at Grimmjow. Grimmjow, on the other hand, just shook his head. \"Whatever... It's your funeral!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as Grimmjow was about to charge the massive beast, the hollow quivered, stopping dead in its tracks. Grimmjow could already sense something was wrong, the hollow's spiritual pressure dropping to almost nothing. He growled as he saw a burst of white energy run through the hollow's body, neatly bisecting him, the two halves disappearing in a flash, leaving nothing behind except some broken pavement. Grimmjow stalked forward, looking around for whoever had just done that. He didn't have to look far. Standing on the roof of a nearby building was a young Soul Reaper sheathing his sword. The blue haired Arrancar launched himself into the air, barely having to strain his massive legs to make the jump, landing hard in front of the Soul Reaper, smashing the area around his feet from his sheer weight. Normally Grimmjow was a tall, imposing figure, but since he had started growing he had become even more intimidating. This kid Soul Reaper looked like he was about the same height as Ichigo and he only came up to the bottom of the Arrancar's thick chest, his eyes staring at the top row of Grimmjow's impressive abs. The young Soul Reaper gasped, shocked by the sudden appearance of a new enemy! He gripped the hilt of his sword and unsheathed it again, pointing it at Grimmjow's chest. The Arrancar flashed a feral grin before stepping forward. \"You know, I was pissed you killed my dinner but now I can see a bright side to the situation. How about I test how strong I am now on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Soul Reaper thrust his sword forward, the tip inches from Grimmjow's chest. \"S-Stay back! Don't come any closer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Grimmjow shouted, his spiritual pressure spiking in anger, forcing the Soul Reaper to his knees. \"Don't you fucking talk back to me you little shit! Now listen up! What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy gasped, unable to even lift his head, forced to stare at Grimmjow's thick toes poking out of his socks. \"S-Shou Fujisaki!\" He stammered. This was bad. Very bad! He had only recently graduated from the academy and become an official Soul Reaper. He had gone on four missions so far, all supervised. This was going to be his first on his own. It should have been simple! Go to Karakura Town, eliminate the hollow Arma Dillinger and its cohorts, and return to the Soul Society. He had just been about to open the portal back when Grimmjow had appeared from out of nowhere, a demon in the dark. Shou was easily able to identify the Arrancar Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez, member of Aizen's hollow army. He wasn't supposed to have left Hueco Mundo yet! All of the Soul Society's projections indicated that no Arrancar would move until the entire army did. Everything about this situation was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow grinned and stepped foward, looming over Shou's crouched form. \"Nice name kid. I think I'll call you something a little more appropriate though. How about dinner?\" He licked his lips as he said this, drool dripping from off his teeth and landing on Shou's head like the rain of Hell. The unfortunate Soul Reaper quivered, like a frightened animal in front of a predator. Grimmjow relaxed his spiritual pressure slightly and barked out, \"Stand up! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShou hurried to his feet and gulped, looking up at Grimmjow. Irrationally, he noticed how small Grimmjow's clothes looked on him and almost burst out laughing. He paled at the very thought. If he did that Grimmjow would tear him apart on principal! That thought killed the laughter pretty fast. Grimmjow stepped forward again, now only a few inches away from Shou, the swell of his chest blocking the shorter male from view. \"Yeah...that's where you soul reaper scum below. So far under me I don't even notice you're there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned, stepping back again. \"Now lift up your sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShou did as he was told, aiming the sword at Grimmjow. \"That's right, just like that. Now stab me! Right in the chest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Soul Reaper's mouth dropped open. Was he...serious? Why would he leave himself open to such an attack? As though reading his thoughts, Grimmjow chuckled and said, \"Don't worry, it won't kill me! Just do it! As hard as you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShou took a deep breath and moved forward, jamming his zanpakuto into Grimmjow's chest as hard as he could! The blade struck the harder than steel skin and glanced off, not leaving so much as a mark! Grimmjow laughed and said, \"Yeah, that's about what I thought! Try it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShou was forced to strike Grimmjow's body over and over again in a variety of ways, each blow doing nothing to harm the beastly Arrancar. When he was finally bored, and Shou's arms felt like they were going to fall off, he caught the blade in his hand and snapped it in two. \"Release your zanpakuto and try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Melt the plains and boil the oceans! Daikaji Akuma!\" Shou shouted, his zanpakuto turning into a curved scimitar. With a shout he ran forward, attempting to plunge the blade into Grimmjow's chest, but once again, the blade did nothing to harm the Arrancar. Grimmjow's grin widened as he saw that this kid's zanpakuto, in all forms, was unable to so much as scratch him! The blade began to leave streaks of fire in the air, the flame type zanpakuto doing its best to harm Grimmjow. Unfortunately, he couldn't even singe his clothing! Grimmjow finally got bored and grabbed the blade again, snapping it half. \"Pathetic.\" He said, tossing the now useless metal to the ground. \"You're better off in my belly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Grimmjow smashed his hand down on the Soul Reaper's head, knocking him out, his body crumpling to the ground. Crouching down, he suddenly got an idea. When he was younger, he remembered seeing a snake hollow devour a mouse hollow whole and the process had intrigued him. \"I wonder...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his mouth wide and picked Shou up, shoving his head against his open mouth. Surprisingly, his jaw seemed to unhinge, his body reacting to his desire, allowing the young Soul Reaper to be taken into his mouth! Grimmjow grinned, his thick tongue dousing the young male in saliva, his hair wet down as his head reached the back of Grimmjow's throat, which immediately opened wide to accept him. It was almost comical, watching the ripped Arrancar balance his body, his legs spread wide, with his head tilted back, slowly swallowing the boy whole! A massive lump appeared in his throat as he forced the boy deeper and deeper inside him, his shoulders passing Grimmjow's lips as his head reached the halfway point in his throat! Grimmjow moaned, never having felt anything quite like this before, his throat bulging as he swallowed, hard, over and over again, eating the biggest meal whole he had ever eaten before! Once Shou's head and shoulders and passed into Grimmjow's stomach, the rest of him came easier. Soon, with a loud slurp, Grimmjow had sucked Shou's socked toes into his mouth, giving one last hard swallow, his fingers following Shou's final descent into the hollow's belly. When he was done, Grimmjow let out an enormous belch, grinning down at his now bloated stomach. \"Who would have thought you miserable pieces of shit could taste so good?\"</span></div></div>",

His stomach had begun to gurgle, and as it did, that pregnant lump in his belly was already starting to die down, and in it's place, more mass was being added!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow's height began to increase in small bursts! First a few inches, then a few more until he was a whole foot taller than before! His pecs popped out even further than before, the overgrown muscles unable to be contained any longer by some flimsy jacket! His arms burst forth with new strength, pumping up bigger and bigger, until they were the size of canteloupes! His abs pushed further out and were more defined, all six of them now proudly on display as his former hollow hole looked nothing more than an oversizd naval! Grimmjow let out a grunt, flexing his upper body! His expanding muscles made a huge tear in the back of the jacket that went right down the center! Grimmjow smirked, putting his hands on his hips and stretching his broad back out, making the tear even wider than it already was! Below the belt, Grimmjow's thighs had bulked up, looking as thick as tree trunks! His calves quickly followed behind, filling out with pound after pound of beautiful muscle. His feet finally shredded those tiny socks that dared to hold back such large, powerful feet! Every toe clenched before undulating and growing! His already impressive cock, that would make any man jealous, continued to grow as well, making more than just a sizeable bump in his front! It was in strict competition with his ass, which pushed out further behind him, looking both tight and bouncy at the same time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it didn't stop either! Grimmjow continued to grow bigger, and not just bigger, but stronger! More powerful! His spiritual pressure began to spread throughout the town! As everything slowed to a halt, Grimmow was at least half the height of a street light, and with muscles that made bodybuilders look like kids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow stood tall, his hands on his hip. \"NGH!\" He grunted, flexing every muscle on his huge body! His jacket finally tore in two, as he felt them slide down, but unable to move past his beefy biceps. \"Heh... Pathetic...\" He said, ripping them from his body, and leaving him completely shirtless! His body was reflected off the light above his head. His pecs so huge that they overshadowed his abs! Grimmjow smirked, bouncing each of his heavy pecs, watching each one flex and bunch up at his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow looked over at the lamp post that held the street light high above him! He wrapped his hand around it, his hands just big enough to fit around! With minimal effort, he yanked it right up out of the ground! Grimmjow grinned to himself. \"That guy may have been a runt... But he was a soul reaper... And that just means more power for me!\" He said, taking the pole and bending it! His entire upper body seemed to double in size, his pecs flexing hard, and his biceps surging with power as he bent the pole with ease as if it was rubber! The metal wailed noisily into the night, as he then crumpled it up like paper and tossed it aside, letting it hit the nearby ground with a noisy thud!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow began to walk off, or rather stomp off! Every step he took make the earth quiver and shake beneath his amazing power. A permanent grin was stuck on his face, as he imagined his next meal...</span></div></div>",

It was full to the brim of various cloths and sewing supplies. \"Damn that Uryu! He's going to pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--One Hour Ago--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you already, I didn't do it!\" Ichigo shouted, slamming the fridge closed, a soda in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know better Ichigo!\" Uryu shouted, holding up a crumpled ball of paper. \"You were supposed to bring my homework to me while I was out sick and THIS is all I received!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I dropped off all your assignments in perfect condition! Whatever you did afterward is your problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I ruin my own homework?

If you do, I won't take drastic measures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo snorted, popping open the can of soda. \"Oh yeah? And just what kind of \"drastic measures\" can you possibly do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUryu's glasses seemed to turn opaque as he turned his back on Ichigo, looking out into the living room. \"Yuzu! You like playing dress up with your dolls, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu, who had been watching TV, quickly nodded and said, \"Oh yes! I don't have that many different outfits for them though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it just so happens I know of an all night fabric store. If Ichigo were to go and pick up some supplies for me, I could make some new clothes for your dolls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait..what?\" Ichigo said, nearly choking as he quickly swallowed the soda in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh will you Ichigo? Pretty please? For me?\" Yuzu said, turning the puppy dog eyes on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo glared at Uryu who merely smirked in triumph and said, \"Geez...Fine! Where is the stupid store anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. It's only a few miles away. Shouldn't take you more than half an hour or so.\" Uryu said, thrusting a piece of paper into Ichigo's hands. \"Here's what I need. You WILL be paying for it all yourself of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ichigo! You're the best big brother ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Now--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have known better than to trust him!\" Ichigo muttered, squeezing the bag in his arms slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to turn the corner of the street his house was on, a strange, heavy, ominous presence filled his mind, making him stop dead in his tracks. It was coming from the other side of town and was unlike anything Ichigo had ever felt before. It almost made him shake it was so intense. He ran back to the house, Uryu opening the door as he arrived, a worried look on his face. \"Ichigo! Did you feel--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo slammed the bag of supplies into Uryu's arms and said, \"Stay with Yuzu. Don't leave until I come back. And make sure she stays calm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUryu nodded as Ichigo ran upstairs. He burst into his room, grabbed his substitute Soul Reaper badge and slammed it into his chest, his body falling onto his bed as he leaped out the window, running over the rooftops as he made his way towards the ominous spiritual pressure. It didn't take long for him to find the source. He skidded to a halt, crouching on top of a building, his eyes widening as he saw the monstrous Grimmjow walking down the street. His every step not only caused the ground to quake, but his feet left deep footprints in the solid concrete, indicating just how dense his enormous body was! Ichigo couldn't help but gulp. The beastly Arrancar's spiritual pressure was weighing heavily down on top of him even now, while his attention was focused elsewhere. As Ichigo grabbed his sword, he couldn't stop his hand from shaking, ever so slightly. He steeled himself and unsheathed his sword, jumping down and stabbing Grimmjow directly in the back, his sword piercing the Arrancar's skin and erupting out the front of his chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Is what Ichigo had hoped to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo could only look up in horror as his sword not only failed to pierce Grimmjow but to make any noticeable mark at all! It was like the beast's skin was so dense, not even his hardest slash could hope to penetrate it! Ichigo quickly swung his sword again and again, trying to make any kind of mark on Grimmjow, completely in vain. Ichigo soon was out of breath, his sword smashing into the ground as his arm was too tired to lift it. Slowly, Grimmjow turned around, an evil grin on his face. \"Well, well, well! If it isn't the little Soul Reaper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo grunted as he lifted his sword, smashing the point into Grimmjow's chest! Grimmjow just chuckled darkly and said, \"That all you got? Even what's his name earlier put up more of a fight!\" He grabbed the sword roughly in his huge hand and squeezed, the blade shattering into pieces! Ichigo gaped, stumbling as he tried to move away. Grimmjow leaned down and grabbed him roughly by the front of his robes, lifting him up to his face. A dull growl emanated from Grimmjow's stomach as he stared at Ichigo. He licked his lips, drool already leaking form between his lips. Grimmjow wiped his mouth and said, \"Damn...you look good enough to eat! I wonder if you taste like strawberries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as those words passed Grimmjow's lips, Ichigo began to struggle, kicking against Grimmjow's abs, hoping to do something, anything, to save himself! Unfortunately, Grimmjow didn't budge, even slightly. He opened his mouth wide, wider than Ichigo thought possible, and smashed his other hand into Ichigo, holding him tightly in his grasp! He began to lift Ichigo up to his mouth, his stomach gurgling, demanding more food! Soon, Ichigo's face was firmly planted on Grimmjow's tongue, his head getting soaked in saliva! Just as Ichigo's life began to flash before his eyes, Grimmjow slowly pulled him back out, staring at him again with a small grin on his face. \"No...I think I can make better use of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" Ichigo said quietly, his hear pounding in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't eat you. But in return, you're going to do every damn little thing I tell you to do. As far as you're concerned you're my little bitch from now on. So thank me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said, THANK ME! I'm being more than generous so you better fucking thank me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow's face was inches from Ichigo's own, the look of a feral beast on his face. Ichigo calmly leaned in closer and said, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow looked livid. His grip tightened. But then he let Ichigo drop to the ground. \"Fine...But you know something? I'll bet those little sisters of yours will make a tasty little snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his back on Ichigo and started walking away. Ichigo saw red. He ran forward and jumped onto Grimmjow's back, wrapping his arms around the massive Arrancar's neck, squeezing as hard as he could. \"You leave my sisters alone you freak!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimmjow easily grabbed Ichigo's arm and pulled him off his back, punching him hard in the stomach, knocking all the wind from him. He then let Ichigo drop to the ground, smashing his big foot on top of him, pinning him down. \"Then thank me~ Thank me for being so generous and get ready to be my slave and those two will never have to get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo wanted nothing more than to tear Grimmjow limb from limb, but he knew that wasn't an option. \"T-Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that just won't do.\" Grimmjow said, pinching Ichigo's face between his big and second toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for being so generous!\" Ichigo shouted, trying unsuccessfully to free himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now kiss my foot.\" Grimmjow said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DO IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIchigo winced at the sheer volume of Grimmjow's voice, the giant man's spiritual pressure weighing heavily on top of him. He leaned forward and gave Grimmjow a little peck on the big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, that's good enough for now.\" He let Ichigo up, crouching down next to him. \"Now listen and listen good. You do exactly as I say, your sisters don't need to get hurt. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, first things first...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luffy tilted his head as he gazed up at the hunk of meat sitting on the table in front of him. It was perfectly prepared by Sanji, glistened with juices in the light, and had a tantalizing scent that made the rubber man's mouth fill with a waterfall of saliva. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, Luffy hadn't so much as touched a single bite of the tempting shank in front of him. His mouth was turned down in a slight frown, his eyes seemingly blank and far away. He was clearly thinking about something but what that something was was anyone's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" He said to himself, poking it gently with his finger. He stuck the finger into his mouth and sucked on it pensively for a moment. His eyes lit up when he realized just how amazing it tasted! Without further ado, he threw himself onto the huge chunk of meat and began to rip into it, eager to get the entire thing into his aching belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Several Hours Earlier**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a primal yell, Luffy managed to catch the horns of the oncoming bull like creature, wrestling with it before heaving it over his head, flipping the monstrous animal into a deep pool of water in front of a ruined stone structure. A tremendous wave of water was displaced as the creature sank like a stone to the bottom, dazed and quickly drowning. Luffy threw his arms triumphantly into the air, yelling out in victory as the water cascaded over him, leaving him soaked to the bone, but refreshed and happy. He jogged over to the edge of the pool and looked down into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! This is so cool!\" He said excitedly, noticing that the pool of water was so clear that the excitable captain could see all the way to the very bottom. The creature as not moving, its eyes closed with not even a single bubble rising to the surface. It was clearly dead. Luffy grinned and said, \"Well, you put up a really good fight! But I'm getting pretty hungry and you did attack me first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his arm back and launched it forward, his hand closing into a fist around one of the creature's horns. With a huge pull, he managed to yank the animal out of the water and in a heap next to him. \"Whew! This thing is heavier than I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was about to drag the thing back to the ship when he remembered the reason he had come all the way out here. He was supposed to be looking for water! The four gourds tied to a harness around his chest were a constant reminder of that and yet Luffy <i>still</i> had almost forgot! He quickly began unstrapping them, dunking them into the clear water. Since the pool hadn't made him feel weak, it was clear that there as no sea water in it, making it safe to drink. He filled the four gourds up and then strapped them back into their places on his harness before grabbing the creature's horns again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the...?\" Luffy said to himself. His hands, which had been able to perfectly enclose around the horns, now barely reached halfway around them. \"I guess this guy's bigger than I thought he was!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy happily dragged the animal back to the ship, though it seemed to get progressively harder the longer he did it. It almost seemed as if the animal was getting bigger or heavier as Luffy moved! But that was insane. Nothing like that could ever happen. Still, Luffy was suspicious of it even after he had managed to get it on the ship and everyone (well, everyone who was currently on the Thousand Sunny anyway) praised him for his amazing catch. It was for this reason that Luffy had been reluctant to eat the meat, despite it being a perfect specimen of culinary delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Present Time**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, that was no longer an issue. Luffy had swiftly devoured the meat, leaving nothing but a picked clean bone in his wake. Sighing happily, he leaned back in his creaking chair and rubbed his bulging belly. \"Man that was awesome! I hope Sanji cooks more of this guy fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy belched loudly and heaved himself to his feet, grabbed the bone and tossing it over the edge of the ship. Certain fish would break it open to get at the marrow, something that Luffy was not interested in. His stomach began to churn and gurgle as it worked on breaking down the meat. Luffy had no idea that the water that the creature had swallowed in its panic had physically altered it, making it bigger and stronger even in the throes of its death. The water that now currently was contained in the Going Merry's water supply and which had saturated the creature that was still stored in the kitchen. No one on the Going Merry, however, was any the wiser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luffy headed down to the kitchen to bum more meat off of Sanji (or so he hoped), his body was slowly beginning to undergo a strange and wonderful change.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luffy was walking about the Thousand Sunny, yawning lightly. This afternoon sun was casting it's spell on him, and Luffy wasn't exactly one to refuse! He walked around the deck a little, before taking a shady spot up against a wall. He set his cool hat, which smelled of his hair, over his face, and closed his eyes. It didn't take long for the young man to fall fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luffy slept, his body started to go through small changes. His shoulders spread out wider, his traps bumping up slightly to give him a more intimidating look. His biceps swelled out, becoming round softballs of muscle. His forearms beefed up, giving him unquestionable grip. His pecs started to push out at his red vest putting a slight strain on the first gold button. No one could quite see it, but his abs tightened up and became much more defined and hard. His thighs started to thicken up, filling with muscle, followed by his swollen, taut calves. His feet grew too large for his sandals, the straps handing on for life, as his large toes hung over the edge. Luffy started growing taller and stronger altogether, becoming more imposing and threatening in the process! As if that wasn't enough, Luffy's pride and joy started to spring out, becoming a long, thick 10 inch pole, enough to make any man jealous! All the while, Luffy had a silly little grin on his face, drooling and giggling in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seemed to notice their enlarged captain as he slept soundly, his chest rising and falling slightly as he slept soundly. Luffy got a good two or three hour nap in, but as he slept, Sanji began to cook up more of that strange creature that Luffy it had caught. Looks like it would be the main course tonight! Not to mention he wasn't even cooking it all, there was plenty left! It didn't take long for that mouthwatering scent to reach up, and across Luffy's nose. Luffy laughed again, as that little stream of drool had practically become a gushing waterfall!. Luffy's eyes fluttered open, as he began to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! I'm blind!\" Luffy shouted, flailing his arms around, before realizing his hat was still covering his face. He slid it back up to his hair, and giggled to himself. \"Oops!\" Before he could revel in his moment any longer, that scent soon struck his nose once again! Luffy seemed to float in midair as he was led to the kitchen below the decks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy soon wandered into the kitchen without a sound, hiding behind the table as he peeked over to see if Sanji was done yet. It was astounding he could even move silently. Sanji soon wandered out of the kitchen for a moment, not even noticing Luffy as he walked out! Luffy got up and started heading for the stove, when he heard a click. He looked back at the door, and heard someone speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There... This lock should keep Luffy out...\" Sanji said to himself, before putting the key off and walking away. For him, a slightly burnt dinner was better than no dinner, which is what they would be having if Luffy got inside! Little did the blonde chef know was that the very person he was trying to keep out, he had trapped IN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy grinned to himself. \"Stupid Sanji.\" He said in a playful manner. He then turned his attention back on the meat, which was cooked rare at this point in time. Luffy quickly snatched a slab of it up, the fat still popping from heat. Not even hot to his skin, he tossed it carelessly into his mouth, and started to chew it up, doing his best to rush and enjoy the flavor in equal parts. Getting lost in the rush, he snatched up another slab, and another, eating more than his fair share in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, the grill was cleaned out. The rubber man licked each and every one of his fingers clean, before realizing his deed. \"Aw man, Sanji's gonna yell at me...!\" He groaned. Last thing he wanted was a beating and a lecture. He dashed for the door, and pulled at it. With his new musculature, and his already admirable strength, he easily snapped the door right off! \"Awesome!\" Luffy laughed, unaware of his changes. With that, he dashed out of the kitchen, just managing to escape the wrath of a chef...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luffy was an incredibly strong fighter, a fearless captain, and a man who faced any danger with a smile on his face. However, he was not about to stay and face Sanji's wrath! Especially since they were in the middle of the ocean and Sanji tended to try and toss him overboard whenever he got extremely pissed off. Luffy decided that the best course of action would be to hide until the trouble blew over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy had barely made it down to the end of the hallway when Sanji returned from the bathroom, drying his hands on a towel. He had a satisfied smile on his face, absolutely sure that Luffy wouldn't be able to get into his kitchen and eat all his food like he had a tendency to do. However, his good mood was instantly shattered as he turned the corner and saw the door to the kitchen had been torn off its hinges! His mouth hung open slightly in surprise for a minute or two before an expression of livid anger rose to his face. Running into the kitchen, he immediately saw scraps of meat and bone littering the counter and floor. Clenching his hands into tight fists, Sanji looked up at the ceiling and shouted out, \"LUUUUUUUFFYYYYYY!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy giggled like a child and picked up his speed, heading to the top deck. He remembered there had been empty beer barrels lined up there to be refilled on the next stop at a civilized island. They were the perfect place to hide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji was on a rampage, kicking down doors and tearing through closets, trying to find Luffy as fast as possible so he could teach him a lesson! He kicked down the door to Zoro's bedroom, only to see Zoro relaxing in his hammock, the sun streaming in over his shirtless body. The green haired swordsman cracked one eye open and muttered somewhat sleepily, \"What the hell are you doing in my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zip it moss head!\" Sanji snapped, throwing open the closet door. \"Have you seen Luffy anywhere around here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro groaned and covered his eyes with his arm. \"No, I haven't! Now get the hell out of my room so I can sleep!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji, not paying Zoro anymore attention, left the room at top speed. Zoro sighed and settled himself back down, taking a sip of the water next to his bed. He drifted off to sleep as his hammock sagged down just a bit more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack up on deck, Luffy yanked the top off of one of the barrels and jumped inside, quickly placing the top back on. He snickered to himself as he peered out through a hole, keeping watch in case Sanji arrived. This wasn't the first time he'd hidden away in a barrel. Although...this was the smallest barrel he'd ever hidden in! Luffy's body was slowly growing again, his muscles continuing to expand, putting further strain on his vest and jean shorts, the straps holding his sandals on snapping apart one by one. The straining top button on his vest swiftly popped off, revealing more of Luffy's now much more impressive torso. Luffy, however, was focused solely on the fact that his broadening shoulders were pressed tightly against the sides of the barrel, causing the wood to warp and groan. \"Dammit...Stupid tiny barrel!\" He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden loud *SNAP!* indicated the barrel was breaking apart! Luffy tried to stand up and escape from the now lousy hiding place, but found his body had gotten wedged inside it! This whole situation was starting to annoy him! With a deep breath he puffed his body up, bursting free from the barrel within seconds. He yelled out happily as he was able to stretch again. \"Man! That's much better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was now able to see that his body had grown quite a bit larger from his normal size! His vest was now strained to the second button, the sleeves of his vest torn slightly as his thick arms filled them up. His jean shorts were now much shorter, the fronts of them bulging out with Luffy's package while the back was pulled tight against Luffy's bubble butt. He had a look of wonder on his face as he wiggled his toes, his sandals laying with the remains of the barrel. A big grin stretched across his face as he realized how big  he was! He was taller too, maybe even taller than Zoro! \"I don't know how THIS happened, but I'm not gonna complain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luffy flexed and touched his bigger body, Sanji was still engaged in the chase, his spirit not dampened in the slightest as he moved! He nearly ran smack dab into Franky who had two barrels over each shoulder, lugging them to his room. \"Woah! Where's the fire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen Luffy?!\" Sanji demanded, glaring up at Franky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no. Not since he brought the water and meat back.\" He shifted the barrels slightly and said, \"This water is pretty amazing! It tastes better than anything I've ever had before! I'm going to make some of my special cola with it and see how much more of a kick I can get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji had stopped listening and moved on after he heard Franky say \"No.\" leaving the cyborg to talk to himself. He didn't seem to mind though. He merely chuckled and continued on to his room. He rolled his shoulders as he walked, his shirt and speedo feeling just the slightest bit tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy had eventually gotten bored of feeling his new body and had stopped to stare out over the sea, his arms behind his head and a big smile on his face. The world was such a mysterious place! He was finding new and amazing things every day! He had no idea what had caused his body to grow like it had, but he was definitely enjoying it! He felt heavier, could see farther, and knew that if anyone gave him trouble, his fists would pack more of a punch than ever! He almost wished his growth wouldn't stop, that he could get bigger and bigger, but he couldn't replicate what had caused his growth if he didn't know anything at all about the cause. He shrugged. \"Eh, this is better than nothing!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Sanji was on the manhunt for Luffy, Franky and Zoro were taking a break below the decks. Franky had just arrived back in the bedroom, carrying the water that was stored below. \"Heads up!\" Franky called, tossing a small gourd of the water to Zoro. Zoro caught it without even opening his eyes, and popped the cork out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Franky.\" Zoro replied to the android, before chugging down the water. By the time he took a breath, it was already half gone! He let out a huge breath, smiling. \"MAN! That's the stuff!\" He laughed. There was nothing quite like a relaxing nap and a cold drink! Franky popped open the gourd, and started pouring it into a beaker. With a few other chemicals at hand, he started to cook up some cola! It would take a while, cola had to be carbonated, and carbonation took time. He poured about half, before taking a drink from it. As it traveled past his lips and down his throat, he let out a cool sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that really IS good!\" He smiled. Disregarding the fact he was going to make cola, he started drinking and drinking, until his gourd was sucked dry! \"Wow! That's some amazing stuff!\" He grinned. \"Hey, I'm gonna be right back.... Go get more of the water...\" Franky said, looking over at Zoro. The changes within the swordsman were just started, so Franky couldn't see any difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Zoro replied casually, not really minding what Franky did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make sure Luffy doesn't drink any of this or anything.\" Frank said, pointing at his worktable as he stood, and moved over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh.\" Zoro replied, half paying attention. Franky just chuckled and rolled his eyes before closing the door. Typical Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow unlike the creature Luffy captured, and the meat he had eaten, Zoro got ahold of the water. The direct source of it all! As he laid back in the hammock, his pecs pushed out further, popping open the top of his white vest. His arms started to beef up, the green bandana becoming more tight, before thankfully going loose and falling off. His back stretched out, becoming a powerful wall of muscle, as his pecs pushed out even more! The shirt became tight and almost painful as it tried to wrap around his growing, hunky chest. His abs rose up, becoming a long wall, not stopping at a six-pack, but a long, diamond-hard eight-pack! His legs seemed to pop out with size, first one then the other! His calved quickly followed, as his feet, which were thankfully not in their boots, became huge and powerful! His ass became two large watermelons filled to the brim with hot, sexy, tight muscle! His pants became tighter as well, namely in the front. His already sizable dick filled out and grew thicker, a rod of manliness that would make any person jealous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he laid out in his hammock, he heard a slight tear. He popped an eye open and looked around. He immediately noticed his thick, round pecs right there to greet him. His other eye shot open, as he stared for a moment. His powerful hand reached up and gave his pec a little squeeze. He then saw how huge his hand was, and looked up his arm, all the way past his impressive forearm and bulging bicep! His eyes widened as he then saw that he was still getting bigger! He was in shock, for as he flexed his arm, his sleeve exploded, no longer able to hold back the godly limb! He soon heard that tearing again, and before he could react, he suddenly fell! The hammock could no longer support his powerful, raw weight any longer! He fell, not only bursting through his hammock, but Franky's as well, which was just below him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire boat shook, tilting slightly to the side where Zoro fell. And it didn't stop there, Zoro was still getting bigger! He grinned, now starting to enjoy this amazing feeling of getting huger by the second! His pecs started pushing up against his chin as he had to sit and crouch down to fit in the room! He laughed a little, looking as all his muscles swelled and bulged out, leaving him an unstoppable force of sheer hotness.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Franky hefted the barrel down from his shoulder into the hold of the ship. There was quite a few barrels of that super tasty down here, which was good, because Franky was finding it hard to drink normal water anymore. After sampling the water Luffy had brought back and drinking a few gulps of it, he had decided to save as much of it as possible, using it only to experiment with on his cola formulas. Unfortunately, normal fresh water was just...bland in comparison. No matter how much of it he drank he didn't feel refreshed or satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if Zoro feels the same way?\" He muttered to himself as he laid his hand on top of the barrel. He could hear the water sloshing around inside the barrel, almost taunting him to drink more. He wiped his mouth and turned his back resolutely on the supply. It was too limited to just drink like regular water! He had to be strong and conserve it! He had managed to cross the room, his hand on the knob of the door, before a thought suddenly occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...that island back there was apparently full of water. The only reason Luffy didn't bring back more was because he was the only one hauling it and he thought it was just normal water...If I steered the ship back around, we could all go and bring a ton of it back! That way we'd have enough for drinking like normal water AND I would have plenty for experimenting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made a fist and pumped it into the air! \"Hell yeah! That's a totally SUPER idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the door open and ran as fast as he could for the ship's wheel. He would have the Thousand Sunny turned around and heading back to that island in no time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Franky went to put his plan into action, Zoro had officially grown too big to fit inside his room. Sanji had slammed the door as he left earlier so no one would be able to see inside and no one would be able to get inside either thanks to Zoro's massive tanned foot pressing hard against it. His right arm was curled around over his head while his other leg was tucked under the right one, the one pressed against the door, his head pressing up tight against the ceiling, his pecs pushing up against his chin while his back was causing the wall to bow out alarmingly. Zoro was quite a sight to behold, his muscles more massive than a bodybuilder while his clothes were completely shredded off his body, leaving him in nothing but a criminally tight pair of green briefs. Zoro grunted as he shifted around. He was in an awkward position. He was big and strong enough to easily knock down any normal wall, but the way his body was positioned made it impossible for him to get enough force to properly knock it down. It didn't help that Franky's shipwright skills were superior to any Zoro had ever seen before him. It would have taken multiple strong hits to knock it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wouldn't be so bad if I had least had something to eat or drink in here...\" Zoro thought grumpily to himself. His thick pecs were making it impossible for him to even talk to himself, his jaw forced shut by his own massiveness. \"Maybe I can knock on the wall or something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro shifted around, causing the whole ship to rock back and forth again, until he managed to get his knuckles tight against the wall. He rapped on the wall, hard, a loud echoing knock issuing from where he struck the wall. Unfortunately for him, the sound traveled and echoed around so much that it was impossible to tell where it was coming from. With everyone engaged in their own activities, no one would probably pay too much mind to Zoro. Not to mention strange sounds were pretty normal on this ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro was about to just give up and wait for someone to come, when he felt something tap against one of his fingers. He shifted around again, grabbing the small object in his fingers. He brought it up to his face and grinned at what he saw. It was his bottle of water! And it had some water in it! Without thinking that he could grow just enough to get even more stuck, Zoro popped open the bottle and forced it between his lips, sucking the water up between his teeth and swallowing it. He let the bottle drop and sighed a bit, waiting for what he hoped would be his freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack above deck, Luffy had climbed up into the crow's nest, squeezing himself into the small wooden area around the mast. He barely fit, his muscles making it hard to hide in any small space, but it was so high above the deck he figured Sanji wouldn't bother looking for him. He wasn't afraid of Sanji by any stretch of the imagination, but this was a really fun game to him! He grinned as he looked out over the water, his legs dangling over the edge of the crow's nest, his bubble but taking up most of the space inside it, his arms also dangling out the sides. His weight was a bit much for the very top of the ship, however, and, like Zoro below deck, it was slowly causing the ship to rock a little bit more than was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting himself as comfortable as he could, Luffy put his hat down over his eyes and settled down to take a little nap, not even noticing that his body was slowly starting to grow larger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Franky had managed to turn the ship around, their course set for that island once again! He excitedly burst into the hold and picked up the nearest barrel, ripping the top off of it using his cyborg strength before bringing it up to his lips. He tilted the barrel up and started to chug the water, his throat working as he drank and drank and drank, the ice cold water flooding into his stomach, not a drop wasted. Franky kept guzzling until the barrel was empty. When every last drop had been drained from it, he tossed it aside and wiped his mouth, collapsing on his butt with a sigh. \"Oh man! That tasted soooo good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a massive burp and idly scratched his abs. \"And there's plenty more where that came from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water churned inside Franky's gut, the sheer amount of it taking a long time to process. Franky's growth wouldn't happen right away, but when it did...it was going to be immense! If the Thousand Sunny didn't manage to reach the island by the time it started, it might not survive the trip...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sanji nearly fell over as he was walking on the decks. \"What the hell...!? Did we suddenly change directions?\" Sanji looked up and all around, but he couldn't see anything different all around him. A lot of strange things had happened lately, so Sanji was more than willing to let it slide... That is, until he had spotted something that was especially strange. He slowly walked over, hitting his foot on a lump that had formed on the deck. \"What kind of grass is this...?\" He mumbled to himself. The patch on the tiny hill that had formed was a slightly brighter green than the grass that normally coated the decks of the Thousand Sunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Sanji know, he would come to regret wondering what he did. There was a rumble, then a shake! Suddenly, Zoro burst from below the decks! Sanji was nearly deafened as a loud \"YEAAAAAAH!\" was shouted from the growing man. Sanji was blown back, further and further, as Zoro's head quickly burst through. Then his massive traps burst up through the wood, which was quickly followed by a pair of deep, ballooning pecs. Zoro's rising arms smashed through even more of the deck, as he stopped after merely two rows of his hard abs were revealed. If Sanji hadn't seen it himself, he would have thought Zoro had fallen THROUGH the deck, not rose above it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why am I even thinking that in the first place!?\" Sanji quickly snapped at himself, \"Look at what happened to Zoro! How in the hell did sword boy get so huge!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh!\" Zoro stretched his upper body, his entire musculature flexing, becoming an intimidating sight for Sanji to witness. \"Feels so much better!\" He said to himself, giving his humongous arms a hard flex. \"Heh, forget swords, maybe I should switch to guns!\" He chuckled to himself. Now that he was free, he was proud of how massive he had become, admiring his bulging arms, as well as a thick vein that ran down the side, feeding and engorging his muscles. As he admired himself, he heard a gasping from below him. He looked down and saw Sanji. The chef's jaw had dropped, and he was pointing up at Zoro, eyes wide. This, of course, only made Zoro laugh profusely, his giant pecs bouncing as he did. \"So much for having a rivalry, huh?\" He laughed. His thick fingers reached over and plucked the tiny blonde man up. \"You probably wouldn't even make a good toothpick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, you big lummox!\" Sanji retorted. Barely able to make contanct, Sanji delivered one of his hardest kicks to Zoro's jaw. Zoro's laughing stopped, as he stared at Sanji in surprise. Then a arrogant grin stretched over the swordsman's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again.\" He brought Sanji in closer, letting him have another go. Sanji was more than willing, and kicked even harder now that he had a clear shot. Zoro just laughed it off! \"What the hell was that!? Did a mosquito just bite me?\" Infuriated, Sanji kicked again and again, trying to make an impact, but soon Zoro just started to laugh again. \"N-No, stop! That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji kept up his kicking for a good while, before his legs began to tire out. Here he was, doing all the fighting, but he was the only one getting hurt! Zoro was just too massive to even put a dent in. The behemoth of a swordsman yawned. \"You're not even very fun anymore.\" He said. He held Sanji in an open palm, and slapped him between his pecs. Sanji started to squirm and look around, before Zoro suddenly have his pecs the hardest flex he could! Sanji let out a moan of pain as he was squeezed like a vice between the two massive boulders. \"See? I can dominate you without even trying!\" Zoro squeezed his pecs together again, causing Sanji to scream out. Again and again, Zoro toyed with the chef, laughing as he effortlessly \"battled\" his rival. He soon decided to have mercy, and release Sanji, letting him fall a good nine feet or so to the deck. Sanji turned in midair, landing on his back, winded as he slammed onto the deck. He was forced to look up at Zoro, who just bounced his pecs in arrogance. \"You're just no match for a titan like me anymore.\" Zoro said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji watched, panting, as the mammoth Zoro put his arms down on the deck, and hoisted himself up and out of the tiny room below. The blonde could only watch in horror as Zoro seemed to rise higher and higher. It seemed like what he had seen so far was only the TIP of the iceberg. Zoro must have been at least fifteen, if not twenty-five feet tall! The biggest thing that caught his eye, as it would with any human, was how endowed their new swordsman was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro looked back down at Sanji, and chuckled again. \"What are you doing down there? Looking at my fourth sword?\" Zoro was reminded of how Sanji was always hitting on women, but never seemed to get very far. Zoro hooked his finger out of the corner of his briefs, and pulled back, letting the beast within fall out. \"This what you wanted to see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom high up, Zoro could see Sanji look away. He frowned for a moment, before getting down on his knees, and slammed his monster of a cock down on him, easily pinning the blonde. Zoro's hips wavered back and forth, the musky scent rubbing all over Sanji. \"You see it now? This is why you probably could never get anyone! You don't have a real BEAST like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning the last of his strength, Sanji issued one last kick, which made Zoro's dick fly up for a moment, giving him just enough time to sprint indoors, and hide within the ship. Zoro, not even affected by the kick, dove down, his massive arm and hand searching in the tiny doorway for the chef. \"Hey! Get back here!\" Zoro demanded. Sanji had already made his way below deck, where he lay up against a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man... Just what the hell is going on here...?\" He mumbled to himself. Seeing it safe, he rested up against the wall, and easily fell fast asleep. The hard-working, tortured chef was finally able to take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro sat with his back up against the wall where the door Sanji had escaped was. He closed his eyes, and let out a deep huff. \"Whatever, no big deal... He has to come back up sometime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Zoro too, had fallen fast asleep. Luckily for a few other of the crew members, this was a good thing, because...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zoro snored as he scratched his abs in his sleep, his broad back pressed tightly against the door leading to the lower decks. If Sanji, Franky, or Chopper wanted to get up from down there they were going to have to find another way. Moving Zoro at his new size while he was asleep would be a monumental task no one would be up for. Especially since the cost of waking him up would be drastic for the one doing the waking! However, the green haired swordsman had been asleep for less than five minutes when a loud splintering CRACK! erupted through the air, startling him slightly. His eyes were half opened, still half asleep, when something solid and heavy crashed down on top of him. Luffy had finally fallen out of the crow's nest and had landed head first on top of Zoro's abs. The sheer height of the fall and weight of the growing captain was enough to actually wind Zoro despite his rock hard abs. This, of course, brought him back, rather roughly, to full consciousness. Before Luffy could move a muscle Zoro shoved the smaller man off his body and punched him in the face. Luffy took the hit, his rubber body absorbing the impact, before blinking up at Zoro. He seemed a bit confused as to what was going on before grinning widely at his first mate. \"Hey Zoro! I was wondering what you were doing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so calm you idiot!\" Zoro shouted, punching the top of Luffy's head irritably. Luffy just giggled and stood up, his arms behind his head. \"Wow! And I thought I was getting big! You're super huge Zoro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro rubbed his slightly bruised abs with a sour look on his face, glaring at Luffy. \"Yeah, yeah...you're looking kind of big yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy flexed his arms, his impressive biceps rising up into two powerful mounds of muscle, veins running down the sides of them. \"I know! It's awesome! No idea how it's happening though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro rolled his eyes and said, \"Why am I not surprised?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly got to his feet, wincing slightly as he did. He towered over Luffy, the rubber captain barely managing to reach the lower part of Zoro's abs. Zoro stretched his arms above his head, cracking his neck slightly as he did so. This slight movement was enough to accidentally cause his brief clad bulge to rub gently against Luffy's face. The sudden overwhelming scent of musk filled Luffy's nostrils, causing him to stumble back slightly, a blush running across his face. Zoro glanced down and grinned, rubbing his manly bulge with one thick hand. \"Sorry about that~ Damn thing keeps getting in the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy chuckled a little nervously and said, \"I'll bet..hehehehe...\" There was something in Zoro's expression that he wasn't sure he liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro scratched his chin as he stared down at Luffy. Something had just caught his attention~ \"Hey Luffy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're at just about the right height you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro answered by stepping forward, his package once again pressing up tight against Luffy's face, only this time, Zoro's hand came down and kept Luffy in place. Zoro moaned seductively as he felt his smaller, weaker captain struggling vainly against his manhood. The feeling of power over another human being was even more intoxicating than it had been with Sanji. Luffy would dwarf Sanji at his current height (and probably even Franky at this point) and his muscles were at least double the size of Sanji's, if not more. Being able to keep a puny, normal sized cook under his control was no big deal. But with Luffy...it illustrated just how strong Zoro had become! He was still barely exerting any effort at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of struggling, Luffy eventually stopped, his breathing getting deeper. Zoro slowly removed his hand, an action which prompted Luffy to wrap his arms around the giant swordsman's legs, his hands gripping the tight, muscled cheeks of Zoro's ass, holding himself down against Zoro's package. Zoro chuckled, gently brushing his hands through Luffy's hair. \"That's right little man~ Stay right there where you belong~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words were arrogant, but the tone was soft, caring...seductive. Luffy felt elated, emasculated, and turned on all at once! A flood of emotions that he almost never dealt with. Zoro gently started pulling down his briefs, his bright green pubes slowly becoming visible followed by the base of his thick cock. Luffy shivered  slightly with desire as he saw the monster slowly emerging from its cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a long time since I've gotten any privacy on this damn ship...\" Zoro whispered. \"How about helping me let off some steam? I'll return the favor after you're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy licked his lips, his voice failing him as he considered the possibilities. In answer, he looked up at Zoro and nodded. The swordsman grinned and sat back down, his back once again blocking the door. \"Come on then~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, wearing only boxers himself after his latest growth spurt, stumbled and fell to his knees he was so anxious to get to Zoro. He crawled over and nestled his face down in Zoro's crotch, gently rubbing the shaft with his face. Zoro moaned, leaning his head back, his voice vibrating deeply in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Luffy was about to take Zoro's dick in his mouth, however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Thousand Sunny slowly pulled back onto the sands of the strange island. Franky, with an eager look on his face, ran directly ashore. Franky stretched out a little, grinning happily. \"Alright! Time to find some of that SUPER water!\" He shouted happily. He dashed off, and started heading into the jungle, only to stop as he suddenly heard a snap from behind him! It sounded like wood breaking! Franky whipped around, looking behind him. \"... Huh... The crow's nest broke...\" He mumbled. \"Ah, I'll fix it when I get back!\" He decided, as he continued to run out into the wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sand beneath his feet quickly became leaves and plants as Franky dashed throught the jungle looking for water. Any water! He ran along a path that had formed when something was dragged through this area... Maybe it was that boar creature that Luffy had brought along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, he couldn't help in noticing how overgrown all the plants were all around the path he was running! And they only seemed to be even more out of control as he went on! \"Geez, what's making these things get so big...?\" As Franky uttered this, the water was already starting to take an effect on him. As he scratched his muscled ass, his blue speedo felt like it was digging into his skin. The feel made the young shipwright wince a little, but he wasn't going to go nude just yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Franky came across a waterfall, where the mouth of the river began. He smiled triumphantly as he squatted down and cupped some of the water into his hands. Although, by now, it wasn't just a little cup he had taken, but practically a jar sized gulp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUPER!\" Franky shouted happily, \"This is just the stuff I was looking for!\" Franky ditched his speedo and his hawaiian shirt and set it on the side of the water. Throwing caution to the wind, he dove into the waters, taking large, healthy gulps of it as he did. At first he did nothing but drink, and drink, and drink! There was some kind of taste to the water that just made it that much more addicting than normal water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the large android finished his drink, the whole water level must have went down by an inch! Now that was an extreme thirst! Franky's stomach bulged out slightly, filled to the brim with delicious water. He laid on his back and began to do a dead man's float, taking idle sips here and there as he swam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, now THIS is one super paradise!\" He chuckled to himself, swimming here and there so he wouldn't get washed down the stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he floated along, his barrel drink earlier had started to take effect. Thankfully he was nude this time. His pecs began to push out from his chest, swelling into two large, plump watermelons. Gently the shook as the titan laid in the water. His biceps pumped up, veins pulsing and rushing to deliver the new mass to his already admirable guns. With his traps swelling just under his head, it was almost as if a life raft was inflating under the gargantuan man. His abs tightened and squeezed together, giving him an impressive eight-pack, hard enough to crush rocks! His back exploded in size, filling out his frame and making him that much more intimidating. Franky just sighed happily, unaware as his thighs bulged out obscenely, huge enough to bend metal to their will, as his throbbing calves swelled up large enough to hold up the behemoth when he stood. His already large feet grew even bigger, toes flexing and undulating as he laid out in the water. Every step he would take would leave a crater in the earth, and shake all the trees around him. To add icing to the cake, Franky's manhood began stretching out, growing into a thick, fleshy, thirteen and a half inch log that could make any man jealous, topped by a soft, pink, musky head that was begging for even the tiniest lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of Franky's body grew into proportion, leaving him a colossus of muscle. And still, he laid there, continuing to idly drink the precious nectar. He yawned, his hand grabbing his meaty pec. He chuckled as he could feel as there was just a little bit of hair around his tan, suckable nipple. The pulsating flesh was tender and much too large for just one of Franky's hands to hold. Franky just grinned happily. He ran his hand slowly down his rippling abs, each bump a powerful, hard tiny mountain on his godly physique. His arms were hulking and huge, the muscles bulging and throbbing as the growth slowed up. The muscles bunched up and tightened, nearly reaching half the size of beach balls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, the water flowed into his mouth, feeding his soon-to-be growing body...</span></div></div>",

Hurry up!\" Luffy cheered, running off the Thousand Sunny and onto the island. \"I wanna explore this place more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. He ignored the gangplank and stepped from ship to island in one step of his massive legs. He looked around and scratched idly at his crotch. \"Yeah, yeah, I know.\" He gazed around the island and felt strangely...normal. The plant life here was much larger than normal (as Franky discovered) which made it about normal sized to Zoro. He smirked a little and walked after Luffy. Even though his captain was running full speed, Zoro was able to stroll along at his own pace thanks to his much longer legs. They walked along in relative silence for awhile before Luffy said, \"Hey Zoro? What do you think this place is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Zoro had been daydreaming about fighting in a tournament against other swordsman. He was, of course, able to trounce any opponent that dared raise a blade against him. His skin was like armor. Nothing would be able to penetrate it! He forced himself to come out of his daydream and pay attention to Luffy. \"How should I know? It's an island with a lot of really big plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And animals!\" Luffy said, arms behind his head. \"Remember that boar I brought back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro nodded and said, \"Right, and animals too...Hey...that water that made us grow is from this island!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy blinked a bit before grinning widely. \"Yeah! You're right! Awesome! I remember where it is too! Let's get some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro was hesitant at first. What if they got too big to fit inside the Thousand Sunny? They would be stranded here! Then again...he imagined himself standing thousands of feet tall,  his muscles bulging to extreme sizes, the ocean's deepest water barely licking his ankles, his body proudly displayed, no clothing able to fit him. He grinned and said, \"Get more huh? Yeah, that sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy took off like greased lightning, even Zoro picking up his pace to get to where the miracle water was located. Luffy, scatterbrained as ever, couldn't remember where he had found it. Zoro was quickly getting frustrated with his lack of a sense of direction...which was ironic since his own sense of direction was incredibly poor. After about fifteen minutes of wandering, they finally decided to rest in a clearing. Luffy flopped onto his back, groaning in frustration while Zoro sat down on a sizable boulder (though it was only the size of a large rock to him) his chest glistening with sweat. \"Man! This stupid island is too big!' Luffy complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro wiped his forehead off and said, \"We should have had some more water before we left! If we could see above the trees we'd be able to find that water in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy sat up, his feet pressed sole to sole, and looked up at Zoro. \"That would be pretty cool! How big do you want to get anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat image of himself as a towering titan came back into Zoro's head before he said, \"Big enough. What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy grinned and spread his arms out. \"The King of the Pirates has to look awesome! I'm going to be the biggest out of everyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro raised an eyebrow and said, \"Yeah, we'll see. The number one swordsman in the world has to look awesome too you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy crossed his arms and frowned. \"Nah, you can't be bigger than the captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro laughed and stood up, his body towering over Luffy. \"Yeah? I already AM bigger than the captain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy stood up and pouted. \"Yeah well...I'll GET bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro ruffled Luffy's hair and said, \"We'll see if I let you catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Luffy could respond, Zoro wrapped his arm around Luffy's chest, lifting him up into the air, pinning him against his body, his arms forced down at his sides. Zoro could carry him around as easily as a toy! \"Now we're going to go MY way for awhile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy sulked, but didn't say anything. There wasn't much else he could do. Zoro picked a direction at random and began walking, his big manly feet leaving deep prints wherever they landed. Smaller trees, shrubbery, grass, flowers, anything that strayed into his path was either carelessly brushed aside or crushed under foot. Zoro was too busy looking around for the water to notice trivial things getting in his way. Luffy grimaced as he felt the sweat on Zoro's chest landing on his back. Soon, both men were quite slick and shiny looking. Zoro managed to reach the top of a hill before sighing and stopping again. \"Dammit...I swear we've been over this whole island!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy snickered and said, \"Now who's a big idiot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro squeezed Luffy, cutting short the laughter. \"Shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have said more, but the ground suddenly began to shake violently. Both men looked around them, wondering what was going on. The ground started shaking again, more violently this time! Zoro dropped Luffy and groped around his waistband before remembering that his swords, now far too small for him to use, were still on the Thousand Sunny. Improvising, he held his arms as though they were his swords, ready for whatever might come his way. Luffy, likewise, was crouched down in a battle position, his eyes hard and wary as he looked around. Neither of them were expecting what happened next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground, which had been shaking on and off for the last few minutes, suddenly began to shake consistently, great chunks of land dividing and falling down the hill, revealing a strange, pinkish ground underneath all the dirt! Strange wiry trees seemed to sprout up all around them, knocking other trees over as the \"hill\" rose up underneath them, bursting through the ground. Zoro and Luffy both crouched down, the soft pink ground underneath them offering no hand support. Thinking fast, they grabbed onto one of the strange trees that surrounded them and held on tight. A low rumbling sound filled the air around them, causing the ground to vibrate, the entire hill moving from vertical to horizontal, the trees now the only means by which Luffy and Zoro were not falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing out over the landscape, both men saw the ground of the island breaking apart, revealing more of the strange pink ground all around them. A sizable portion of the island was being destroyed by a massive...something coming out from the ground! Something about this pinkish land seemed familiar... Suddenly, it struck Zoro. This was some kind of enormous person! Down by the Thousand Sunny he could clearly see something that looked like a foot, the big toe hovering over the Sunny, able to crush it easily if the owner of the toe so desired. Further up his (Zoro could tell the body belonged to a man, thanks to the musculature and hair and the overall shape) leg had demolished a large portion of the forest. His crotch was still being covered by land, though how long it would last was anyone's guess. Zoro's eyes traveled up the enormous ab muscles, each brick powerful enough to smash a fleet of ships between them, and finally figured out where they were. They were on the enormous nipple of the giant, the wiry tree they were clinging to a single hair around the nipple. Looking up, Zoro couldn't even begin to see over the swell of this man's pecs. His identity would remain a secret to them it seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky yawned, stretching his arms. \"Oh man! I must have dozed off in that pool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smacked his lips and looked around. There was some kind of weird grass here now...how strange! \"I wonder where the water went...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scratched his head, getting even more confused as he looked. Nothing seemed right! Everything had changed while he was asleep! \"Maybe I got kidnapped and dropped somewhere?\" It was possible. This island WAS much smaller than the one he had been on. He got to his feet, brushing off a few specks of dust, and started looking around.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Franky, as he stood, was nearly the size of a large volcano! His herculean physique towered far above the trees, and every footstep he took shook the land, birds fleeing in fear with every step he took. \"Ugh, what's with all these flies!?\" Franky growled, swatting at the birds. Zoro and Luffy, once more, had to hang on for dear life to the nipple hairs of the titanic Franky. Franky didn't even seem to notice or feel as a mini-giant held onto him. The muscle of his pecs were just that powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky kept looking around, trying to find out where he was. \"This is so weird... How could I have got kidnapped in my sleep? This grass feels so weird too...\" He mumbled, wiggling his toes. Countless trees and rocks were crushed under his mighty limbs. It was at this point he saw a toy boat at the shore and starting making his way to it. It was only a matter of seconds, but he smiled happily to himself as he picked the boat up in his hand. The crew on the boat shouted as they suddenly felt themselves shaken out of control! \"Aw... Some kid lost his toy boat...\" Franky said, his large finger poking around at it. \"Hey, wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky's giant finger ran across the grassy deck, the familiar trees on the stern, and how could he forget the lion head at the bow!? Franky's face turned to one of shock as he looked back down at the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Franky ran his hand down one of his bulging pecs, thankfully not the one Zoro and Luffy were on. Although some trouble was about to head their way. \"Check me out!\" Franky started to bounce his pecs as he looked down at them. The captain and swordsman shouted with fright as they were suddenly shaking up and down. \"I'm huge! Ha ha! Did that water do all this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at this moment, Zoro looked down. Below, there was the vast ocean, and it was just a hop, skip, and a jump back to shore! Disregarding any consequences, Zoro turned to Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Luffy!\" Zoro shouted out. Luffy looked over at the moss head. \"I'm going to jump down! Then you jump, and I'll catch you and swim to shore!\" Luffy was a bit surprised, but at this point, Luffy had trust in Zoro. He nodded confidently. After that, Zoro gulped, and let go! He fell quite a distance, before making a splash in the water. He resurfaced, half-surprised he was able to stand in the water and still touch the ground! Luffy had watched the whole thing, and was now looking down himself. He gulped. Sea water. His mortal enemy. Giving caution to the wind, he took the leap of faith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro was watching intently from below. As soon as he spotted Luffy in the air, he adjusted himself. Luffy soon landed, making a bit of a splash, but Zoro immediately plucked him out, carrying him in his arms. Luffy had already started to go useless, having touched the water. Zoro couldn't help but chuckle. He was always kind of cute in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good thing Zoro had got out of the water when he did! Seconds later, the Thousand Sunny was roughly put back in the water, a wave nearly pushing Zoro forward onto shore. Looking up for a moment at Franky, Zoro made his way back ashore and set back out in the jungle. That water had to be somewhere...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky, in the meantime, was laughing happily, running his hands down his body. \"Oho, what's this?\" He asked with a slight blush. His hands rubbed right over his thick cock, a hard vein running along the top of it. Franky chuckled to himself, taking his hand off. \"Nah... We're gonna save that for later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting to business, Franky hefted his arms up, looking at his biceps as he slowly flexed them. They popped up gradually, the muscle practically growing once more before the android's eyes. They quickly became a large mound. Franky flexed them again and again, making them nice and huge, with his veins running all down them, pulsing strongly. Franky then stopped, and put his fists together. He then ran them up under his sternum, and pushed up until his godly pecs were pressed right into his chin. He grinned down at them, before giving them a hard lick along the top. He flexed and bounced them, before giving them another long lick that spanned across both pecs. Chuckling, Franky let his pecs go and fell back, causing a huge earthquake for the whole island, making a crater where his bulgy, tight ass sat. Up front, his cock laid out, crushing all flora beneath it. This just made Franky laugh even more. He rubbed his large hands over his hairy legs, smiling all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am one hunk of man...\" He mumbled to himself. \"Not only do I have the SUPER body to prove it, just look at this hair! A real man is hairy!\" He laughed. \"Then again...\" Franky grabbed his immense cock in his hands. \"Doesn't hurt to have a SUPER tool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky let out a sigh, feeling unstoppable at this point. It was at this point...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Franky was now a permanent fixture on the island. No matter where you stood on it, his body was in some way visible. His deep, manly voice was also heard all around the island as he moaned and felt his body, his cock twitching, thrashing side to side like an angry anaconda. The titanic cyborg was like a natural disaster, his every movement able to cause disaster for the whole island. For the comparatively tiny captain and swordsman scurrying around on the island like fleas, this was a war zone. Several times Zoro barely managed to dodge as Franky shifted minutely, sending shock waves through the entire island, the ground starting to split and crumble under his tonnage. Luffy was fairing even worse, his smaller body getting flung about by the quakes. Franky was completely unaware of all of this. He was too focused on playing with his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy suddenly jumped onto Zoro's back, forcing the massive swordsman down to the ground as Franky's enormous foot passed over them, the toes landing a few feet in front of them. Zoro struggled back to his feet and ran towards them, getting between two of the mountainous digits before it shifted again. Zoro barely managed to dodge the huge hairy leg that landed in its place. \"This is getting ridiculous! We need to find that water! Now!\" Zoro shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, still clinging to Zoro's back, pointed ahead. \"Look! I see something over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro looked and ran towards where Luffy was pointing. It didn't take long for Sanji and Chopper to come into focus, both men holding onto a tree for dear life. Sanji glared up at Zoro and Luffy before shouting, \"What the hell is going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time to explain!\" Zoro said shortly, grabbing Sanji and Chopper like they were toys. \"We need to find the water that did all this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Water did this?\" Sanji said incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" Chopper shouted, pressing his hooves against his cheeks. \"I've heard of this stuff before! This is the Gigant Island! The water on this island is pumped up from deep below the earth's crust and is enriched with so many vitamins, minerals, and other healthy components that it vastly speeds up growth! The more you drink, the bigger you get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji groaned and said, \"And you three idiots have been guzzling the stuff haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro smirked and said, \"Jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji kicked Zoro's chest ineffectually before Zoro was knocked to the ground by a particularly vicious quake. A deep moan vibrated inside of their bodies as Franky began to fondle himself, his head tilting back, his gigantic chest heaving as his breathing rate increased. Luffy pointed up and said, \"We have to make sure we're not anywhere near that thing when he's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro changed direction and ran as fast as he could, trying to put distance between them and the enormous cock. Chopper perked up after they had run about one hundred feet, his nose moving as he sniffed the air. \"Hey! I smell water! Fresh water!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy grinned and said, \"That's it! That's the stuff! Where is it Chopper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little reindeer pointed and said, \"Over there! I'm positive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro changed direction once more, following Chopper's extended hoof. The area started looking familiar to Luffy. They were definitely headed in the right direction! Soon, the crystal clear pool was in front of them! It looked ravaged, the land around it utterly decimated. When Franky had grown, while he was still in the lake, his body had become progressively heavier until he sank down to the bottom. This had caused his body to bury itself under the island as he grew which also had the side effect of spreading the lake's water out over a greater area. Zoro kept a tight grip on Sanji and Chopper while Luffy jumped down to the ground. Before he could race over to the water and start drinking, Zoro pressed his foot down on Luffy's back, pinning him in place. \"Listen up! I'm getting the first drink whether you three like it or not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji and Luffy immediately began to protest which Zoro promptly ignored. He crouched down, pressing his hands against the ground, pinning Sanji and Chopper down in the same manner as Luffy. He didn't worry about how much pressure his foot was putting on Luffy. The man's rubber body would ensure his safety. Zoro put his mouth into the water and began to drink, gulping down gallon after gallon of the water, filling his belly to the brim and then drinking even more! He kept gulping until he had grown a little pot belly, his body unable to take in any more water. Zoro let out a tremendous belch and stood up, wiping his lips. \"That hit the spot! You three can do whatever the hell you want now. I've got my share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro rubbed his belly happily, heading for a nice, safe, quiet place to take a nap. It would be awhile before his growth kicked in, but it was going to be quite an event when it happened! Chopper, Sanji, and Luffy all looked at each other, wondering what the other was going to do. Chopper was way too scared to make a move, and immediately fled, heading back to the Sunny. At least there he would be relatively safe! Luffy grinned over at Sanji before heading for the water, intending to drink. Sanji, still pissed off at Luffy for what he had done earlier (not to mention being the cause of all this trouble), ran forward and jump kicked the rubber man in the face. Despite his size and resistance to blunt attacks, the kick still caught Luffy off guard. He glared at Sanji who dropped down onto his hands and knees and began to drink as much water as he could. \"Hey!\" Luffy shouted, grabbing the cook roughly by the back of the neck before tossing Sanji into the forest. \"I'm going to have to teach you a lesson about the chain of command!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked his knuckles and, forgetting about the water for now, began to hunt down Sanji who ran off, trying to keep the distance between them until he grew.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Under normal circumstances, no normal human Sanji's size would have been able to outrun the mighty Luffy. Thankfully for Sanji, he wasn't exactly a normal human. All the training he had done on his legs, every kick, every exercise, was really paying off now! Sanji was able to take large lunges that put him at a speed just a few notches faster than Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, in the meantime, was chasing after Sanji like a wild ape. He tore through the jungle, chasing and knocking over anything that happened to be in his way. Sanji had intended to punish the rubber man, but now the glove was on the other hand! Luffy grinned as he began to think of all the ways he was going to remind Sanji just where he stood on this little crew of theirs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the water, Chopper emerged from the surrounding jungle once more. \"What!?\" He cried as he looked down and saw that he got absolutely nowhere! He had walked in a complete circle! He held his little head, starting to freak out. \"But I know I went the right way! I know I did! I followed the scent of the ocean!\" He cried out. He then let out a little groan. \"O-Ocean...\" He looked down at the stream. His tongue ran along his lips, a dry gasp escaping his lips. \"Water...\" He cried out in a raspy breath. Taking a look left and right, he made his way over to the stream. No one had to know that he took a drink... And he felt SO thirsty... Just then there was a loud rumble that made him shriek! \"I surrender!\" He shouted out, lifting his hooves to the sky. When he looked around, he realized it was just Franky, who had shifted around again. Chopper let out a sigh, and resumed his business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, slowly he bent down to the water, feeling the cool liquid run under his lips. That alone would have been enough to satisfy him, but before he knew it, he lost himself, taking gulp after gulp of the irresistible ambrosia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the chase between captain and chef continued. \"Get back here Sanji!\" Luffy shouted. \"I'm gonna squeeze you in these huge arms, and then I'm gonna rub you between my huge feet!\" He threatened, laughing as he visualized just how sweet revenge would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji let out a sudden gasp as he ran. He was already starting to pant, but this sudden rush of breath was different, he could feel it! To prove him right, he could feel as his pants were starting to get tight around his calves. Next were his thighs, which were already swollen and red from all the running. But with this shock of energy, he could feel strength returning to them! He chuckled, starting to get addicted to the feeling of growing huge. Just the way he'd like it. He'd become massive, godly! The mere sight of his massive, burly physique could have the ability to make all the people of the world fall to their knees and juice their pants. Yeah... He was liking the sound of that! Just then his fantasy was broken as he could feel his pecs starting to burst forth with mass, popping open the button of the blue button-up shirt he wore under his suit. His tie was starting to feel tight around his expanding neck, as his shoulders and back began to flare outward! Sanji's height was taking huge jumps, gaining nearly half a foot with every few seconds that passed! His large, yet surprisingly tender feet had begun to break free from his boots, leaving him a barefoot giant, tromping through the forest. Sanji's gargantuan biceps had long exploded out of the sleeves, making him look like he was wearing a vest instead of a suit! Long, thick veins ran underneath that pulsed with even the slightest flex of his arms. His deep pecs were inflating like air bags, pushing their way out, as the remains of his clothes became quite unfit for wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah... That's right...!\" Sanji uttered. He was surprised at how deep his voice had suddenly gotten! It was guttural... Sultry... The kind of voice that could scare and arouse at the same time! Sanji's abs popped outward like bricks being laid into place, creating a hard wall of muscle! Then came two parts that really brought a grin to his face. First, his already fine ass started to bulge outward, growing fat with tight muscle, the kind of ass that bounced with every step! Finally, Sanji's manhood had burst forth, greater and larger than he could have ever hoped! It must have been at least fourteen inches, and it was only flaccid! The chef's heart skipped a beat as he imagined the size of that beast once it came to head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point Sanji stopped running, and decided to hide instead. He would have a nice little surprise for when Luffy came by...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere seconds, Luffy soon ran past, which was Sanji's trigger! From behind, he tackled into Luffy, pinning his limbs down and looking at him. \"Hey there, captain.\" Sanji said in a menacing manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanji!? Hey, no fair! You weren't supposed to get bigger than me!\" Luffy argued, a big scowl on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy, it's about time you owned up to your punishment!\" Sanji demanded. Luffy violently shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh, I'm the captain, and I'm not gonna be stopped by you!\" The stubborn captain replied. Sanji just grinned. Those were the exact words he was hoping to hear. He crouched down like a frog, and sprung up. Luffy was too in shock to move! Sanji shortly began to fall, and slammed down on Luffy, letting his fully weight crunch down on top of Luffy. The rubber boy let out a gasp of air, unable to move the titanic mass of muscle above him. Sanji just chuckled to himself, and rubbed his thick pecs slowly across Luffy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You feel those? That's what a man's chest feels like!\" Sanji said with a grin. He pressed his forehead to Luffy's, and pressed his chest on top of his captain's. \"See that? Those flat pancakes you call a chest can't even compare to THESE gargantuan melons!\" He smiled, getting up and straddling Luffy. He gave the throbbing muscles a long, slow bounce. He grinned down at Luffy, who he saw was just staring up at him. \"Heh, I can see it in your eyes! You want these, don't you?\" Sanji smiled, getting down lower. He held onto Luffy's hand, rubbing it all over his pec. A bead of sweat went down Luffy's forehead as he rubbed along the pec. It almost felt like that muscle alone could crush his hand! He could barely even get a hold on it! Sanji just wore a cocky smirk as he looked down at Luffy. He had him in his clutches... Or so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Luffy suddenly grabbed Sanji's nipple and gave it a fierce twist! Sanji let out a loud yell, falling off of Luffy in the process! Luffy immediately got up and sprinted off, wanting to get back to the water as soon as he could!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luffy was giggling childishly as he ran as fast as he could back through the forest towards the water. He wanted to make sure he had a head start when Sanji finally recovered and began to give chase. The chef was still clutching at his thick pec, the nipple feeling sore and chafed. Luffy must have either practiced that at some point in his life or had it done to him so many times he could easily replicate the technique because it was the fiercest twist that Sanji had ever experienced. By the time he had recovered and sprang back up to his feet, Luffy was already gone. With a frustrated growl, Sanji ran as fast as he could back the way he had run before. Luffy may have been huge and fast, but Sanji was even bigger and his legs were already stronger, giving him far more speed than Luffy could hope to match! It wouldn't take long for him to catch up to his childish captain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was luckily able to follow the path of destruction he had caused when he had initially chased Sanji or else he probably would have ended up lost. After about ten minutes of running, he finally broke free from the tree coverage and found himself back at the destroyed pond. Franky's enormous body, stretching into the sky, was a constant scenic accessory to the island now, something Luffy had already gotten used to seeing no matter where he was, but his constant shifting was starting to cause issues. He had already, without meaning to, scooped up Zoro between his toes and deposited his sleeping form quite a ways away on the other side of the island, had destroyed a good portion of the forest, and had decimated the ground, salt water starting to seep up through the tremendous cracks he was making. If he wasn't careful, the whole island would soon sink! There was no telling what kind of damage could be done if the magic water was allowed to spread into the ocean. However, none of this was any concern to Luffy. He barely even noticed Chopper, dead asleep next to the pond, his furry belly distended with so much water he looked like a hairy little water balloon. It seemed like mass drinking of the water induced sleep, possibly in order to prepare the body for the monumental growth that would follow. Luffy rubbed his hands together with a grin on his face as he fell to his knees, ready to drink the water. Before he could take so much as a sip, however, he heard a tremendous crashing sound issuing form the forest. He looked over his shoulder and saw Sanji barreling towards him, a livid expression on his face. Luffy, moving fast, pursed his lips and began to drink the water. He had only managed a few swallows before Sanji grabbed him by the collar, hoisting him into the air. \"Got you! Now it's payback time for that nipple twist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy responded by belching in Sanji's face. \"I'd like to see you try!\" He cockily announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, with pleasure!\" Sanji retorted, dropping Luffy before leveling a kick at his abs. The kick hit Luffy like a ton of bricks, knocking the wind out of him and throwing him back into the forest. Sanji laughed and charged after him, wanting to punish him some more, only to be met with a rather rude surprise. Luffy stepped out from the dense foliage, the ground shaking with his every step, his clothes now completely shredded off his body save for a tight pair of underwear, and his body standing head, shoulders, chest, and abs above Sanji! The young chef gaped as Luffy walked up to him, a grin on his face, his muscles bulging obscenely out from his body. He cracked his knuckles and said, \"What were you saying before about a MAN'S chest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji turned to run but was yanked back by Luffy's meaty fist, his body pulled into a tight bear hug, the pillowy pecs shoved into his face. \"This is what you meant right? These thick slabs of muscle just busting with power?! Look! I can hold you in place just by flexing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy put his arms behind his head, squeezing his pecs together in a tight flex, leaving Sanji with his head trapped in the crevice between the two mounds, held tight so that he dangled in the air, his legs kicking uselessly at Luffy's rock hard abs. Luffy eventually got bored with that and relaxed his flexing, dropping Sanji to the hard ground. Before he could move, Luffy crouched down over top of him, his massive bulge hanging somewhat ominously over his face. Luffy snickered and said, \"Look at that! My freaking crotch is bigger than your head! You really are a weak little worm compared to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy loved showing off his dominance! It was the cocky attitude of the man who knew he would some day be King of the Pirates! Sanji was helpless before him, the musk from the pouch dangling above his nose making his head spin. He wasn't too dazed to lift up his knee and drive it into Luffy's fleshy sac, however. Luffy grunted and tipped over, cupping his wounded pride in his hands while Sanji dragged himself over to the water, sticking his head in it and gulping down a few mouthfuls before Luffy's fist enclosed around his leg and yanked him back. \"You're going to...pay for that!\" Luffy grunted out, unaware that Sanji had just drunk more of the water. The blonde haired man lifted up his arms to protect himself from Luffy's assault, when he suddenly felt a tingle rush through his body. Without warning, his body suddenly surged upward in size, his ballooning chest smacking Luffy in the face, forcing him back, while his burgeoning thighs spread out on either side of the captain's body, quickly forming a compound around him as Sanji half crossed his legs, his upper body looming over Luffy who looked to be about a mere six inches high in comparison. Sanji grinned evilly as he realized, sitting down, his head was peeking up out of the forest canopy! \"Payback's a bitch!\" He said, cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, for his part, couldn't reach the water now AND had made Sanji angry. Things weren't looking too good for him! All pretense of clothes had been fully removed from Sanji, his body now far too big to fit anything that he owned even slightly. This didn't seem to bother him, however, as it showed just how tiny Luffy looked in comparison. Sanji wrapped his fingers around Luffy and hoisted him into the air, up to his grinning face. \"Maybe I'll just chew you up and spit you out like a wad of gum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, his arms pinned to his sides, could only struggle fruitlessly as Sanji decided what to do. He was in luck, however, as something happened that diverted all of Sanji's attention away from him in an instant!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Crap!\" Sanji shouted suddenly. As Luffy looked over in the same direction, there was a massive tanned foot heading straight for them! It was like a bulldozer, crushing every little thing that was in it's way! Sanji immediately ran, carrying Luffy along with him for the ride! As Sanji began to sprint, not even his powerful legs were able to put him far enough ahead! Sanji soon found the foot pressed against his back and was shoving onward with him pressed to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot finally seemed to stop. Luffy and Sanji fell forward as their ride came to a sudden end, leaving them face down and in the midst of the jungle! Sanji slowly got back up, dusting himself off. Thankfully he was so huge that the fall felt like it was nothing! Luffy, on the other hand, was made of rubber, and luckily didn't feel much pain as well! Sanji stood, looking up at the foot. It took a moment, but the little gears in his head started to click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wait a sec... There's no way this is...!\" He stammered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if his answer, Zoro slowly rose up, almost ominously. He yawned a little before smacking his lips and looking down. He immediately grinned, which made Sanji freeze up in an instant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" He said softly to himself. He bounced his pecs, before giving them a long, lustful squeeze. \"You guys really swelled up, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji gulped as he looked up the the massive giant. He may have been big, but Zoro made him look like a chew toy! Thankfully the swordsman hadn't noticed them yet. He watche as Zoro's hand traveled down his abs, rubbing them softly, causing Zoro to let out a soft moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got pretty huge!\" Zoro said with a grin. He rose up his arms and flexed as fast and hard as he could. Those two mountainous muscles burst right up, and even formed a peak at the top as they did! Zoro just grinned, flexing them again and again, forcing the blood to engorge them and make them even thicker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sanji heard a loud shout pound against his ear. \"Hey! Zoro! Lookin' good!\" Luffy yelled as loud as he could, cupping his hands around his mouth, up at his crewmate. Sanji immediately dashed over and tackled into Luffy, covering his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you idiot!\" Sanji shouted, \"He's going to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! There you guys are...\" Zoro said suddenly. Sanji felt his heart skip a beat once more. While he grit his teeth, hoping Zoro was talking about another one of his muscles, a large shadow soon loomed over them. Before either them could do or say anything, Zoro grabbed the two of them right up! Sanji started to struggle and shout, whereas Luffy, strangely, was calm and giggling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you laughing about!? You have no idea what he's gonna do!\" Sanji shouted at Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do! He's Zoro, he's not going to hurt us!\" Luffy said innocently. Sanji just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro had a cocky smile on his face as he looked down at the two. \"Look what I caught... A stupid chef and a rubber captain!\" Sanji just bit his tongue, trying not to say anything that would further anger the giant. He tried to use his new, muscled body to try to work Zoro's fingers apart, but as he did, he saw Zoro's forearm flex, and in turn, squeezed him tight like a vice. \"Where do you think you're going?\" Zoro said with an arrogant, proud laugh. He then turned to Luffy. \"And what happened to you? I thought you were going to be King of the Pirates, and here your CHEF is bigger than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still gonna be King! Just you wait, I'll still find a way to get bigger than all of you!\" Luffy shouted back up at Zoro. That little remark just made him laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was then a pause where no one said anything. However, it was Zoro who was doing all the thinking. As he looked down at the men he held in each hand, he had two ideas... He could always get revenge on Sanji by taking Luffy back to the spring and only letting him drink to his heart's content. Then he would get bigger than Sanji and be able to push him around! But if he did that, there was a chance the gargantuan Franky might spot him, not to mention Luffy might grown even bigger than Zoro himself! On the other hand, he could always just enslave the two little guys while he still could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Decisions, decisions...\" Zoro thought to himself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The more Zoro thought about it, the more he liked the idea! Sure it would be a lot of fun to just toy with both of the tiny men in his grasp right now but if he let Luffy get bigger than Sanji it would really piss Sanji off and Zoro never let an opportunity like that pass him by! He gripped them both a little tighter in his grasp and said, \"Okay! I now what I'm going to do now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word the gigantic swordsman turned and began to walk back toward the spring. Sanji felt himself break out in a cold sweat when he realized where they were headed. Zoro really wasn't thinking about making himself even bigger was he? It was possible. He might resent the fact that Franky was still an unstoppable mega giant in comparison to any of them. Sanji looked up and saw Franky still exploring his own body, his massive erect cock jutting into the sky like a volcano, red and veiny and ready to erupt! Franky's thick hand was pumping his shaft slowly, his other hand fondling his broad chest. He was clearly taking his sweet time, enjoying each sensation to its fullest! That suited the giant chef just fine. The more time Franky devoted to himself, the less time he would have to find them! Sanji quickly diverted his thoughts elsewhere before they could stray towards imagining what was going to happen when Franky actually came...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily (or unluckily) those thoughts were driven from his mind as he noticed that Zoro had stopped walking. He was standing at the edge of the spring with an evil smirk on his face. \"Alright boys! I decided to be generous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji looked up at Zoro in amazement. He wasn't seriously going to let them drink was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs though reading his mind, Zoro laughed, his voice booming across the island. \"Don't get too excited! I'm not being generous to <i>you</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plucked Luffy out of his enclosed fist and dangled him over the water. \"Go nuts captain! Drink however much you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy cheered as Zoro dropped him down next to the water. The rubber captain immediately dropped to his hands and knees, sticking his lips into the water. With eager gasps he began to draw in the water, swallowing continuously like a machine! Sanji struggled in a rage, trying futilely to break Zoro's grasp. \"Give it up dumbass!\" Zoro said with a chuckle. \"You're never going to get away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I won't!\" Sanji retorted, redoubling his efforts. Zoro sighed and glanced around. He noticed that Chopper was no longer lying next to the pool passed out. Where had he gotten to? Zoro knew that the little reindeer had guzzled some of the water for himself but he wasn't sure exactly how big the doctor would get. Perhaps he had gone back to the ship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Zoro pondered this, Luffy was still gulping down the water like a man dying of thirst. His rock hard abs had disappeared under a bloated belly as he forced more and more water into his system. This was his best chance to really take off in size and beat out the other men once and for all! He was going to show the whole world just who the King of the Pirates was! He suddenly stopped, feeling a strange gurgling in his stomach...which was remedied by a massive belch! Luffy sighed and went back to drinking~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the noise had finally gotten Zoro's attention! His eyes snapped back over to Luffy whose stomach was literally hanging to the ground like a swollen udder. Zoro's eyes widened as he remembered that, thanks to Luffy's rubber body, he could hold far more water than any normal human! He quickly snatched Luffy up and brought him up to his face. It was like holding a flesh colored baseball! Luffy wiped his mouth and frowned at Zoro. \"Hey! You said I could drink as much as I want! Why'd you stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you've had enough!\" Zoro said irritably. He squeezed Luffy a bit harder to emphasize his point. Luffy winced but then just grinned. It was a rather dark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Just you wait! Once I start growing you're going to be sorry you messed with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro's eye twitched as he realized that Luffy was speaking the truth. He knew that Luffy wouldn't start growing immediately but it wasn't something that would take all day either. \"Yeah?\" Zoro said, glaring down at Luffy. \"Maybe I'll just squeeze all that water right out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy shook his head wildly. \"I won't let you! This is mine! Mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, they were interrupted by a massive rumbling that shook the whole area! Sanji and Luffy stopped struggling and Zoro even stopped squeezing. All three of them listened...and then the ground shook again! What the heck was going on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zoro shook a little as he sat. Sanji was looking around frantically. Luffy held his hands over his mouth, not allowing Zoro to wring him out. On top of that, the little captain was starting to feel a little tired as well. A new, even larger shadow engulfed Zoro from behind. The swordsman looked directly up and spotted a blue nose... A cute muzzle... And two large horns!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chopper!?\" Zoro said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" Chopper said, waving his hoof down at his friends, \"Now I'm big too! I'm bigger than all of you!\" The reindeer said with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... You are...\" Zoro said. Judging by the look on their friend's face, he didn't seem to have any malicious intent... In the meantime, Luffy had fallen fast asleep in Zoro's hand, as his swollen belly gradually began decreasing in size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoro looked up, he saw something seemed a bit off about Chopper. He was most certainly bigger, but unlike the rest of the guys, he didn't have the same bulging muscles. He should have had at least a little improvement, considering how much he drank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chopper!\" Zoro called out, \"Why aren't you as buff as the rest of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper tilted his head, his large hoof tapping his chin. \"Why...?\" He echoed. \"Oh! I know! Maybe if I change...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change...?\" Zoro thought to himself. But soon enough, he would have his answer. It all happened in an instant, but in Zoro's eyes, it all seemed to go by so slowly. First Chopper's hooves morphed into feet, huge toes popping up as his gargantuan foot pushed at Zoro's back! Two huge columns that were Chopper's legs burst with new size, his calves looking five times the size of boulders! Traveling right up the ladder, Chopper's thighs became heavy, like two massive tree trunks, as the reindeer turned human's manhood soon fell down between those huge thighs, slapping against them! Chopper developed a bouncy, thick ass which he immediately fell back on. His abs shot out from his once tubby reindeer belly, before his two pecs jutted out of his chest. The two bulging muscles looked like they could crush mountains! Speaking of mountains, Chopper's arms had developed, leaving something the size of Epcot in shame! His forearms had grew, supporting his fathomless grip, which he now had as his front hooves had become his hands! Chopper's back was about a third as wide as he was tall! Not to mention his massive traps nearly engulfed his head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro's mouth was gaped open. In one instant, he went from twice Zoro's size to a size the nearly rivaled Franky's! Chopper's human face grinned, waving down at Zoro. Feeling a little cocky, he bounced his pecs, well knowing that Zoro couldn't see his face. Chopper went on with flexing, putting on a little show for his puny little admirers. They only reached up to about halfway to his kneecaps anyway! He showed off his thick biceps, and his rippling abs. He flexed and cracked his toes, as his hands issued down his thundering, beefy thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chopper continued to show off, a new problem seemed to arise...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sanji's head felt like it was spinning! Everything seemed to be getting completely out of hand! Now that two members of their crew were approaching island size, there was no way they were going to be able to fit on the Thousand Sunny anymore! Worse still, he was the second smallest out of all the guys! It probably wasn't such a bad thing that he was smaller than Chopper or Franky but he couldn't stand being smaller than Zoro! He had already had to deal with him back on the ship when he was huge and now he was even bigger! Even Sanji's own growth spurt hadn't put him on the same level as the turf headed swordsman!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji looked up again, taking stock of the situation. Zoro seemed to be mesmerized by Chopper's enormous physique. It was distracting even for Sanji! Seeing the once smallest member of their crew so enormously huge was a very weird experience. Chopper himself was too busy showing off, flexing and feeling himself, to notice anything else. Franky was still a very noticeable presence as well, the enormous hairy pillars that were his legs on either side of them. It was sheer luck that they hadn't been spotted by him yet! Finally, there was Luffy, still sleeping, his arms and legs dangling over the edges of Zoro's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....Wait a minute...Sanji looked more closely at Luffy. Was his arms and legs always dangling like that? He could have sworn that Luffy previously had fit in Zoro's palm like a big squishy stress ball. Sanji's eyes widened as he saw Luffy's legs slowly stretching longer, his arms following suit, all four limbs growing thicker as well! A few minutes of growing eventually made Luffy heavy enough for Zoro to finally take notice. He frowned as he saw Luffy getting bigger and bigger! He had been distracted long enough to make it impossible to get even a drop of liquid out of Luffy's body now, his big belly reduced to its normal size, a wall of abs now in its place, each brick like muscle bulging out more and more as Luffy continued to grow! Soon, Zoro had to drop the rubber captain, his body landing on Chopper's lap. The reindeer human felt the sudden weight, which was slowly getting heavier, and tried to look down, his chin pressing up against his pecs. \"Wonder what's going on down there?\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy, still fast asleep, was starting to grow even faster now, his massive feet growing longer and wider, each thick toe spreading further out. Zoro and Sanji slowly backed away as Luffy took up more and more space, his calves bulging in quick bursts, his thighs thickening so quickly that the remains of his shorts exploded off his body, sending scraps of denim fluttering to the forest floor. His underwear met a similar fate, his cock bursting free, unreeling down his leg while his balls bloated with size, keeping proportion, his ass hardening and bulging out behind him, giving it a nice bouncy quality. His abs quickly developed into an eight pack, his broad shoulders growing even broader shredding his vest into pieces. Now totally naked, Luffy's body continued to stretch across the land, his feet slamming into the ground. Before Sanji could react he was swept up between Luffy's big and second toe, the other foot resting on top of Zoro, forcing the massive swordsman against the ground, pinning him easily. Luffy's weight could no longer be denied. Chopper looked down and saw Luffy's thick legs stretching out in front of him. \"W-Woah! What is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon got his answer as Luffy's broad back flared out in front of his eyes, Luffy's growth picking up speed! His biceps bulged upward, already hard and round without him even needing to flex, his chest pushing so far out from his body there was no way he'd be able to see his feet, his nipples erect from the cool breeze of the island. Chopper let out a whimper as Luffy's glorious ass pinned him down to the ground, the captain's body still expanding!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky, his eyes closed in ecstasy as he played with himself, suddenly opened as he felt something brush against his feet...something big! He looked up and gaped as he saw Luffy, already bigger than him and getting bigger! The island was slowly being crushed under the weight of the massive captain, his cock head pushing against Franky's chest, the weight of the shaft pinning his legs down! Before the cyborg could do anything to defend himself, the veiny shaft thickened and pressed down harder on his body, the dick head passing higher than his own, forcing him onto his back. He was trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy's growth finally came to a stop when the tip of his dick landed in the cool water. Now, with Sanji trapped between his toes, Zoro trapped under his foot, Chopper trapped under his ass, and Franky trapped under his shaft, Luffy was truly in control, his body taking up the entire island! The cold water made him shiver and his eyes began to open...</span></div></div>",

Just as he smacked his lips, he heard a loud crash! Almost like a rock slide! Luffy's eyes popped open as he sat up immediately!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My meat!\" He said out of habit. He never knew if someone was after his food after all... But then there was another crash! It wasn't just Luffy that had heard it, but all the other crew members too! Luffy's head whipped left and right, trying to see what was wrong, but all he could saw was water, as far as the eye could see. Just then, he felt a slight chill against his rump. He looked down not only to see a few colorful \"bugs,\" but also to see that waster was starting to rise up along the shores of the island! Those little bugs immediately began to climb up Luffy as the straw hat captain began to get to his feet! He looked down at the ground, watching as water slowly started to surround him on all sides! Luffy gulped slightly. He still couldn't swim! It would only be a matter of time before he would sink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, around Luffy's calves, Zoro was carrying Sanji, scaling his mountain of a captain. Chopper had things the easiest. Luffy's bouncy ass was so wide, he was able to just sit on down on Luffy's right cheek and enjoy the view! Franky was in a similar state, albeit a little more... Musky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crew scrambled, Luffy whimpered slightly as more and more of the water surrounded his feet. His toes were already starting to dip into the cool blue liquid. Right then, as if to cure Luffy of his cowardice, the island broke off, and sent Luffy and the crew crashing into the briney blue!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy floated to the surface, splashing and making a huge commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"St-Stop! Help me!\" He shouted. It took him a full minute before he realized something was off. He didn't sink straight to the bottom! In fact, he was floating on the water like a normal person! Luffy took a sigh of relief. As he let his body sink down, something touched his foot! It was the sea floor! Luffy had grown so massive that he could actually feel the floor of the ocean! His thick shoulders and everything else above remained on the surface of the water. Luffy grinned to himself. He really felt proud of himself, for no apparant reason!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he felt another rumble! Looking down, he was shot in the face by a gyser of water! Luffy shook his head fiercly before rubbing his eyes. As he looked at the water gushing before him, it didn't take very long for him to realize it was spraying from where the island once was! Luffy looked at the beauty in amazement for a moment, before bending in to take a sip. With that tiny little drink, he instantly realized that it was the same water that they had been fighting over on the island! With a big smile, he then got closer, and started to drink all he could drink!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Luffy was truly a sight to behold. The World Government had been forced to classify the threats to the world in various ways through the years. The Seven Warlords of the Sea, the Marines, the pirates, the Four Emperors, all were at different levels yet all were documented and at least somewhat controllable. Now Luffy was the greatest threat the world had ever known! Even sustaining such a titanic human being was going to be impossible! With Luffy's appetite he could wipe out the food supplies of the planet in a single meal! Water would be drained, lives would be lost from so much as a twitch of Luffy's gargantuan body. Already the amount of water he had displaced from falling into the ocean was causing mass tidal waves at the surrounding islands, sinking some of them completely. Mass panic and worldwide chaos was the name of the game. No one on the planet had been left untouched in some way thanks to Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all of this, the only thing on Luffy's mind was more. He guzzled the water like he was addicted to it and maybe he was. Addicted to the sweet taste, addicted to the growth, addicted to the sheer power tensed up inside his body. When he was his normal size, a mere speck to him now, he had been determined to be King of the Pirates. Now that he was nearing the size of a continent, he wanted more. Why settle for being the king of such a small group of people when all of the world could be his? Luffy moaned as he felt his body slowly rise up out of the water, his thick pecs swelling even more, pushing out from his body, his shoulders widening, blocking out the sun as he climbed miles into the sky, his abs deepening and pushing out like they were in competition with his pecs, his biceps swelling to the size of islands and beyond! His thighs thickened, taking up more and more space in the water, pushing aside even the biggest, meanest Sea Kings, his calves blasting coral and underwater mountains to pieces, his toes digging up the sea floor as they stretched across it. Luffy's perfectly round ass rose up out of the water majestically, the thick base of his cock seen as he grew more and more and more out of the water. Luffy tilted his head back and moaned, his hands gripping his pecs, his fingers pinching his nipples as he grew higher and higher. He was so enraptured with his growth he didn't notice it slowly coming to a halt. Luffy towered above sea level, the clouds gathered about his chest and abs. His knees were above the water but his massive dick was still below sea level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Luffy grew, the miniscule members of his crew had been climbing his body. Zoro and Sanji had had it the worst, being the lowest on the ground. Of course Chopper and Franky's easy time of it was cruelly shattered when Luffy sank into the sea. All four of them had been swept under water, though their massive, muscular bodies allowed them to swim to the surface. They had just managed to cling to Luffy's chest when he began to grow again, rising up out of the water. When the growth came to a stop, they had managed to make it to Luffy's shoulder. With all their voices combined, they managed to get Luffy to stop fondling himself and look down at his shoulder. He grinned and said, \"Oh hey you guys! Looks like you didn't get crushed! Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all tried to speak to Luffy but the titanic captain merely shook his head. \"Sorry! No way I can hear you! You're just going to have to listen! Things are obviously different now so listen good! I've decided that being King of the Pirates isn't good enough! Now this whole world is going to be mine! But I still need a crew to help me out! So you guys are going to stick by me and do whatever I say! Now, you're all way too small to do me any good so I'm going to make sure you're all big enough to do stuff for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swept them off into his hand and lowered them next to the geyser. \"Drink up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as his crew mates eagerly drank as much water as they could. Luffy let them at it for a bit then pulled them away. One by one, they became too heavy to hold, dropping down into the sea around Luffy. Their growth came to a halt when they would have only just reached past Luffy's ankle. Luffy crossed his arms and pointed at each one of them in turn. \"Now, you all still have your jobs to do, they're just slightly different in some cases! Zoro! You're main mission is to make sure no one gets close to the geyser. That means Franky, Sanji, and Chopper too! If you're faithful for awhile and don't take any yourself, I'll let you get even bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro grinned and said, \"Alright! I like the sound of that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanji! You're in charge of keeping me fed! You have to go to all the islands and tell them to make sure a tribute is paid to me every day in food! All the food they can give me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji nodded and said, \"Sure, sounds easy enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chopper!\" Luffy continued. \"You are in charge of my body! When I want something rubbed, you rub it! Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um..I guess!\" Chopper said, looking a little unsure but not wanting to piss off Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Franky! I want you to build some kind of building around the geyser to make absolutely sure no one can get in! Use whatever you can find, no matter what it is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it! I'll make a SUPER container!\" Franky said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy watched, satisfied, as his crew followed his orders. He let out a sigh and sank into the water, rubbing his chest. It was nice to be able to be in the water without the fear of drowning!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Luffy gave his crew the order, the would was slowly plunged into chaos! Entire cities were left without food as Sanji had to plunder them for every morsel they had! If there was any resistance, Luffy would dispatch both Zoro and Franky, and all forms of rebellion were quelled within seconds! There was no doubt that the Straw Hat crew was an unstoppable force that just might bring about the end of the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith pirates run amok, there was one group that was left in chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Navy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery general, every lieutenant, admiral, corporal, colonel were all dispatched, trying to withhold what little peace was remaining! With the Straw Hats so easily taking everything they wanted, it had encouraged other pirates to do the same! And once a town was stripped of food, it was raided by pirates while it was still defenseless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne officer was furious... No, seething with rage! This man was none other than Officer Smoker. The tiny town of Redport was thankfully safe from piracy under his rule, but unfortunately, it wasn't too far from where the Straw Hats had been raiding! There was no telling when their innocent village would be struck! Smoker was walking down the halls of Redport's Navy base, racking his brain for a way to keep the town safe, and in time, keep the entire planet safe! He felt as if the weight of the entire world rested on his shoulders!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! Sir!\" Someone called out. Smoker's teeth grit a little, before he looked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Tashigi?\" Smoker asked. His eyes opened a little when he saw the size of the soldier Tashigi had with her! He had seen bigger before, but it was still not the type of person he ran into every day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! I think we've made an interesting development!\" Tashigi said, saluting Smoker. \"Tell him!\" Tashigi pulled the man a little closer, presenting him to Smoker. Smoker just looked up and down the man briefly before looking back up at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You see, sir, I was on my break and I was getting something to drink! But there wasn't a bar or anything for blocks! So... O-Out of desperation, I drank water right out of the ocean...\" He said, looking down. \"I swear! I didn't think anything would happen! I was just so thirsty! My mouth felt like it was full of sand, it was hotter than--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enought!\" Smoker suddenly said, interrupting the man! An idea crossed Smoker's mind. \"Tashigi, I want you to send out an order to all of our men to evacuate everyone from the port and prevent anyone else from entering it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" She agreed. She immediately began to broadcast the order over her transmitter snail. Smoker, on the other hand, had turned to head out the front doors of the navy base. If his little theory turnd out to be true, there just might be hope yet!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Though Smoker had ably protected the city of Redport, the sight if Luffy's miles tall body standing in the middle of the ocean was impossible not to notice. Every island nation from the largest to the smallest was aware of Luffy's ascension. Those nations that were near his body had even heard his proclamations, though they were soon ravaged by Sanji stealing all their food, some of the more troublesome individuals getting swept up into the food supply. Luffy and his crew were no longer on the same level of mere humans. They were now simply fodder for the massive captain, to fuel his gargantuan muscles. Brave, yet foolish, crews had tried to sail to the geyser, rationalizing that since Luffy grew into sight from that point and he wasn't moving from the area, that it must be the source of his size and power. However, none of them even got close to it. Zoro easily scooped the ships up in his massive hands, the enormous battleships mere specks in Zoro's palm! The titanic swordsman amused himself by playing with the ships, crushing some in his hands, drinking some of them up, and smashing them between his various muscles. Any ship that managed to squeeze past found themselves crushed by the defenses Franky was installing as he built the massive container that would protect the geyser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this chaos was largely not felt by Redport, but given enough time, the colossal Straw Hats would eventually make their way here. Smoker intended to be completely prepared before that could happen. He strode through town, the citizens moving out of his way as they saw him coming out of the respect they felt towards the man. Soon, he reached the port, his men already standing guard there. He moved past the blockade and down the dock, staring at the water. If what that officer had said was true, this water would give him exactly what he needed to protect his city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker gazed out over the sea, watching Luffy, his body creating tidal waves and maelstroms just be existing, his slightest movements spelling disaster to all. Smoker looked at his reflection in the water and pulled the cigars from his mouth, holding them between the fingers of his left hand. If he did what he was planning on doing, then he might not be able to reverse it. He would have to live his life completely changed. However, if it meant protecting his city and the world at large, then he would do what needed to be done. He crouched down at the edge of the dock and stuck his lips to the water, slowly taking long, controlled gulps. After about ten gulps, his stomach bulging slightly with water, he rose to his feet, sticking the cigars back into his mouth. He didn't have to wait long for the water to take effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, Smoker felt himself growing! His body slowly stretched taller, his teeth gritting, chomping the cigars in two, the ends dropping to the deck. Smoker growled and spit out the chunks still left in his mouth. \"They wouldn't have lasted long anyway...\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body grew at a relentless pace, stretching taller and wider, his chest bulging out a foot, then two feet, then more, the thick muscles swelling like balloons, his jacket forced open even wider! His biceps practically exploded from his sleeves, the material fluttering around him like snowfall, leaving him sleeveless! He flexed his arms, the muscles bunching up and bulging upward, thick veins running over top both of them, feeding the muscle, forcing it pump bigger and bigger! His hands spread out, giving him a stronger grip, his forearms expanding along with them! His shoulders broadened, the hem of his jacket rising up as it began to tear along the seams, Smoker's muscled flesh peeking out from under it, his abs popping up from his stomach, creating a wide, cobblestone path, his pants biting harder and harder into his waist! His jacket was so small on him now it was like he was wearing a vest, his shoulder exploding out from them, the tattered cloth barely clinging to his enormous body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow the belt, his thighs suddenly bulked up, one by one, his pants first filled, then straining to contain them, then giving up weakly as a loud ripping sound filled the air, the blue material fluttering to the docks to join the remains of the jacket. His calves destroyed the lower part of his pants, swelling up into a perfect diamond shape. Smoker's thighs were so thick, he had to adjust his stance, his pants ripping further as he did so. His boots bulge, swelling up as they tried to hold back Smoker's feet, but the massive, manly stompers would not be denied, splitting them open like rotten husks, his thick toes wiggling slightly as they were set free, the tops of the boots meeting the same fate as Smoker's pants! Even his ass began to swell and shape, growing bouncier, filling his underwear to the bursting point, his belt snapping off, leaving him in nothing but a pair of overstretched briefs. His cock was the last thing to grow, slowly filling the pouch of his briefs, putting any normal man to shame, his balls keeping proportion with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker's shadow began to cover the men guarding the port, getting their attention as the dock creaked and warped under Smoker's enormous weight. The men all gaped as they saw their commanding officer towering over them, a titan of impressive stature, the deeper water of the port only ankle deep to him. He groaned and flexed his arm, running his hand over the enormous bicep before wandering down to give his ample chest a tight squeeze, the other hand gripping his manly bulge. He had started growing purely for necessity but now that the power was flowing through him, coiling deep inside his gigantic muscles, he had only one thought on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More...\" he whispered, turning to look at the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More.\" He said it more loudly, wading out into deeper water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOOOOOORE!\" He roared, his voice thundering over the entire city, forcing the men to cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Smoker plunged himself under the water, greedily sucking down as much of the magic liquid as he could hold, his stomach bulging and aching but forced to take on more and more and MORE!</span></div></div>",

Yes, life was great for our straw hat hero, that is until one insurmountable obstacle seemed to arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he grew bored of standing, he laid on his back in the water, floating bigger than any boat ever made! He splashed around now and again, sprinkling water around as he did. The giant captain didn't even know that these little movements were channeling water from the gyser into a current that led right to Redport! Franky's defenses might have stopped unwanted guests, but he couldn't quite stop nature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoro!\" Luffy said, getting down closer to the swordsman. To Zoro, Luffy's voice was like standing with your ear pressed to a megaphone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owww! Geez, what is it Luffy!?\" Zoro asked, looking a bit spitefully up at Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bored!\" Luffy said simply, looking down at Zoro. He was about the size of a mouse compared to Luffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What do you want me to do about it? I'm busy guarding the waters for you.\" Zoro answered. At this exact moment, he spotted a ship! He plucked it up, a smile rising to his face as he heard screams upon the ship. Hell, he even saw a few little dots jumping overboard! Zoro gave them a shred of mercy, and let them plunge into the waters below before crushing their ship between his pumped pecs like it was made of paper mach\u00e9!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See?! Like that!\" Luffy said, \"I don't get to do anything!\" Luffy said, beginning to whine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro sighed, dragging his hand along his face. \"You're the one who wanted to be captain. I'm just following your orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but when Franky gets done, there won't be anything left for you to do!\" Luffy replied rather quickly! Zoro's eyes popped open a little. Luffy was right for once! Zoro then just sighed again, probably going to regret his next words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll play with you when he's done...\" Zoro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh!\" Luffy replied, \"I'M gonna be the one who's playing with YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back in Redport, Smoker was slick sucking down every drop of water he could get! The already massive officer continued to grow beefier by the second! His stomach was swollen like a beach ball, filled to the brim with water! It shrank a little at times, only to be replaced by twice as much water! Smoker had grown so tall, that his feet could touch the ocean floor near the port! The rest of the navy could only watch on as their commander continued to grow and grow! His back was slowly becoming an insurmountable wall, while a canyon of rippling muscle trailed down his back! His pecs were twice the size of houses, and his arms were gigantic boulders packed with pure size! His abs were non-existant at this time, hidden beneath a giant, bloated stomach of water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding tall, the water barely reached below Smoker's naval. At times, he'd stop, just to fight through the sleepiness he was feeling, and in doing so, he seemed to be growing bigger at a much faster rate! But even at his great size, he would barely come up to even Sanji's chest! A fierce look on his face, Smoker would then lower himself back into the water, opening his mouth wide and gulping down countless gallons of water, and even some fish in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger...\" Smoker thought to himself, \"BIGGER! I won't stop until I can crush those filthy pirates under my foot! They'll be kissing my toes, BEGGING for mercy!\" Smoker thought. \"I'll grow until I can hold this entire planet safely in my hands!\" Smoker then grunted as he felt his body surging upward, not to mention he was feeling even heavier as his already massive muscles grew bigger and mightier! Smoker didn't want to stop until there was no one who could stand above him!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smoker, panting slightly, was just about to move down closer to the water for another guzzling session when something huge landed just off the coast of Redport, sending a massive tidal wave over the island! The men guarding the pier let out a cry of anguish as they were swept suddenly away, the water flooding areas of the town as well! Smoker saw this and growled, his growl turning into a somewhat sensual grunt as his body surged taller and wider, the water level now reaching his knees. He had easily withstood the tidal wave and crossed his arms, facing what had landed outside his fair city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji's self assured grin, which he had been wearing when he swooped down over the island, faltered as he saw Smoker glaring at him, equal to him in height! He had been looting all the neighboring islands of their food for the last few hours and had met absolutely zero resistance. The inhabitants were like bugs to him, not even worth thinking about! Some of the islands had honest born giants on them as well, but even they were more like toddlers than fierce warriors! He had gotten complacent and now he was faced with a far greater threat! Smoker at normal size, with his Devil Fruit powers, was a force to be reckoned with. Sanji hesitated, holding the back of food he had so far gathered tightly in his fist. He flung the sack over his shoulder and said, \"Well, guess I'm actually going to have to try this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker flexed his biceps, his chest bulging out as he glared at Sanji. \"You're not taking a step past this shore line pirate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji snorted and said, \"Fat chance! I've gotten used to being this huge! You're new. I doubt you've even adjusted to how heavy you are now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker hesitated now. Sanji had a point. He had been so focused on growing bigger he hadn't taken the time to try and acclimate himself to his new size. Would he be too slow to fight? Would his movements be slow and clumsy? As he thought Sanji quietly tried sneaking up behind him, lifting one leg out of the water. With a swift vibration, Sanji's leg burst into flame! He kicked out, hard, his bare foot slamming into Smoker's back, sending him flying forward, head fist into the water! Sanji chuckled and said, \"Too easy! But I'd better be fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his back on Smoker, expecting him to be paralyzed and sinking to the bottom of the ocean. He would soon learn, however, how wrong he was. Smoker gasped as his body hit the water, sucking in a tremendous amount of water and causing him to nearly choke. Under the surface, he opened his mouth wide and began to drink, the water level actually lowering slightly as he filled his aching gut with more and more water, his belly actually stretching out a few inches past its normal limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji, totally unaware of this, stood tall on the edge of the city and shouted, \"Alright you bugs! Listen up! Captain Luffy has ordered me to gather food for him to feast on and as you can imagine, he's a growing boy and needs a lot of food! So I want you to gather every scrap of food you can find and bring it to me! If I find you're holding out even a single grain of rice, I'll not only destroy this entire island, sinking it into the ocean, I'll gather up each and everyone of you and add you to Luffy's meal! So get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe citizens of Redport, not wanting to end up as food, all rushed about to obey Sanji, creating a pile of food in the center of the town that grew larger and larger and larger! Sanji kicked back and watched the bugs scurry, a big smile on his face. This was the life~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis good mood was interrupted, however, by a strange rumbling that ran throughout the entire town, causing everyone to pause as they tried to discover what it was...earthquakes weren't common here on the island after all. All their questions were answered when a gigantic series of what appeared to be strange white trees rose from the water, followed by an enormous peach colored wall. Two gigantic eyes surfaced next, followed by a massive nose, and a titanic grin, the head of Smoker staring at Sanji with murder in his eyes. Sanji gaped as more and more of Smoker's tremendous body came into view, the slope of his gigantic chest sending a torrent of water over the city, his nipple decimating a dock without him even noticing! The citizens cheered as their savior rose from the ocean like a god, his abs rising next, followed by his thick horse cock, the massive purple head crashing through a mountain as it swung, slapping against his meaty thigh. Higher and higher he rose until his toes had broke the surface, his right foot alone the same size as the island! Truly Smoker was a sight to behold! He stretched and let out a groan, cracking his knuckles as he stared down at Sanji. The cracking echoed over the island like thunder. Sanji could feel his legs shaking, unable to move as Smoker's god like hand reached down and snatched him up off the island. He brought him up to his face and growled out, \"I think I can handle my size just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanji gulped and didn't say anything. Smoker didn't expect him to. Any words right now would be completely wasted on him. \"Normally I'd let the World Government decide your fate, probably end up throwing you into Impel Down where you belong. But at your size, and with the destruction you and your crew have caused, I'm going to have to mete out punishment on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you going to do?!\" Sanji shouted, terrified of what his fate might be but refusing to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker's stomach growled loudly, answering Sanji's question for him. \"I'm going to put you in the one place more terrifying than Impel Down. My stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tilted his head back and opened his mouth wide, dropping Sanji carelessly down onto his thick, wide tongue, coating the chef in his saliva. His teeth clicked shut, sealing the tiny pirate's fate. The massive tongue tip flicked Sanji in the head, dazing him and causing him to lose his grip. He quickly slid backwards down the tongue and fell into the hole at the back of Smoker's throat, the gigantic Marine swallowing, Sanji making a tiny lump that traveled down his throat, quickly depositing him into the stomach. Unfortunately for him, all of the water that Smoker had guzzle had already passed into the man's system, leaving nothing but stomach juices behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker belched slightly and bent down, speaking in a low voice. \"I'm going to spend a little more time preparing before I go take care of the Strawhats. I'm sorry for any damage I've caused. Talk to Tashigi and she'll organize some money to pay you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker could barely register the tiny citizen's cheers as he turned around, crouching down and gulping down even more water. If he was going to take down Luffy, he still had a ways to go!</span></div></div>",

Smoker, who was lip-deep in the water, continuing to drink, was shadow boxing in the water to better prepare himself for the next fight that was sure to come! After a few minutes, he got up out of the water, sitting on the edge of the island that was mostly jungle so he could take a break! He was wet, water cascading off his beefy pecs, plunging off his soft nipples and onto his water-bloated gut. It then smoothly slid off and harmlessly onto the land below. Smoker was getting pretty huge now! Even then entire island was starting to become no more than a splotch on his growing body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker stroked his belly as he sat there for a moment. Sanji had long stopped kicking and wriggling around. It saddened him a bit, since Smoker had always enjoyed seeing pirate scum pay for their misdeeds. So rather than hurting him, every kick Sanji tried had actually brought him more satisfaction than pain! Smoker's thoughts slowly started to take a shift. When he thought about it, this one battle was going to change his entire life forever! There was no promising that even when he got as mind-bendingly large as he needed to be that there would be a way to turn him back! Then again, it's not like he really cared! He would forever more be a massive, looming figure over all the pirates of the world! Any who dare rise up would be swiftly dealt with! The world would finally be at peace! Albeit ruled by him, but peaceful nonetheless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Smoker's cheeks puffed up! All that rubbing had worked some of the air out of his stomach! His mouth then opened wide, and a huge, thundering belch shot over for the entire land to hear! Smoker just chuckled to himself, slapping his gut! Just then, he could feel it! His pecs jutting out further from his hulking form, his arms becoming heavier as tons of beef were added on, and his back spreading wider, more broad, like a canyon of muscle! With a smirk on his face, Smoker got up and started to head out into the water, getting deeper without straying too far from the source!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat loud burp was what blew Smoker's cover. Far off in the distance, although not too far for the titanic Smoker and Straw Hats, the sentinel Zoro had spotted what he thought of as strange activity! Immediately, he turned in the water and started to head for Luffy to report in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy was laying on his back in the water, his gigantic, bulging form the size of a big, mountainous island! It didn't take TOO long for someone Zoro's size to soon reach one of Luffy's ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Luffy!\" Zoro shouted, \"There's some weird stuff happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuffy just yawned, having come within just seconds of a nap! \"Mnngh, you take care of it...\" Luffy replied sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luffy, I think it's another giant! You should take care of it, there's no way they could match up to you and it would be done in seconds!\" Zoro begged to differ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm bigger and I'm the captain, so I say YOU do it.\" Luffy replied, a little more stern in his tone this time. Zoro just shook his head. After but a moment, he figured he was big enough to take care of it. Sighing, Zoro laid on his stomach in the water and began to swim to the island in question, passing by the incomplete embankments as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn but a short amount of time, Zoro had swam right to the city of Redport! As he rose up out of the water, his humongous body cast a shadow over the entire town of Redport! This prompted many people to stop in their tracks just to look up at Zoro! Many of them couldn't even see past his great, shelf-like pecs, which were like two mountains of muscle! They couldn't see the plain, indifferent look on his face as he scanned over the island for suspicious activity and nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoro stood there, however, he failed to notice someone even BIGGER slowly rising up behind him! The cries of the people below didn't go unnoticed. Slowly, the beast that was Smoker was rising up out of the water! At first, Zoro felt two mounds slowly travelling up his back! Those mounds were soon passed by some gelatenous orb that knocked him forward! Zoro crashed into the ports, before catching himself! Otherwise he would have slammed his body right down on top of the buildings! Crushing a few was a small price to pay! Not like he really cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, another one of you Straw Hats...\" Smoker said. His voice was low and rumbling, nearly shaking the island below! Smoker had really grown... He must have been at least three quarters Luffy's size! Zoro's mouth gaped open as he gazed upon Smoker's superior male form. Every muscle practically ten times the size of his, peaked to perfection. Thick veins ran all over and throbbed on his body, each of them feeding the already huge, heaving muscles! Before Zoro could even react, Smoker fired a punch right at Zoro's stomach! The swordsman heard a crack as a few of his ribs broke, but it wasn't surprising considering Smoker's fist nearly encompassed his entire torso! Zoro coughed a little speck of blood, and before he could even recover, Smoker gave him another punch, sending him flying not only over the entire island, but to the other side and into the water! There was no contest. Smoker was an unstoppable beast! He began to tread water around the island, a task easily done by someone his size, making his way to Zoro! Every step made a small quake on the ocean floor, and every movement sent waves crashing into the island! Smoker loved every second of it. Being so massive he could make men bow before him with little effort. So huge, every step could change the land upon which he walked. And so amazingly strong that no one could ever stand up to a gigantic man like him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker's shadow soon engulfed Zoro's once more. \"Hmph.\" He plucked Zoro up out of the water. \"You puny, cowardly pirates are no match for a REAL MAN like me. Even your mighty captain will fall before the immense, bulging power that is Smoker!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout taunting the fallen warrior any further, Smoker began to feed him into his mouth! Zoro was too weakened to even fight back! Smoker didn't even bother with taking his time. Every gulp pushed Zoro in deeper. His head, then his pecs! His abs, soon enough, Smoker used his tongue to work Zoro in before mercilessly tilting his head back and gulping him down! The large lump trailed slowly down his gullet and into his stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker let out a sigh, his hand trailing down his chest and patting his stomach! Another one down, and three to go...!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Smoker licked his lips, his hand slowly rubbing up and down his swollen gut. It had been even more satisfying taking down Zoro, someone who had given such grief to his subordinate in the past. Smoker's mind briefly returned to the now nearly microscopic people he was leaving behind, all in the name of the great good, and looked down at the island at his feet. He could just barely make out a high pitched squeak, what was literally thousands of voices cheering him on in unison. The island that housed Redport was now smaller than his big toe, barely visible over the magnificent swell of Smoker's nearly unparalleled chest. He nodded, his face a mask of seriousness and said, \"Enough waiting. Enough preparing. It's time to finally end this nightmare once and for all!\" His voice never rose above a whisper, and yet everyone on the island heard him clear as day, his voice rumbling lowly making the very island shake, every citizen feeling that profound bass voice vibrating in at the core of their beings. It was a feeling of warmth and protection and only made them cheer louder. Smoker felt uplifted by this show of confidence, turning his back on the mini island and heading into the deeper waters, heading straight for the Strawhat compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this was going on, Luffy was still sleeping soundly, his snores like thunder, heard round the world. Franky was working tirelessly to build the fortifications around the geyser while Chopper was scanning the horizon, pausing in his experiments to check to see if Zoro or Sanji were returning. He was starting to get worried! \"I hope they didn't run into any...trouble?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes bugged out of his head when he saw Smoker slowly walking towards them, a fierce look of anger on his face. Smoker was intimidating at normal size, but as a musclebound vengeful giant? He was downright terrifying! Chopper had slowly been feeling more and more confident the bigger he got. At this size, he had felt downright invincible! Those feelings had slowly been disappearing as first Sanji and then Zoro went missing. His worst fears were confirmed as he saw Smoker getting closer and closer. \"I've...I've got to warn Luffy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human shaped reindeer dived into the water, leaving his little lab on top of one of the completed fortifications and swam as fast as he could towards Luffy. \"LUFFY! LUFFY! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!\" He shrieked as loudly as he could, hoping to break through the haze of Luffy's tiredness. It was no use, however. Luffy was impossible to wake up when they were both normal sized. Now that Luffy was several times Choppers size it was like an ant trying to wake a human. Chopper, who had been one of the biggest giants, had been slightly left behind, Sanji, Zoro, and Franky getting upgrades from Luffy to assist in their work. Since all Chopper had to do was experiment with the water, he had been kept consistent at his size. He was bug like compared to Luffy and therefore bug sized compared to Smoker who had managed to reach Luffy's lofty height! \"Oh no...Oh no!\" Chopper worried, paddling around by Luffy's feet, looking around for Franky. \"FRANKY! Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what's with all the noise little reindeer gorilla?\" Franky asked, suddenly looming over the wall, raising an eyebrow. He was about half Luffy's size, needing to be enormous to work on the containment walls. Chopper waved his arms frantically, babbling as he tried to explain himself. \"Slow down, slow down! What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper took a few deep, calming breaths and said, \"Smoker! He's coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky chuckled and said, \"So what? He can't compete with us! He must be like, a germ by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! Just look!\" Chopper insisted, pointing out to sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky just chuckled and looked up, his smile disappearing as he saw the titan approaching. \"SHIT! Alright! Time to put my SUPER defenses to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dove under the water, a gigantic, water proof control panel situated at the base of the containment wall. He slammed a big red button, making a series of sirens go off, disturbing Luffy enough to cover his ears before falling back to sleep. The walls began to close, a ceiling rising up and covering the entire area, making a protective cocoon. Once the place was properly sealed, a massive cannon popped out of the wall, aimed directly at the approaching Marine! Smoker stopped as he saw it, bracing himself! With an earth shattering KABOOM the cannon fired off a lead ball, bigger than dozens of islands combined, heading straight for Smoker! The colossus gritted his teeth and caught the ball, sliding back in the water, his enormous pecs cushioning the blow like a pillow, his massive arms slowly crushing the ball! With a crack that could split the heavens, the ball shattered, the pieces raining down into the water around Smoker's legs, causing tidal waves to overrun several more islands in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to try harder than that you scum!\" Smoker roared, issuing a challenge that would not be denied!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle of titans had truly begun!</span></div></div>",

However, the spastic little reindeer didn't like his odds, and was quickly making his way back to the geyser! It was almost like magic water that gave him confidence... Though technically, it WAS magical... And he WOULD end up with some confidence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker kept walking twords the base, one footfall after another! Each step making the water rise up and create small waves! Franky continued to frantically lauched cannonballs at the massive man, only to have each and every one either crushed by the man's gargantuan arms or take it head on and have virtually no effect on the man! Franky kept up the barrage, doing everything he could to stop this colossus of a man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper, in the meantime, had arrived at they geyser where the island once stood! The water seemed to be bubbling up slightly from here, almost like a fountain. Luffy wasn't too far off from here. The massive captain made sure of that. Chopper bent down to the water and started drinking like crazy! He sipped and sipped, gulping the water down just as fast as it was entering his lips! He stopped briefly for a moment to catch his breath, and dove right back in for more! He wasn't about to stop until he was sure he had enough!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes, Chopper backed off a little, and let out a huge \"BUUUUUUURP!\" He rubbed his stomach weakly, groaning a little. \"Mmm...\" He would moan, before his eyes then shot open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened fast and in small bursts, like a bomb going off in every part of his body! First his left shoulder, then the right! Each like gargantuan beach balls! His back arched suddenly as his pecs burst forth, throbbing and heaving with newfound size! Growing so gigantic that his nipples pointed down! And just below, his abs erupted with newfound mass, each of them like a set of miniature pecs themselves! Chopper kept blowing up like some kind of muscle balloon, his biceps exploding to even bigger proportions, each of them indescribably large and pumped! \"Come on... Come on...\" Chopper seemed to chant to himself, wanting nothing more than to get as utterly massive as he could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not as important to the growing reindeer, his cock was getting bigger and thicker, along with two balls that could smother an entire islands! His ass swelled out as well, each of them enough to take out part of an entire continent! His thighs bulged and undulated, pressing together, forcing the monstroud reindeer to have a bit of a waddle until he shot up in size like bamboo! His calves were so huge that they could support and entire island while he feet could do just the opposite; crush one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper was soon gasping for breath, starting to look around as he was hunched over! Much to his surprise, he was just a bit bigger than Luffy! He got a small grin on his face, feeling much more confident now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper turned and ran back to meet up with Franky! Just as he had arrived back on the scene...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chopper, moving as fast as he could, managed to make it back to where Franky was just in time! To see his friend be devoured. Smoker stood there, cheeks bulging along with his muscle gut, his throat filled to bursting with Franky's buff body, his hairy legs kicking wildly out of Smoker's mouth! With a bit of a bite, Smoker gulped Franky down, his arms flexed at his sides, his biceps bulging obscenely, every inch of his body bulging with rock hard, veiny muscle! Smoker's body was just too intense for Franky! Within seconds, he was swallowed up, Smoker's already bulbous gut stretching out further, a hint of abs still visible as he ran his finger tips over the thick meaty globe. He let out a deep, thunderous burp, turning to face Chopper. The once little reindeer gulped, his confidence taking a slight hit as he met that menacing stare. Smoker had a grim look on his face as he said, \"I don't want to hurt you! I've seen you around. You're a doctor. You're scared. I'm willing to let you go if you'll just submit and stay out of my way while I take care of Strawhat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Never! You're not going to get away with hurting my friends you GIANT BULLY!\" Chopper screamed, his childish taunts and face at odds with his continental body. \"I'm going to make you pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker sighed and looked behind Chopper, seeing the bubbling geyser. \"That's it, isn't it? The water that started all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah! So what?!\" Chopper said, holding his fists up. \"It's not like you're ever going to get at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker chuckled and said, \"Sorry kid, but I need that water. I'm still not big enough to eat you or Strawhat. My belly is now the greatest Gaol in the world. It's the only place you won't cause any more trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper looked at Smoker's bulging gut with a little bit of trepidation before he charged forward, screaming at the top of his lungs, aiming a punch right at Smoker's belly! \"There's still a chance Franky is okay in there!\" Chopper thought. \"Maybe I can get him to spit him out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker had other plans however. He was far more nimble for his size than he  had any right to be, effortlessly jumping back and avoiding Chopper's punch, kicking him right in the jaw! Chopper let out a squeal of pain, feeling one of his teeth crack from the force of the blow! Smoker wasted no time! He charged forward, ramming his knee into Chopper's abs, the reindeer barely able to tense them in time, absorbing most of the impact. He quickly tried to move into his shield point but it wouldn't work. He couldn't access any of his old forms! \"What the...what's going on?\" He thought to himself. He quickly decided to run an experiment! He grabbed Smoker's wrist and punched him right in the nose with his other arm, the blow landing a solid hit, a gush of blood erupting from the Marine's nose! He looked shocked as he touched the blood, glaring at Chopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it! All of us are constantly standing in the sea water!\" Chopper thought to himself. \"It's negating all our Devil Fruit powers! It's just not strong enough to immobilize us! We must be too big! Or maybe since we drank water to get this big it's having that effect on us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper, too busy musing over the possibilities and eager to run experiments again, was completely unprepared as Smoker elbowed him in the gut, following it up with a punch across the face, ending with a boot to the chest, knocking him down, crashing into one of the pillars surrounding the geyser. \"Sorry kid. But I'm not going to lose here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper struggled to his feet, the protective armor dented slightly, but still holding! Franky had built it to be impenetrable to normal sized humans. No one on the planet could hope to crack it except for any of the Strawhats...and now Smoker. If the possibility of an enemy giant had even occurred to him Smoker would have had no chance of succeeding. As it was, it wouldn't take much more to break into the geyser! Smoker shoved Chopper aside and slammed his meaty fists into the cocoon over and over again, the metal squealing and shrieking as it began to bend inward. Chopper let out a roar and jumped on Smoker's back, slamming him against the metal shell. He grabbed the back of Smoker's head and slammed it over and over again into the metal, dazing the Marine captain, forcing him to stumble back! Smoker lashed out wildly, striking Chopper a few times, but doing no lasting damage. Chopper held on tenaciously, his heels digging into Smoker's gut, trying to force him to puke Franky back up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker kept his abs tense, flexing them with the same instinct that he normally used to keep his body in its smoky element, refusing to let anyone escape from his belly! Chopper's focus was once again his downfall as Smoker managed to rip him from his back, throwing him against the shell as hard as he could! With an almighty crack heard around the globe, the metal shell fell apart, revealing the geyser in all its glory! Smoker quickly started making his way over to it. \"At last! I can put all of this to an end!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had barely taken three steps, however, before he was stopped by something!</span></div></div>",

What is...\" The marine managed to swear under his breath, before once more howling in pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFranky, who was still in Smoker's stomach, was fighting and kicking any way he could! Trying to get out of this seemingly impregnable prison! He had that big grin on his face when he could hear that it was working! He then clamped onto Smoker's stomach and started twisting his arms over and over, tweaking Smoker's stomach from the inside! It was giving even a hardened Marine like him trouble! It almost felt like he had a stomach full of glass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChopper was looking at Smoker in fright, at first, before he realized that something was up! He started walking to where Luffy was, when he couldn't help think, \"Wait! It's a trap! He's gonna gulp all that liquid down as soon as I'm gone!\" Chopper started running back over to Smoker, slowly realizing how big he was as he got closer! \"B-But he IS pretty huge... Well, not as huge as me, but he can fight a lot better! I should get Luffy...!\" Chopper started running away again, before his thoughts then looped. The massive reindeer kept running back and forth, trying to think of what to do, and running out of time fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weapons Left!\" Franky shouted, firing off two powerful blasts against the now sensitive flesh of Smoker's stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F... Fuhhh...\" Smoker grunted. He then smashed his fist into his own gut, which smacked Franky hard across the jaw! Thankfully the huge shipwright was an android, or else he would have been knocked out cold! He slowed for a moment, letting Smoker think he got him, while suddenly getting a SUPER idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weapons left... Strong right!\" He grinned as he looked at his other hand! He had forgotten that he could stretch it! Panting and sweaty, he glanced over at Zoro and Sanji, who were unconscious inside Smoker's gut, and thankfully, still in one piece... \"Just you wait guys, we'll be out of here in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazing up to the roof of the stomach, which he was thankfully able to see in the dark thanks to his special eyes, Franky started looking around for the entrance! \"Got it!\" He grinned, before firing his fist as powerfully as he could, straight up Smoker's esophogus! \"I hope it's long enough...!\" Franky thought to himself as he let loose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the pain felt like it was subsiding, Smoker felt something crawling up his throat! It was small and narrow, so it couldn't be a person... It could just be excess water... But before Smoker could think too hard on it, he suddenly felt something tugging at the back of his throat! Franky's hand had just managed to clasp Smoker's uuvula, and was starting to tug and pull on it ferociously as his arm was wanting to retract! Smoker gulped as hard as he could, trying to force Franky's hand back down, but that sealed his own fate! His uuvula slapped against the back of his throat, and immidiately, Smoker began to gag!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker curled over, trying to get himself to stop choking and gagging, but he couldn't seem to fight off his own body's reflexes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOUGH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGAG<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWHEEZE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCOUGH COUGH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoker's face was soon met with the water as he fell under...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was quiet for that moment. Smoker could feel a gargantuan bulge in his throat, so immense that it stretched his esophagus to the limit! He swore, it throat would have exploded if he tried to keep whatever was coming up! He was left with no choice... In one flush, it was mere seconds that Franky, Zoro, and Sanji were sent gushing from his mouth! They flowed seamlessly into the water, as if they had just reachd the end of a water slide! Holding his breath, Franky immediately began to swim to the surface, dragging the two males along with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah! SUPER!\" He shouted, once he was at the surface! \"Chopper!\" Franky called to his friend, who was running the other way, still trying to decide what to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"F-Franky?!\" Chopper whipped around, his eyes already starting to well up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time for tears, reindeer gorilla! We need some CPR on these guys, stat!\" Franky tossed Zoro and Sanji over to Chopper, their unconscious bodies floating face-up towards Chopper, who immediately picked them both up! He began to work immediately, trying to perform CPR on two men at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still feel a pulse! They just need...!\" Chopper suddenly slapped the two of them across their faces! The immediate shock reminded their bodies to breath! Their pale skin immediately started to flush with color as they started breathing once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, it's that easy? Maybe I should be a docot...\" Franky thought to himself, scratching his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...!?\" Zoro gasped, looking around, seeing the towering brown fur that was Chopper! He smiled down at his friends, glad that they were okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Smoker! He's coming!\" Sanji shouted out of shock, not fact. He soon felt Chopper's hoof brushing across his forehead as he smiled down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry! You're okay! For now...\" Chopper gazed over at Sanji, speaking sweetly to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah... Speakin' of which, where is Smoke dude?\" Franky asked, looking around in the water...</span></div></div>",

Luffy had nearly exhausted the entire food supply, Chopper and Franky needed more raw materials, and Robin had ran out of reading material. Everyone had their reasons for going to market, except one man. That man was none other than Roronoa Zoro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro laid out on the beach, his eyes closed as he listened to the soft lull of the waves, and the seagulls flying lazily in the sky. There were a few people visiting the beach, but as long as none of them bothered Zoro, he wouldn't bother them either. Unfortunately for him, that wasn't going to happen today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zoro laid there, his peace was interrupted when wave after wave of sand was carelessly kicked in his face! Zoro sputtered before immediately sitting right up, looking for his offender! A tall, brown haired man walked right off, paying no mind to Zoro! Zoro sprung right up and chased after the man, tapping his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" He said in a gruff tone, clearly displeased. The man turned around. His eyes were sort of... Glazed. He had a bit of an aura of stupidity to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whuh?\" The careless stranger asked Zoro, looking down at him. It was at this moment Zoro saw that this man was at least a foot, if not a foot and a half, taller than him! Not to mention he had a body that rivaled that of a heavyweight bodybuilder! He had a volleyball tucked under his right arm as he looked down at the moss headed man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kicked sand in my face.\" Zoro said sternly. One of his eyes was still closed tight, irritated by some of the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What's a sack of bones like you gonna do?\" The man asked, giving Zoro's shoulder a shove. Such power! Zoro was actually pushed back a few inches!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? Apologize!\" Zoro barked at him, \"Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't apologizing for nothing!\" The man replied. He tossed the ball behind him and gave Zoro a more forceful shove, knocking him to the ground! \"Especially to some scrawny little dwarf like you!\" He stomped his foot hard on Zoro's chest, winding the brave swordsman. \"How 'bout you just get off my beach, thin mint?\" The man gave Zoro an extra kick of sand before turning around and resuming his game with his friends. Zoro soon sat up, wiping his face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worthless punk...\" Zoro grumbled as he got to his feet. He turned and made his way into town, still steamed over the whole incident. As he walked through town, he saw a few of his friends, but he didn't bother meeting up with them. Right now, he prefered to be alone. As he walked along aimlessly, he feet had ended up dragging him into a blacksmith of sorts. As he wandered in, there were a few others wandering within. Someone would have greeted him, but the cashier, as well as the owner, were busy talking. Zoro idly listened in on the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I don't care WHERE you dump it, just get rid of it!\" The man told him. \"I'm not going to sacrifice my reputation over a stupid cursed sword!\" Zoro's ears perked up! He heard someone's footsteps, and as he turned his eyes, he saw someone leaving the store! Without drawing any attention to himself, Zoro casually walked out of the store, and began to tail the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut on the streets of the market, the man was walking, holding the supposed \"cursed\" sword in a large cloth over his shoulder. It wouldn't be too hard to just take it from him, but then he'd risk looking like a theif! It was best to just keep on following him, and wait until he dumped the sword off before snatching it up for himself! Zoro followed the man all the way down the street, and soon realized that this was the exact same way he had come up! The young man soon led Zoro back to the port where the Thousand Sunny was located. The man wandered off onto the pier, looking left and right, before tossed the sword into the water, and sprinting off! He dashed right past Zoro, not even noticing him! Zoro walked up to the water and took his shirt off. Zoro had a dazzling physique, that comparable to a model! His tanned skin accentuated his sexiness, while the scar along his body gave him a manly air. Without wasting another second, Zoro dove in after the sword! The water was cold, and Zoro had to be quick before the sword sunk down too deep to reach! His muscular arms pushed him further and further down, and in mere seconds, he spotted the sword! Pushing himself just a little bit harder, he managed to swim down and clasp it in his arms! Tucking it under one arm, he used his other to swim back up to the surface... And just in time too! His lungs were starting to feel the strain of not having air...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro tossed the sword up onto the stone pier before pulling himself up. He sat there for a moment, taking in big breaths of air to recouperate. As he sat there, he heard a dull growling! He turned around, but no one was there! The noisy growl echoed again, but this time, Zoro could see the package containing the sword beginning to rumble! Zoro picked up the sword, and unraveled the cloth. There stood the sheathed sword. It gave off an eerie purple aura. Zoro couldn't help but notice the mystical seal on the sheath, which was holding the sword and it's container together! Zoro didn't mind much. He was fearless! Without a second thought, he pulled the sword from it's cage, breaking the seal! Zoro could hear the growling much louder now, watching as the sword shook before him! The metal was black as a moonless night, and reflected the shine of the setting sun off it's dark blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" A deep voice bellowed. Zoro rose an eyebrow. \"I am what mortals call a muramasa. My name is Kinninusu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... So a talking sword, eh?\" Zoro said, holding it sideways. He gave it a slash, getting a feel for it's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seek power... Yes?\" The sword then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What're you talking about? What would you know?\" Zoro asked, \"You're just a sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All men crave power. Power is what rules this world. And I can give you that power. All of it.\" Kinninusu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? And jus how are you going to do that?\" Zoro asked, obviously suspicious of the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That much is easy. I am not a sword that cuts. I drain.\" Kinninusu replied, \"Slash anyone with me, and their energy will drain, and fill you up, making you bigger and stronger! Unlimited power is yours to wield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That right?\" Zoro asked, holding the sword up high as he now stood. \"Guess you're pretty useful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kehkehkeh... Yes... My master...\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro chuckled. \"Alright, I'll give you a shot! And I think I know just the person...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoro turned and made his way...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a splendid summer day on Mount Paozu. The birds were chirping, the sun was shining and there was a gentle breeze blowing that offset the high temperature perfectly. All the creatures, big and small, were out and about, taking advantage of it. Some, however, were taking advantage of it in an altogether different manner. Inside the Son household, there was completely silence except for a loud snore coming from one of the bedrooms and the soft sound of rushing water coming from the bathroom. The Son house was small, with only as many rooms as was strictly necessary. Two bedrooms, one for Goku and Chi-Chi and the other for Goten and Gohan to share, one bathroom (mostly for Chi-Chi and Gohan now that he was old enough to have experiences with indoor plumbing via school and friend's houses), one kitchen, and one living room for down time (Chi-Chi being, again, the only person to get much use out of it. Gohan used his room and friend's houses while Goku and Goten preferred being outside). While Goku was taking a nap after having gone fishing and bathing afterward, Gohan had recently come home from school and was taking a shower in the bathroom. Everything was calm...right up until the door was suddenly flung open and Goten came rushing in. He dropped something carelessly on the dinner table before running as fast as he could to his father's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy! Daddy!\" He shouted, jumping on top of the slumbering Goku. \"I'm home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku jumped and let out a little yell, looking around wildly before seeing Goten. He smiled and sat up, picking Goten up at the same time. \"Hey Goten! Did you have fun over at Trunks' house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten giggled as his father set him down on the floor. \"Yeah! It was tons of fun! We trained for awhile and I almost beat him this time in a sparring match! It was so cool! You should have seen the look on his face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great!\" Goku said enthusiastically, standing up and hunting around for his clothes. He had been napping in a pair of boxers and nothing more. He was allowed to be more lax whenever Chi-Chi wasn't around and since she was spending the month with her father in her old village the Son men could act in any way they wanted! Gohan took care of all the domestic chores along with doing his homework. It was a lot for an average high school kid but he could more than handle it. Gohan was one of the lucky few to be gifted with brains AND brawn. Goku was soon dressed in his standard orange gi, matching his son Goten. Father and son then made their way to the kitchen to start looking for something to eat. Goku always had a bit of an appetite after taking a nap. Before he could search the cupboards for anything to snack on before dinner, however, he noticed a strange looking gun of some kind on the table. Curious, he went over to it, picking it up to examine it more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Goten?\" He asked, turning to his son who was standing on top of the counter to reach the higher cupboards. \"Do you have any idea what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten glanced over his shoulder and said, \"Yeah! That's something Trunks gave me to try out! He said it's a...a...Matter...E...E...Exp...I can't remember what he called it. There were too many big words! He said you just have to set it and then point it at something and fire to make it work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku scratched his head. He couldn't make heads or tails of the strange thing. There was a switch of some kind on the side that could be flicked up or down. It was currently in the middle. Goten, a box of cereal in his hands, suddenly grabbed the gun and flicked the switch up. \"There! He said to make sure it was up first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't remember anything else he said about it?\" Goku asked, clumsily pointing the gun. He had next to no experience when it came to hand held weaponry. The closest he had come to it was when he had fought opponents who used guns. All he knew was that if he or any of his friends or family members got shot (except perhaps Chi-Chi) they would survive with little damage. It came with having a powerful alien heritage. It was because of this that he wasn't exactly using proper gun safety as he waved it around, looking for something to shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten shook his head and said, \"He just said that something cool happens when you shoot something with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku shrugged, aimed it at random and pulled the trigger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Goku felt a bit like a kid, playing with what he thought of as a toy gun. Carelessly, he fired it, and a bright yellow beam shot out! It flung directly at a silver plate that was on the counter, drying. It reflected the beam right back at Goku, who took the hit square in his chest, pushing him back a little and nearly falling over Goten! He quickly caught his balance, and looked down at the gun. As he looked behind himself, he saw Goten sitting there, pouring out some cereal into a bowl for a midday snack. Looks like he didn't even notice the bright beam shoot out! Goku sighed. That probably would have scared him, so it was best he didn't see it anyway. However, Goku immediately began to feel a change within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, he could feel his pecs pressing tighter against his gi. He mouth dropped a tiny bit as he was slowly able to see more and more of his chest as it pressed against the opening of his shirt! His eyes immediately switched over to his biceps. His sleeves were quickly getting tighter against his arms, pressing uncomfortably against the growing arms. He lifted his arm and flexed it, making a tear right along the peak of his huge arm. His shoulders and back began working outward, giving him a top-heavy look. Slowly, he ran his arms down his sides, and could feel his abs starting to thicken up, pushing outward, farther and father until they were just a millimeter short of touching his shirt. What was left that Goku couldn't feel didn't mean it wasn't growing as well! Goku's already meaty thighs seemed to grow in little explosions that made them a whole inch bigger! His calves became even bigger, making his pants feel quite tight all around. Thankfully the saiyan was barefoot, for even his feel began to stretch and expand into two large stomping machines. Goku's ass started to push out as well, slowly growing closer and closer to Goten's face as the boy, unaware of his father's growth, ate his cereal. Then Goku felt something that made him blush a little. His thick, eight and a half inch dick started to throb slightly, snaking downward and engorging as it too grew even larger, filling up to a nice ten inch beast! And that was just when it was soft! His bulge pressed out in front of him, although not quite as far out as his muscular ass did. Of course, to accommodate all this new size, Goku shot up at least a good six inches in height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku marveled over himself, looking at his new, better body! He looked over at Goten, who was still unaware. Goku took the gun in his hand, and started to tip-toe away. \"Uh, Goten, I'm going to head back to my room real quick...\" He said to his son, already halfway out the doorway. \"I forgot... Underwear!\" He said, trying to think of an excuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Okay.\" Goten replied, his eyes questioning as he didn't see his father in the room anymore. \"That's weird...\" Goten mumbled. \"... I don't even wear underwear!\" Goten stretched the waistband of his pants and looked down, chuckling to himself as he saw his boyhood down below. Innocent to it as ever, he let his waistband slap back to his body, and resumed eating his cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku, meanwhile, closed the door behind him, and looked down at the gun. \"This thing is awesome!\" He chuckled. He flexed a little and tried moving around. Unlike going \"ultimate super saiyan\" as he did in the past, he was just as mobile and fast as he was when he was normal size! The obvious exception being that now he was a much more massive man! Goku walked over, standing in front of Chi-Chi's vanity mirror. He had a firm, determined look on his face, as he then flexed hard! Every slab of muscle pushed outward, even tearing down his chest a little. Goku chuckled, looking down. \"Oops! Guess I still don't know my own strength!\" He grabbed his pec, bouncing it a little in his hand. All that unquestionable power within, almost begging to be unleashed and shown to the world. Goku pulled down on the torn collar, looking at his bulging pec as it flopped out of the cloth. Goku grinned. \"Wow! I look even more powerful than before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Goku looked down at the gun that he had set down on the desk of the mirror. He was already this strong now... Why not get even stronger!?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Goku was always trying to find new ways of making himself stronger. It was his greatest joy to be able to train his body more and more under harsher and harsher conditions in order to build up his body, his muscles bulging just a little bit bigger, his clothes becoming just a bit tighter, and fighting off opponents that, even months earlier in his life, would have been able to easily take him out. It was a bitter sweet victory to have defeated not just the strongest warrior in the galaxy but the strongest fighters in the universe period! Even the gods of the universe couldn't hold a candle to his fighting strength. Truly the universe was lucky that it's greatest fighter was such a kind hearted man who wouldn't even think of exerting any kind of command over the universe. His passion was in fighting, getting stronger, and fighting stronger opponents and absolutely nothing else. He grinned as he lifted the gun up a little higher. Now he could actually make himself stronger! And it wouldn't require getting into the gravity room (which he didn't always have access to) or the Hyperbolic Time Chamber (which he could no longer use in his lifetime) to do it! All he had to do was point...and shoot~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to make sure to reward Goten somehow for bringing this home!\" Goku said with a grin, pointing the muzzle of the gun at the mirror. Without another word, he pulled the trigger. Once again a beam of light lanced out of it, pushing his body back (though his now bigger body didn't move back quite as far as the last time he had fired), before striking the mirror and bouncing back, hitting the excited Saiyan straight in the chest! Immediately his body began to grow once more, his clothes becoming even tighter on his frame as his muscles bulged outward, thick veins rising up to the surface as the energy from the gun coursed through his body and pumped it up! With a single surge he grew another six inches taller, putting him up at around 7 feet tall! The belt around his gi had come undone by this time, forced apart by Goku's abs as they sprang out, his undershirt rising up to show off the beautiful bottom row to the world. His chest caused similar devastation, ripping his undershirt right down the center, his thick pecs pushing up through the collar of his gi. His biceps expanded similarly, the thick arm muscles destroying whatever was left of Goku's sleeves. Down below the waist the same kind of changes were occurring! His thighs now fully filled his once baggy pants, his calves ripping apart the hem line of the pants legs. His big bare feet were now even bigger and wider to accommodate his new weight. His forearms had also grown thicker and stronger, giving his now bigger hands an even stronger grip. Last, and certainly not least, his package easily filled up his boxers and then some, the now smaller undergarments beginning to look more like a speedo than boxers! His ass was causing similar strain in the back, the bottom parts of the boxers covering only half of each cheek!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku chuckled and set the gun down on the vanity in front of him, flexing his arms. He had to bend down to be able to see them properly, the seat of his pants bursting open as soon as he bent his powerful legs. He didn't care in the slightest, he was so busy flexing and staring at himself. \"Oh man! Look how HUGE I am! This is awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bounced his pecs playfully, the thick muscles tearing his undershirt to shreds with every pump! Every time he flexed a muscle he could feel the intense strength inside it coiling up, begging to be released in some way! Even his footsteps were more powerful, his every movement causing the room to shake. Goku had always had power, but this was the first time in his life he FELT the power in a physical way. It was an intoxicating feeling. Without really thinking about it, a smile still plastered across his face, he grabbed the gun again and fired it into the mirror, three times in quick succession! The bolts of energy fired out and struck the mirror, one after another, combining together into one powerful blast that sent Goku flying backward a few feet. He hadn't been expecting such a powerful kick and he nearly lost his balance, only barely managing to keep to his feet. His feelings of shock, however, were quickly replaced by feelings of pure pleasure as his growth was far more intense than the first two times! With a moan, Goku's body stretched taller and wider, his gi top ripping to shreds on his huge torso, his pecs practically jumping out further from his body, his abs close behind, the rows moving up to make room for another, giving him an incredibly defined eight pack. His back flared out as his traps rose up around his thicker neck, his shoulders broadening to make room. His biceps swelled like there was a hose attached to them, pumping them up bigger and bigger. His thighs caused his pants to literally explode, scraps of orange fabric fluttering down to the floor, his calves tightening and expanding while his feet sped up to catch up to the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was so caught up in his growth, he didn't notice the ceiling until his head smashed into it, cracks radiating out from where it struck while bits of plaster and dust rained down on top of him. Goku quickly crouched down, his underwear ripping off as he did so, leaving him completely nude, his impressive cock dangling obscenely between his legs, his globular ass thrust towards the door for anyone to see. Still his height increased another foot or so, leaving him ten feet tall in a nine foot tall room! Luckily the growth appeared to stop, leaving Goku massive, naked, and completely excited!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Look how HUGE I am! This is so cool!\" His voice blasted out of him, much louder and slightly deeper than it used to be. The sheer volume rattled the windows! Goku didn't seem to notice or care though. He was too busy hefting his pecs in his hands, testing their weight, before flexing his biceps as hard as he could, pushing them to expand just a little more with every flex!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis attention on his body was quickly broken as there came a series of knocks on his door. \"Dad? Is everything okay in there?\" It was Gohan! He must have finished his shower!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah! Everything's fine! Totally fine! Don't worry about me! Ahahahaha...hehehehehe...eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? You sound kind of...weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure! I'll be out in a little bit! I'm just...changing into something more comfortable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay...if you say so.\" Gohan sounded unsure, but still left his father to his own devices. He needed to get dressed himself. He was only currently in a pair of boxers with a towel around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku sighed, rubbing the back of his head. He didn't like lying to his son, but he couldn't really think of any other way to handle the situation. He leaned back slightly and grabbed the gun. \"I wonder if Gohan would make me give it back or stop using it if he knew about it?\" Goku thought to himself, turning the gun over in his hand. \"Hmm...If I was bigger though...he couldn't tell me what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed like the proper leap in logic that the situation would require in Goku's mind. Besides, if Gohan could see how awesome it would be to be huge he might not have as many reservations about it! Goku nodded to himself and pointed the gun back at himself. Taking a deep breath, he began to pull the trigger. Burst after burst of energy flowed into his body, the shocks no longer pushing him back even slightly. After pulling the trigger a fair few times Goku's body began to shake. He grinned and held onto the gun, excited for this next bought of growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this was going on, Goten was jumping on his bed while Gohan pulled out his homework, now dressed in his normal purple gi, and started working on it. He had promised Goten he would train with him after he was done with his homework. He had barely written his name on his latest assignment before the house began to violently shake! Goten stopped jumping and looked a little nervous, his eyes darting all over the room. \"G-Gohan? What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Goten! Come her!\" Gohan held his arms open and Goten, needing no further invitation, jumped into his older brother's arms. Gohan made his way to the door and quickly pulled it open. He jumped back, his face wearing an expression of pure shock, as he saw an enormous &lt;choice&gt; in front of him!</span></div></div>",

Upon closer inspection, and judging by the curves, it looked like it was a giant foot! But how did that get here? As Gohan thought to himself, Goten spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you hear laughing?\" The younger brother asked. Gohan stopped and listened for a moment. He could! It sounded a bit muffled, but it was coming from somewhere nearby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gohan began to think, he noticed at the foot was starting to press at the door! Taking Goten, he backed away and made for the back exit. The two just managed to escape in time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them got far enough away, Goten was set on the ground, as Gohan turned to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on in there...?\" Gohan mumbled. Soon enough, the teen would have his answer! Cracks suddenly began to form along one part of the rounded house. Those cracks soon spread, and Gohan could hear the sound of someone's voice. \"Dad!\" Gohan shouted, immediately realizing he had forgotten him! Gohan started to dash back to the house, but before he could make it, a large beast exploded out from one part of the house, sending debris flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, that's so much better!\" The voice said. Gohan's eyes went wide. He knew that voice! He looked back at the house, and up at the massive giant sitting in the rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dad?\" Gohan called out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked to the side. \"Gohan?\" He called back. \"Is that you?\" Goku started to look around. He couldn't even see past his thick, massive pecs to where Gohan was standing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Gohan mumbled to himself. \"How the heck did you get so big!?\" He shouted up to his father. Goku chuckled, showing off the now tiny (in comparison) gun in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look pretty great, right?\" Goku said, flexing his arms as hard as he could. Not only were his gargantuan arms bulked up and flexing, but his pecs seemed to push out a little more as well! Goku was a behemoth, in every sense of the word!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dad? Maybe you should give me that gun...\" Gohan said a bit shakily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? No way! It's mine!\" Goku replied. He turned the gun at himself, and used the corner of his nail to pull the trigger a good three or four times! He laughed a little as he felt the beams land against his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan's mouth gaped open, as he looked up and up and UP at his growing father! Goku's already massively buffed up pecs pushed out even further from his chest! Goku's thick arms bulked up immensely, becoming the size of two hills of muscle pushed into his arms! Goku's abs pushed out even further, each like a steel brick. His thighs were becoming thicker as Goku sat cross legged, and Gohan could just barely see as his diamond-hard calves flared up. Goku's feet continued to expand, destroying even more of the house under their immense size, as Goku's back and traps started to push out even more, making him look extremely top heavy! And though Gohan couldn't see it, his father's mammoth of a cock was pulsing, growing even bigger than it already was, while his tight, bubble butt grew even thicker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku laughed, bouncing his pecs proudly before his sons. \"See that? There's no question I'm the strongest warrior in the world!\" Goku said proudly. Gohan was left speechless. \"And it's all thanks to this-- ... This... Uh oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh?\" Gohan repeated, \"Wh-Why are you saying that?\" He asked worridly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the gun... I...\" Goku babbled...</span></div></div>",

It was impressive how a man so scarily huge and powerful could look so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan sighed and said, \"Where did you drop it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked down, trying to lean forward, but still unable to see passed his enormous pecs. \"I can't see! But I think it was somewhere in the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan nodded and turned to Goten. \"You stay out here Goten, okay? I'm going to go in and look for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Goten said, smiling up at his brother. Gohan turned and headed for the front door, which was still standing in the half ruined house.He opened the door and slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gohan began to search around the fallen debris and his father's massive body, Goten shyly walked up to Goku's hand, which was resting on the ground, and poked it. Goku looked down, smiling at his youngest son. \"Hey Goten! What are you doing down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing!\" He called up, putting his hands behind his back. \"You're really big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku flexed his arms, his biceps erupting upwards into a split peak, veins crawling over the massive mounds. \"Pretty cool, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Goten said, giggling. \"It's really cool! I've got the biggest dad in the world! Trunks is going to be so jealous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku rubbed his chest as he listened to Goten. When he mentioned Trunks, Goku had suddenly got a flash of Vegeta in his mind. Being the biggest and the strongest in the universe was fine, but he wanted to be able to prove it by fighting a really strong opponent. Unfortunately, at his massive size, no one would pose even a slight threat! Goku could feel an immense power coiled in his body at the slightest movements. Without even trying he could probably demolish the entire planet! If Gohan found the gun though, he could go out and make some new rivals! Even his old friends who hadn't been able to keep up as their enemies grew ever stronger could be molded into worthy opponents! Goku grinned as he thought of all the possibilities~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the house, Gohan was having a rough time. Goku's entire upper body had jutted out of the house when he grew, leaving only his crossed legs and his enormous genitals inside. There was a heavy musk radiating from Goku's crotch, filling the air. It made him feel slightly dizzy, his face flushed. There was so much debris to move, Gohan feared it would take forever to find the gun. Standing still, just to the right of his father's thick thigh, he tried to think of the most likely place for the gun to be. Goku had showed it to him, he had asked for it, Goku had used it on himself, and then (it was safe to assume) he had dropped it somewhere. He had been holding it at chest height, which meant it probably fell straight down from there, which would mean the gun had landed...in his father's...lap. Gohan sighed and began to climb over the thigh. The striations were so thick Gohan had plenty of hand holds. Once he reached the top, he slide down the leg and landed between Goku's legs. He was now faced with the enormous genitals of his father. His cock was thick and long, stretching across the floor like a snake, resting atop two boulder sized balls, surrounded by a thick crop of dark black pubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my luck, I know exactly where the gun is going to be...\" Gohan muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to be on the safe side, he searched the area all around the dick first, moving aside planks of wood, shattered dishes, and parts of the roof. No luck. With a heavy sigh, Gohan turned to face his dad and advanced to the pubes. He had a feeling the gun would be somewhere tangled in the hairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Goku and Goten were both getting impatient. \"How much longer are you going to be in there Gohan?\" Goku called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just give me a minute!\" Gohan weakly shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaad, this is boring!\" Goten said. \"I wanna go back in my room and play!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't move until Gohan finds the gun.\" Goku explained. \"But when he does, we'll all do something fun together! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten instantly perked up and cheered. \"Yay! Fun stuff, fun stuff!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the house, Gohan was carefully combing through the slightly moist hair with his fingers, trying to locate the thing that had started this whole mess. He wasn't having the best of luck and it was hard to keep his balance on Goku's ball, the skin constantly shifting under the teen's bare feet. Finally, after what felt like ages of searching, he parted some hair at the base of Goku's dick and saw the gleam of metal. Eagerly he wrapped his hand around the object and tugged, only to find that it had gotten tangled up in the pubes! Sweaty, tired, and completely flustered at the whole situation, Gohan wasn't about to leave empty handed! He grabbed the gun in both hands and gave it an almighty tug! The gun, luckily, came free with relative ease. Unfortunately, some of the hairs and been wrapped around the trigger and the tugging had cause it to be pulled as Gohan freed it! The only question was, just where had the gun been pointing when it had gone off?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gohan landed rather hard on his butt as the gun jumped and sparked in his hand, unleashing a blast of growth energy directly at Goku! The teenage half saiyan looked up in dismay as his father's body glowed briefly before it began to expand once again! Gohan got to his feet as his father's dick suddenly surged forward, the head nearly bowling Gohan over as it grew past him. Goku's thighs thickened and towered even more above Gohan's head, bursting through the ceiling as they outgrew the inside of the house. A loud creaking and groaning filled the air as the few still standing supports started to snap and break. Gohan gulped and looked around, trying to find an escape,moving amongst the debris and his father's expanding body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Goku looked down at himself in shock as he felt a jolt of energy enter his body. His look of confusion turned to one of happiness as he felt himself growing once more! Goten looked up in awe as his father's massive form took up even more of his sight, filling the sky above him. Goku, feeling cramped inside the hollowed out remains of his home, stretched his legs out, his gigantic feet bursting through the walls like they were made of paper, spreading them out with a relieved sigh. His calves balled up and pushed outward, his feet thickening and lengthening as the heels dug up the grass, the toes pointing up at the sky. Goten let out a little yelp and started running away, Goku's thigh threatening to overtake him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku was too enthralled with his own body to notice this. His hands squeezed his monstrous pecs as they inflated more and more, pushing out like a shelf over his abs, each row popping out one by one, tightening, an impenetrable wall of muscle. His shoulders broadened while his back flared out, each valley becoming more pronounced, his neck thickening while his traps rose up around it. Goku flexed his arms, grinning as he saw the biceps bulge upward, swelling bit by bit, peaking before suddenly swelling even larger and rounder! His forearms kept pace, thickening and giving him an unparalleled grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth slowly came to a halt, the wreckage of his house now entirely replaced by one of his titanic balls. Goku playfully wiggled his toes as he looked over his body, a childish smile on his face. Every muscle on his body was bulging with size and power, his upper body especially looking quite thick. Clenching his fist, the saiyan giant could feel power such as he'd never felt before coursing through his veins. Nothing and no one would be able to even come close to matching him in a fight! \"Maybe they'd have a better chance if they all fought me at once!\" He thought to himself, the idea making him chuckle. Even such a simple sound rolled powerfully from within him, rumbling over the landscape like approaching thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, Goten was shielding his eyes with both hands, gazing up in total awe at his father. He was like a bug compared to the giant man in front of him, but, oddly enough, he wasn't afraid in the slightest! He grinned and jumped up and down, waving his arms. \"Hey! Heeeeey! Daaaaaad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku's ear twitched as he faintly heard the squeaking voice of his youngest son. Turning his head, he glanced down at the ground and smiled as he spied his bug sized son. Being as careful as he could be, he pinched the back of Goten's shirt between his massive index finger and thumb and lifted him up. Goten got a close up view of Goku's slowly passing abs, the ridges in between them looking big enough to hide in, his wide, bulging chest that filled his entire view, and finally his grin, showcasing an impressive set of pure white teeth. Goku adjusted Goten so he was dangling in front of one of his eyes and said, \"Hey Goten! What do you think of your dad now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten laughed and shouted, \"You're so cool dad! No one is bigger or stronger than you now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku chuckled and said, \"Yup! I'd like to see anyone try to destroy the earth now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten held up his tiny fists and shouted, \"You'd beat them without even trying!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku grinned, Goten's words feeding his ego. He would have listened to Goten singing his praises for longer if a sudden thought hadn't interrupted it. \"Hey! Where's Gohan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten put his finger to his mouth and thought. \"He was in the house wasn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked down and saw only the scattered remains of his house, smashed to bits under his genitals. \"Uh oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm..I think I now where Gohan is.\"</span></div></div>",

It was probably the best way to put it for now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get him!\" Goten said happily, flying right on down to where his father's manhood lie in wait. Goten plugged his nose, fanning his face. \"Pee yew! It smells weird down here!\" He said to himself, looking around at his surroundings. As Goten walked around, he took note of everything around him, namely, their ruined home. He couldn't find anything familiar quite yet, until finally, his foot his something. \"Huh?\" Goten looked down, one hand still plugging his nose. \"Oh! Hey! It's you!\" Goten said happily, picking up the gun. \"I was wondering where you went!\" The young saiyan then pocketed the gun. He then heard a loud groan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Goten... Is that you?\" Gohan called out. He lifted his head, still a bit groggy and disoriented from the sudden weight hitting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gohan!\" Goten rushed over to his brother, who was under some big, fleshy orb. \"There you are! I was looking for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goten, help me out!\" Gohan said, extending his hand out to his brother. Goten grabbed on and helped yank Gohan right out from under his father's musky balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ew, Gohan! You stink!\" Goten said, giggling a little as he resumed plugging his nose. Gohan just blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, well...\" He scratched the back of his head, looking down at the ground. \"Hey! Why are you down here?\" Gohan asked, looking at Goten. Goten scratched his head. He had kind of forgotten... Between finding the gun and the smell permeating the air, his short little attention span wore itself right out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten just shrugged. Gohan shook his head. \"Look, I'm going to go talk to dad, okay? You should go back to Trunk's house.\" Gohan said, forgetting about the gun for a moment. Goten nodded happily, and immediately flew off. Now it was just up to Gohan to convince his father to find a cure to all this...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Goten was a good little brother and always did what he was told. Immediately after Gohan said to go to Trunks' house, he obeyed, flying into the sky and heading towards West City. He looked behind him and giggled as he saw his enormous father, leaning back on his hands, smiling at a floating speck in front of his face that was clearly his brother. It was a funny sight, especially to him! He turned his attention forward once more and sped up, wanting to get to Trunks' house as fast as possible! He wanted to show Trunks just what kind of machine he had given up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took the young half saiyan about ten minutes to fly to West City and about five minutes after that to land in front of Capsule Corp. He charged forward and started jamming his finger against the doorbell, a loud ringing sound echoing through the house. The door was opened by a very irritable looking Vegeta. Goten's smile never wavered for a second, even in the face of such a sour look. \"Hey Mr. Vegeta! I'm here to play with Trunks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta let out a sigh and said, \"Very well. He's in his room. Don't make too much noise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten giggled and ran inside, Vegeta closing the door behind him before heading to a different part of the house. It felt like it was going to be a very long day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten ran down the many halls of the Capsule Corp. building, going up and down stairs before skidding to a halt in front of Trunks' room. He hammered on the door excitedly calling out, \"Trunks! Trunks! Open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks opened the door with a grin and said, \"Hey Goten! What's up? I didn't think you'd be back so soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten ran inside and pulled out the gun. \"Remember this thing you gave me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks closed the door and crossed his arms. \"Yeah? What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Know what it does?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...why? What does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten giggled and pointed the gun at himself. \"Watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't go shooting yourself you crazy kid!\" Trunks shouted, running up to Goten to try and stop him. Before he had even taken two steps, Goten had pulled the trigger, engulfing his body in a burst of energy. Goten grinned as he felt power flooding his body, slowly stretching it taller and wider. Trunks' eyes widened in shock as he saw his once short friend slowly rise up, higher and higher, until Trunks was staring at Goten's chest, the once barely defined pecs bulging out a few inches from his chest! Trunks gaped up at Goten's grinning face, watching it slowly rise higher above him, the thin arms of his friend bulking up size after size after size, the sleeves of his undershirt tearing slightly, similar tearing sounds coming from around his chest. As his shoulders broadened, his gi came untied, the shirt and undershirt slowly rising up to show that Goten's once flat stomach was now decorated with at least two rows of abs, a probably third row forming as the gun worked its magic over the once small boy. The cuffs of his pants were rising up in a similar fashion, getting caught around the thick bulge of his developing calves, his little boots bulging all over as his feet grew too big for them, his toes bursting out the ends. Finally, the growth came to a stop when Trunks only reached up to Goten's abs, the young half saiyan's clothes ripped and ill fitting. Goten grinned and said, \"Pretty cool, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks' look of surprise suddenly turned to one of pure excitement. \"Holy crap Goten! That's...That's awesome! You just grew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! My dad grew too!\" Goten said happily, crouching down slightly so he was on the same level as Trunks. \"You should see him! He's super huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How huge?\" Trunks asked, curious how powerful this gun was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like...so huge he could...um...probably smash this whole building under his foot in one step!\" Goten said, trying to think of a good way to describe Goku's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks' eyes widened. \"No way! That's crazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! My dad is the strongest in the whole universe!\" Goten said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks felt a twinge of jealousy at that. \"Oh yeah? Well...Not for long!\" he suddenly reached out and ripped the gun from Goten's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Give that back!\" Goten shouted, advancing on Trunks who was running to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh!\" Trunks said, sticking his tongue out at Goten. \"Your dad had his turn now it's my dad's turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair!\" Goten replied, smacking into the door which Trunks had pulled shut on him. \"Ow! That was mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wrenched the door open and looked left and then right. Trunks was nowhere in sight! He was moving fast! Goten picked a direction at random and charged down it, hoping to catch up with Trunks and stop him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks, meanwhile, was running as fast as he could, trying to find Vegeta. Goten and he had always gotten into arguments over whose dad was the strongest. Neither boy would ever willingly admit that their respective father wasn't the best and the arguments usually turned into brawls. Trunks wasn't about to let Goku get an unfair advantage! Especially since it was his family that had made the gun in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was starting to worry that Vegeta had left when he passed by the kitchen. Vegeta was inside, looking through the cupboards. Perfect! He wasn't paying attention! Trunks took careful aim, making sure that he wouldn't miss...</span></div></div>",

Vegeta was pushed forward into the counter from the initial shot, before his head whipped around to see what the hell had just shot him! There was no one there. Vegeta started making his way to the entrance. He had an idea of who did it, and when he got ahold of him, they were going to get a little spanking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Vegeta stopped about halfway to the entryway, as his eyes went wide! His body suddenly started to heat up, and all of his limbs felt heavier, as if over a thousand times gravity all at once! He fell to his knees, and shortly after he did, he felt as every one of his muscles beginning to expand all at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all started in Vegeta's legs. His already muscular thighs started getting bigger and bigger as they filled out the black shorts he was wearing! The once loose fitting garmet was quickly becoming tight on him, and only getting tighter by the second! In fact, his thighs got so large, they actually started to tear already! The gun must have had a more potent effect on Vegeta than it did on Goku! Vegeta's calves soon followed, each growing cut like diamonds and ripped like thunder! The saiyan prince's feet also were growing, stretching across the floor, his large toes clenched in reaction to the growth! Up higher, Vegeta's abs pushed out further, putting more mass and definition, before stretching out into an eight pack! The man's arms were clenched, and as his biceps flexed, the continued to grow. Bigger, beefier, more powerful, as if the already beyond powerful man needed it! His shoulders bulked up immensely, and his back expaned, the muscles rippling and long, like a canyon. Vegeta's pecs were swelling up as well, becoming like two huge, pumped up medicine balls! So far, they were the largest muscle on his body! His tanktop struggled to keep them back along with his growing traps! His pecs' gargantuan size meant that his shirt had risen up, showing off his abs! Back in his shorts, his ass had buffed up and pushed out further from his body, so bubbly that you could bounce a quarter off of it! Not to mention you could see the top of his crack from behind! And to top off the already egocentric man, his dick had begun to increase in size, pressing out further in front of him! The big snake pressed against the front of his briefs, gaining mass and size all at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks had peeked back around the corner, just in time to watch his dad's glorious transformation! By now, he must have been two feet taller than Goku originally was, and with three times the muscles! Trunks just looked at his gun, then back at his father in amazement!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta, in the meantime, had risen back to his feet, the sudden heat from the growth wearing off. As he stood up, he nearly hit his head on a low hanging lamp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Vegeta looked up at the lamp, before looking down at his body. Imagine his surprise when he saw that he had suddenly grown into a hulk of a man! He was a bit hysterical for a moment, laughing a little. Those laughs soon turned into ones of confidence, as he bounced his thick, meaty pecs, each of them coming just a few inches shy of hitting his chin! He rose up an arm and flexed it, amazing by his own strength as he saw the muscles bunch up and pulse slightly as blood rushed to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment, Vegeta noticed Trunks watching him, a ray gun in his hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\" Vegeta immediately said! Trunks, a bit freaked out and fearing his new, bigger father's rage, immediately ran off! Vegeta quickly gave chase to the boy, wanting answers now!</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that his muscles were pumped up to the max, far larger even than any body builder! In his panicked state, Trunks didn't even notice as he ran himself into a dead end! He looked left and right and was dismayed to see that the nearest doors were at least ten feet away, too far to reach as Vegeta loomed into view, his whole body seeming to fill the space in the hallway. Trunks gulped, shaking, and stared up at his giant of a father. Vegeta slowly walked forward until he was right in front of his son, his engorged pecs blocking his face as he attempted to look down at Trunks. \"Did you do this to me?\" He asked, his voice rumbling down from above those meaty pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks, unable to see his father's expression and thus unable to tell what kind of mood he was in, tremulously said, \"Y-Yeah, I did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta lifted his right hand, causing Trunks to flinch as he thought he was about to be hit, and gently tousled Trunks' lavender hair. Trunks looked up in surprise to see his father smiling down at him, though his expression was still rather stern. But that was just the way Vegeta smiled. Trunks hesitantly smiled back as Vegeta said, \"Is that little gun what did it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks nodded and held it up, placing it in Vegeta's large hand. Vegeta brought it up to his face and examined it, the machine looking like a harmless toy in his huge mitt. The trigger was far too small for his giant digit to manipulate. He handed the gun back down to Trunks and grinned, leaning forward slightly so that he could more easily see Trunks. \"Alright son...Pull the trigger again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks looked shocked at his father's suggestion. \"B-But dad! You're already huge!\" He stammered, holding the gun almost protectively against his chest. \"Y-You'll break through the building!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta let out a low moan and looked up, as though already imagining his head bursting through floor after floor before his magnificent body erupted from the roof for all of West City to see and admire! \"I don't see the problem son. Pull the trigger! Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks shakily aimed the gun at Vegeta and said, \"A-Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVegeta frowned slightly and said, \"It wasn't a question nor was it a request Trunks. Pull. The. Trigger. NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was loud enough to rattle windows. He clearly meant business. Just as Trunks was about to pull the trigger, he flashed back to what Goten ha said earlier. Something about how his Dad was bigger than a house or something...Yeah! That was the reason he had grown Vegeta in the first place! There was no way that Goten's dad was going to be better than his! He aimed the gun with a more determined air and pulled the trigger! The gun hummed as it quickly gathered energy, storing more and more the longer Trunks held the trigger. When the gun was beginning to shake slightly, a dull blue color radiating out from the barrel of the gun, Trunks let the trigger go, slamming back into the wall from the force of the gun firing! An enormous ball of energy smashed into Vegeta's chest, holding against him and nearly forcing the giant Saiyan off his feet before it was absorbed into his body! Vegeta let out a dull moan that swiftly turned into a mighty roar as his body filled to overflowing with energy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body swiftly began to grow, his chest bulging out in front of him, slamming into the wall above Trunks' head, buckling the wall and nearly going through it! The gigantic, round orbs of muscle were pressed tightly up against his chin, pulsing with pure power! Vegeta moaned louder, his head tilting back as his hands rubbed over them, squeezing them, completely absorbed in touching and feeling his body. With a grunt he ripped off the remains of his tank top, only scraps remaining after his gargantuan pecs exploded out of them. His abs down below tightened, hardened, and moved up to make room for another row, the thick muscles sticking out almost as much as his pecs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks and fallen onto his butt, cowering before his growing father, trapped by his bulk! Luckily for him, Vegeta's body began to surge upward, his head smashing through the ceiling as easily as if it was made of tissue paper, his crotch rising up past Trunks' head before lurching forward and smashing through the wall, taking apart his shorts and briefs all in one go, his balls spilling out of the ruined undergarments and landing briefly on Trunk's head before rising up off of him, passing through the ever widening hole in the ceiling! Trunks took his chance and ran forward, between Vegeta's gigantic calves, the muscles ripping apart the walls on either side of him. Vegeta's low laughter vibrated through the building, his voice calling out for \"More....More.....MORE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrunks almost ran into Goten who was looking around in fear and confusion. Trunks grabbed Goten's bigger hand and dragged him along. \"Hurry!\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" Goten asked, glancing behind him to see a titanic big toe filling the hall behind them, rushing toward them, curling and twitching slightly! Goten immediately picked Trunks up and ran faster, barely managing to escape the building before the story tall toe took them out! Both boys gaped upward at Vegeta's colossal body rising proudly from the slowly crumbling Capsule Corp building, his feet filling the dome like building up before bursting free from it, the building falling to total ruin. Vegeta grinned as he felt his body, his hands exploring his traps which rose up halfway around his thick neck, his gigantic pecs which heaved out in front of him, hanging shelf like over a ripped cobble stone road of eight perfect abs, his thick third leg flopping down nearly to his knee against his round, bloated thighs, the muscles practically rubbing up against each other! His calves were equally thick, supporting his weight easily, while his feet were long and wide, the thick toes digging into the grass and concrete around him. Vegeta flexed his biceps, fat veins rising up over the split peaks as he flexed as hard as he could, the rounded mounds looking more like mountains than muscles! Vegeta put his hands on his hips and laughed, looking around with glee at his now tiny surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only question now was, what to do with this new size? </span></div></div>",

Vegeta stood there, tall and proud, flexing one of his arms, enamored as he saw it bulge upward, pushing the veins right up against his skin! Vegeta just chuckled to himself, his deep voice rumbling from within him! The conceited man would have kept admiring himself if it wasn't for all the noise that was happening behind him! He could hear people talking as well as cars screeching to a halt! He looked over his shoulder, before turning around. He began to bend over so he could see below him. Otherwise his huge, ballooned pecs stood right in the way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, worms.\" Vegeta said with a grin, \"I see you all have noticed your prince... No... Your GOD standing before you.\" Vegeta said with a confident smirk. \"I'll tell you what... If you all get on your knees and worship me, I won't crush the life out of every last one of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Vegeta's dismay, he didn't see anyone obeying. All they seemed to do was chatter, too shocked to do anything! Vegeta's smile soon became a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No? Then I'll crush you under my foot like the bugs you are!\" Vegeta growled! He stood back up to his full height once more. The people below only got a moment of sun before they were coated in the shadow of the titanic man's foot! \"Bye bye bugs!\" Vegeta's boomed, before bringing his foot down hard onto the ground below! It made a huge quake, that shook buildings all around, bringing them quickly to the ground! Vegeta just laughed to himself, as he ground his foot into the concrete below! He then looked out to the city. \"If you all won't fall to your knees before your saiyain god, I'll just MAKE you!\" Vegeta said, taking a big stomp forward into the city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCountless buildings were smashed under Vegeta's gargantuan feet! His heel would decimate buildings, as his massive toes would crush cars like they were made of paper! Vegeta laughed, his voice echoing throughout the entire city! He stomped through, picking up a handful of small buildings and people, before mercilessly tossing them into his mouth and swallowing them whole! An ominous gulp was heard by many nearby citizens, striking fear into their hearts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the most delicious food I've tasted...\" Vegenta then pat his canyon-like abs, \"But it satisfies me...!\" Vegeta reached down for another handful, raising it to his gaping maw before tossing it in and swallowing it down! Vegeta then chuckled, wiping some debris from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant saiyan looked down and started to stomp around, demolishing more buildings than a tornado, earthquake, and tsunami combined! Vegeta was an unstoppable force that terrorized the city! And he loved every second of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bow to me! Your master! Your unstoppable ruler!\" Vegeta rose his arms up and flexed them HARD! His biceps welled up to the size of small mountains, pumped with a split peak at the top! His pecs were heaving slightly as he stood there, each a giant orb of pure power. \"None of you can stand up to me! I am all powerful! I AM A GOD!\" Vegeta roared! He then had a thought as he flaunted his strength. Why stop here? Why just one city? Why not two? Or entire countries? Or the entire world!? Vegeta's massive dick twitched slightly as he imagined himself ruling over the entire earth with one large, powerful fist! He smiled, and turned back to where Capsule Corp. once stood. He wanted to confront his son, and force him to make him even bigger!</span></div></div>",

Just one more shot can't hurt!\" He said to himself, taking aim at his image. \"Here we go!\" He said happily, pulling the trigger! Another shot fired out and hit him square in his chest! But just as it did, Goten came bursting into his room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daaaaaad! Did you take my toy?!\" He said, looking at this father's backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Goten!?\" Goku said, glancing over his shoulder. But it was too late now, the blast had already hit Goku and his body was already starting to grow! From what Goten could see, his father was getting taller and taller, his head slowly starting to approach the ceiling! His back was stretching out even further apart, a slight tear forming at the top of Goku's gi near the back of his neck! Goten was but a witness to his father, hulking out before his very eyes! Out front, Goku's pecs were starting to swell out, the already thick muscles deepening and putting on pure mass. The collar of his gi was pushed even further down, giving all a look at those bulging, round muscles. Goku's sleeves were quickly filling up to the point they were ready to rip! The cloth lied upon the peak of his bicep, and was just begging for him to flex and tear it right down the center! Such massive, powerful arms, only made even more so by his saiyan blood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Dad... You're getting huge!\" Goten said, getting excited as he watched his dad ascend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goten! Not so loud!\" Goku said in a loud whisper to his son, who was getting smaller compared to him by the second! Goku's impressive abs were bulking up even too, each one popping out into a hard brick of muscle, forming a long, cobblestone road of muscle! Below the belt, Goku's thighs had grown so large that they were starting to rub together! They were starting to tear his pants at the seams, his skin peeking out from between the holes it was making! The bottoms of his pants were starting to ride up, making the once baggy pants look like a tight pair of khakis!  Each calf was a pillar of muscle that was only getting bigger! His feet were starting to get painfully tight inside his boots, ready to burst out if they grew much bigger! As if it wasn't enough, Goku's manhood was pushing out further, forming a nice, big pouch in front of him! It was a dick to be proud of, that would make any man jealous of its size! And right behind him, his round, globular ass was popping out even more, making for two beachballs that were just begging for a smack! This, of course, went unnoticed by Goten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth, thankfully, seemed to come to a halt as soon as Goku's head hit the ceiling! He looked back and down at Goten, chuckling nervously. \"U-Uh... Hey son!\" He said to the tiny little kid, \"You mind closing the door behind you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten did as he was told, and then proceeded to walk up to his father fearlessly. He then asked, \"Hey dad! How did you get so big? Huh?\" He asked, smiling up at his father expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku glanced at the gun briefly, before looking back down at Goten. He decided that the best choice would have to be...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsuna was just leaving the front door one peaceful morning. Surprisingly enough, he hadn't seen any of his Vongola family... No Lambo or Reborn! The young brown haired boy might have been a little bit more worried if it wasn't for the fact he was enjoying all the relaxation... After all, the guys were the ones who caused the most trouble for Tsuna, especially Lambo. However, the more he thought about it, the more it started to worry him. It was one thing them to just have had suddenly gone missing, but for Nana (Tsuna's mom) to not even say anything about it was a bit strange...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to worry about it right this moment, Tsuna continued on his way to school. Along the way, he was still wasn't joined by Gokudera as he usually was... How strange... Nor, as he passed Yamamoto's, did the young baseball player join him. The worry starting to catch up with him now, Tsuna made a dash for school. Maybe there was something there that he wasn't told of... Tsuna was always making little excuses for others like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the one?\" A mysterious voice asked, pointing at Tsuna as he spied on the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Can you do it?\" A much more familiar voice asked. After all, the figure was only about the size of a baby... With a yellow pacifier. The first man just chuckled at the infants notation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am an expert! I will not fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the second man nodded, and the first one dashed out. He walked calmly behind Tsuna, doing his best to not make a sound. Quickly pulling out a rag and dousing it with chloroform, it was pressed to Tsuna's nose. Without a struggle, the boy was instantly knocked out, and the man carried him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhh....\" Tsuna groaned, as he began to wake up. Everything was pitch black. \"H-Hey! What's going on!?!?\" Tsuna shouted. He started to struggle and move, but to no avail. All his limbs were tied down, and if he was feeling it correctly, all of them were spread out. \"Am I dead?! Is anyone there!?\" Tsuna continued to shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Tsuna...\" A voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Who's that...!?\" Tsuna looked around again, but still couldn't see in this curtain of darkness. There was a sudden click, and the lights turned on, illuminating the bright room. Tsuna was blinded, slamming his eyes shut, before re-opening them slowly. He was able to make out a figure... Before his vision returned, and looked at the person before him. \"Reborn!?\" Tsuna was surprised to see his little tutor. \"There you are! I was wondering where you were! ... But... Where am I? Where are we?\" Tsuna asked, looking about the room. He saw he was laid out on an experiment table, which was raised at a 45 degree angle. His limbs were held down by steel cuffs, leaving him bound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the secret Vongola labs.\" Reborn finally answered. \"Japan branch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vongola labs...?\" Tsuna asked, \"What am I doing here?\" Tsuna was noticeably more calm than he was previously. It didn't mean he wasn't on edge anymore though. The young man was still very paranoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Recently here in Japan, we unearthed some strange tank.\" Reborn began to explain. Tsuna figured it was in his better interest to listen. \"It's horribly burned, as if it went through some kind of explosion. The tank itself had a huge hole in it when we found it, was a bit rusted out, and it wasn't easy to find either. All the plants around it had grown out of control...\" After saying this, Reborn snapped his fingers. A large, round machine was rolled in. It almost looked like a gumball machine, only the orb was filled with some strange, yellow liquid. \"After a few tests, we found out this liquid is what made the plants grow so well! So everyone back in research and development decided we need a test subject for this. They chose you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Me!? Why me!?\" Tsuna demanded to know, starting to feel increasingly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the 10th.\" Reborn answered simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this stuff even going to do to me!?\" Tsuna demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we're testing it.\" Reborn retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But!\" Tsuna began to whine once more, but before any more arguments could be had, the scientist who had rolled the machine out pulled out some kind of tentacle with a needle at the end! Tsuna shouted out in displeasure. \"Y-You're going to put that thing in me!? Let me go!\" Tsuna demanded, starting to struggle and move around. The scientist, who was surprisingly strong, held Tsuna's head down and carefully placed the needle into his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now we begin!\" Reborn said in a singsong tone, flipping a switch up into the \"on\" position! Tsuna's eyes were on the liquid, as it ran through, starting at the machine, and to his neck! He could feel his heart racing already, everything somehow moving so fast yet so slow at the same time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsuna's heart raced as his breathing slowly got heavier, his eyes becoming half lidded as he felt the liquid get pumped into his body. He couldn't quite believe that the people he considered friends would ever allow him to be pumped with some strange, unknown liquid from an ancient and rusted machine. Then again, his friends weren't exactly difficult to fool. All it would take would be a few pleasant words from Reborn and they would each be on board. At least it explained why his walk to school had been so deserted...this was no doubt all part of Reborn's sick plan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna was so busy ruminating on his situation that he barely noticed the changes his body was going through. The yellow liquid sent little shocks throughout his body. It reminded Tsuna of getting a static shock from a piece of metal after rubbing your socked feet against a shaggy carpet. It almost felt as though his body was being injected with pure energy! After about two minutes had passed, the machine shut itself off with a loud clang, the needle vibrating slightly before pulling itself out of Tsuna's neck, the hose it was attached to falling limply to the side of the machine once more. The scientist exchanged as surprised look with Reborn as Tsuna moaned, the transformation beginning! The scientist quickly ran over to the machine to see why it had shut itself off while Reborn watched Tsuna with his usual smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna weakly tried to move his body but his movements were sluggish, almost like some kind of strange mush was filling his limbs. He felt like he was about to cry as he looked down over himself to see what exactly was happening. His frightened expression swiftly changed to one of pure shock as he saw that his once puny body was slowly growing taller! With a series of pops and groans his body stretched itself taller, his clothes becoming tighter and smaller on him. His shirt swiftly pulled itself up, revealing more and more of Tsuna's flat stomach while his pants pulled up much the same way around his calves. His shoes were becoming uncomfortable as his feet swelled within them, the material warping and stretching as it struggled to contain the growing feet inside them. After a few minutes, the sleeves of his shirt were stretched tight against Tsuna's upper arms, everything below his belly button exposed while his pants clung tightly to his slender hips, the hem pulled tight around his upper calves. His toes had popped both out of his socks and his shoes, the rest of the shoe looking pretty ragged. Tsuna looked down with amazement over his body. \"I'm...tall! This is so weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis expression had done a complete turn around. Gone was the look of worry and the creases of concern. A big smile lit up his face now, Tsuna eagerly wanting to look over his body, wishing he wasn't strapped down like this! Luckily for him, the changes had only just gotten started! With a sudden wave of dizziness, Tsuna's body started to grow again, though in a much different way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis biceps slowly began to swell, the sleeves of his shirt swiftly ripping, his forearms growing thicker, giving him a far stronger grip! His once flat and unimpressive chest suddenly bulked upward, thick slabs of meat straining and finally bursting free of his shirt, the slightly sweaty skin visible to all in the room. The tear continued down his torso, showing off a tight six pack before splitting open entirely, only rags now attached to his broadening shoulders and widening back. With a grunt, his voice sounding slightly deeper, Tsuna watched as his belt popped off, followed by the button on his pants. The zipper slid down with a low, whispering sound, revealing his boxers, packed to the brim with Tsuna's now far more impressive manhood! Tsuna blushed a little as he saw the button straining on his boxers. If he made the slightest misstep, he would end up revealing himself to everyone! Below the waist, his thighs had already popped the material of his pants open like the husk of a cocoon, thick striated muscle emerging. His now massive calves had made short work of the rest of his pants. His feet had grown a bit thicker and wider to better balance his now impressively muscled body, long tears running down the sides of each of his sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna, his eyes now nearly bugging out of his head, could only mumble incoherently as he looked down over his body. The scientist, meanwhile, ran back over to Reborn and whispered, \"It seems the machine was preset to run an experiment. We're going to need at least a day or two to reprogram it for any further experiments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReborn nodded and said, \"That's fine. We'll let the 10th here to get used to his new body before doing anything further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna, hearing Reborn's voice, looked sharply up at him. \"Wait...you mean you're going to do this again to me?! But...But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReborn chuckled and said, \"Look at you Tsuna! You're nearly taller than Yamamoto and at least twice as muscular as Ryohei! Why wouldn't you want to keep this improvement going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna looked down over his body, his much larger pecs now making that a little difficult, and instinctively tried to flex his arm. The cuffs, which were nearly as rusty as the machine, actually broke, allowing the formerly small boy to flex his arms. Tsuna watched in amazement as the mound of muscle slowly rose up into a peak. Was that big thing really attached to him? \"Yeah...Maybe you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first things first!\" Reborn said sharply, bringing Tsuna's focus back down to him. \"We need to get you some new clothes AND start training you to use this body properly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReborn started heading for the door, leaving Tsuna to break himself free and follow after him, his bigger body making him even clumsier than before! \"W-Wait up Reborn!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Tsuna had found his way out, he had lost Reborn. He looked all around, trying to find the little infant. Little did Tsuna know, Reborn was nowhere around. At the same time, Reborn hadn't even noticed that Tsuna wasn't following him. Reborn usually never made miscalculations like this... Unless he did them on purpose. Truly, this was a once in a lifetime thing! As Tsuna looked around, confused as he stood outside what looked to be an abandoned house, he could practically feel himself refreshed with new energy! No longer what he hopeless, useless, or a loser! With an amazing body like this, he could easily make something of himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna looked around, and managed to see the clock tower in a park not too far away. It was at least 3pm! He had missed a whole day of school! Then again, he had faith that everyone else had taken care of it for him... So why not take a little time to enjoy his new body? After all, since they did this to him, the least he was owed was a little time to enjoy it! Puffing out his chest and trying to seem tough, he walked onward, right into the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack home, Reborn was just arriving back at the Sawada household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SUPRIII--\" Everyone, all of Tsuna's friends, seemed to pop out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ciaossu!\" Reborn greeted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's Reborn.\" Gokudera said, looking down. He chuckled nervously. He was clearly in a good mood. \"We thought you were the 10th!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be here soon. He still needs to adjust.\" Reborn answered. \"Walking's not easy after you go through what he's went through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of the Vongola family nodded, even Lambo, who had no idea what was going on. Such was his nature. As for Tsuna's room, it was mildly decorated, clearly in commemoration of some event. Even more obvious, only members on the Vongola were here, save for Dokuro and Hibari who both had their own reasons for now showing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna was enjoying his little stride, feeling so tall and powerful! Never had he felt as good as he did now! His pecs shook with every step he took, making some people blush, while others were green with envy. The only thing holding his pants up was a rather tight belt. The button and zipper were still undone, and his sizable bulge pressed against a pair of red and white heart boxers. Rather... Indecent for being in public, but with Tsuna's great height and muscular body, there was not a man who dared to question him! He looked down at the people every now and again, forcing him to blush. He immediately grinned a forced grin along with it to try to convince people of how confident he was in himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he crossed by the playground, children of all ages stopped and stared. All kinds of \"whoa\"s reached Tsuna's ears which only served to make him just a little bit cocky. He stopped, smiling at the kids, and flexed his powerful arm. The muscle bulged upward, only causing the kids to \"ooh\" at his hugeness. Before he knew it, he was swamped by kids, all of which who wanted to innocently touch and admire his godly body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, side-effects!?\" Gokudera demanded to know as Reborn began to theorize the worst that could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you think power like that didn't come at a cost?\" Reborn replied. Gokudera clenched his fist, none too happy to hear about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto put his hand on Gokudera's shoulder in attempt to calm him. Gokudera just jerked away. Yamamoto turned to reborn. \"So what are these side effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of three things could happen.\" Reborn stuck a single finger up, \"One, he could be subjected to random, uncontrollable growth spurts.\" Reborn began. Gokudera calmed down just a bit after hearing this. That wasn't TOO horrible... After all, the bigger the 10th was, the stronger he would be, and no one could hurt him! \"Two!\" Reborn resumed, \"Based on the research we've already conducted, we have to hope Tsuna doesn't acquire too many... 'Friends'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\" Ryohei asked with curiosity. \"I thought friends were a good thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He means admirers, turf head!\" Gokudera snapped, before turning to Reborn as well, wanting to hear the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Tsuna starts to garner too much attention, not only is he going to become bigger, he'll get a swollen, arrogant ego with it!\" Reborn said, before lifting a third finger. \"Or third, he'll go on unharmed, and everything proceeds as planned.\" Reborn smiled slightly at that option. It was clear even he was wishing for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back at the park, Tsuna was happily tied held down by children who were all playing around on him and admiring him. Suddenly...</span></div></div>",

The countless hands, squeezing and admiring how jiggly and soft his muscles were tickled the sensitive giant! In the back of his mind, a thought formed. He must have been one hell of a stud to attract all these admirers. Those simple thoughts, coupled with all the children's, innocent as it was, worshipping was slowly making his body expand. His pecs plumping up fuller, his abs growing tighter... His shirt started to tear slightly around his growing form, as his lower section was growing thicker. The belt was just barely digging into his skin, as his manhood pushed out just a little further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the mothers called to their children, who all left Tsuna a mess on the floor. Many of the children looked back and pointed at Tsuna with smiles on their faces. Tsuna was barely able to pick up on what they were saying as he quickly got back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... He's pretty huge...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just look at those arms...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to mention those massive pecs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AND he's good with children?! What a man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna blushed, chuckling nervously. Part of him was starting to want more compliments, but for the most part, he was still Tsuna. He waved back, slowly starting to wander off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna soon left the park, the memory of the children all over him lingering with him. \"I really liked that...\" Tsuna thought to himself as he wandered on, \"All that attention, all that love... I deserved to be worshipped like that!\" He thought to himself with another proud grin. This time, it wasn't forced. The grin he wore now was brimming with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's settled!\" Gokudera announced. \"I'm going to head uptown to the school, and Yamamoto and Ryohei will take downtown by Yamamoto's house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" Ryohei and Yamamoto agreed together. Briefly after, all three split up, heading to their respective locations. It was Gokudera's idea to start a search party for Tsuna, after some helpful hinting from Reborn. The last thing they wanted was for their beloved leader to wound up hurt due to one of Reborn's little plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna stood there on the street, a whole crowd gathered around him. His former shirt was in shreds on the ground now, as he flexed and showed off his massive body to all the people. Every single onlooker, who gave him even the slightest bit of attention only made him gain more size and mass onto his already hulking frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tsuna could get any bigger...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The very second that Gokudera and the others had formed their plans, Gokudera had ran out of the house, heading for the uptown area to look for Tsuna. Luckily for him, Tsuna had been moving slowly away from the school and was currently showing off in a park that was a few hundred feet from the building. The park also happened to be not very far from where Tsuna's house was. Gokudera had formed this plan specifically so it would be him and him alone who would end up finding Tsuna! He snickered to himself. \"Man, this is such a great plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin ten minutes, Gokudera was darting passed the park. He would have continued right passed it without a second look if he hadn't noticed the crowd that had formed there. He slowed to a walk and saw that everyone was looking at some really huge man, standing head and shoulders above every one there, flexing his biceps and grinning proudly. Gokudera shrugged and started moving on. That guy WAS pretty impressive but no nearly as impressive as the tenth! It didn't matter if the tenth was really small, he always, ALWAYS came out on top during any fight! Even that guy would fall to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had sped up, eager to find Tsuna, when something finally clicked in his head. That guy in the park...the remains of a tattered white shirt with a tie had been on the ground next to him...and his pants were formal...not to mention he had some really spiky brown hair...Gokudera's eyes widened. \"It couldn't be...could it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeeding to be absolutely positive, Gokudera whipped back around and ran to the park again. The crowd had swelled with even more people, the man bouncing pecs that were now clearly thrust out above the heads of everyone watching. This man seemed to be getting bigger by the minute! Gokudera shoved through the crowd, ignoring the shouts of protest, until he was at the front. \"Tenth?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked down at Gokudera in shock, a slight blush running across his nose before a confident smirk appeared on his face. \"Oh, hey Gokudera!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera's mouth was hanging open as he stared up at the new and improved Tsuna. His pant cuffs had rode up around his calves, the button popped off while the zipper was pulled down, the incredibly tight looking belt the only thing still keeping his pants up and on. The front part of his shoes had been burst through, Tsuna's thick toes lying comfortably on top of the grass. What really caught Gokudera's attention, however, (beyond the somewhat obscene bulge in Tsuna's too tight pants) was his boss' bare torso. His thick pecs and bulging biceps, his broad shoulders and his wide back, and the rock hard six pack cast in slight shadow all came together to form a perfect specimen of man. Tsuna slowly walked over to Gokudera, his thighs rolling slightly as he did so, and crossed his arms over his chest. The look in his eye was supremely confident, no trace of the timid Tsuna left in him. Gokudera gulped a little, his heart pounding. \"T-Tenth! What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna chuckled and flexed his bicep. \"Hey, I'm a high school student right? I'm finally getting my growth spurt is all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera opened his mouth, ready to start talking about how people didn't just suddenly start growing like this, when a voice in the crowd whispered, \"Who's THAT guy? He's blocking my view!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera immediately whipped around and glared at the crowd, several sticks of dynamite suddenly in his hands, a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth. He passed his hands in front of the cigarette, lighting them all at once and tossed them at the crowd. \"Get out of here you freaking leeches! This isn't some circus show!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dynamite exploded violently throughout the crowd, people only just managing to escape the fiery detonations. Tsuna frowned as he realized his adoring fans were no longer showering him with praise. He was reaching out to grab Gokudera and teach him a little lesson when the silver haired teen turned around with a grin, giving him a thumbs up. \"Don't worry tenth! I got rid of those wannabes! I'm all the attention you need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna tilted his head. Gokudera raised a good point, though it was unintentionally. He had always praised Tsuna continuously, no matter the situation. If there was anyone who would support him in his ventures, no matter what they were, Gokudera was that person. Tsuna smiled a little mischievously and said, \"So...what do you think of my new body Gokudera?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera threw open his arms with a bright smile and said, \"You look amazing tenth! I thought you were impressive before, but now you're even bigger than me! Anyone who tries to attack you is going to learn the hard way not to mess with the Vongola family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna felt his body swell and stretch taller and wider as Gokudera praised him. He wrapped his arm around his shoulder and said, \"Yeah? Keep going!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsuna walked on with Gokudera, flexing his firm bicep with a smirk as his friend followed. \"And my arms?\" He asked with a sly grin. He knew exactly what he was setting himself up for, all that was left was for Gokudera to take the bait. Sometimes, he didn't even have to say anything! Gokudera was always known for spewing random comments to him as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're amazing! I've never seen anything like them! Not even on TV! I didn't know they could get that big!\" Gokudera said enthusiastically. His compliments only served to pump Tsuna up even larger. \"Wow, Tenth, you got so huge! That experiment must have really went well! You really seem a lot more confident too! But you should be! You're the mighty leader of the Vongola!\" Gokudera went on, every comment fueling Tsuna's growing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked onward, Gokudera's praise feeding Tsuna's ego just as well, if not even better than the crowd he had attracted before! His pathetic belt soon burst forth, which only made Gokudera's comments speed up, in turn shredding those pants. Tsuna was left to parade about in his heart boxers, but he didn't complain! Now that he was fully on display, he got attention from every person he walked by in addition to Gokudera. Tsuna must have stood at least ten and a half feet tall, his muscles bulging out obscenely. His pecs pressed out over a half foot from his chest, pumped and huge like two round orbs. His abs were built like bricks and twice as hard, leaving him with an impossibly hard six-pack. His biceps were swollen nearly as large as a small watermelon, and were only pulsing larger with every compliment. Tsuna's tight ass stuck out from behind, and his growing package from the front, putting a constant strain and a losing battle on his boxers. His thighs stretched the limits of his boxers, his bulging calves remained hard and flexed with every step, and his gargantuan feet had burst from the shoes; All of these things attributed to the way the land shook all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you see that Tenth!? You're so massive that everything is shaking underneath your mighty power!\" Gokudera brought to his leader's attention. Tsuna just smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Guess I'm just so powerful, everything quivers under my power!\" He said with a cocky grin. It was at this moment someone had bumped into Tsuna. The random man immediately fell to the ground, while Tsuna still stood, tall and proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why don't you watch...\" The man rubbed his head, as his mouth then gaped open, just barely seeing past Tsuna's massive pecs to see the young boy's face. Tsuna bounced his pecs with an arrogant smile. \"S-Sorry!\" He stammered, getting to his feet, \"I didn't mean it!\" The man ran off, never to be seen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you better run!\" Gokudera shouted, \"That's what you get for messing with the all-powerful Vongola Tenth!\" Gokudera lifted Tsuna's powerful arm, pointing at it. \"Next time you'll be torn in half and swallowed whole by these pythons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this only forced Tsuna to swell and grow even larger, his ego ballooning nice and huge. As he grinned with his hands on his hips, he didn't even seem to notice as...</span></div></div>",

Is that Tsuna?\" Yamamoto asked Ryohei, looking over at him with the same easy going smile he always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is!\" Ryohei shouted out, clenching his fists, a grin stretched over his face. \"Looks like that experiment thing really worked on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto chuckled and said, \"Looks like Gokudera found him too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera was swinging happily from Tsuna's arm while the once small mob boss flexed his substantial bicep, easily able to hold Gokudera's weight without so much as breaking a sweat. The two teens quickly ran over to Tsuna and Gokudera, the people around them watching curiously as two new men arrived on the scene. Tsuna didn't seem to notice them. He was too busy focusing on Gokudera who was happily chattering away compliments about how big and strong and unstoppable he was which in turn was making his boasts reality, Tsuna's body growing more and more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tsuna! You look amazing!\" Yamamoto said with a smile, hands in his pockets. Tsuna looked over at his shoulder and smirked at Yamamoto. \"Oh hey. Almost didn't see you down there puny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto snickered and said, \"You're so funny Tsuna.\" He patted the massive boy on the back while Ryohei ran in front of him, holding up his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you just gotta join the Boxing Club!\" Ryohei shouted, throwing a few air punches as he grinned up at Tsuna. \"No other team in the district would be able to stand a chance against us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna chuckled and said, \"Sure, sure, I'll think about it. In the meantime, let's take a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna wrapped his arms around both Yamamoto's and Ryohei's shoulders, pinning them against his bulk as they walked away, both teens now adding their compliments to Tsuna, Ryohei going so far as to run his hands up and down Tsuna's abs and squeeze Tsuna's pecs. Yamamoto meanwhile playfully slapped Tsuna's butt, complimenting him on the shape and hardness. Tsuna soaked it all up, not even noticing that Gokudera had fallen behind with a sour look on his face. As always, he hated when anyone got in between him and his boss. It didn't help that Tsuna didn't even notice that he had fallen behind. He kicked morosely at the ground, a sad expression on his face. Suddenly, a shadow was cast over him. Gokudera looked up in surprise and saw Tsuna smiling confidently down at him. \"Hey little man. Get over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his arms and Gokudera immediately jumped into them. Tsuna wrapped his arms tight around the smaller teen and lifted him up onto his shoulders. Gokudera happily held on. \"Tenth you are the coolest guy ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna flexed  his bicep and watched as it rose up another inch without him even flexing. \"Yeah, I know~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time Tsuna was passing twelve feet tall, his thick arms wrapped back around Yamamoto and Ryohei again. As the four teens made their way down the sidewalk, attracting even more attention from the crowds, every word of praise soaking into Tsuna and making him bigger and bigger! Yamamoto looked a little concerned as he gently played with some of Tsuna's thick fingers. \"Yeah, Tsuna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna tightened his grip a little on the baseball player and said, \"Yeah? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you worried about, you know, maybe getting too big?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera snorted and said, \"There's no such thing as too big! The tenth can get as huge as he wants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, lighten up!\" Ryohei said with a laugh. \"He's not hurting anyone so what's the problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto shrugged with a small smile. \"Yeah, I guess you're right. Maybe I am just worrying about nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna grabbed Yamamoto by the back of his shirt and lifted him off his feet. \"Don't worry about anything small fry! With a big guy like me around, nothing bad is going to happen to any one you! As long as you don't get in my way. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tightened his grip a little on Yamamoto. A flash of fear passed through the once taller teen's eyes, followed by a weak smile. \"S-Sorry! I get it, I'll be good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna smiled again and let Yamamoto down, his arm tightly wrapped around him again. Like it or not, these three were with Tsuna until the end. Gokudera just snickered while Ryohei said, \"That's the kind of passion we're looking for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto's heart was beating just a little faster as they walked along. Tsuna had always been a meek, sweet, gentle boy, a little hapless, but with a good heart. This new body of his seemed to be making him more aggressive, cockier, and arrogant along with making him supremely more confident. Yet....when he looked in Tsuna's eyes, he still saw the same guy he had made friends with so long ago. This is what made Yamamoto smile again, his fears at a rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still Tsuna grew.</span></div></div>",

From the start of the day to the finish, he had went from being a five foot one, one hundred six pound weakling, to a gargantuan twelve foot eight, and just a few hundred pounds short of being a whole ton of muscle! Everything around him rumbled, vases falling from shelves, animals making a commotion as they heard the sound, only to shut up once they saw the source of it all. Tsuna took a deep breath, taking it all in, and enjoying every second of his new self. Things were going to be MUCH more different from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To Tsuna!\" Gokudera cheered, the four of them literally squeezed in Tsuna's room. Their new, bulky leader practically took up an entire quarter of the room! If not more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsuna!\" Everyone cheered. They all had a round of sodas together to finally celebrate the return of their beloved friend and boss. Of course, having a party in his honor was just the thing that Tsuna needed to get even bigger! Not many seemed to notice as the brown haired boy continued to bulk up and out, filling up more of the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong after the party started to calm down, every was slowly starting to settle in. Tsuna demanded that everyone stay the night. No one knew why, but Tsuna did. He wanted to be closer to his power source. He took a few of his sheets out of his closet, and tried getting out the door. There was no way he'd be able to sleep in his bed tonight, so perhaps sleeping out under the stars wouldn't be a bad idea. Besides, what's wrong with hiding such a thick, godly body from the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang it! Why is this frame so small!?\" Tsuna growled. With a loud grunt, he slammed out, demolishing the door frame in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenth! You're so cool!\" Gokudera cheered, \"Who needs doors when you're massive enough to smash from room to room!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna let out a chuckle, the joke starting to become a bit of a serious suggestion to him. After all, he was only going to get bigger, right? Brushing it aside for now, he made his way outside as he allowed his friends to have his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I call the Tenth's bed!\" Gokudera demanded, jumping over into the cushy, iron bed. Yamamoto didn't mind taking the floor. Before Ryohei could argue, however, Reborn tugged on his sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Reborn?\" Ryohei looked at his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come talk with me in the bathroom.\" Reborn said simply. With that, he just up and disappeared! Ryohei looked about for a second, and saw no one else saw that. He stood to his feet, looking down at everyone. \"I'm... Uh... Going to the bathroom...\" He said, still a little thrown off by it all. Gokudera just pointed and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turf head can't hold his soda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei arrived in the bathroom downstairs, and closed the door behind him. \"You wanted to see me?\" He asked Reborn, who he saw was sitting on the edge of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsuna's getting pretty big...\" Reborn started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It's pretty extreme!\" Ryohei shouted proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the floor above, Gokudera snickered to himself, and whispered to Yamamoto, \"You hear that? He even uses the bathroom in an extreme way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's starting to get really self-absorbed too... Always wanting you guys to compliment him...\" Reborn continued, trying to see if Ryohei would pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Ryohei agreed again, \"Wish I could be as huge as he is... That'd be pretty EXTREME!\" He shouted again. Reborn smacking him in the head to remind him to keep quiet. He bent back up a little, chuckling nervously. \"Right, sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You want to be that big?\" Reborn asked quite simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei, surprised at this proposition...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uh... Yeah!\" Ryohei whispered loudly, \"I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile stretched across Reborn's young face. \"I'm glad to hear it. Now we have to go get Yamamoto and Gokudera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they're sleeping...\" Ryohei replied, \"Wouldn't it be rude to--\" Reborn interjected by holding up some kind of pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've already spiked their drinks. They won't wake up for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe streets were dark, as Ryohei carried his two friends over his shoulders. \"Where are we going...?\" Ryohei asked. He didn't have a problem carrying one of them, but both of them at the same time was more of a challenge. A challenge that Ryohei was more than happy to accept!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Vongola Labs. Japan branch.\" Reborn replied, walking along the concrete fence of the street. \"We'll be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope so... Gokudera's snoring is really getting annoying!\" Ryohei whispered back, a bit leery about waking the two up. He even made sure not to run too fast and end up shaking them awake. \"Why did we need them again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find out soon.\" Reborn replied, hopping all the way across a street onto another fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them together soon came across a large, abandoned warehouse. Reborn knocked on the door in a strange way the Ryohei didn't really understand. After a brief moment, the door slid right open, leading to a staircase that went downwards. At the bottom of the stairs, Ryohei could barely see a dim light shining. Reborn hopped down from step to step, and Ryohei followed closely behind. The door closed quietly behind them, and soon there was no sound other than the echo of footsteps as they wandered down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom, Reborn pushed open a door, where three iron beds, much like what Tsuna had seen earlier in the morning, lay. Reborn merely had to point at them for Ryohei to know that Yamamoro and Gokudera must belong on those beds. Gently, he set them down. Gokudera whined a little, mumbling in his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenth...\" He chuckled and blushed. \"You're getting so big...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryohei looked over, Reborn was standing at the third and final bed, patting it. Ryohei walked over, and sat on the edge of it. He looked down at Reborn, trying to see what he was supposed to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shirt and pants off.\" Reborn said simply. Ryohei just shrugged. He slid of a blue sweatshirt he was wearing, along with his light blue sweatpants. With that, he was left in nothing but a pair of white boxers. He looked over and saw that Reborn had already undressed Yamamoto, and Gokudera was already halfway there! \"Lie down!\" Reborn commanded from afar, giving a wave to what appeared to Ryohei to be complete darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei did as he was told, and with it, he was suddenly shackled down! It came as a shock to him at first, and he did struggle, but after a moment, he gave his trust to Reborn. Glancing over, he saw the same had been done to Gokudera and Yamamoto! Then, there was a shrill sound that broke the silence. Ryohei looked over and saw a large machine pushed by a man in your stereotypical science garb, but instead of the stinging syringes that Tsuna had seen earlier, this one had suction cups. One side had a red light, the other a blue. Reborn took the cups from the red side, and stuck them to Ryohei, while the scientist took the blue side, and was quickly sticking them to the other two boys. Ryohei noticed that they were all placed the same location that Reborn was sticking the cups on him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna let out a loud yawn as he laid out in the backyard. His arms stretched far, as he idly rubbed down his body. A cocky smirk stretched across his face as he felt his large, bulbous pecs, giving them a hard flex. He loved the way they just barely tapped his chin as he was looking down at them. His massive, powerful arms, strong enough to crush rocks, and his thick, rippling thighs that could squeeze a man's head off! \"Yeah...\" He thought to himself in a confident way, \"Things are gonna be a lot different from now on...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tsuna turned on his side, and scratched his ass, which looked as if sculpted by the god themselves. As he did, there was someone who was watching him from the back sliding window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... A squishy monster!\" A young boy, with a large back afro, adorned with cow horns whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei chuckled somewhat nervously. \"What's this thing do again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to be big, right? Here's how we're going to do it!\" Without saying anymore, Reborn flipped a switch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei felt a tingle from all the cups that were on him. Not a stinging feeling, but more of a ticklish feeling! He couldn't hold back a little chuckle as the machine began to work it's magic on him! Ryohei's legs started to grow thicker. As if they weren't toned enough, they quivered and shook, before bursting forth with new size and power! Ryohei's eyes practically popped out of his head as he was watching his own already strong physique growing even larger and stronger! Ryohei's already wavy abs soon tightened and became more visible, turning from a large 6-pack, before a new row sprouted and began to fill up, giving him an amazing 8-pack! His pecs pushed out, swelling and filling with pure mass that could make any man (save for Tsuna) green with envy! He gave them a hearty flex, wanting to feel that same ecstasy that he saw Tsuna experience all day! His back flared out, stretching into an immovable wall of strength, while his powerful biceps and forearms, already powerful from throwing so many punches, balled up even faster than the rest of his body, pumping up bigger and bigger and BIGGER until they were nearly the size of softballs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei could barely believe his eyes! But before he could get much further, Reborn turned the machine off, which caused Ryohei's head to snap right up to the infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why'd you stop!?\" He demanded to know. Reborn pointed at Yamamoto and Gokudera. While Ryohei had filled out and hunked up, his friends appeared to be much more scrawny than he remembered... He could see Gokudera's ribs from where he lay, and Yamamoto, who had given more mass than his fiery friend, was panting, clearly worn out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that mass has to come from somewhere.\" Reborn finally replied. Ryohei felt a little bad inside. After all, who wouldn't? He just potentially hurt his friends! However... All this size... All this mass... It felt so worth it! Ryohei started to make excuses in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can gain it back!\" He chuckled nervously, \"It's not like it's forever... R-Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want more... There's always more people...\" Reborn suggested, teasing the young man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Now that he was in a new area in a street, a new crowd was already starting to gather, mainly thanks to the commotion that Gokudera had made. Tsuna's ears perked up and a smirk ran across his face as he now heard all kinds of new compliments reaching his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that kid...\" One person said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at those pecs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pecs? Look at his tight ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna turned around to the crowd, looking down at them. They all seemed to suddenly freeze with fear, looking back up at him. Tsuna raised his arms... And suddenly flexed his thick arms, showing them off for all the people to see. He grinned, all the \"ooh\"s and \"ahh\"s feeding his already swollen physique. More and more people started to gather, admiring his bulging muscles. Suddenly, a little kid stepped bravely forward, and pointed over at a small car on the edge of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Mister! Can you lift that?\" He asked. Tsuna glanced at the car, before smiling down at the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing!\" He smirked. With that, Tsuna began to walk over to the car, the ground quaking beneath him. The whole crowd followed behind, wanting to see. Gokudera stayed behind, smiling to himself. It was no big deal if the people just wanted to see how strong his boss was! It was just when they were getting a little too close to him for Gokudera's own comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was muttering to each other, looking as Tsuna squatted down and set his hand down along the bottom rim. With a mighty heft, he easily was able to lift up one side, which made the crowd gasp! Tsuna grinned as he felt even more mass added onto his godly body, as he was now able to go a step further, and lift the vehicle up off the ground! Higher, and higher, and higher, Tsuna was quickly able to dead lift the car directly above his head. He shot a cocky grin down at the crowd, and they all began to cheer and shout for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Tsuna began surging up higher, all those people's eyes and words feeding his appetite for size. His bulky pecs shot out at least another two inches from his already immense pecs. His over sized biceps started bulging and undulating, flexing larger as the car was held in place, becoming even less of a task for this herculean boy. Tsuna's enormous back flared out even further, nearly completing his top-heavy physique. His abs were long down his stomach, rippling and hard as another row popped into place, giving him a mighty 8-pack that could crush a rock! Tsuna's thighs were swelling out, rubbing even closer together until no light could be seen between them. His calves had also been thickening up, starting to near bowling ball size! Tsuna's shoes had long fallen off, and now his huge feet had been growing larger! Not even a size twenty five shoe would be able to fit those massive things! Tsuna let out a triumphant laugh, his voice noticably deeper than it was when he had started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was strange that no one seemed to notice how large Tsuna had become! The car, while it had to be held from under and took much of Tsuna's strength, Tsuna could now hold at both ends high above his head with relative ease. He looked down at the people who seemed to settle down a little... That was no good for him! A lightbulb went off in Tsuna's head as he realized what he should do next!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna let out a noisy grunt, which immediately caught everyone's attention. The seventeen foot boy shouted and groaned, even scaring a child or two to the back of the crowd! As everyone looked up, they quickly saw what he was doing! The could hear as the metal of the car had begun to creak and moan as Tsuna started to squeeze it together like it was a soda can! While some were surprised, others began to cheer Tsuna on, which only made the boy become even more of a Goliath than he already was! Tsuna's muscles expanded even further out, becoming red as the veins began to surface, throbbing as the cocky teen kept squeezing the car tigher together! Everyone watch as the car quickly became smaller and smaller, to a volkswagon, to even smaller, squeezed between the gargantuan vices that were Tsuna's arms. Tsuna soon lowered it, pressing one end to his chest, and his hands wrapping around the back in a bear hug, as he was now able to mash the puny tin can between himself and his arms in a crushing bear hug! There was a sudden leak as the gasoline tank popped, splattering between himself and the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone knew it, Tsuna tossed the piece of scrap metal to the ground, not even making the loud thud it normally would have. The whole crowd looked down in amazement at the piece of junk at the ground, before looking back up at Tsuna. Tsuna, of course, was smiling, bouncing his pecs as he flexed his mountainous biceps. The crowd erupted into applause and cheer. Tsuna grinned, as he felt his body surge upward bigger, and bigger, and BIGGER! His biceps bounced up to about halfway up his forearm, as his thick, throbbing pecs brushed up against his chin with every bounce. His abs pressed out from his body as well, almost like a set of mini-pecs themselves! Tsuna's ass had become two large beach balls, but if you squeezed them, it was like two giant watermelons! His thighs could crush steel, and his calves bounced and shook with every step as it helped support the colossal teen's body. While 25 was previously the limit with Tsuna's shoe size, but now it was arguable is size 40 would fit! His back was an immovable wall of waves that could take a cannonball!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna was without question THE hugest, most powerful thing in all the town! But Tsuna would soon be in for a shock as...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsuna was so absorbed in the attention he was receiving from the crowd and on such a high after not only lifting a car up but actually crushing it in his bare hands, he didn't even notice as the crowd began to get much quieter, moving aside as someone else arrived on the scene. Tsuna didn't look up from admiring his muscles until a shadow fell over top of him. Tsuna blinked and slowly looked up, his eyes widening as he saw an even bigger standing before him! Now Tsuna was already enormous by human standards. The normal people milling around him only reached up to his knees. But this man towered over even Tsuna! The bulge in his briefs was level with the young crime boss's face! Tsuna leaned his head back and tried to see who was standing before him but couldn't see the man's face past his thick, swollen pecs! \"Hey!\" Tsuna shouted, his voice easily heard not just because it was now deeper but because everyone else had gone deathly quiet. \"Who do you think you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man leaned forward with a grin, revealing the face of Ryohei! Gokudera's mouth dropped open in pure shock. \"W-What the hell?! What happened to you? I just saw you a few hours ago and you were totally normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei just chuckled and said, \"Let me answer your questions one at a time. First, who do I think I am?\" He grinned at Tsuna and slowly stretched back up to his full height, bringing his arms up into a powerful double biceps pose, his arms erupting into twin mountains, thick veins powering the muscles as he flexed them bigger and bigger! The crowd \"oohed\" and \"aahed\", completely enraptured by Ryohei's display, clapping and cheering, causing the enormous teen to actually stretch higher and wider! \"I think I'm more man than you could ever hope to be!\" He leaned over and gave each of his biceps a kiss, growling and flexing them harder afterwards, the fierce display earning renewed cheers! \"As for what what happened to me...well~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Hours Ago--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure this is a good idea?\" Yamamoto asked, scratching his head as he watched Reborn and some doctors hook Ryohei up to some kind of strange machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely!\" Reborn said, that enigmatic little smile on his face. \"At first I thought Tsuna experiencing side effects would be a bad thing, since it would involve a lot of civilians and might make a big mess. But after Gokudera \"reported\" back to me, I realized this was the perfect opportunity to build Tsuna's confidence and get a little training in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did Gokudera report to you anyway? You don't have a cellphone do you?\" Yamamoto asked, smiling slightly at the idea of a little baby having a cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I planted Leon on Gokudera and he's sending reports back to me.\" Reborn said simply, pointing at his hat, his chameleon pet noticeably absent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how does Leon know how to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare for phase one of the experiment!\" Reborn swiftly interrupted, raising one finger into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei winced as the needles came down, slowly injecting him in the same process Tsuna had gone through. \"See, with Ryohei out there showing up Tsuna, Tsuna will get jealous, his new confidence and pride forcing him to be better than Ryohei, to show HIM up! It's important for mob bosses to have not only a lot of confidence but to not be afraid of taking down his enemies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Ryohei isn't an enemy.\" Yamamoto pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. That's why we'll be watching! If things get out of hand, I have a contingency plan.\" He held up a rather wicked looking syringe filled with a colorless liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Yamamoto asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Reborn said, little smile firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--An Hour Ago--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! What happened to me?!\" Ryohei said, flexing his now much bigger biceps, each one looking as big as a softball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he got even bigger than Tsuna!\" Yamamoto said, measuring himself playfully up against Ryohei. He only came up to the top row of the giant teen's abs! Ryohei grinned and tousled Yamamoto's hair, eliciting a chuckle from the smaller teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he did! He started out not only taller than Tsuna, but stronger as well! If Tsuna wants to keep up with him, he's going to have to work twice as hard!\" Reborn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei bounced his pecs and chuckled. \"Hey, I really like this! No one could beat me at boxing before but now...it's not even fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to the wall and punched it, knocking a huge hole in it! \"Hahahaha! I feel amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look really amazing too!\" Yamamoto said, putting his hands in his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Yamamoto's words reached Ryohei, his body pulsed, slowly growing taller, his muscles bulging bigger all over his body! Ryohei groaned and squeezed his pecs, loving how heavy and huge they felt in his hands. Reborn nodded and said, \"It's already starting. Alright Ryohei! Tsuna is near the park! Go out there and show him who the bigger man is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm on it!\" Ryohei said, moving towards the door. \"But I need to make one little stop first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Now--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what happened!\" Ryohei said, crossing his arms smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna clenched his fist and growled. Leave it to Reborn to take the one thing he had going for him and turn it into a stupid training exercise! Gokudera suddenly shouted, \"Don't get discouraged tenth! He might be bigger but you're better! Come on! Show him who's boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna couldn't help but smile at Gokudera, his grin slowly returning. \"Yeah! You're right!\" He flexed his own biceps, a look of pure confidence on his face. The crowd quickly started cheering again, applauding for Tsuna. They had followed him this far, no other guy was going to get their attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, show him whose boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crush a car on his head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squeeze his head between those melons on your chest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna chuckled as he felt his body stretch higher and higher, his biceps pumping up, his chest inflating out in front of him! Gokudera cheered loudest of all, fueling the already cocky and huge teen! He locked his hands under his pecs and pushed them up closer to his chin, his tongue giving the massive slabs of meat a long, slow lick. The cheers only got louder, pushing Tsuna up taller and wider, soon reaching Ryohei's height! As soon as they were eye to eye, the crowd went ballistic, causing Tsuna's height to surge up until his right pec smacked Ryohei in the face! Tsuna laughed and said, \"You really think YOU'RE the biggest man around? Try saying that around these huge pecs you little wuss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got Ryohei in a headlock, his gigantic bicep pressing hard against the back of Ryohei's head, forcing his face deeper into the cleft between Tsuna's pecs! \"Mmmm~ Why don't you show how much better I am then you by worshiping this huge body? Give my chest a little lick~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd laughed as Ryohei was brought down, though he seemed oddly calm about the whole thing. He raised his hand and held up the victory sign. The crowd only laughed louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! Who does this guy think he is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a loser! He's already lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna squeezed harder, having to bend over now as his body grew bigger from the support. \"Hear that? You're nothing but a joke compared to ME!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had Tsuna said those words then something made him wince in shock!</span></div></div>",

This wasn't the truth, in fact, the whole crowd was silent as they saw the smaller, tanned Ryohei slowly pulling Tsuna's arms apart! Tsuna looked down, and saw Ryohei pulling himself free, and flexed harder in an attempt to capture his little friend! It proved to be no use, as Ryohei broke free in seconds! The crowd gasped, looking up at the two tiatans before them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei immediately moved behind Tsuna and put on hand on his friend's ass, and another on his shoulder! Tsuna blushed a little as he felt his ass suddenly groped, but he was more focused on just what Ryohei was doing! Soon enough, Tsuna had an answer! He felt his legs starting to feel a little wobbly, and not because of their weight! Tsuna was slowly being hefted right up off the ground! Ryohei grunted, his muscles flexing, and the ground beneath him even cracking a little as he held Tsuna up above his head! It was amazing how someone tens of feet smaller could just suddenly heft an even bigger man in the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you see that...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think the new guy would be so strong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, he actually IS kind cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei couldn't quite hear the murmurs of the crowd, but that was irrelevant! With all eyes on him, Ryohei started to get even bigger, layers of muscle slowly being added onto his already hulking frame! He looked down at the crowd and winked at them, making them roar into a wave of applause! Ryohei's growth picked up, surpassing Tsuna's height, and in seconds, he even dwarfed many of the nearby houses! Ryohei switched to holding Tsuna up with just one hand, which only impressed the crowd more, and made Ryohei bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boxer in the tight red speedo suddenly found himself even bigger than he could have hoped for! His shoulders flexed and swelled, giving him that intimidating form! Veins ran along his biceps, the blood running through them feeding the already massive muscles and making them even bigger than they needed to be! His pecs were pushing out further from his chest, each an orb of meat, easily the size of the car Tsuna had crushed moments ago! His abs tightened and stretched, each muscle popping out as it filled! Ryohei's tight thighs bulged outward as they grew! He flexed them, making the little teardrops in them that made some people in the crowd swoon! As he did, his calves were also becoming two massive pillars! His feet stretched out further, inching slowly twords the crowd! They didn't even seem to fear for their life! It was like they were hypnotized by Ryohei in all his massive, bulging glory! And speaking of bulges, Ryohei's was getting bigger by the second! His tight speedo only became tighter! The long snake inside stretched out longer and thicker, the head of the beast clearly outlined by the cloth, while his balls filled out as well, making the space inside all the more tight! Ryohei's ass put on some size as well, each bouncy cheek jutted out behind him! He had a perfect, tanned ass!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting consumed by the attention, as any kind of performer would, Ryohei tossed Tsuna to the ground and began to flex for the crowd! Tsuna landed in the nearby park where he had started from! As he rubbed his head before sitting back up, he looked up... Far up, and saw Ryohei getting bigger with every pose he struck! He lifted both his arms, flexing them hard! They rose up, and Tsuna's jaw dropped as he saw the muscles, practically the size of two large hills and growing! Ryohei put his arms behind his head, and crunched his abs, showing off his huge deltoids at the same times! That wavy, muscled cobblestone path that was his abs only seemed to stretch up higher, as his back flared out further! Ryohei was bringing new meaning to the phrase \"broad as a barn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna gulped. At this point, his choices were twofold...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tsuna briefly thought about charging Ryohei and kicking him as hard as he could in his groin to regain favor from the crowd and knock Ryohei down a peg...but decided that it would be far too dangerous. If he missed Ryohei would just overwhelm him again with his superior height and strength (which was steadily increasing thanks to all the praise he was getting from what USED to be Tsuna's crowd!). Besides, even if he DID hit him square in the balls, there was the very real chance that it might not affect Ryohei at all at his monstrous height. Then again, the crowd could also turn on Tsuna for being so cheap, leading them to heap even more praise on Ryohei and make the situation even worse! No, this was a bad situation no matter which way you sliced it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenth!\" Gokudera shouted, finally managing to escape from the crowd. He had been at the head of it when Ryohei and Tsuna had started to have their competition. He had cheered Tsuna on and tried to get the crowd excited for him but ultimately Ryohei had won out. When Ryohei tossed Tsuna aside he had tried to make his way back to Tsuna but the crowd had been too thick, forcing him back towards the front. He had fought long and hard to make it out, running up to Tsuna. \"Don't worry Tenth! I-I'm...still on your side.\" He said, his breath wheezing out of him. \"I know you can still beat that moss head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna couldn't help but smile. He scooped Gokudera up and set him on his shoulder, his body already slowly pumping up again thanks to his devotion. \"I know Gokudera, but not while he has that huge crowd on his side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera snorted and said, \"That's not such a big crowd! At your size, you could easily draw in a crowd ten times that size! You just have to find a new area in the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...you're right! Can I count on you to help me gather up a big crowd?\" Tsuna asked with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera clenched his fist and pumped it into the air. \"Of course you can! I'll draw in such a big crowd you'll be able to stomp that moss head under your foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna let out a deep little moan and rolled his pecs, imagining all that size and power belonging to him. \"Yeah...let's make it happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word he started running, the cheers of the crowd slowly fading away. Gokudera barely managed to hold onto to Tsuna's hair in time to avoid flying off his shoulder at the sudden speed increase. As he ran, Tsuna began to think. The park had been a great place, full of people to gather into a crowd but there had to be another place to easily gather a crowd. \"Gokudera, where do you think we should go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGokudera thought about it for a second before brightening up. \"There's an American football game going on at the high school! There should be a huge crowd of people there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna grinned and said, \"That's perfect! Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Tsuna to reach the school. He immediately ran over to the field and saw the two teams ramming into each other, the crowd cheering. He shivered slightly as he hear those cheers. Soon, they would be all his! He waited until the teams were huddled up before cockily striding out onto the field, Gokudera leaping off  and rushing over to the cheerleaders, knocking the captain over and stealing her megaphone. The cheerleaders quickly moved back, recognizing Gokudera, and watched as he shouted, \"Hey everybody! Who wants to see our own Tsuna Sawada take on both of these teams at once?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd, which had gone silent before erupting into a series of whispers, laughed as they heard this proclamation. \"Yeah right! No way Hapless Tsuna could do that!\" a voice called out sneeringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Gokudera said with a grin. \"See that muscle man back there? That's Tsuna! Now do you think he can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd's whispers got louder, people craning their necks to see Tsuna better. \"No way! Is that really him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It IS him! Look at that hair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd he get so huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna smirked, flexing his biceps as Gokudera built him up. He could already feel his muscles bulging bigger, his height slowly increasing as parts of the crowd was already staring to admire him. He flexed his left bicep, the muscle rising up in a powerful mountain before pointing at the teams with his right hand, giving them a thumbs down. The challenge couldn't be more clear. Both teams glared at the usurping teenager and shoved their helmets onto their heads, lining up on the field against Tsuna. The giant teen crouched down and braced himself. They didn't wait. The opposing team immediately charged Tsuna, one guy going for each leg, another two for his arms, and a fifth one ramming into his abs! Tsuna grunted slightly as all of these tall, muscular teens rammed into him then chuckled. He slowly straightened up, lifting his arms up in a double biceps pose, the two players dangling like charms from his thick biceps. The two on his legs kept trying to push him over, failing miserably, while the one around his waist just clung to him, trying to throw him off balance with his weight. The crowd went wild as Tsuna easily overcame these teens, shaking them off his legs before flexing his biceps so hard, the sheer size of his muscles forced the two teens to let go, dropping to the ground. Tsuna smirked and grabbed the one around his waist, pulling him off and bringing him up to his face. The teen quivered, wincing as Tsuna glared at him. \"D-Don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna laughed and shoved the teen against his chest, bouncing his pecs harshly against the player's helmet, mangling the mouth piece with the sheer force of his muscles! He then tossed him aside and said, \"Come on! Give me a challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd went wild, cheering for Tsuna. Hundreds of people, all cheering immediately had an effect on Tsuna, his body quickly swelling bigger and bigger and bigger! Tsuna moaned as he felt unbelievable power rushing into his body like never before. Ten or so people had been amazing...this enormous crowd filling this stadium was purely euphoric. His height began to skyrocket, his shoulders broadening while his chest bulged outward, widening like a billboard, each swollen slab of muscle pushing away from his chest while pushing against each other, hanging like a shelf over his abs, each brick smashing outward, thickening and tightening, creating a long cobble stone rode of muscle, leading down to his bulge, his underwear ripping apart as his enormous cock and balls thickened and swelled, hanging low, slapping against his thigh with a meaty thud, his thighs rubbing up against each other as they swelled more and more, becoming more like trees before blowing even past that, looking like granite pillars of pure size! Tsuna flexed his biceps again, the mounds rising up, thick veins running over the split peaks, his traps rising up around his thickening neck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Come on! Give it up for Tsuna!\" Gokudera shouted, the cheerleaders all joining in, adding their chants to the cheers on both sides of the stadium, everyone present (except the football players) swept up in the spectacle of the growing Tsuna! Tsuna chuckled, his now deeper voice rolling out over the stadium, his head clearing the top most bleachers, his back spreading out like an enormous canyon of muscle, his ass bulging and rounding into two powerful, bouncy orbs of perfection, giving nosebleeds to half the crowd. Tsuna kept posing and flexing, his feet pulling up grass, sinking into the soft ground as they stretched along, his toes growing thicker and more powerful, getting closer and closer to the teams! Not wanting to give up, all the players from both teams ran forward, crashing into Tsuna's massive calves, jumping on top of his gigantic feet, trying to do something, anything to this titan and failing miserably! Their failure only caused the crowd to scream louder, Tsuna's body stretching higher and higher into the sky, the lights of the stadium following him like a spotlight as he ascended upward! Tsuna put his hands on his hips, smirking down at the dwindling crowd at his feet, their tiny cheers getting softer as he grew larger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way Ryhoei can beat me now!\" Tsuna thought, bouncing his pecs, each muscle making a dull THUD as he did so.</span></div></div>",

Gokudera seemed enthusiastic, smiling up at Tsuna with stars in his eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Tenth! You're huge! I mean... Look at you!\" Gokudera said, looking up and down Tsuna's giant, hulking body! \"There's no way that tiny little boxer could ever compare to you! You're like... L-Like a god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna had a cocky smirk on his face. He stepped over the stadium like the puny fence it was! He started heading back to where Ryohei originally was, with no other goal in his mind than to keep his family in line! HE was the boss, and he was going to make sure that everyone knew it! As Tsuna walked, he warped the streets beneath his feet, his tremendous weight making huge craters in the image of his foot! A small crowd that had scrambled it's way from the stadium and was doing it's best to try to keep up with the titan. This, of course, kept a limitless fountain of praise coming his way, which only made Tsuna's body shoot up and up and UP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei, in the meantime, had resorted to doing exactly what Tsuna had done! He flexed for the crowd, working up a sweat as he showed off his bulging biceps that could crunch steel like it was cardboard! Or his massive, shelf-like pecs that had swole out so far that you could barely even see the top row of abs! Yes, Ryohei had certainly become an arrogant, muscle-hungry behemoth just as Tsuna did, and it didn't seem like anything was going to stop him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil there was a rumble... Then a shake... Soon the people began to tumble as the quaking of the earth had become more vigorous! Ryohei was still flexing, but stopped when he realized that the crowd had fallen silent... In mere seconds, even Ryohei was starting to have trouble keeping his balance! Before he could ask a single question, he was engulfed in shadow! He started to turn around, and as he did, he saw a gargantuan, thick, fleshy pole! Ryohei turned all the way around, and backed up a little! Greeted by Tsuna's cock, he started looking up higher... Past a rippling ten-pack... Even further, barely able to make out a big patch of brown spiky hair that was high above a set of pecs so massive, so unrealistically huge, that they made Ryohei's look like mosquito bites!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No way...\" Ryohei mumbled to himself as he gazed up at the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there...\" A loud voice thundered. Tsuna then bent forward, a smug grin on his face. \"Ryohei.\" He said smoothly, gazing down at the downright puny boxer! \"Remember me?\" He asked, standing upright and flexing his biceps HARD! Ryohei nearly felt blown back as he watched Tsuna's body explode with muscles! His arms had become so huge that Tsuna actually had a peak on his peak! Ryohei had suddenly felt overcome with not just fear, but also jealousy! Ryohei himself wanted to be that huge! Tsuna looked so gargantuan that he could bulldoze a skyscraper and come out unscathed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Can't speak?\" Tsuna asked, \"Heh, I know, I'm pretty amazing, right?\" Tsuna grinned, flexing only one bicep now as he looked down at Ryohei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah? Why's that!?\" Ryohei asked, unable to take his eyes off of Tsuna. This, of course, only made Tsuna more fearsome as his muscles bulged out further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You humiliated me. And I don't like that one bit.\" Tsuna replied, \"You know, there's consequences for taking on your boss... But I think I can forgive you this once...\" Tsuna replied. Ryohei still seemed a bit on edge, but felt at least a little relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\" Tsuna then said, \"I think I'm going to have to make you...\"</span></div></div>",

Just down the street, he found Ryohei and Yamamoto waiting for him. He just smiled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" Tsuna parted the crowd with ease, many of the people moving out of the way of the hunk. Some stayed in the way just to be touched by the muscled god! Tsuna walked right up, so tall that his crotch reached Yamamoto's face! He held his hands on his hips and bounced his pecs. \"What do you think of the new me?\" He asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look awesome Tsuna! You HAVE to join the boxing team now!\" Ryohei insisted. His comments only served to make Tsuna stronger. Yamamoto bopped Ryohei on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsuna, you have to come back with us! This isn't right!\" Yamamoto said, making a reach for Tsuna's hand. Tsuna pulled back, before lifting his arm and flexing it hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's not right? I'm huge! No one's going to dare stand in my way now!\" Tsuna replied confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Tsuna! What if you start getting too huge?\" Yamamoto inquired. Tsuna just laughed at his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too huge? You say that like it's a bad thing! The bigger I get, the stronger I get, and the stronger I get, the less any stupid mobs are going to mess with me!\" Tsuna said, grinning down at Yamamoto. \"Unless... I know what it is!\" He said with a sly smile. \"You're just jealous! With arms like these, I could hit a baseball MILES farther than you ever could with those toothpicks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsuna that's...\" Yamamoto just watched as Tsuna flexed his bicep, admiring his own bulk. \"This isn't working...\" Yamamoto sighed to himself. \"Ryohei! We're going to have to take him by force!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamamoto looked over at Ryohei, who was watching Tsuna! Yamamoto gave Ryohei a little push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! We have to help Tsuna!\" Yamamoto said a little louder. Ryohei shook his head to get ahold of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" He agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they going to fight?\" Someone from back in the crowd said. \"That huge guy is gonna wipe the floor with them!\" Another murmured. \"I think I'll call them an ambulance now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuna chuckled to himself. It looked like he had the full support of the audience! And it only helped to make him even bigger! In those brief seconds, Yamamoto and Ryohei both charged right at Tsuna, Yamamoto tackling into his arms, while Ryohei tried to get a grip around his thigh. Tsuna just snickered to himself and stood there, hands on his hips. The two little pre-teens could barely move him an inch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We got him!\" Ryohei said, grunting a little as he tried to get Tsuna to budge. Yamamoto just grunted as he kept trying to get Tsuna to come along with them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You guys got me!\" Tsuna said sarcastically. He looked down at Ryohei and got a little idea. Using his free arm, he tapped Ryohei on the shoulder. As the little turf head looked up at Tsuna, he bounced his pecs. He could feel almost instantly as Ryohei stopped pushing at him, and started looking at him instead! Tsuna smiled, feeling how the attention from Ryohei was pumping up his massive frame with even more muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ryohei, stop!\" Yamamoto said, \"Remember what Reborn said? That's only making him stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsuma smiled, rubbing Ryohei's back a little bit. \"You know, I'm going to be the biggest there ever was... Or ever will be...\" Tsuna said in a soft whisper to the young boxer. \"You could always keep fighting this losing battle with shrimpy over there, or... You could join my side, and I'll make sure you're taken care of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei gulped. Was Tsuna right? Would he just keep getting bigger and bigger? Or was it wiser to stick to the plan and try to \"help\" his friend in other ways? Ryohei gulped... But deep in his heart, he knew just what had to be done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll... I'll join you Tsuna!\" Ryohei said, letting go of the boss' leg! With that, Tsuna shook his arm and dropped Yamamoto right to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" He asked, flexing his powerful bicep! The muscle rose up to a perfect peak! \"Last chance!\" He warned. Tsuna stood there for a moment, but quickly grew impatient with Yamamoto. \"... Guess not.\" He said, before taking Ryohei up and tucking him under his arm like a toy. He turned around and started to walk away, getting just a little more attention from the crowd before disappearing...</span></div></div>",

Ryohei was a boxer after all, he had to keep his body in top physical condition! It all started with an immediate 150 push-ups! Then it was a switch, as Ryohei who then jump, twirl in mid-air, and lay on his back. Setting his feet under his bed, he'd begin a marathon of 200 sit-ups! Once Ryohei was REALLY starting to get pumped up, he snatched up his sweatpants, running shoes, and hoodie. He'd rush them on his person, leaving a trail of clothes from his room to the door. The moment he was out the door, he ran off, running at least a good five miles around the neighborhood, before finally running home. And even as he returned, the man still had energy to burn! It was simply unheard of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei, the moment he got home, would take a shower. After all, he was still human. The last thing he needed was people staying away from him all day at school since he would smell of a week old gym bag. He's wouldn't really mind having all eyes glaring at him. Attention was something he loved, but Ryohei was a social person! He loved to interact with others! So a hot shower was the best remedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom was already beginning to steam once Ryohei was letting the water run. The moment he entered, he let out a loud shout that could be heard throughout the house! Everyone knew, however, that it wasn't out of pain, but out of pleasure! The hot water felt fantastic running down his thin physique, cleansing his body from the filth and grime from his workout. Water droplets gently ran down his cheeks, gently falling down along his chin, before sliding down his pectoral and jumping off at his soft, brown nipple. Ryohei started to run soap all along his chiseled physique, the scented bubbles running down over his body and leaving his skin smooth and clean. Ryohei giggled a little as he cleaned through his dick, the long, flexible rod proving a bit of a challenge once it got all soapy. Ryohei started to laugh as it was becoming a bit of a hassle to clean the thick, eight inch rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei's little fondling aside, his shower was soon finished, and he began to towel dry. School would be starting in about an hour and a half, giving him just enough time to finally get breakfast. A smile on his face as he stood before the mirror, toweling off his hair, he flexed both of his arms, nodding happily. The two firm, toned muscles popped up, large and powerful. He was doing fantastic! He was the perfect picture of health. He peeked out in the hallway, looking both ways, before dashing to his room, stark naked! There was a sneaky grin on his face, feeling so free as everything down there was aired out, slapping against his muscular thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei slammed his door shut behind him, and started to get dressed in his uniform, making sure to pack an extra pair of clean shorts and briefs in his gym bag for boxing club after school. Just as he set his favorite shorts inside, he heard a knock at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" He called, looking over at the door. There was no answer. \"What's up?\" He asked. There was no reply still, so Ryohei walked over and opened up the door. \"Kyoko?\" He asked, looking around. No one was there. He stepped out a little, when his foot hit a tray. \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei looked down, and squatted. There was a small tray that had two things on it. One was a vial with a clear liquid inside, the other was a cute little tea cake inside a glass box. Both had \"drink me\" and \"eat me\" on them respectively. Ryohei scratched his head. \"I wonder who left this here...?\" He took them both up in his hand, looking over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of his working out had left him a little thirsty, so the vial was very appealing, whatever the liquid inside was... On the other hand, Ryohei WAS allotted one sweet thing every month, and the tiny cake did look pretty delicious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird...\" Ryohei said, \"But I'm glad someone was nice enough to give me a gift!\" He then began to grin happily. Taking them back into his room, he set one down on his night stand, before looking at the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hand, it was...</span></div></div>",

There was no guarantee that whatever was inside of it would be very tasty or refreshing and the last thing he wanted to worry about was getting sick (especially since he had no idea where the vial had come from in the first place nor did he know if the liquid inside was even drinkable) while the tea cake, which had the outward appearance of any other small sweet cake that Ryohei had eaten in the past, looked absolutely delicious. Ryohei licked his lips as he lifted the small cover of the glass box, picking up the small cake between his index finger and thumb. He was shocked to find that the cake was actually still warm! Whoever had left it for him must have just recently baked it! He closed the glass box and lifted the cake up to his nose, taking a few whiffs. It had a spicy, undefinable scent, almost like cinnamon and cloves, but with a more subtle sugary smell mixed in and just a hint of something that Ryohei couldn't identify. It had been over a month since he had tasted anything as sweet and indulgent as a cake and just the unique smell of this one was making his stomach rumble fiercely. It didn't help that he had yet to eat any real breakfast. Without further ado, Ryohei sank his teeth into the little cake, taking bite after bite until he had quickly finished it off. The flavor exploded in his mouth, literally dozens of flavors appearing and passing only to be replaced by others. It was truly the best cake that Ryohei had ever eaten, a worthy entry for his \"Once a Month Sweet\". Licking his lips, the young boxer brushed off his hands and grabbed his backpack. He still had plenty of time to get breakfast but that little cake had been surprisingly filling. He didn't even feel hungry anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei had taken no more than five steps before a strange feeling crept over him. It felt almost like he was being...lengthened. Like someone opening the largest collapsible telescope ever built! He tried to shrug it off, but by the time he made it to his doorway, his head was level with the top of it! He was unmistakably growing larger! He could feel his clothes growing too tight now, his undershirt coming untucked while his jacket began to hug his shoulders. His pants were no better, the belt popping its buckle as his thighs swelled up, tearing in places as his feet began to outgrow his socks. Ryohei lifted up his arms and watched as they not only grew longer, but wider, his biceps pushing harder and harder against the sleeves until they popped open, revealing his tanned skin and swollen muscles. Ryohei's look of utter shock turned to a grin as he flexed his arms, the sleeves ripping further until they had completely vanished. By this time his undershirt had ridden up enough to show his deepening six pack, deep crevices forming between each rock hard brick of muscle. Ryohei rolled his shoulders, his jacket feeling far too uncomfortable by this point. With a careless flex, the jacket ripped down his back, his broadening shoulders taking care of the rest of it, leaving him in nothing but a tight, midriff bearing undershirt that clung so tightly to his body, every curve of his muscles were sharply outlined. His burly pecs were particularly apparent, the thick slabs of beef pushing so hard against the shirt that the collar had stretched down, showing off the slope of the muscle. His nipples rubbed against the fabric of the shirt, growing harder and poking out against it, the collar finally giving up and ripping down his torso, revealing his sculpted body to the world. Ryohei groped his pecs, squeezing the enormous muscles. His chest and arms had always been quite developed for his age, but now they were impressive even for an adult! Ryohei leaned forward, trying to see over the swelling of his pecs, and watched as his thighs popped his pants open the same way his arms had popped open his sleeves. His calves pushed out and took care of any remaining fabric, shredding it after a quick flex. His socks were likewise mangled, his thick toes pushing out the front of them as the tops split open like a cocoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his head struck the top of the ceiling! Ryohei had to be at least nine feet tall by this point! Luckily the growth seemed to be stopping there. Ryohei continued gazing over his body, noticing now that even his manhood hadn't been left out of the changes! His briefs were stretched to their fullest extent, his bulge hanging so slow it dragged the waistband down, showing off just the faintest hints of his silvery pubes. Ryohei looked over his shoulder and flexed his ass, the two glute muscles stretching the back just as much as the front was! Ryohei flexed his biceps again, comparing them to how they had looked before. It was no contest. The thick mounds that rose up from his arms were bigger than an average bodybuilder's, a single vein running over the tip of the muscle, feeding it, encouraging it to bulge up even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei could have gone on admiring his body for hours, running his fingers over every bulge and cranny but if he did he would definitely be late for school. He grabbed his back pack and was about to head out of his room when he remembered that he had outgrown his clothes! He quickly went into his closet and started searching for something, anything to wear but it was a lost cause. Even his sweats would have been hopelessly tight on him and his school would have never allowed him to wear it anyway. He shrugged and tossed his back pack back onto his bed. \"I'll just call in sick. One day won't hurt.\" He said to himself, squeezing out the door before heading down to the phone. He had only managed to get to the bottom of the stairs, however, before something caught his attention.</span></div></div>",

Someone to show off to!\" He said to himself. He undid the first few buttons of his school uniform, and pushed up his pecs to make sure their pumped form was peeking out of the skin-tight shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei grabbed the door handle, practically crushing it in his grip as he did, before opening it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" He said in a deep, almost sensual tone. To his surprise, he didn't see anyone there! He leaned out of the doorway, and started looking around, only to suddenly see Lambo as he looked down! He just smiled at the little guy. \"Hey! You're that one cow kid!\" Ryohei said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment Ryohei noticed Lambo's usual getup was a bit different than usual. Normally such a small change would have breezed right past the turf head, but this time it was significant. Lambo's outfit was missing it's black cow spots, leaving him in an all white outfit. He had socks over his horns, making them look like they were floppy ears. The biggest thing, however, was the huge, gaudy clock he wore around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei laughed, bending down to pat Lambo on his head. \"Hey, not bad! Are you trying to be like that one rapper? Uhm... Tasty Taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a reply, Lambo then turned around, and ran off to the gates of the house. Just as he was about to turn the corner, Ryohei saw him drop something! It was a little glass box with a tea cake in it! Lambo quickly snatched it back up, but not before Ryohei saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! That was you!?\" Ryohei said suddenly. Before he could get a reply, Lambo went running off, down the street! Curiosity getting the best of him, Ryohei squeezed his way out the doorway, his massive, powerful shoulders cracking the walls in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyohei dased as fast as he could, chasing the little cow boy through the streets! He did his best to spot the white outfit or black afro in the crowd! Countless people had to move out of the way of this massive teen lest they want to be steamrolled onto the pavement! Every one of Ryohei's beautiful muscles bounced and shook with every step, captivating just as many people as he cleared! From his deep pecs that heaved and inflated with air with every deep breath he took, down to his calves, which quivered as every step he took made a huge stomp! Ryohei didn't even stop to show off all his newfound glory to his admirers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lambo made a sudden turn down an alleyway! Ryohei grinned. He knew that alley way! He used to jump the fence in it to take a shortcut to and from school! But with Lambo's tiny little body, there was no way he could make it! ... Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryohei rounded the corner to confront Lambo...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep, deep in the bowels of the DWMA, a lone figure was slowly making its way down a spiraling stone staircase. His right hand slowly passed along the wall, helping him to keep balance while his left held up a torch. The bright orange light illuminated his shark like teeth and crimson eyes. Soul had a determined expression on his face. He had come down here for a reason! He had a distinct purpose and he would not rest until it was fulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**An Hour Earlier**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Soul! Are you even trying?\" Black Star said with a grin, his thick arm with its bulging bicep still perfectly vertical on the table. Soul, his own arm trembling with effort, tried to force his friend's arm down but it refused to budge an inch. Black Star had always had a chiseled, athletic physique but ever since the Kishin had been vanquished once and for all, he had really thrown himself into working out, using almost all of his free time to lift weights. His intense efforts paid off with bulging softball sized biceps and thick slabs of meat over his once somewhat flat chest. Not to mention his diamond hard calves and thick thighs, straining any shorts or pants he tried to wear. He had even shot up a few more inches, puberty having an early effect on him. Worst of all, it had inflated his already monster sized ego to startling new proportions. Soul had finally gotten sick of it and had challenged him to an arm wrestling contest. He had figured that if he beat Black Star in a contest of strength it would hammer down his obnoxious ego at least a bit. However, wanting to win and actually winning were two very different things. Black Star actually yawned, giving Soul a look that clearly showed he knew just how much stronger he was. Finally, after letting Soul sweat and struggle for awhile, Black Star effortlessly pinned Soul's arm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! That was too easy!\" He cheered, getting to his feet. \"You should have known better than to mess with the mighty Black Star!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul massaged his arm, glaring at Soul. \"Shut up you stupid meat head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star seemed to take the name as a compliment. He flexed his arms, the biceps peaking impressively on either side of him, as he said, \"Don't be jealous! Maybe if you work hard you can get strong enough to beat me as I am now! Too bad by the time you get there I'll already be a hundred times stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed obnoxiously as Soul could only stare jealously at Black Star's ripped physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Present Time**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul winced as the memory still burned his ego. He had reached the bottom of the staircase, torches now ensconced in the stone walls every few feet. He dunked his torch into a nearby barrel full of water and walked down the hall, hands in his pockets. A small smile rose to his lips. Soon enough he'd get his revenge on Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**An Hour Ago**<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul irritably left Black Star to his self worship, heading down the hall of the school, aiming to reach the exit as soon as possible. He just wanted to go home, turn out the lights, dive under his covers and forget all about this crappy day. As he passed a slightly open door, however, two voices caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you move all the extra souls down to the Archive?\" Shinigami-sama's voice issued out from an unused classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course! I took care of it all already!\" Spirit said enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! At the rate these remaining evil souls are being collected we might not have enough room to store them all!\" Shinigami-sama said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we'll find uses for them soon enough!\" Spirit said confidently. \"Just leave it to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remembered to lock the Archives up right? And closed the secret entrance next to the third floor bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop worrying! Nothing's going to  happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul swiftly made his way to the third floor. An idea had suddenly occurred to him. Weapons gained Death Scythe status after consuming 99 malicious souls and 1 witch soul. But what would happen if another 100 souls were consumed? Each soul gave a weapon more power. Power equaled strength. With more strength Soul could finally get his revenge on Black Star!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he arrived on the third floor, finding the secret entrance was cake. Before long Soul was making his way down the stone spiral staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**Present Time**<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Soul said, grinning at the door in front of him. It was clearly marked \"Soul Archive\". Without further ado, he grabbed the cold metal handle and pulled the heavy wooden door open. A bright light immediately assaulted his eyes. The room was packed, floor to ceiling, with hundreds upon thousands of souls. It was like a glistening buffet for the power starved weapon. Soul rubbed his hands together gleefully and looked around. Where, oh where to start?</span></div></div>",

Soul was already in a state of ecstasy, and he hadn't even started! He shook his head, regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, SO not cool...\" He mumbled to himself, rubbing the back of his head. As he opened an eye and looked back at the souls, he drooled once again. \"But...\" He paused, taking a long look at the souls. \"Aw man, a chance like this comes around once in a lifetime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrowing all pride to the wind, Soul lunged forth, grabbing the first soul he could. Without even enjoying the flavor as he usually did, endlessly, he began to shove them down his gullet. There was plenty to go around! Stuff face now, enjoy flavor later! Throwing caution to the wind, endless evil souls were being devoured, all of their power now belonging to the scythe boy. He easily took down a hundred, and then a hundred more! Unlike actual food, the soul's power was absorbed right into his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a good, long while, but Soul finally stopped, his arms a bit tired out. As he laid on the floor now, he looked about at the still endless supply of souls. Looking at them all made him grin... He still had a ways to go... A lone soul floated just by his face, and he couldn't help but stick out his tongue and lick it. Finally able to enjoy the flavor a little more, he shuddered as he addicting taste of power coursed throughout his entire body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat one little lick was all it took to reignite his flame! He sprung back up, and started to munch on the souls, one after another in a Pac-Man fashion, giving a little more consideration to taste as he did! Like no other feeling in the world, he was loving this feeling as he believed he could feel himself growing ever stronger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was late at night. Soul was finally walking home from school. Every step he took made everything around him shake and tremble! Soul must have eaten at least a good five hundred souls! He was a true, full-blooded predator, tearing everything to shreds in his wake. And now, thanks to it, and the power of all those souls, he was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soul returned, he found it difficult to get in the door...</span></div></div>",

This was unsurprising, however, given that Soul's body was now far larger and far wider than it had been before! Gone was his skinny, somewhat frail looking body, replaced by a juggernaut! Eating those five hundred souls had caused Soul to grow far larger and far stronger than even he had anticipated! The door in front of him was about half his height, his crimson eyes able to peer into a second story window if he got up on his tip toes! His clothes had all but ripped off, leaving him in nothing but a criminally tight pair of boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been lucky the growth hadn't been immediate. After eating as many souls as his stomach could hold, the bloated weapon had made his way back up the stairs, through the secret door, and out of the school building before the power exploded inside him like a raging wild fire. His eyes had rolled into the back of his head as the power overtook him, his mind a whirling torrent of nothingness, every thought obliterated as he dimly felt his body growing heavier...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his mind had finally cleared, he had looked around and slowly came to realize just how much he had changed. His first thought had been to get home and lie down. However, now that he had reached his home, his mind was fully clear and he knew exactly what he wanted to do! He turned away from his home and started walking to where Black Star lived. His every step caused the ground to shake ominously, a dark grin rising to his face. He was going to show Black Star just who was the real man around here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star shivered suddenly, like a cold breeze had struck him. \"What the heck was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around but couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. Just his average old, every day apartment. He shrugged and went back to brushing his teeth. After spitting he stood up straight and grinned at himself in the mirror. \"Sometimes I forget just how huge I've gotten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bounced his pecs, the thick slabs of muscle pushing against his tight white tank top. \"Yeah, tomorrow I'll work extra hard and get even bigger! Get the power to surpass god! I'll show everyone how awesome I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a traditional mantra with him lately. It really helped to psyche himself up! Positive thoughts yielded positive results! He flicked the light off in the bathroom and made his way to his room. He had barely shut the door and taken a step when the whole apartment suddenly shook violently. \"Woah! What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star stood perfectly still and was rewarded with another earthquake like shake! And then a few seconds later another! These strange tremors seemed to be happening in a set pattern. Almost like...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could complete that thought, the shakes stopped. In their place, a loud, deep voice called out, \"Hey Black Staaaaaar! Come out and plaaaaaaay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...why does that voice sound so familiar?\" Black Star muttered to himself. He turned off the lights and laid low, not answering whoever it was outside. It didn't take long before the voice spoke again: \"You've got ten seconds to come out of there Black Star! If you don't...I'll come and get you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star snorted with derision as the voice began to count down. \"Yeah right!\" He thought to himself. \"Like I'm afraid of...whoever is out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star had a choice: He could either wait inside for whoever it was to come in, or he could get a jump on him and head outside right now! He closed his eyes and thought about it for a split second before making his move!</span></div></div>",

It caught wind of this, and immediately snatched Black Star up, and pulling him from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star felt a wave of both anger and a bit of fear wash over him. As he was pulled out, he looked up at the face of his tormentor. \"S-Soul!?\" He managed to choke out, seeing those unmistakable red eyes, paired with that white hair. Soul just grinned, his pearly white shark teeth grinning as he looked down at Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, who's the big man now?\" Soul laughed, giving Black Star a little squeeze. He poked his tiny friend in the chest. \"Feh, you call those pecs?\" Soul bounced his chest, Black Star forced to watch and hear as they made a dull \"Thud!\" with each flex. \"THESE are pecs!\" Soul shoved Black Star to his chest, and wiped him up and down his chest. \"Feel that? Smell that? That's what a REAL man smells like!\" Soul barked, all this power going to his head. One of his fingers poked out, and pushed Black Star's face against his fleshy chest. \"Lick it!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to lick you!\" Black Star barked back, unwilling to obey the megalomaniac. Soul just looked down at him with a frown... That is, until an idea struck him. With that, his grin returned, sending chills down Black Star's spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Then into the dungeon with you!\" He told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dungeon?\" Black Star asked. He would soon find himself regretting it. Soul stretched the waistband of his boxers as far as he could, and dropped Black Star inside! The young ninja boy fell, forced to hold onto Soul's mammoth cock, lest he fall down further and to the ground below, where he would surely get hurt! Soul just sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would have been so much easier if you'd just listen to me.\" He said. \"Maybe I'm not big enough to scare you...\" Soul then stroked his chin, thinking on that for a moment. \"Huh... Big enough...\" He repeated. \"Tell you what, Black Star! You're coming with me! I'm going to show you just how fearsome a weapon can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul turned and started making his way back to the DWMA. He'd have to find a new route to get those souls, but at his size, he wasn't about to let anyone stop him!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul now had a new mission in mind. Tormenting Black Star was fun and all, but he was still being incredibly defiant. The young ninja boy always seemed to keep his cool no matter who or what he was facing. Soul knew this and he also knew the perfect way to really strike fear into the cocky teen's heart! The ground shook with his every step, cracks radiating out from the spot where his enormous bare feet fell. He was slowly making his way back to the DWMA to get at those delicious souls! Another hundred and he'd surge to greater heights. A hundred after that and his muscles would bulge obscenely huge. Another hundred after that...the sky was the limit and even that wouldn't hold him back! Soul could already feel himself drooling as he imagined it. Five hundred had been all it took to get him to this size! And there had been hundreds of thousands of souls in that storage area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soul continued his unstoppable journey back to the school, Black Star, who had no idea of what Soul was planning beyond his declaration of showing him \"how fearsome a weapon can be\" was more concerned with escaping from Soul's underwear than with the fate of the city. His arms were wrapped tightly around Soul's cock, the meaty tube his only salvation from falling to the ground and possibly being popped like a grape under Soul's gigantic feet. He was pressed up so close to the dick that his face was pressed against it, the musky smell suffusing his nose as he struggling to hang on while it waved back and forth, slapping against Soul's thighs as he walked. He could feel the white hairs of Soul's pubes brushing occasionally against his back as well, a strange, scratchy feeling. Black Star looked around, trying to think of a way to escape. Suddenly, an idea formed! There wasn't any way he was going down against Soul's thighs to escape under the hem of the boxers and the waistband was similarly out of the question. However, there was a third route of escape directly in front of him! The flap of the boxers! Soul hadn't bothered to button it closed when he got dressed, leaving a perfect escape route! Unfortunately, Black Star would never be able to reach it unless he could get closer. He gritted his teeth as he realized the only choice he had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, halfway to the school, suddenly felt a strange pleasure course through his body. He stumbled a bit, his hand gripping the side of a building as he did so. He moaned and looked down at his groin, his breathing starting to get fast. \"W-What the hell...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it was the last thing Black Star wanted to do, he knew he had only one choice. He was currently rubbing his body against Soul's member as fast as he could, hoping to stimulate it enough that it would poke through the flap, giving him a much clearer chance of escape! Slowly, the cock hardened underneath his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, wincing in pure pleasure, did his best to keep walking. \"You're not...going to distract me...a-ah...j-just by doing...something like this!\" He panted, his eye twitching as he felt the spikes of pleasure from the soles of his feet darting up through his legs. The school was visible in the distance! He was almost there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star looked up, grinning as he saw the flap getting closer. He was no longer wrapping his arms around Soul's dick, mostly because he couldn't reach fully around it anymore! He was now able to kneel upon it, his hands still rubbing it as much as he could, thick veins erupting all over it. Just a bit more and he'd be able to crawl to freedom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Soul's cock head could poke through the flap, however, Soul wrenched open his waistband and snatched Black Star up, bringing him to his face. Black Star gulped slightly as he saw those crimson orbs glaring at him, Soul's shark like teeth bared in a fearsome frown. \"Now you've done it. I'm going to have to take care of that now. I'd make YOU do it, but you've got more important things to worry about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped Black Star down on the front steps of the DWMA before sitting down himself, his massive body jutting into the sky behind Black Star, like an ominous warning. \"Now, listen closely! There's a secret passage in the school...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul gave Black Star the instructions he needed to reach the soul storage room and then said, \"Once you get down there, bring me as many souls as you can carry! By any means necessary! And you'd better be quick about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul closed his eyes and gripped his dick, slowly pumping it. Black Star, shocked by this sudden display, turned and ran into the school, if only to get away from Soul's private time. He sighed as he made his way to the secret passage. He would play along with Soul's little game...for now. But as soon as the giant was distracted, the assassin was going to strike!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star made his way down the dank, dark hallways under the DWMA, trying to find the soul archives for Soul! As he ran about, he could just barely hear moans of a giant man pleasuring himself echo from the entrance! As if Soul wasn't big to begin with, his echo only made him seem even bigger! Black Star really wasn't quite sure if there was a way out of this one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long while of stumbling around in the dark, Black Star pushed a fake wall that led him right into the basement of the DWMA. At least now his ears were spared the sound of Soul's long, lustful groans. Although, in the silence, he could still hear it, if faintly. Black Star plugged his ears as he ran down the halls looking for the archives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh... Fuck yeah...\" Soul sighed as he laid there in his own steamy mess. \"That felt great...\" He grinned, looking on as his limp but heavy cock laid before him, strewn down the long stairs of the DWMA. Soul rubbed his abs, which then responded with a loud growl! Soul's smile soon turned sour as he looked at the entrace where he let Black Star in. \"That runt had better hurry... Or else I might start eating the city... Or better yet, maybe I'll make sure HE ends up my next meal!\" Soul said with a dark smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was by no means smart, but if anything, he was lucky (or at least, in this case he was). As he opened his second door, the first being a mere bathroom, he managed to find the soul archives! Soul after countless soul shimmered in the darkness, illuminating the shadows. Black Star's mouth was gaped open slightly as he looked up, down, and all around at all the little fluttering beauties. Now all that was left was to gather as many as he possibly could! In but a few minutes, and with arms full, Black Star made his way out of the room, and in due time, he would make his way out of the building!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, in the meantime, was getting bore waiting for Black Star. So, as any all-powerful god would, he began to plan out his reign! Death City was the first obvious step, but after that, maybe somewhere bigger! Like London! That place could do with some flattening out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as his thoughts were beginning to flow, he hear a noisy squeak! As he turned around, he could see the doors to the school opening, and out ran Black Star with souls in tow! Soul turned around, grinding the stone under how powerful muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it?\" Soul asked, looking rather displeased. \"That's barely a morsel!\" Before Black Star could raise an arguement, Soul plucked him right up and held the tiny meister over his mouth. \"Drop them.\" He ordered, almost as if he was talking to a dog. Black Star, who was a little freaked out, quickly obeyed, watching all the little blue orbs drop down into Soul's ravenous mouth! His teeth clamped shut as he chewed each and everyone one up before swallowing them down his gullet. Black Star then saw how little he had brought Soul; that armful barely made even a bump in his throat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul licked his lips, his fingers traveling from his lips, down his throat, along his pumped chest, before finally his ripped abs. Black Star looked back up at Soul's face, which was drooling, clearly craving more! The tiny ninja wasn't sure what Soul loved more, the taste or the power! Black Star could only quiver in fear of his friend as he suddenly seemed to grow all at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's massive pecs pushed out even further, like two massive orbs of power. His abs tightened together, each a steel brick. His shoulders broadened as his back flared out. His biceps flexed and undulated, growing to immese proportions as his forearms were forced to quickly follow suit! His ass bounced up another few sizes, while his monsterous dick gained a good foot and nealy doubled in thickness! His thighs surged with strength, filling out and tearing the hem of his boxers, putting even more strain on the poor cloth! Soul's calves were like two large, heavy boulders as they too increased in mass. Soul's gargantuan feet only grew bigger, and now started to push their way into the city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul let out a burp right in little Black Star's face! \"Not bad!\" He said, raising his bicep and giving it a hard flex. \"Yeah... Not bad at all!\" He added. \"But this is going to take forever at this rate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked down at Black Star. Maybe it wasn't as potent as he hoped because those souls were all too weak! Maybe the soul of the powerful Black Star would have more potency! Rile him up, make him fight a little to build up that energy, and then, just as it peaked, snatch the boy up and gobble him down! Soul got a wicked little grin as he thought of this...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul smirked down at Black Star, his stomach growling dully behind his abs. Black Star gulped as he heard it, not liking the look of lustful hunger in Soul's crimson eyes. It would be so easy to toy with the little meister. His defiance and will to live would only add seasoning to his soul, giving Soul much needed nourishment, sending his height climbing, his muscles bulging...but if he did that he would lose his little slave and breaking into the DWMA would be a pain in the ass. Plus he liked watching Black Star scurry around like a frightened mouse at his behest. He dropped Black Star back down on the ground and licked his lips, moving his face close to the little teen. \"Listen up! You're going to need to bring me way more souls than that or my belly will never be satisfied.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach growled again, lending credence to Soul's words. \"Now, you're looking pretty delicious to me right now, so unless you don't want a full inner body tour, you'd better bring more than the appetizer you presented as an entree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I can only carry up that much at once!\" Black Star protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rolled his eyes and then got an idea. Turning over onto his back, he gripped the bottom hem of his boxers and ripped off a tiny amount of the material, dropping it on Black Star's head. The strong, overpowering scent of Soul's musk nearly made Black Star swoon, his body swaying slightly as he pulled it off, looking at it in a daze. \"What...What's this for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it like this!\" Soul snapped, showing Black Star with his own hands. \"See? Use it as a sack! You'll be able to bring more souls up this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right!\" Black Star said, turning to run back into the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Soul said, turning over onto his stomach again, his face getting close to Black Star. \"Just for a little extra motivation...\" He stuck his long, thick tongue out and dragged it across Black Star's back, soaking the energetic teen in Soul's saliva, making the small boy shiver in fear. Soul moaned, licking his lips. \"Man...you taste a lot better than I thought! You'd better hurry up or you'll be the main course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star immediately took off like a bullet, charging into the school. Now that he knew how to get to the archives, he was determined to make it there and back in half the time! He REALLY didn't want to be eaten! Soul chuckled as he watched Black Star run. He put one of his thick arms behind his head and flexed the other, watching the bicep bulge and bounce with his every movement. He gave it a kiss and said, \"Just wait. You're going to be even bigger soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul gently rubbed his abs, his stomach growling. He turned his head slightly and gazed out over the city. So many unsuspecting souls...if Black Star was still too slow at least there was another enormous supply within his reach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the school, Black Star was already back in the archives, stuffing souls into his make shift sack, his brain churning in his head. This was insane! If he kept feeding Soul like this, sure, he probably wouldn't be eaten but Soul would keep growing! There was no telling how big he would want to get before he was satisfied! Looking around the room at the countless souls, Black Star felt himself go cold. Was saving himself really worth unleashing such a terrifying force into the world? He slowed down before another thought entered his head. Regardless of who was feeding him, Soul would get at all the souls inside this room. Sacrificing himself would only serve to give Soul a super charged, super powerful soul. It was truly a lose-lose situation for him. Maybe it was time to just learn to live in a world dominated by Soul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought he slung the bag over his shoulder and ran back up to the entrance of the school. Soul was waiting, resting on his arms, his body taking up the entire stairway. He licked his lips as soon as he saw the bulging sack Black Star had brought him, the stitching stretched apart, showing the lightly glowing treats within. Soul could have easily snatched the bag away and immediately sent Black Star down for more, but he much preferred being fed like the god king he was! He snatched Black Star by the back of his shirt and lifted him overhead, opening his mouth wide, his tongue flopping out like a red carpet. He lowered Black Star until he was just a few feet above the cavernous maw and said, \"Drop them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star upended the sack and watched as the souls fell down into Soul's mouth. With a little moan Soul swallowed them down, drool already running down his chin again as he set Black Star down before swallowing, a more substantial bulge traveling down his throat, the souls plopping noisily into his stomach. Soul let out another burp and patted his abs. \"More.\" he said simply, glancing at Black Star. The young meister did as he was told while Soul spread out...and grew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process repeated itself again and again. Black Star would come up with a bag of souls to feed Soul, wincing with fright as he saw Soul even bigger every time he came back up from the archive! The third time Soul had to lean on his side for his body to fit on the stairway. The fourth time Soul's right pec took it up and he was kneeling at the bottom of the hill! The fifth time Soul's broad chest took up his whole view! The sixth time Soul was leaning back, his legs spread out on either side of the hill, his dick taking up the entire stairwell! Black Star's heart was hammering, not just from the work out, but from just how enormous Soul was getting! The seventh time he came up, he barely noticed that he had run directly out onto Soul's tongue, the weapon's throat pulsing in front of him! He skidded to a halt at the last second, staring in horror at the uvula as it bounced, a glob of saliva landing on his head. Deep from within Soul's chest his voice bellowed out, \"DROP IT!\" Black Star, panicking, threw the whole sack down Soul's throat before turning tail and running. Soul's tongue began to retract under him, nearly dragging him back inside that monstrous maw! Black Star barely managed to land outside the mouth as Soul's teeth clicked shut, trapping the souls in his mouth without Black Star. The blue haired teen gaped as he saw Soul's enormous head rise up into the air, revealing Soul's gigantic throat and mountainous pecs. With a heavy gulp, Black Star watched the large bulge travel down Soul's throat, disappearing at his chest. Soul moaned, patting his slightly distended abs, letting out an earth shaking burp before his body began to grow! His pecs bulged out, smashing the hill that the school was situated on, the ground rumbling under Black Star's feet. His abs each popped out, row by row, thick, steel hard mounds of muscle, his biceps bulging out more and more as his shoulders broadened, his back flaring out. With a thrill of horror, Black Star realized that Soul was still sitting down, despite the fact that his pecs were now towering overhead, casting a shadow over the entire school (and much of the city behind it) blocking Soul's face from view. With a loud moan, Soul began to flex his pecs, each one rising and falling with a thunderous THUD, illustrating the pure power coiled up within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMM NOT BAD BLACK STAR.\" Soul said, his voice rumbling loudly overhead, surrounding Black Star like the voice of a true god. \"BUT I THINK I CAN HANDLE THE REST MYSELF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Black Star could fathom what he meant, his gigantic hand easily gripped the entire school in his palm, tearing it up off of its foundation! Soul leaned over, so he could see into the basement, nearly crushing Black Star under his pecs, the tiny meister saved by being trapped between the thick muscles. Soul grinned as he saw the glittering cornucopia below, just waiting for him to partake. He drove his gigantic fingers into the ground around the room and lifted it up, bringing it up to his drooling mouth, his tongue running over his shark like teeth as he held the archive above his head. Tilting his head back, his lazily opened his mouth wide and dumped the archive, each twinkling soul bouncing off his tongue before gathering in the back of his throat. Once the archive was empty, Soul crushed the room into dust between his fingers, wiping it carelessly off on his chest before swallowing, the biggest lump of all moving laboriously down his throat. Soul moaned and touched it, following its slow descent down his throat and into his cavernous belly. With another earth shaking burp, his abs bulged out a little more, giving Soul a bit of a muscle gut. Soul chuckled and patted his now full belly, just waiting for the growth spurts of growth spurts to overtake him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star could only stare up at his huge friend. He just ate the entire DWMA! On top of it all, Soul had a determined, almost hungry look on his face! Before the fear could travel any further through Black Star's body, there was a rumble! It almost felt like an earthquake... But then it came again, even more powerful! Being the only person who had even an idea of what was going on, Black Star made a mad dash for Soul's foot, landing on top just in the nick of time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OHHH... IT'S COMING BLACK STAR!\" Soul said, his voice booming over the town like thunder. Soul pecs pushed out and out and OUT! In mere seconds, his height began to skyrocket, as his entire body filled out even bigger, muscles added upon already massive muscles, the titan of a boy growing to an immesurable size! Soul's pecs alone now were so huge, they were like mountains themselves! His arms seemed to be in competition with his pecs, blowing up to insane sizes, packed to the brim with unrivaled strength, each one easily three times the size of Death City itself! His abs pushed out a little further, but soon faded slightly as Soul's midsection was filled by a powerful, and not to mention hungry, muscle gut, more powerful than any abs! His back was flaring outward, greater and stronger than any wall! Soul's traps shot up, raising up until they were about halfway up to his head, not to mention his neck was bigger and thicker than any tree ever recorded, three times over! Soul's thighs grew into perfect size, so massive that they rubbed against each other with every step, yet just small enough that he wouldn't have to waddle around... Yet! His calves were immesurable pillars! One might say they were like humongous, divine blades cast down from the heavens by the gods themselves! Black Star watched as the expanse of feet before him kept getting bigger and wider... Before, he was only about as big as the nail on Soul's pinky toe, but now even that dwarfed the once proud muscle assassin! What was once Death City was now no more than a puny, worthless speck on the growing expanse that was Soul! Soul's beautiful ass pushed out behind him, both like two moons of pure meat! His cock too had outgrown, becoming so large, thick, and long that it not only looking like a third leg, but also to the point it was the size of a great and massive tree!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul let out an ear-shattering roar as he reached his full height! His head was peaked above the clouds! Black Star was luckily far enough that his ears didn't pop! Soul groaned, as his arms felt all the way down his body... His hands, the size of an entire state squeezed his pecs. He let out a loud moan of sheer erotic pleasure as his hand then ran down, rubbing his bloated muscle gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MAN... ALL THAT GROWTH... AND I'M STILL HUNGRY!\" Soul's voice bellowed. Black Star froze as he heard this! Part of him relaxed, knowing he was no meal for Black Star. Hell, even the tiny, tiny hairs that covered every human's skin were as tall as trees to him now! Soul's stomach let out an ominous growl, begging for something, ANYTHING to eat! Soul looked down, forced to bend over because he couldn't even see past his beautiful, gigantic pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOD... SOMETHING... SO... HUNGRY!!!\" Soul shouted! Without hesitation, he dug his fingers down into the earth, unintentionally scooping up several cities in his ginormous as he did, and dropped it right into his mouth! He began to chew and crunch, before swallowing it all down, his fingers tracing the lump that traveled down his throat. Soul began to drool, as his stomach let out another growl that could be heard for miles upon miles! \"I GOTTA HAVE MORE... I'M NOT GONNA STOP UNTIL THIS WHOLE WORLD IS JUST FOOD IN MY STOMACH!\" Soul announced to no one but himself! With that, Soul began to scoop up more and more of the planet, feeding it into his canvernous, black hole of a mouth...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The very second Black Star heard those words, his eyes widened and he desperately shouted, \"NO! SOUL! YOU CAN'T!\" as loud as he possibly could. For all the good it did him, he might as well not have even tried. Soul's god like hands uprooted entire states, shoving them into his gaping maw, his razor sharp teeth turning the hunks of land, cities, streets, vegetation, and people, concrete, steel, and wires, all into an indiscriminate mush before gulping it down, an almost orgasmic moan erupting from his throat as he did so. His voice was louder than thunder, able to be heard almost anywhere in the world, his form not only towering high over the United States, but over the planet at large, his muscular form visible even from other countries. Black Star was tossed around as the skin beneath him constantly moved, growing bigger and longer and wider, the hairs that towered like trees soon towering like skyscrapers, making Black Star feel as insignificant as a  speck of lint on a god's foot...which is what he was for all intents and purposes. He gazed up in awe and fear, not even able to see Soul's face past his bloated muscle gut, the ball of muscle dangling high overhead like an ominous moon, shaking slightly as more and more of the planet dropped within it, making it stretch and bulge, constantly churning and groaning as it demanded more and more and MORE!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was like a machine, his eyes trained on the ground, looking only for his next handful. Soon, one by one, the entire mainland of the United States was devoured, Soul's enormous feet planted firmly on Canada and Mexico, the foot on Mexico trailing somewhat into the water. Soul rubbed his gut with a moan, unleashing a burp that sounded more like a sonic boom, the sound echoing all over the world, dispersing clouds and planes with the force of its wind. Soul sighed in satisfaction and grinned down at the planet, flexing his massive arms, the biceps bloating bigger than his head! Every muscle on his body was pumped beyond belief, his body looking pumped beyond belief, from his pecs bulging outward and resting heavily on top of his gut, down to his thick thighs, each one wider and more powerful than any natural or man made structure on the planet. Even the slightest of his movements caused the Earth to quake, magma shooting up from massive trenches, spewing ash and fire into the air, making Soul look like a dark god rising from the depths of the planet to bring about the end of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET A GOOD LOOK AT YOUR FUTURE YOU PATHETIC GERMS!\" Soul bellowed, shaking his stomach slightly. \"YOU'RE ALL GOING TO FEED MY BELLY AND BECOME A PART OF MY BODY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted his foot and scooped up Mexico, dangling the landmass over his head, grinning as he realized he couldn't distinguish falling debris from falling people. He briefly savored the sheer fear some of these useless specks must be experiencing as they fell thousands of miles, crashing against his godly body. With a dark, deep chuckle, he opened his mouth wide, strings of saliva glistening from his teeth as he slowly lowered the country into his mouth, savoring the unique taste. It didn't taste like dirt or grass but had a distinct, delicious flavor all its own, the flavor of the planet itself. No one smaller than him would have been able to appreciate the intoxicating flavor a planet. He moaned once more as he swallowed Mexico whole, tracing the lump as it disappeared behind his massive chest, landing with a plop into the juices residing in his stomach. Soul turned his attention to Canada and continued his worldly buffet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown, down, down below on Soul's gargantuan foot, Black Star was starting to lose sight of Soul as a whole. His once slightly shorter friend was now so massive, so unbelievably, mind bendingly gigantic that he could only comprehend bits of him. The foot was an endless plain of musky flesh stretching as far as he could see in every direction, a slight glint in the distance the only bit of the toenail that could be seen. Behind him, the leg rose like an endless pillar, disappearing amongst the clouds. Soul was growing so huge, standing in the ocean was like standing in a puddle, despite the monumental tidal waves that washed over the planet. For Soul, it was unnoticeable. Within minutes, all of the Western hemisphere was gone, all digesting inside Soul's gut. With a lick of his lips, the titanic weapon turned his red eyes on Europe. With a single step, his toes were resting on the outskirts of the United Kingdom. The once proud nation was little more than a handful of food to Soul, whose attention was much more preoccupied with meatier fare, such as Asia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one by one, the countries of the world, the continents, the islands, even the very oceans disappeared, leaving nothing an increasingly more massive Soul in their wake, the souls of billions of people charging his growth to greater and greater heights! Soul got down, as best he could, on his hands and knees and began to dig into the dry ocean beds, his weight already slowly skewing the orbit of the planet, magma erupting all over the dying planet, taking the planet itself into his cavernous mouth. Soul sighed and rested once the planet was nothing more than a half of a planet, just the right size for Soul's gigantic ass, even more perfectly sculpted, into a chair, the magma of the Earth's core acting as a seat warmer. Soul sighed and gently stroked his gurgling gut, gazing into the vastness of space, a dreamy expression on his face. Lazily, he reached up and grabbed the moon, biting into like an apple, savoring its smoky taste before glancing at his foot. He knew Black Star was down there, somewhere, though he couldn't see him. It didn't matter. He didn't matter. Only one thing DID matter. Still, he knew that Black Star could still hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Black Star...\" Soul said, dusting his hands off as the swallowed the remains of the moon. \"I've been thinking. What happens when all the people of the planet are digesting inside my belly? No more Souls means no more growth right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, who had sat down as soon as Soul started speaking, curious about what he had to say, nodded, despite knowing that Soul couldn't see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more I ate the planet, the more I realized, planets are not dead. They're living, breathing entities, capable of supporting life. And like all living things, planets have souls. The core of the planet, what gives it its shape and keeps it running, is the planets soul. So even after the human race is extinct, I'll still be able to grow. Planets, stars, galaxies, I'm positive they all have souls. And they'll all end up right here.\" He patted his belly affectionately and said, \"So I've decided to keep eating and eating and eating until all of existence is resting inside me. A whole universe digesting in my gut. So you have a choice now. Either stay where you are on my foot, and watch from afar as I devour the universe, or jump onto the planet and join the rest of humanity inside me. What's it going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul lifted his feet up and rested them on the planet, digging his hand into the ground right next to the foot Black Star was on. He would give Black Star five minutes to decide. After that, he'd begin eating again. The first handful he'd take would be the handful that Black Star would jump down to. The choice was his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star thought about it. It would be something of a privilege to see Soul stretch and grow until he ate the entire universe, but after that what would happen? What would there be to see? If he was eaten now he wouldn't see Soul complete his journey but he would be with the planet and his fellow humans, fulfilling their purpose as food for Soul. Black Star knew there was probably nothing he could do at this point. Should he just give up?  His mind turned these problems over and over again in his mind. Finally, with less than a minute to go, Black Star made his choice.</span></div></div>",

Chunks of the earth vanished down Soul's gullet, crushed to bits before swallowed by the ravenous weapon! He grinned as he felt his immense body grow larger, his taut, round ass sticking up against another planet! Nothing could stop Soul from devouring entire planets now! Soul finished off the earth, the last crumbs hanging off his tongue before disappearing into the abyss! Soul smiled, rubbing his stomach a little. All that kneading forced the air out of his stomach, and make him release a supersonic burp that echoed through the cosmos! Soul chuckled to himself as the start near his mouth had parted slightly. If moving stars didn't make you some kind of god, he didn't know what did! And speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul rose up his arms, and flexed them as hard as he could! Biceps the size of the moon swelled upon form! He grinned and flexed them harder, making the muscles bulge up, pressing his veins against his skin. Veins that were the size of great rivers! Soul smirked, before looking down at his pecs. Two huge, immeasurable orbs of untold strength. He flexed them, watching them tighten, before relaxing them again. His started to bounce them, one after the other! Each time, they hit up against his chin, as a thud echoed throughout space. Soul smiled, his hands running down them and giving them a sensual squeeze. A groan slipped from his lips, as his pec flexed invoulentarily in his hand! Soul started to moan, as both of his hands began to fondle his chest, playing iwht the two huge, round muscles. Soul's eyes closed shut as he took a moment to admire his massive size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's skin, so smooth, his hands glided right along his pecs! His hands could barely hold onto the two pieces of meat. He could feel his cock twich, and he so desperately wanted to touch, but his hands wouldn't listen! They remained clutched to his pecs! His hands, able to crush asteroids into dust, pressed and squeezed, making Soul's foot twitch as the pleasure couldn't be contained in his titanic body! Something was stirring, and it was coming soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below, on his feet, Black Star could hear Soul beginning to moan. He felt a little stir in his pants, hearing such a low, dull growl echoing through space. He had an idea of what he could do to stop Soul, but the sound of his friend's deep, lustful moans were getting hard to deny! \"I-I have to try... To resonate with Soul...\" Black Star though, as he got on hands and knees, \"Then out power... H-His power will become mine... too...!\" Black Star said to himself. His ears felt as if they were melting, little pricks of pure ecstacy were poking at his manhood! Black Star wouldn't be able to hold out much longer... But if he just waited, he could catch Soul when he was at his weakest!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star winced as he heard Soul's deep voice moan lustfully, the skin of the foot he was kneeling on heating up as Soul's passion increased. The meister tried to block the sound out, but even covering his ears didn't work! Soul was so impossibly enormous his voice vibrated Black Star to his very core, pleasure spiking through the tiny human's body. \"I...I've gotta hold out...I can do this...I can do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star's mind drifted to thoughts of Soul, to his thick, heavy pecs resting on that bloated, powerful muscle gut, gigantic arms bulging with muscle, bigger now than planets, traps rising up around his neck, making his entire torso look impossible bloated with power and size, his legs stretching across the vastness of space. Black Star glanced down toward the end of the foot and could just make out Soul's gigantic toes, the big and second one, gripping Venus between them. The only reason they weren't crushing it into dust was because Soul needed to add it to his belly to fuel his unending growth. The thought of Soul growing bigger and bigger, devouring the solar system before setting out to eat the rest of the galaxy, finishing with the galaxy itself and then moving on to eat the other galaxies was enough to break the last of Black Star's resistance. Surrounded as he was by the greatest specimen humanity could provide, he was barely even in control of his own actions. He flopped onto his back and pulled his engorged member from his pants, the shaft harder than it had ever been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, meister and weapon began to wank, Black Star's insignificant moan drowned completely by Soul's cosmic one. The gigantic weapon moved one hand down from his pecs to his shaft, gripping it tightly and jerking himself, his other hand rubbing his belly, the deep gurgling noise coming from within playing like thunder in the background. Soul grinned as he closed his eyes, feeling his immensity as it floated through space. He opened them again when he felt an annoying stinging sensation on his face. Hundreds of tiny specks were smashing into his face. They were so small they were like crumbs to the colossal weapon. Soul frowned and glared at them, figuring out what they were only after he saw Saturn in the distance beyond them. He grinned as he realized he was staring at the asteroid belt. \"Stupid crumbs.\" Soul muttered, sticking his tongue out and licking the space rocks up, swallowing them down in one gulp. A few more licks, and the entire formation was gone. This godly act only spurred Soul on, his hand moving faster and faster, jolts of pleasure coursing through his body right down to the soles of his feet, making his foot twitch and his toes clench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was constantly tossed and tumbled around and yet every time his back connected with solid ground and he stopped moving, he continued pleasuring himself furiously, his body slowly glistening with sweat. Images of his friend turned god were burned into his mind, spurring him on. Soul's confident grin, dripping with saliva, his immensely powerful body lording it over all of creation. It was a dream in his mind but he knew that at the rate Soul was eating and growing it would become a reality, the entire universe condensed down inside Soul's gut, the titanic organ churning, working it down until it was gone, absorbed into Soul's godly body. And then...what would happen next? One could only guess but Black Star would be the one privileged human who would witness it. The very thought of Soul becoming lord of all creation sent Black Star over the edge, cum spurting out of the slit in hot sticky ropes, covering the young assassin in his own essence, his body alternating between hot and cold. Panting, Black Star looked up at the pale wall of flesh that was Soul's leg, stretching into infinity and felt humbled by how truly insignificant he was. He sighed and closed his eyes, drifting off to sleep, the last sight and sound his waking mind perceived being a veritable ocean of cum covering the sky above him, accompanied by Soul's roar of pure pleasure. Not a single drop of Soul's juices would fall on Black Star, the thick spunk drifting off into the far reaches of space, nearly putting out a few stars as it drifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul sighed happily and scratched his globular gut, grinning stupidly, lost in the pleasurable after glow of his self pleasure session. He crossed his legs and glanced down at his foot, wondering briefly if Black Star had decided to stick around or not. \"Knowing that idiot, he's probably still down there trying to fight me or something.\" Soul chuckled at the very idea of anyone or anything being able to match him. He truly felt like a god now, the entire universe his to take and devour. He felt his belly vibrate as it growled, demanding more sustenance. Soul chuckled and patted it. \"You're never satisfied are you? Good! Neither am I.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stretched and moved himself into a more upright position, cracking his neck and his knuckles before setting back out on his mission.</span></div></div>",

No, in fact, Death City was like any other city, for the most part. One look at this place, and you would notice it's most popular landmark; some kind of large castle. In fact, this \"castle\" was the DWMA, or the Death Weapon Meister Academy. An academy of youth that creates a death scythe, a weapon of great power, attained by consuming 99 malicious souls, and 1 soul of a witch. It is here that our story begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step one... Blend into the shadows, control your breathing... And wait for your target to let down his guard...\" Black Star shouted noisily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Black Star...\" Soul, Black Star's shark-toothed friend said, noticing the blue haired ninja. \"I was wondering where you were. C'mon, we got class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit...\" Black Star grumbled under his breath. \"Just you wait, Soul! One of these days, I'm gonna really surprise you!\" He tackled his friend from behind, riding him piggyback. Soul just chuckled, carrying him for a bit before letting him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure you will.\" He said with his usual grin. \"That was so uncool... Hope no one saw that...\" He scratched the back of his head, thinking to himself. He was, of course, referring to the little ride he let Black Star hitch off of him. Ever since the Kishin was defeated, they had a little more free time, Soul and Black Star had grown at least a little more closer than the friendly brotherhood they once shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two entered the classroom and took their seats, it didn't take long for their teacher, Dr. Stein, to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, take a seat kids...\" Stein said, no more interested in teaching than he usually was. \"Oh, Black Star.\" Stein pushed up his glasses and pointed at the young man. \"Shinigami-sama wanted to see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, who had just sat down, sprung right back up. \"Heh, figures he'd want to see me! I'm the strongest man in this room!\" Black Star said with his usual cocky arrogance. He began heading right for the door, everyone of his classmates shooting daggers at him once his back was turned. Black Star didn't mind. He took all eyes on him as a compliment, no matter how they were looking at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Star, wait!\" Tsubaki, Black Star's weapon and companion called out. Stein rose a hand up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just</i> Black Star. Shinigami-sama was very clear about that.\" He instructed the young woman. She sat back down, a bit of worry and sadness on her face. After all, there was a bit of an issue with Black Star last night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, the two were close. They were weapon and meister after all. They even slept in the same bed together! But last night was different... Just as Tsubaki had entered the bedroom, Black Star had packed up his pillow and had one of their extra blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sleeping on the couch.\" Black Star told Tsubaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words seemed to resonate within her, tormenting her, playing like a bad movie, over and over in her mind. She couldn't help but worry that it might have been something she did... Or said... Nothing seemed different between her, which just left her confused...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Black Star was already in Shinigami-sama's office, getting a run down of a mission he was getting sent out on!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So! Are there any questions?\" Shinigami-sama asked, his lone finger popping up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I get to do a solo mission, AND skip out on class?\" Black Star said, a smirk across his face as his arms were behind his head. \"Sounds good to me! Don't you worry, I'll check out that warehouse for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do be careful...\" Shinigami-sama said with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!\" Black Star replied, already heading out, under the intimidating guillotines that led to Shinigami-sama's office. The young ninja had no idea what was in store for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star later wound up in the abandoned part of town. No one was around, obviously. All that stood before him were a series of large warehouses. He started to walk among them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2-C...\" Black Star mumbled to himself, looking around. Many of the iron plates that labeled the houses were rusted out. They weren't even near water, so this only emphasized how old this part of town was. \"Aha!\" Black Star shouted out, finding the warehouse in question. After prying the doors open, which wasn't too hard for a boy of his musculature, he wandered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was dark inside. Boxes were stacked high, as far as the eye could see. After only a few moments, Black Star saw a golden gleam near the back. He rushed over, jumping from the tops of the towering crates with ease. In the area now, he peered downward, looking at the fantastic gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Yup! That's it!\" Black Star said with a grin. \"The ancient soul of O'Lanturn Jack! Death City's best kept secret!\" Black Star swooped down and grabbed up the floating orb. \"Huh... Not bad.\" Black Star said to himself. \"Now THIS is a soul!\" A long grin stretched across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The soul of the mighty O'Lanturn Jack.\" Shinigami-sama said, as Black Star recalled. \"When he was on the brink of death, he hid himself from hiding, for the one who would find his soul would find a power beyond that of any witch, meister, or weapon! Possibly even beyond that of a death scythe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... You want me to find this dude's soul or something?\" Black Star asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, in fact, great news! We've already spotted it!\" Shinigami-sama said enthusiastically. \"However, Spirit refuses to let us take Maka from her studies, and Kid is already off on an important task... And we can't send a weapon to do it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry, Shinigami-sama! You don't have to make up reasons! I already know I'm the best you have!\" Black Star said with the uptmost confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinigami-sama was less than amused by Black Star's antics, but set them aside. \"So! Are there any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star began his trip back to the DWMA. However, the unexpected happened, not even Shinigami-sama himself could have seen it coming! As Black Star carried the soul of O'Lanturn over his shoulder in the sack given to him, the soul had suddenly slipped through the bag... And disappeared into Black Star!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man continued on his way, unaware of all the surprises that would be in store for him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star was dealing with a force far trickier than he had ever faced before. The soul, once inside his body, moved to the center of Black Star's being and settled there, its glow slowly receding, biding its time for the proper moment to unleash its power. Black Star was none the wiser, merrily making his way back to the DWMA to deliver what he thought was an ultra rare soul to Shinigami-sama. It didn't take him long to reach Shinigami-sama's office. He dashed under the guillotines and stood dramatically before the powerful meister. With a confident grin he dropped the bag in front of Shinigami-sama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was totally the easiest mission I have ever been on!\" Black Star announced proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you didn't have any trouble then?\" Shinigami-sama asked, raising an eyebrow at Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! Like someone as amazing as me would have trouble!\" Black Star guffawed. \"I just walked right into that warehouse, got the soul, and came back to give you this bag faster than light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinigami-sama just stared at Black Star, not very impressed by his boasts. Instead, he grabbed the drawstrings on the bag and pulled them loose, peering into the burlap sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Didn't I do great?\" Black Star asked, moving in closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinigami-sama answered by straightening up and smacking Black Star on the head, hard, with one of his hands. \"You've brought back an empty bag! What kind of trick are you trying to pull here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" Black Star shouted, sticking his head into the bag. \"No way! It was definitely in here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinigami-sama sighed and said, \"Of course it was. Looks like we got another false tip. The search continues!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm telling you I definitely had it!\" Black Star argued, kicking the bag in his frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinigami-sama chopped him again and said, \"Silence! Classes are over so you may return home. I would advise you to do that immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star grit his teeth and turned on his heel. \"Fine! I will!\" With those words, he stormed out of the office, not looking back for even a second. The soul within his body flickered in seeming amusement before dimming again. Black Star was stomping grumpily through the hall when he nearly ran smack dab into Soul. \"Woah! Black Star watch where you're going! Not cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star glared at Soul and said, \"Aw shut up! It's not like I hit you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul looked surprised at Black Star's anger. \"Jeez what's your problem? Shinigami-sama punish you or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star sighed and said, \"No...He sent me on a mission and I did really awesome at it but the super powerful rare soul I was supposed to bring back disappeared somehow! That stupid thing made me look like a total idiot! If I ever get my hands on it again I'm going to smash it into pulp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's stomach suddenly growled, his mouth watering at the idea of a \"super powerful rare soul\". He wiped his mouth and said, \"Yeah...wish I could have seen it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star didn't seem to notice the look on his friend's face. \"Anyway, I want to just forget about all this crap! Let's go do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul put his hands in his pockets and shrugged. \"Sure, whatever. What do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star thought about it, crossing his arms and tapping his foot, his eyes closed in an expression of concentration. Soul rolled his eyes and leaned against the wall, waiting somewhat impatiently for his friend to decide. After a few minutes had passed, Black Star's eyes popped open and a grin rose to his lips. \"I've got it! Let's get something to eat! I heard your stomach growling earlier and I'm pretty hungry too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked Soul playfully in the gut, earning an irritated look from his friend. \"Hey, don't do that...it tickles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star chuckled and wrapped his arm around Soul's shoulders. \"Don't tell me that! You're just going to make me want to do it more!\" He never got tired of teasing his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pair made their way to the nearest restaurant for some food, the soul within Black Star slowly began to glow brighter. It seemed that Black Star was in for quite a strange ride...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star and Soul sat down at one of their usual joints, The White Skull. Nothing high class, just a casual eatery for casual people. Black Star wasn't even looking at the menu as much as he was Soul. However, Soul was more focused on the menu than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking about getting the tempura... How about-- ... What?\" Soul asked as he put the menu down, only to see his friend gazing at him. It was kind of weird, the look he was giving him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... You're eyes are really red.\" Black Star said, looking up at him as he laid low to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? So?\" Soul raised an eyebrow at this notation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice.\" Black Star replied. Soul just looked aside, a slight blush across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, don't say such stupid things! It's not cool at all!\" Soul told him, \"Geez, what's wrong with you...\" Black Star just laughed, knowing full well what he did. It was always fun teasing Soul since he always had the same, funny reaction!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pat his stomach happily. \"That hit the spot...\" He sighed happily. \"I swear, I'm so full I could burst...\" He groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star rubbed along his cut abs too. \"Yeah, I know! I'm almost surprised I could finish it all...\" As the two sat together, Black Star couldn't help but steal looks at Soul. Lately things had felt different between them. At least for Black Star. The young ninja boy had started to feel somewhat of an... attraction to his friend. The bond they shared had developed further, and he couldn't help thinking Soul was a little less \"cool\" and a little more \"sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs those simple thoughts crossed his mind, that light within Black Star had begun to flicker once more! Unbeknownst to him, Soul was now starting to grow a little taller, his muscles developing to give him a nice athletic build that rivaled Black Star's! Who knows, Soul could have been even stronger than Black Star now. There was a smile stretched across Black Star's face as he imagined this, feeling a little twitch in his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you smiling about?\" Soul seemed to suddenly ask. He then shook his head, seeing that familiar look in Black Star's eyes again. \"Nevermind... I've going to the bathroom real quick...\" With that, Soul stood up, and head a sudden tear! He immediately began to look over himself, but didn't see anything on him that could have snapped. He pat his rear end... Yup! His pants were still all together, not a hole to be felt! Figuring it wasn't him, he walked over to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, however, had seen what had torn. The bottom of Soul's jacket, at the back, was significantly tighter, had rode up slightly, and now had a tear along it. Black Star now blushed as he not only saw his friend's fine ass, but also his blue boxers! Black Star couldn't help but have a little fantasy to himself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, Black Star didn't question his sexuality! He had the confidence to know that he was perfect the way he was, and any voice of doubt that dared rear it's head in his mind was squashed flat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I tell you, I had a hard enough time trying to get it out in the stall...\" Soul said, looking down and patting his groin while no one was looking. He had to make sure the zipper was up! The last thing he needed was for his manhood to flop out during the walk home! Not that he lacked confidence... But he hated to being humiliated. In any way, shape, or form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're getting older, you know.\" Black Star said, \"Tsubaki told me that guys get bigger down there when they get older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If dealing with it every time I go to the bathroom is that much of a pain, I'm not sure I WANT it any bigger...\" Soul said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Why? How big is it?\" Black Star asked, looking away nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's already up to about ni-- HEY! Why do you even wanna know!?\" Soul spurted out. A little bit of trust he had for Black Star wavered, as far as personal issues went. Black Star just grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine inches! Got it!\" He thought happily to himself. \"You know...\" Black Star replied to Soul, \"In case you ever need condoms or something and... I dunno, you're too embarrassed to buy them... Is it really that big of a deal to tell your best friend!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Soul looked at Black Star. \"Hey, have you gotten shorter?\" Soul asked, noticing he had to look a little further down to see Black Star now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Black Star looked over. \"Whoa! Did you have a growth spurt back there or something!?\" Black Star exclaimed, looking over Soul. Soul just laughed triumphantly, ruffling Black Star's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, DWARF Star! I'm sure you'll catch up to the real man!\" Soul said with a grin, flexing his arm... Which then tore his sleeve. \"Hey!\" Soul shouted, looking at his arm. \"What the hell... Look at that!\" He flexed it again and again, grinning at the bouncing muscle. \"Not bad! Maybe I am hitting puberty!\" Soul ran his hands down the rest of his body. Over his pecs, which felt like they had an extra layer of muscle over them, to his abs that felt like a hard, bumpy road down his stomach. \"And this is just the start?! This is too cool!\" Soul laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, who was furious with jealousy, couldn't help staring at his friend, who was now sexier than ever! In the heat of the moment...</span></div></div>",

So when he saw Soul suddenly bigger and stronger than him, it struck a nerve in him and made him see red for a brief instant. Soul and he were best friends and had been since they both started going to school together. He wanted to be happy for him, but he just couldn't manage it. The little flare of attraction that had been lit inside him when he was watching Soul eat earlier had increased in intensity, just slightly, but it wasn't enough to quell the inferno of jealousy tearing through his body. Especially when Soul was still flexing and admiring himself, unzipping his jacket to get a better look at his thicker pecs and cut abs! The added muscles even made his scar seem sexier! That was the last straw to the excitable ninja! He clenched his fists and ground his teeth as he suddenly shouted, \"That's it! I'm going to definitely get bigger than you! Just wait and see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul raised an eyebrow at Black Star, stuffing his hands in his pockets and rolling his eyes. \"Oh come on Black Star...I was just joking around. Don't take it so personally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Black Star wasn't listening. He had already run off, conceivably to head to the gym to work out some more. Soul just shook his head, not sure what he should do. Going after him might just make him angrier, but he didn't like the idea of just leaving him alone either...He sighed and rubbed the back of his head. \"Man...so uncool! Why do I always have to make these decisions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star threw his door open and stormed inside. Tsubaki had gone on a trip back to her home town for some private business. Black Star had been a little miffed when she refused to tell him why and said he couldn't come, but he had gotten over it pretty fast. Things like that never bothered him for long. He ran to the bathroom and pulled off his shirt and took off his pants, leaving him in just a pair of boxers. He took a few steps back and looked himself over in the mirror. \"Yeah...this is still great! I just need to work on pumping it up bigger! Bigger than Soul so I can really impress him and show him who the real man is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner were these words out of his mouth than the soul inside him sparked again and started to work its magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Black Star tilted his head as he saw...his body rising up? He looked down at himself and then back in the mirror. It appeared that he was slowly moving up in the mirror, his body lengthening and growing taller. Suddenly, his body surged up! Black Star let out a surprised yelp as he suddenly realized he had gotten at least three feet taller! If Soul had been standing next to him, he would have barely reached Black Star's chest! Black Star's look of shock and amazement quickly changed to a grin of delight. \"Awesome! I'm so manly I'm growing just because I want to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star flexed his arms and said, \"Some bigger guns would be great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnswering to his whims, the noisy assassin's arms began to swell up, larger and larger. With a flex the vein covered balls of muscle exploded upward, big as softballs! Black Star experimentally squeezed one, even his fingers unable to make a dent in it! He put his hands at his hips and flexed his chest muscles. \"Alright guys! Get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs pushed out in bursts, inflating like balloons, the cleft between them growing deeper while his shoulders broadened and his back flared out, a veritable road map of cut, striated muscle. Black Star tapped his abs and smirked. \"Forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRow by row the abs popped out from his stomach, giving Black Star a thick look. \"Come on legs! Get with the program!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star chuckled as his thighs thickened, stretching his boxers to the breaking point, his calves bloating out behind him while his feet grew thicker, wider and slightly longer to better hold up the young man's much heavier body. He could even feel his ass harden, swell a bit, and shape itself into two perfect spheres of muscle and fat, giving it that bubbly look that just made you want to grab it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last but not least...\" Black Star thrust his hips forward, his dick immediately starting to grow, pushing its way out of the slit in his boxers, his balls swelling up right along with it. His boxers shred apart, unable to withstand this final assault. Black Star grinned and flexed in the mirror, his hands running over his thick pecs, rock hard abs, and tree trunk like legs. He was definitely bigger than Soul now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock at the door! \"Black Star? Are you in there? Come on man, I want to apologize! Or whatever...\" Was there anything he could actually apologize for? He didn't control his body after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soul?\" Black Star said quietly to himself, looking a bit confused. His eyes quickly lit up. \"Souuuuuul~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mischievous look on his face, Black Star slowly made his way to the door, the room shaking slightly as he walked. Standing up to his full height, he pulled the door open revealing Soul standing on the door step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you opened....the....door?\" Soul said, his eyes widening as he looked UP at Black Star!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Soul?\" Black Star said with a grin. \"What do you think of the new me?\"</span></div></div>",

He immediately felt smaller, but his spirit wasn't entirely crushed. Black Star just frowned... Before then smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... You're right... It's not...\" He agreed. Soul looked back in the corner of his eye, surprised to hear Black Star agree with him. His eyes widened a bit as he saw what just happened. Black Star's body had suddenly burst with size, nearly doubling in mass! \"NOW it's that great!\" Black Star grinned, flexing his bicep. It must have been at least the size of a cantaloupe! And a huge one at that! Black Star suddenly reached out and grabbed Soul's wrist, jerking him inside his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill controlling his arm, Black Star lifted Soul's wrist, and pulled it back. \"Come on, flex big man!\" Black Star said with a heavy note of sarcasm. \"You were showing it off so proudly a few minutes ago!\" Soul just whimpered a bit, looking up at the titan that was his friend. After a bit of hesitation, he flexed his arm, the muscle popping up from his arm. Black Star laughed at Soul's puny arm, and flexed his own, putting it right next to Soul's. \"Heh, you see? THIS is an arm! Not that little toothpick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pulled his arm away, blushing slightly. He, in turn, couldn't help but have a little arousal at his close friend's new attitude. Black Star, who was still grinning, started to move in on Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Black Star said, towering over his friend. \"I wasn't done with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul made a dash for the door, getting it open before Black Star's arm, with it's inhuman power, slammed it shut! \"Let me out, Black Star!\" Soul demanded, glaring up at him. Black Star just laughed it off. To him, Soul looked about as intimidating as a wet kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Black Star replied with nothing but sheer confidence. \"You said all this...\" Black Star's hand gestured down at his massive body. \"Wasn't that great. How about I show you just how great it is!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's eyes had followed Black Star's hand. It was finally at this point he had realized that Black Star was naked! \"Dude! Put some clothes on or something!\" He demanded, pulling away from Black Star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And hide this amazing guy?\" Black Star asked, grabbing his cock and giving it a little shake. It must have been at least 11 inches! Soul blushed and looked away. He was bigger... In every way and form! At this moment, Black Star grabbed Soul by his open jacket, and hefted his up. He turned around, and set Soul down on his couch, the young weapon gazing upward at the behemoth of a ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star, who was still grinning through it all, put his arms behind his head, and gave his pecs and arrogant flex. \"These pecs...\" He moved down, and pressed his chest tight to Soul's. They must have been as huge as watermelons! Not only did they overlap Soul's, but they nearly touched Soul's chin in the process. \"Bigger than yours. These arms?\" Black Star flexed them simultaneously, smiling at Soul for a moment before giving them a long, slow, self-absorbed lick. \"Bigger than yours.\" He said, snickered. \"All of this...\" Black Star showed every inch of his massive, bulging muscles to Soul, from his round, bowling ball ass to his tree trunk legs. \"You see it now? I'm bigger than you! I'm BETTER than you!\" He laughed triumphantly, bouncing his thick, burly pecs, one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-Shaddup... Just because you suddenly got so huge...\" Soul blushed furiously, looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star grinned. Just the words he wanted to hear. Just as Soul looked away, he burst upward, growing even buffer! His head just barely slammed into the ceiling, and his pecs pushed into his chin. He was forced onto his ass, which wasn't left out of the fun, as it too grew larger and rounder than any award winning pumpkin. His abs were a cobblestone road, six pumped and tight muscles all crunched together. His feet pressed together as they became great fleshy walls, while his legs became burly tree trunks that could snap a telephone pole like a matchstick. His traps were pressed equally as tight against the ceiling, whereas his arms were like two mountains of pure beef. If that wasn't enough, there was practically a gargantuan \"anaconda\" that had seemed to have sprouted from his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all this commotion right in front of Soul attracted his attention. As he looked back, he flinched, holding onto the couch. \"Wh-What the hell!?\" He shouted. Black Star just laughed, his massive arm ominously swept over and picked Soul up. Soul couldn't even fight; he was clearly outmatched by Black Star's unquestionable power. Black Star rubbed Soul's face in the two wrecking balls he called pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I huge enough now!? Huh!?\" Black Star shouted at him, \"These pecs big enough for a tiny man like you!?\" Black Star started to laugh like a madman, drunk with his own power. \"How about this!?\" Black Star shoved Soul onto his thick cock. \"This thick enough for you!? This thing makes yours look like a worm!\" Black Star began to forcibly rub Soul up and down along his fat dick, letting out a long moan as he did. \"Oh god... You don't know how long I've been wanting to do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soul heard this, he managed to push himself up for a brief second. \"Wh-What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star chuckled, flashing his arrogant smirk down at Soul, before rubbing even faster. His thick rod started to harden and rise upward, loving the attention that Soul was forced to give it. Soul soon found himself forced between it and Black Star's taut abs. But it didn't stop there! Black Star made sure that Soul kept his arms around his mammoth cock and forced him to keep riding it. The massive boy was already starting to pant, loving the feel of Soul rubbing against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, on the other hand, had mixed feelings. He tried so desperately to not let a single moan escape his lips. He refused to give Black Star the satisfaction! Black Star didn't care. As the precum started to gush from his head, there was nothing that would stop him from reaching climax. Soul's smaller hand could feel a thick vein within Black Star's cock, which only made Black Star moan out even louder than before! Even as he sat, Black Star began to buck, unable to hold back the flooding emotions. Soul slammed his eyes shut as he knew what was soon to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStroking even faster, and with Soul riding his massive manhood, Black Star finally let out a huge wave of cum flush itself from Black Star's balls. Not only did the white, sticky mess splatter all over the ceiling, but it coated the behemoth's pecs, Soul, and left giant puddles all over the room. Black Star fell back, slamming his head through a wall and into the bathroom in the process. There was a dumb grin on his face as he laid there, breathless. It wasn't easy to rub on out when you were crammed into such a tiny space!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, a bit worn down himself, finally peered up. Judging by the looks of it, Black Star must not have had much feeling in his groin right now... Quickly picking the large blue pubes from his back, he dashed for the door. Just as he was about to exit, he took one last look back at Black Star...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a good thing Soul took that one last look, least he miss out on what what the opportunity of a lifetime! For as he looked back at the exhausted Black Star, he saw a yellow flicker, an orb, slowly starting to raise up from Black Star's chest. He stared at it for a moment, before starting to walk  closer. It didn't take long for Soul to be able to tell that it was a soul! Unlike any one he had ever seen before... Soul hopped up, climbing up Black Star's abs, before making his way on top of the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star giggled. \"Yeah... Massage me like that...\" He muttered. He must have been half asleep, Soul assumed. He hopped up closer, looking at the glowing orb that cast a gold aura across his face. Soul actually felt himself drool a little at the marvel of such a beautiful soul... And like all souls he saw, this one was going to have a fate just like the others! Soul's arm reached out and grabbed a hold of it, bringing it closer. The soul was just as warm and soft as it looked! Soul's stomach was starting to let out a noisy growl, as he looked at the soul. He knew this one was different than any of the others... And he had to enjoy every last taste!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting right down on Black Star's massive, shaking pecs, Soul licked the tiny golden orb. He almost let out a groan as instantly a rainbow of flavors filled his mouth! He gave it another lick, and another, getting all the flavor before he then popped it inside. Gently, he swished it around in his mouth. It almost had a squishy, stretchy property, like mochi. Soul's mind was a total blank, as his taste buds were catered and tended to, putting him in a deep, euphoric state. Soul fell back and laid down, making sure every inch of his mouth was coated by this wonderful soul's flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, and unable to hold it back any longer, Soul instinctively gulped it down, practically having an orgasm over how smoothly the giant, thick lump taveled down his throat. He sighed, rubbing his abs, as he now started to feel a strange power coursing through him. Black Star, being a meister, would have never been able to harvest the full potential of this soul like Soul could. Soul's purpose was to feed upon souls, and on top of it, unlike Black Star, he actually ATE the soul, rather than accidentally being a host to it. Soul started to groan and moan as he could feel power coursing through his veins, as if he was becoming a death scythe. His heart started to pound faster, and his eyes were wide open as this shock of energy traveled through him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And just as fast as it had happened, it stopped. leaving Soul a bit confused. He sat up, looking all around. He didn't look any different... But at the same time, he could feel the power deep within him... Soul looked down at his hand, opening and closing it... He could feel the energy was there... But how did he activate it...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Soul felt a giant hand snatch him up! He looked onward, and saw Black Star, wide awake now, and with a huge grin on his face. \"Hey there, Soul!\" He greeted, bouncing his huge pecs, which hit his his chin with a thud each time he did. \"Glad to see a little man like you stuck around! Are you ready for round 2?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A brief rage flared up in Soul as his red eyes stared into Black Star's lighter, more carefree ones. He had the power now to knock Black Star down, to outgrow him and show him what true domination and subjugation felt like! These thoughts, thoughts of revenge, rushed through his mind before suddenly being chased out by another though. Soul had the power now. He was in control, despite what Black Star thought. Before, if things had gotten out of hand, there was nothing he could have done. Now, he had a means of fighting back! Not only that but he would be lying to himself if he didn't find all of this very...exciting~ He could feel a stirring in his pants just from looking at Black Star's enormous body. The meister's body was huge, each muscle bulging thickly while his height was prodigious. He was already looking like a god among men! He had always talked about how powerful he was and how he was going to surpass god but it had all been just annoying talk. Now he had the ability to back it up! And if he ever needed help...Soul had him covered there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of these thoughts brought a grin to Soul's face, an expression that made Black Star raise an eyebrow. \"Am I ready for round 2? You better believe it!\" Soul answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis positive response brought a look of shock to Black Star's face. The look didn't stay in place for long though! With a little laugh, he dropped Soul down onto his abs again and said, \"Yeah? You finally learning your place little man? At the mercy of a god?\" Black Star flexed his biceps as he said this, the muscles bulging up into two solid mountains of power. Soul grinned and imagined them growing bigger, the muscles responding to his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" He said, watching Black Star's arms bulge up and outward. \"Yeah I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star grinned wider and said, \"Awesome! Then what are you waiting for? Star worshiping your god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was eager to comply. He clambered up Black Star's body, using the gigantic muscles as ledges, hand holds, and foot holds, making his way up to his god's chest. He ran his tiny hands all over the thick orbs, imagining them growing thicker, bulging out further from Black Star's body, his shoulders broadening while his back flared out. Black Star, moaning, leaning his head back, didn't even notice as his already gigantic body grew even more so! Soul slid down to the abs and touched each one, the bricks of muscle popping out at his command, creating a cobbled road up to Black Star's enormous chest. Bracing himself against Black Star's abs, his foot resting in Black Star's navel as a foot hold, he imagined those long, massive legs growing longer and thicker. Black Star opened his eyes as he noticed what was happening at last. \"Woah!\" he shouted, watching as his feet suddenly smashed through the wall of the apartment. \"What's going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax and enjoy it!\" Soul shouted up, an obvious tent in his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star let out a gasp as his head suddenly slammed into the ceiling, his shoulders cracking through the walls on either side of him. The floor bowed downward, groaning under the immense weight of the growing teen. His thighs thickened and his calves bulged out behind him all while his feet grew wider and thicker, the soles nearly reaching the street now as Black Star's head and shoulders burst through the ceiling. Soul's concentration was only broken when a gigantic hand suddenly wrapped its thick fingers around his tiny, frail body, holding him in a tight, but not uncomfortable, fist. The reason for this became clear when the floor finally collapsed under Black Star's weight, sending him crashing down into the lobby of the apartment building. The whole building soon crashed down on top of him, though even sharp wood and heavy concrete did nothing to harm his exquisite body. With a lurch, Black Star got to his feet, coughing slightly and brushing himself off. He opened up his fist and looked down at Soul with a grin. \"I don't know what's going on...but I like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, a little taken aback at how huge Black Star was now, smiled weakly and said, \"Y-Yeah! Pretty awesome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes traveled up and down Black Star's body, taking in his huge chest, hanging heavily over his abs, each brick like muscle hard as steel. His thighs were so thick he had to stand with his legs spread slightly, his calves bulging almost obscenely out from his legs. His thick toes, wiggling slightly, obliterated the tar and concrete of the street like it was made of tissue paper! All of this paled in comparison to the thing that really got Soul's heart pounding. Hanging from Black Star's groin, surrounded by a thick crop of bright blue pubes, was Black Star's gigantic cock. It hung low, the shaft thick and veiny, the head bulbous, the slit looking wide enough to force a person down it. His balls swayed slightly below the shaft, looking every bit as impressive. Soul licked his lips slightly before staring back up at Black Star. The titanic assassin grinned and said, \"You like that don't you? Why don't you take a closer look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tilted his hand slightly and, before he could react, Soul was tumbling head over heels down, down, down, before making a soft landing at the base of Black Star's dick, surrounded on all sides by the musky smelling hair. The sight, the scent, the whole situation made the tiny weapon's head spin. Black Star let out a deep chuckle and gripped his shaft in one hand. \"You think you can handle all this by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul crawled through the pubes until his hands were pressed down on Black Star's cock. Without a second thought, he began to lick it. Black Star let out a little moan, surprised that Soul could illicit such a reaction. He slowly began to stroke himself, his other hand running over his chest.</span></div></div>",

He gulped a little, before letting his long tongue out and giving Black Star a sloooooow lick right upside the thick rod. Black Star moaned even louder, as his hand then began to stroke even faster! Soul was really doing a number on him! The ninja boy's dick towered tword the sky, practically two stories tall, with all-out thickness! The head was a dark pink, and was already starting to dribble precum as the two of them worked him over. The very sight of it was giving Soul his own tent in his pants, as his heart started beating even faster! His mind became a blur, as blood traveled from one head to the other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star started stroking even faster, his tongue hanging out in pleasure as he let out a primal groan. The only word on the gargantuan teen's mind was \"SEX!\" His hips bucked a little, making Soul's job both easier and harder at the same time! Black Star's toes clenched as he turned his head over! All he could think about was that gush that would send pleasure all throughout his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, in the meantime, was working even harder, not only rubbing his hands all over the meister's cock, but also rubbing his own throbbing manhood against Black Star's! Soul had a little musculature to himself, but nothing compared to the behemoth that was Black Star! The giant's pecs heaved, inflating and pumping up with air, only to deflate suddenly as he let the air out! Black Star was out of control, with only one, simple need on his mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul started to ram his crotch into Black Star's towering column of flesh, on the verge of losing his \"cool!\" Black Star was getting even closer as well, his hand stroking even faster as more and more pre only helped his hand stroke even faster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RRRRRR.... AAAAARGH!\" Black Star roared, actually cracking windows as his manhood shot glob after glob of hot, sticky seed from his slit, not only spraying all over himself, but Soul and Death City as well! Soul grunted, shooting his own load in his pants, making a little mess of himself, but it was nothing compared to the god that was Black Star!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh... Hell yeah...\" Black Star groaned happily to himself, one of his hand still rubbing over the large nipple with his thumb. Soul had fell back as well, landing in the forest of blue pubes. They reeked of Black Star's musk, but it was only turning Soul on all over again! It was then that...</span></div></div>",

That had been even better than he had expected! The constant grunting and moaning, the reek of musk, the heat baking off of Black Star's titanic body, it all combined to make an unforgettable experience. As Soul lied there, his heart rate slowly returned to normal, and his mind starting to turn to other ideas. Black Star had had his fun. Now it was time for a new god to take the stage! He crawled up out of Black Star's pubes, putting his hands in his pockets. He had an easy going grin on his face as he lazily walked up Black Star's body, using the ridges of the mighty teen's abs as stepping stones to reach the wide chest which was taking up the entirety of the street in front of the apartments. Once there, he pulled Black Star's nipple, climbing on top of the chest, walking up to Black Star's chin. His tiny hands caught Black Star's attention, a little jolt running through his sensitive nipple. He slowly lifted his head up and smirked down at Soul. \"Hey little guy! Don't tell me you're already wanting more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckled and said, \"Yeah! I'm definitely wanting more! I want everything you have and even more besides!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star let out a booming laugh, his chest shaking with mirth, nearly sending Soul tumbling down backwards off of the shelf like pecs. \"Oh man! That's hilarious! Like a tiny little shrimp like you could ever match a god like me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See...that's the weird thing!\" Soul said, a shark like grin rising to his lips. \"I've been getting this feeling lately...like something BIG is trying to break out of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star rolled his eyes and said, \"Sure, sure.\" His eyes twitched slightly as he saw Soul's clothes seemed to be...moving?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's head tilted back as he let out a little moan, his hands groping his chest. \"Aw yeah...I can feel it! I'm gonna get BIG! I'm going to grow and grow and grow and all you're going to be able to do is watch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star laughed again, though it was a little weaker this time. There was a strange conviction in Soul's voice that was starting to make the usually totally confident teen a bit nervous. He looked a little closer and saw that Soul's jacket was looking incredibly tight on him, the sleeves wrapped tightly around Soul's arms, his biceps noticeable mounds, his shoulders looking broader as well. Was Soul...actually growing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's already starting...better get used to looking UP at me!\" Soul said with a wicked grin, the zipper on his jacket suddenly starting to unzip, showing off his swelling pecs and his popping abs, each muscle like a solid brick! Soul flexed his arms, the sleeves ripping loudly, his biceps forcing their way up through the material, a low tearing sound signalling the massive tear running down Soul's back. Black Star gaped as he saw Soul's thighs and calves swelling, the young weapon's pants popping its seams along with the button, the zipper making a low whispering sound as it came undone. Soul put his hands on his hips and grinned up at Black Star. \"You see these muscles? You see what I'm becoming? This is just the beginning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star actually gulped as he saw Soul growing before his very eyes! This was unreal! Just how big was he going to get?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul playfully did up the zipper on his jacket as much as he could, the little bit of metal coming to a rest just below Soul's mammoth pecs, the thick muscles spilling out over top of the zipper. The jacket gamely held on until the hem started ripping apart, clinging tightly to the middle row of Soul's abs, the metal teeth of the zipper quickly parting, leaving Soul with a mangled bit of fabric that USED to be a jacket. Soul chuckled and tossed it aside, showing off his chiseled torso, each muscle bulging to unreal proportions, making Soul look like a mini hulk! His traps were rising around his thickening neck, making Soul look even more like an intimidating predator than he already did! With a tired wheeze, Soul's sneakers burst open, the laces coming undone, the sole separating from the main body of the shoe as Soul's thick toes expanded. In a matter of seconds the shoes fell to pieces around Soul's massive feet. Soul wiggled his toes and let out another little chuckle. The destruction of all his clothes seemed to amuse him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star watched on as Soul's pants shredded down into shorts before falling apart completely, leaving the white haired teen in nothing but a pair of obscenely tight boxers. The little button on the boxers burst quickly after the pants were destroyed, Soul's thick cock peeking out before suddenly surging outward and upward, hard as a rock, thick veins running up and down the shaft while his massive balls slipped out the legs of the boxers, the material stretching as best it could before falling apart like so much detritus, leaving Soul completely naked. He stretched and flexed his biceps, the muscles popping up and up, splitting into a peak. \"That's good for a start...now I can REALLY grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star gaped as Soul suddenly doubled, then tripled, than quadrupled his size! He went from being a few inches tall compared to Black Star, to being as big as his chest, to being half his size, to matching him in height! Eye to eye, Soul grinned and then doubled in size again! His massive shoulders crashed into the buildings on either side of him, his toes tore up the road as he knelt over Black Star, the concrete cracking and splitting apart as Soul's weight increased. His head and shoulders rose above the buildings, Black Star dwindling until he was a mere action figure in comparison to Soul!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul's monumental growth came to a slow halt here. No reason to rush things after all~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...oh yeah~\" Soul said, his hands groping his body all over. \"Yeah, this is more like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced down at Black Star and said, \"You know...I'm feeling REALLY hungry all of a sudden!\" His stomach growled ominously as he said this. \"Why don't you go find me something good to eat? Otherwise...\" He licked his lips, his sharp teeth dripping with saliva, a line of drool running down the side of his mouth. \"Otherwise, I just might eat you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star jumped and ran, his first priority getting away from Soul, his second finding food so that he didn't become a snack! Soul just chuckled and leaned back, the building he was leaning against crumbling to dust thanks to his massive weight. Soul merely shrugged and put his arms behind his head, grinning to himself. He was going to enjoy being in control for awhile!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul opened an eye as he looked at Black Star. He was trying so hard to try to find something to eat. Surprisingly, he came back in just a few seconds, holding... Some kind of spec in his hands. Soul rose an eyebrow, looking down at him in disdain. He plucked it up and gave it a closer look. It was one of the Dark Meals from one of the fast food joints!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, you call THIS a meal?\" Soul said with frown. He then gave Black Star a grin, which gave the young assassin shivers. Suddenly, he started to notice that Soul's face was getting higher and higher up above him! Soul flicked the food into his mouth where it barely even registered with his cavernous mouth! He chuckled as he looked down at Black Star. \"If you do it again, you're going to end up even smaller that that!\" Soul explained, his voice now booming over the blue haired boy. Black Star then dashed off to find something with a little more sustinance to feed the gigantic teen! As he ran off, Soul chuckled to himself. Maybe it would be nice to have a little fun with Black Star! Soul then shrunk himself down so he was at about the same size he was when this all started. As Black Star came back, this time with the whole buger stand, he looked up. He shook his head as he looked over Soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell...?\" He mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that for me?\" Soul asked. Before Black Star could even reply, Soul took the stand off of his hands, and popped it right in his mouth! The metallic covering wasn't much, but the inside was hot and juicy! Soul could taste the meat and even some bread as he gulped the whole thing down! It was almost frightening how tempered steel was like tissue paper to Soul! Black Star gulped, and before he could be told, he ran off again to find Soul more food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul grinned, turning his head to the side. To mess with him again, he then made both of them grow, making sure that they stayed in perfect proportion so he was always the one on top! Soul almost let a groan escape his lips, as he nuzzled up to his bulging bicep. The feeling of growing was a euphoric, almost arousing feeling to him. Not to mention that the young weapon just loved the feel of his muscles pushing out further, namely his bicep engorging and pressing more and more against his face! A permanent grin was plastered on Soul's face as he began to think how far he could take this. Sure, it was just Black Star now, but why not the DWMA next? Or all of Death City? The entire land? Continent? Why not the planet, or even the entire galaxy!? Soul grinned to himself, a hand running over his abs as he daydreamed to himself. \"Soul, King of All Existance\" seemed to have a nice ring to it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star returned once more with more food, this time bringing Soul an entire resturant! Soul grabbed ahold and took a huge bite of the building, then another! As Black Star watched the entire structure vanish down Soul's throat, Soul gave him a mean spirited kick that sent Black Star back a few blocks! Gritting his teeth and getting to his feet, he set back out, leaving Soul to his own agenda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul, this time, decided to make the two of them even bigger! If he was going to rule over all that ever existed, he was going to have to start somewhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star seemed to return even faster this time, holding up another resturant. Black Star started to pant, sweat running all the way down his godly, but not nearly as divine as Soul's, body. As Soul started to tear through another building...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With an amazed look on his face, Soul looked up, his jaw dropped. \"How the hell did you get so big so fast!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know.\" Black Star replied, flexing his arm. His biceps bounced a few times, before reaching their full size, nearly twice the size of a bowling ball! \"I'm a growing young man! A man that's going to surpass god someday!\" Black Star answered with a cocky smirk. Soul was left at a loss for words as he looked Blacks Star up and down. He had the body beyond that of an adonis, each muscle not only perfectly scuplted, but also bulked up to immense proportions! \"What's wrong?\" Black Star asked mockingly. \"Don't worry! I'd be speachless in the presence of a giant, hulk of a man like me too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul gulped slightly. \"You...\" Soul paused for a moment. \"H-Hey! Tell me how you got so big!\" He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star's ego only swelled more as he heard Soul refer to him as \"big.\" Black Star was used to being a little on the short side, so the sudden turn-around was a nice change of pace for him! \"Yeah?\" Black Star asked, stepping out of his doorway. His massive body towered over Soul, as the tiny weapon could barely see the meister's face beyond the mountains he called pecs! \"And what if I don't?\" Black Star asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pulled back a little, but then Black Star would just step forward! Soul would move back a little more, and Black Star would get even closer! It seemed like for every step back, Black Star took two steps forward! That, or his feet were just so large that one of his steps equaled two of Soul's! It didn't take long, but soon Soul's back was against the wall! He turned and looked nervous for a moment, but not as much as when he turned back to see Black Star's pecs, pressing right agains his face! Black Star kept pushing, until he had Soul pinned to the wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Going somewhere?\" Black Star asked, putting a little more pressure on Soul! \"Go ahead! I won't stop you! I'll just stand right here.\" Black Star added on, smiling down at Soul. Soul tried moving, his lower body wriggling left and right, but he couldn't get away from Black Star's beefy pecs! Soul didn't stop yet! He kept moving and shaking, trying his best to get loose, but there was no escaping the wall that was Black Star! \"Heh, what's wrong?\" Black Star asked, \"Are you really that weak? Or am I just so STRONG--\" Black Star bounced his massive pecs, bumping Soul in the face with every arrogant, muscle-headed flex, \"-- That I can hold you down without even trying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul was getting a little irritated. He kept trying to escape, but it was a fruitless effort! Black Star just laughed triumphantly, enjoying the show! Soul, who was getting real annoyed, gave Black Star a kick righ to the groin! He didn't kick TOO hard, but it would be enough to be felt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star laughs were cut off immediately, as he winced, before groaning, falling to his knees! Soul, who was finally set free, backed off a little bit! The white-haired teen looked at Black Star as he kneeled there, holding his jewels. Then Soul heard something a little unsettling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was groaning at first, but his groans soon evolved back into laughter again! He looked up at Soul, a menacing grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!\" He smiled, \"I'm such a big man now, that barely hurt!\" Black Star stood right back up, holding that log he called a cock in his hands. \"See the size of this thing? It'll take more than a tiny bump to put a dent in this!\" Black Star let go of himself, and took a stomp forward, shaking the ground a little beneath Soul! \"Now then... I can't let you just walk away after pulling a trick like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul pulled back a tiny bit, before turning and sprinting off! Black Star just grinned as he saw his puny friend run off. \"Heh...\" He cracked his knuckled, \"I love a good chase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star took off right behind Soul, everything on the ground vibrating in his wake! \"I'm gonna get you, Soul!\" Black Star called, running after him, and catching up fast! Soul looked behind him, panicking slightly when he saw how fast Black Star was closing in! As soon as he could, Soul made a sharp turn to the right, heading right into the crowds of people! Black Star quickly followed, stopping when a stream of people blocked his way! They immediately stopped, looking up at the nude demigod that stood before them! Black Star didn't seem to pay them any mind. He looked over, and could see a white topped head waving through the crowds! He grinned, and decided to take a little detour...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul kept running, looking behind him once more! Once he saw Black Star wasn't following him anymore, he sighed, holding his chest as he caught his breath! Soul knew Black Star hadn't given up yet. It wasn't the kind of person he was! But Soul was glad he was at least able to take a breather for a moment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul began walking, keeping a sharp eye out for Black Star! At one point, he could have swore he saw Black Star's spiked blue hair! He casually turned the corner into an alleyway to make a quick escape...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBad idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Soul looked forward, there was suddenly a shadow just a few inches above! Before he could even react, Black Star came slamming down, forcing a few nearby garbage cans to the ground! He grinned as he locked eyes with Soul once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, I knew I'd find you!\" Black Star said with a smirk. \"Now you're mine!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soul's body went cold as he saw Black Star looming over him, a huge grin on his face. The alley was a small one, ending in a dead end with nothing but a few trash cans and a fire escape ten feet up on the wall, too high for Soul to reach, unless he stood up on a trash can and even then it might not be a guarantee. At the other end was Black Star, his enormous body blocking the entrance completely. His shoulders were so broad, they were pressed tightly against the brick walls on either side of him. His chest was bulging out in front of him, barely moving, a stark contrast to Soul's own which was heaving both from fear and the exercise he had just gone through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you look so scared Soul?~\" Black Star asked with a grin. \"You don't have anything to worry about as long as you don't pull any stupid tricks like you did back at my apartment! Of course, you'll have to pay for that right now. But after that, I'm sure we'll get along just fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grin was far from reassuring but there wasn't much Soul could do. For a brief second he thought about turning his right arm into a scythe and slicing at Black Star but the last thing he wanted to do was seriously injure Black Star. He may have been a meat head, arrogant, and looking to show off even at Soul's own expense but...he was still his best friend! He slowly backed up, his eyes never leaving Black Star's face. The ninja chuckled and said, \"You can't get away Soul~ Just sit tight and this will all be over...over...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted as he straightened up, his shoulders still tightly pressed against the walls. He tried to take a step forward...but couldn't! He tried to take a step backward...but couldn't! \"Dammit!\" He shouted, twisting around, trying to move and being completely unable to. He was wedged into the alley like a sardine. Soul felt an enormous relief well up inside him. This was his chance! With a small grin he turned around and jumped up on top of the nearest trash can before taking a leap to the ladder. He barely managed to wrap his fingers around the bottom rung. With a little grunt, he braced himself against the wall and began climbing, slowly making his way up the ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get back here!\" Black Star shouted, small chunks of stone flying from the walls but not enough for him to free himself. There was only way out of this! He grit his teeth and began to concentrate, the light within him flickering into life, sending energy coursing through his whole being. Almost immediately he began to grow again, his body slowly inching upward as his shoulders broadened, the chips in the stone turning into cracks, radiating out from the point his shoulders were pressing against the wall, his chest bulging out in front of him, the slabs of muscle pressing up against each other before smashing into the walls as well, the buildings on either side of him groaning as so much pressure was placed on them. Black Star grinned as he felt his biceps swell up, thick mounds rising up from his arms, making it harder to bend his arms. His abs grew tighter, each brick pushing out from his stomach, bigger than a normal man's pecs, his hips slamming into the walls as well, the walls crumbling as Black Star started growing through them! Soul could hear the squealing of breaking mortar and the crumbling of bricks but ignored it, climbing faster, his heart starting to pound faster again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star chuckled, a grin wide across his face. \"You can't run Soul~! I'm going to get you, one way or another~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star's body continued to grow, bigger and bigger, his thighs growing bigger than tree trunks, the dense muscles rubbing up against each other before slamming into the walls, knocking more of the structure down, slowly freeing Black Star from his prison. His feet stretched across the ground, his toes thickening as they flexed, breaking into the concrete like it was made of butter, his elbows adding more holes to the walls around him. His cock twitched and hardened slightly, all the power inflating Black Star's monstrous ego, which in turn was turning him on, his cock lengthening and thickening, slamming into the wall, hitting the bottom of the ladder, nearly knocking Soul off of it! Black Star chuckled and flexed his muscles, the walls breaking down almost fully, his cock smashing through floor after floor as his height continued to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better climb faster Soul~! I'm catching up~!\" Black Star said, his cock destroying more and more of the ladder as it made its way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul finally managed to make it to the top of the roof, collapsing on top of it, out of breath. He knew he couldn't afford to stop for long, especially as Black Star's shadow began to rise up over him! Not daring to look back, Soul started to run towards the edge of the building, which slowly started to rumble, nearly knocking the teenage weapon off his feet. He had made it about halfway along the top of the roof when the concrete under his feet began to warp. Before Soul could even think of dodging, Black Star's gigantic dick rocketed up from underneath him, sending him flying up in the air! Soul turned over, feeling almost like he was falling in slow motion, and saw Black Star's grinning, god like face staring down at him, his hands on his hips, every muscle in his body bulging enormously, putting any body builder alive to total shame! Soul gulped as he landed back on top of Black Star's dick, the thick, vein covered shaft easily supporting his puny weight. He glanced over the edge and saw the building slowly sink away below him. Jumping off now would no doubt result in a broken leg or worse! He was in it for the long haul now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star stopped growing when his knees were clearing the roof tops of the nearby buildings, his huge foot now completely filling the alley he had been previously stuck in, the buildings on either side of it crumbling. He chuckled, his chest bouncing as he did so, looking down at Soul with total confidence. His chin was pressed tightly to his pecs, the muscles swelling out so much he could barely see his tiny friend sitting on top of his junk~ The feeling of such a tiny body sitting so perfectly on his shaft was turning him on like nothing else, the sheer power he felt intoxicating. He grew harder, letting out a little moan as he did so. \"Well, well~ I think I know exactly how to punish you~\" Black Star said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul gulped, a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach. Whatever was about to happen next, he wasn't sure he was going to like it...</span></div></div>",

Pleasure your god?\" Black Star said, his voice echoing across the city! Soul's heart sank as he heard Black Star utter those few words. He could feel the flesh beneath him heat up and throb as Black Star uttered his command. The gargantuan meister looked down at the little bug that was Soul. \"Well?!\" He asked in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I... There's...\" Soul began to stammer, unable to choke out the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what.\" Black Star said, glaring down at Soul, practically freezing him in his place! \"You can either keep this giant body of mine happy or you can become a part of it!\" Black Star warned! Soul could just barely make out his giant friend licking his lips hungrily as he stared down at him! Soul got shivers, before turning around on his stomach so he was straddling Black Star's cock! Closing his eyes and bearing through it, he began to scrunch up and relax, practically humping it as he worked it! Black Star could feel him move. Exerting his monumental power over the helpless turned him on even more! Black Star let out a soft grunt as he felt Soul working on him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh yeah... Right there, like that... Oh god yeah...\" Black Star gasped as Soul kept working! More blood coursed through, raising Black Star's cock up higher, pointing right up to the sky! Black Star's hand reached down and started to squeeze the head of his beast! Black Star's entire body shuddered in a shock of pleasure, from head to toe! He gripped the sensitive, swollen head, massaging it and working it in his hand! He let out another dull moan, his chin rested firmly on top of his pumped up pecs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little further back on the shaft, Soul could feel Black Star's dick shaking beneath him! His hand was just inches from a tender vein, which Soul quickly started to stroke! He would do anything to get this over with as soon as possible! He started to work a little faster, sweating slightly as he did! Black Star couldn't help himself as he soon fell backwards, crushing several buildings behind him in the process! He groaned in ecstacy. So much power... So massive and strong that he could crumble large buildings just by leaning into them! The thought alone was already making Black Star pre!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star shook his hand off once he took it off the head of his cock. Squeezing his bulging pecs in one hand, his other had begun to massage his enlarged balls, which were churning with cum, nearly to the point it hurt! Black Star moaned as he squeezed his massive, heavy pecs in his hands. The feeling of having such muscles... So big you could crush rocks into dust...! Black Star's hand had quickly switched from massage to stroke! It started at the base of his dick, in his blue pubes, before going straight up, moving Soul up to the head as well! Black Star would then go right back down, and he was quickly picking up speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the relocated Soul was pressed right up against the musky head of Black Star's gigantic dick. Soul turned his head away and just began working even faster! He wanted to get done faster than ever now! Black Star immediately felt the sensation, and began stroking even faster! Soul had to hold on tight as Black Star's giant manhood began to waver! Black Star's head was flooding with thoughts of power. Of conquest. Of finally becoming the god he'd always wanted to be! Death City... London... Peru... All of it would be pinned under that massive bulk that was Black Star! He would grow bigger, more powerful, taller than buildings, mountains... Why stop there, why not continents? Planets?! Galaxies!? Black Star's mind was flushed with these thoughts before he finally gushed. Black Star let out a feral roar, as the slit of his dick unleashed a tidal wave of hot cum! Not only pouring down on Black Star, but even raining down on the people of Death City! Black Star kept on stroking, making sure to squeeze out every last drop he had in him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Black Star laid there, a lustful mess, his huge pecs had begun to heave as he was breathing deeply. Soul had falled from the flaccid cock and into a puddle of juices on Black Star's abs. Quickly, he squirmed out, leaving a trail to a more clean spot of Black Star. But even that spot was coated in the sweat from Black Star's passion! Soul just let out a groan as he tried to shake himself off like a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't half bad... For someone who's so tiny!\" Black Star finally said. Soul just looked over at Black Star. That is to say, he looked over at Black Star's red, swollen pecs. He couldn't even see the teen's face! Black Star rose up one of his biceps and flexed it! He smiled as he looked over at it. \"Fuck yeah... So big...!\" He mumbled to himself. \"You WISH you could be even half the man I am!\" Black Star told Soul! He kept flexing his arm, pumping it bigger as blood rushed to it! \"Heh... In fact...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You're going to see just how MAN I can be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul let out a groan as he heard these boastful words. His body was battered, beaten, and covered in sweat and cum. Every limb was shaky and he was out of breath. But of course Black Star was practically bursting with energy! His reserves seemed unlimited! Even if they had been the same size Soul had an idea that Black Star would still be just as energetic. It was just the way he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, this is how I'm going to die.\" Soul thought to himself with a sigh. \"Totally not cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was too absorbed in his own body and power to even glance down at Soul once he tapped into that power deep within him once more. He still had no idea how he had gained this ability but he didn't care. The point was he had the power to go beyond where everyone had ever gone before! He closed his eyes and slowly grinned as his energy coursed through his body feeding his muscles, pumping them up, all while his height slowly began to increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoulders pushed wider while his back flared out, the already deep canyons of muscle carving deeper, stretching over the entirety of it, his shoulders looking like massive bowling balls, his traps rising up and surrounding his thickening neck! Black Star grunted and flexed his biceps, each mound of muscle bulging upward, rising up from his arms, growing harder and rounder, thick veins rising up to his skin, forcing blood and energy into the swelling muscle! His forearms thickened, strengthening his grip while his hands stretched and widened, each finger holding more power in them than an entire army of men! Soul felt his body begin to tumble downward as Black Star's abs hardened, each brick erupting around him like the Earth rearranging itself after the separation of Pangaea, Black Star's body becoming the equivalent of a geological force, all of Death City slowly crumbling as his body climbed higher and wider! Soul found himself deposited neatly inside Black Star's navel, unable to climb out due to both the sheer size of the walls around him and the weakness in his limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star chuckled as he felt his pecs suddenly surge outward, becoming massive orbs of pure strength, the nipples hardening as the cool breeze blew over them, stimulating the young god like teen even after his recent release. His hands roamed over the expanse of muscle, squeezing and bouncing them, each bounce resulting in a resounding THUD that echoed like thunder over the city, warning those who were unaware of Black Star's growth of his imminent arrival. Down below, his thighs were bulging thicker in size with every pump of his heart, crashing through buildings like they were made of building blocks, his enormous ass decimating the streets and buildings alike. Each cheek grew rounder and bouncier, able to stop fleeing passerby with a single look at their magnificence! His calves followed suit, crashing into the ground, destroying the sewer system under Death City with every surge of growth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe populace fled in fear as Black Star's gargantuan toes rose up higher, rushing towards them like a steam roller, fully intent on crushing them without the massive assassin even realizing it! Black Star's body was quickly spreading over the entire city, his cock slowly growing hard as he reveled in his growth. Unfortunately for the people down below, this was just another weapon for the gigantic meister! The hardened dick was like a battering ram, swinging wildly into buildings, tunneling into the ground, smashing people with impunity, a terrifying force all on its own! Black Star moaned as he felt every new sensation striking his cock. \"Man! I guess all you little bugs are still useful! Keep pleasing your god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star's eyes were still closed, the utter carnage relatively unknown to him. The angry purple head of his cock was almost as tall as an average building at this point, debris getting caught in his slit, sending shivers of pure pleasure coursing through Black Star's body. \"Mmmmmohgod...You people keep this up and I'll need to go another round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bottom of Black Star's navel, Soul sighed as he stared up at the night sky, the stars winking down at him. If he wasn't currently resting inside the belly button of his best friend, he could almost pretend this was a normal night. The deep gurgling sounds coming from within Black Star's stomach, which were making the bottom of the navel vibrate slightly, were making Soul incredibly nervous. That is, until he realized that he was a veritable speck on Black Star's body by now. Then again, with that weird power he could easily make Soul grow big enough to be a decent snack. Either way, Black Star probably wasn't going to let him go so easily. Soul tentatively got to his feet, wincing at the ache in his legs. He unzipped his jacket and tossed it aside, which managed to clean off most of his upper body from all the sweat and cum. He did the same with his pants, leaving him only in his boxers. Without all the sodden clothing he felt a little less achy. He began to walk around the bottom of the navel, touching the \"walls\" slightly, trying to get a feel for his location. The walls were far too tall and smooth for him to even think about climbing out of unfortunately. He was just going to hope Black Star remembered him down here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star gulped a little. While it struck true that he was always the biggest man at the DWMA, something rang true with him when he was looking at Soul. It was almost as if Black Star grew up a little on the inside, right then and there. There was just something so mesmerizing about watching his friend flex and show off his body... He could do without the insults, sure, but seeing Soul happy like this was, for some strange reason, something that made him happy too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind...\" Black Star thought slowly to himself as he watched Soul show off, \"If Soul was bigger than me... I wouldn't even mind if he was WAY bigger than me...\" A faint glow shone within Black Star, as he now would see that his simple little thought would end up becoming a reality. Before his very eyes, he could see Soul slowly inching upward, growing taller, but that's not all that happened. As Soul continued to flex in a way he would normally deem uncool, his muscles began to pump up, becoming larger and thicker... His pec pressed at his jacked, slowly forcing the zipper downward. It was if something was inflating in his chest, but Soul didn't even seem to notice as he kept looking at his biceps. Black Star had a front row seat to watch his friend expand before his very eyes. Soul's shirt had begun to ride upward, showing off the bottom row of his abs, but as Black Star looked down in that direction, he could just barely see around Soul's hips and see that his already tight ass was growing bigger and thicker, so bubbly you could bounce a quarter off of it! Of course, how could the young ninja look at that without seeing Soul's manhood starting to push forth, getting longer and thicker with every second that passed. For some reason beyond Black Star's comprehension, he began to drool. Soul's pants quickly became tight, every contour of his rippling thighs visible through his pants, whereas his calves were growing so large, his pants were starting to rise up. He could see motion in soul's shoes, which could only mean one thing. The already large weapon's feet were growing even larger! Black Star let out a audible gulp, as he quickly snapped his head back up. Soul's eyes were just now widening as he saw his biceps plumping up... Soon they were even bigger than Black Star's! It made him break out with a sudden chuckle as he was just catching on to what was going on! He looked back down, a bit further than before, and looked at Black Star with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, check me out!\" Soul said proudly, \"Do I look cool or what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Black Star agreed, a bit star struck as he looked up at his friend. Soul raised an eyebrow, but didn't question it any further when he saw his pecs bloating outward. His hands quickly made their way on top of them, rubbing all around them. He did his best to hold back a groan as he realized just how tender they could be. Black Star just chuckled nervously, watching Soul slowly starting to tower over him. His eyes didn't wander off his growing friend for even a second! Soul's build was athletic, but in a matter of seconds, he had become a full-on bodybuilder! His muscle mass had easily doubled, if not tripled! Within seconds, it seemed, that Soul's clothes were getting torn left and right! His jacket became sleeveless, his pants now a pair of capri, and now he looked like he was wearing a midriff! Although, no one would dare call a man of his unquestionable size and power on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul laughed, before calming himself and bringing it down to a chuckle. \"I-I gotta go, Black Star! I need new clothes!\" He said, dashing off before his young friend could even say a word. He felt fantastic for the most part, but the last thing he wanted was to be nude in public. This left Black Star feeling a tone of disappointment in his heart. All that help he unknowingly provided for Soul, and he got nothing in return? Alas, even through the disappointment, Black Star was at least a LITTLE happy for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, Soul...\" Black Star groaned under his breath. \"Get back here...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star gazed in that direction for a moment, before turning around, and slamming right into what felt like a wall! He immediately fell on his ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, watch where you're going!\" Black Star shouted, going on instinct. He looked up, and saw a familiar face... As well as a familiar body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming or not?\" Soul asked with a cocky smirk. He extended his hand downward to help his friend back up to his feet. Black Star, however was dumbfounded. He knew he saw Soul disappear around the corner, yet all of a sudden, here he was, right in front of him... Strange. It took a moment, but Black Star finally...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star grabbed Soul's hand, the weapon's paw quite a bit bigger than his own, and was hoisted to his feet easily. Black Star, who had been suspicious of Soul suddenly appearing in front of him again, quickly forgot his objections when he was face to...abs, with Soul. His muscles were still just as thick and powerful and his clothes were still just as tattered. It really showed how much Soul cared about Black Star that he would wait in public while he was half dressed to make sure his friend was following. This made Black Star feel even better about Soul's size. No matter how big he got, he was still the same stand up guy...maybe a bit cockier than normal, but that was something Black Star could deal with...especially since his friends had been putting up with it from him for as long as they'd known each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Soul suddenly asked, raising an eyebrow at Black Star. \"You seem a little out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star shook his head and grinned up at Soul. \"I'm fine! Don't worry about me! Let's get back to your house quick and get you some new clothes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckled as Black Star ran off, following him at a more sedate pace. \"Same old Black Star~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take the pair long to reach Soul's apartment since they hadn't walked very far on their way to school. Of course they were now officially late for class and would probably end up paying for it later but at the moment they didn't care! Especially since it meant Maka was out of the way. They avoided any lectures because of this. Black Star flopped down on Soul's couch with a sigh, watching as Soul pulled off the remains of his clothes, leaving him in nothing but a pair of really tight boxers which were clearly too small on him. Black Star blushed a little and said, \"Do you have anything around here that's going to fit you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I'm looking but I can't find anything. Everything is three sizes too small now!\" Soul said, rifling through his closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star nodded slightly, thinking about Soul's predicament. It sure would be nice if he had at least one outfit he could wear...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait! I forgot I had this! Awesome!\" Soul exclaimed, pulling a coat and a pair of pants out from the closet. He opened his drawer and pulled out a new pair of underwear, these ones fitting him perfectly! Black Star politely looked away since Soul had forgotten to close the door to his room. Within minutes Soul was stepping out of his room, hands in his pockets. He leaned against the wall, adopting a \"cool\" pose and said, \"Well?~ What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star's eyes widened as he saw Soul dressed in a black and yellow jacket, unzipped, showing off his thick pecs and rock hard abs, the sleeves reaching as far as the base of his biceps, unable to pass over them. His pants were tight around the crotch and ass areas while more roomy in the leg area, a pair of sandals on his feet along with a different headband for his hair. \"Wow! You look really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckled and said, \"Yeah? You really think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star jumped off the couch and gave a thumbs up. \"Definitely! No one's going to mess with you when they see you coming wearing that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul stood up straight and crossed his arms. \"Glad you think so! I don't really have any other options so this is the best I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get some new clothes soon!\" Black Star said. \"Just wait until after your next job! You'll be able to take on a high level assignment and make some serious cash with that bod!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul blushed slightly and said, \"You're being awfully complimentary today~\" He had a bit of a silly grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I'm happy for you!\" Black Star said, thumbing his nose. \"You look good! You should feel good too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul wrapped his arm around Black Star's shoulder and pulled him close in a bear hug, forcing the smaller Meister against his abs. \"Thanks Black Star~ You're a real friend~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star blushed but smiled up at Soul, his heart racing. He didn't want to go to class anymore. There was just something about Soul that made him want to spend more time with him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...we're already late for class, what do you say we just skip today?\" Soul suggested, smiling down at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! I was just about to say the same thing!\" He shouted excitedly. \"What do you want to do? Play basketball? Go get some food? Hang out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoul chuckled and shrugged. \"Let's do whatever you want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star thought about it and said, \"Okay! I've got it!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Black Star began making his way back to the DWMA to return the soul to Shinigami-sama. However Black Star would soon find this task difficult, if not impossible. Not to mention the changes that were slowly happening to him as he began his walk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soul of O'Lanturn Jack seemed to bounce around inside Black Star. It started to work, forcing his heart to pump faster. Black Star began to sweat a little as his chest was pounding. He pulled off to the side, into the shade of one of the warehouse buildings to take a break. He gulped a little, holding his chest. Looking down, he unzipped his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star was surprised at what he saw! His sturdy chest started pushing out further, swelling with unquestionable mass! He would have been grinning if this wasn't so unexpected! Just below, he could see his abs quickly gaining definition. Each slab of muscle was popping up! As his hand was running over his chest, he noticed as his hand and forearm had begun to grow! His black gloves were starting to feel a little tight, but Black Star didn't do a thing to remove them! No, by now, he had cracked a smile. He <i>wanted</i> to keep them on. He <i>wanted</i> to feel his growing body burst from his too tiny clothes. Black Star flexed a little and noticed how his already ample arms were becoming more heavy and burly. He flexed a little harder, smiling even bigger as he saw the muscles bunch up even burlier! As Black Star turned his attention back to his pecs, he saw that they were at least the size of basket ball cut in half! And yet they continued to grow! As Black Star was looking in a downward direction, he saw as his thighs were rising in his pants, gradually like bread baking in an oven. His pants began to ride up a little, feeling a little tight as his calves shaped into two large mounds of strength. Black Star's feet also had begun to feel tight within his boots. Any second now, his toes might burst out of the star tipped footwear! Black Star could feel himself sitting up straighter as his back had begun to expand, becoming a huge, immobile wall of muscle. To top it all off, Black Star's infamous \"third sword\" had begun to grow with the rest of him. It coiled around in his crotch, making a nice pouch in his pants. His zipper was mere inches from sliding down and leaving him in his pair of white boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star sighed happily, nearly drooling as his hand rubbed up and down his abs. He could feel his whole body pulse with each heartbeat, and in turn, he became a whole size bigger! As time passed, Black Star soon felt them come to an end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star looked down at his chest, pounding it a little with a closed fist. \"Come on, is that it!?\" He whined, not even realizing just how big he already was! He just shrugged, and in doing so, made a long rip down the back of his jacket! Black Star just chuckled. He sat up, placing his hands on his hips and flexed his back. The muscle flared outward, and instantly tore the little black jacket in two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Star grinned as he watched the jacket slide down a little before the sleeve openings were unable to work past his bulging biceps! A grin plastered on his face, he gladly tore them right off of his body and tossed them aside. His arms rose up and flexed hard! They bounced up, with pulsing veins running down them! Black Star flexed over and over, letting blood engorge them before finally getting up to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thought in the childish ninja's head was to go show someone! But who? Soul already respected him, so what was the point in showing off to him? He needed someone who had to be taught a lesson. Someone like Kid. A little bug like him would have to have respect for this new, nine foot muscle giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, with a body like this, Black Star was destined to need some new clothes eventually... He didn't want to hide too much of his massive physique, so he <i>could</i> always find something that covered him up, but still revealed everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was frustrating! It was the most thinking he had done in a while! However, despite all this, his legs seemed to move against his will, leading him somewhere... Not that Black Star noticed. He was too deep in thought.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a typical afternoon in Medusa's secret base. Free had just returned from a reconnaissance mission, just as he was instructed. He pushed open the large wooden door of Medusa's lair, and began to wander in. The first thing to do was to report to the head honcho herself and tell her about everything he had found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree made his way down into Medusa's room. She was always doing some kind of experiment in there, so Free had to make sure he didn't stop in at the wrong time. Free took a breath as he placed a hand on the door. That woman always had some kind of creepy glint in her eye that freaked him out. He finally took a step inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, snake woman, you in here?\" Free asked, as he then looked up. Not a person was to be found! The first thing that Free noticed was a large circle drawn in the ground, and in the center was a tome that stood silently on a stand. Free looked around the room real quick, before walking up to the strange set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was she up to this time...?\" Free mumbled to himself. Free looked down at the book, both of his hands resting idly at either side of the stand. \"Yeesh, frog torture techniques?\" Free said. \"Why would... Oh...\" The wolf man quickly realized Medusa was just looking up ways to punish Eruka. \"Heh... Guess this means I'm her favorite!\" He said with a sly little grin. In boredom, Free started flipping through the book, making sure to keep place of the page he was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange book listed all kinds of things about various beings. From frogs to bears, rabbits to wolves, and even an article on humans! But as Free looked at this particular section, he immediately notices something strange about it. The entire section was written in another language! Squinting a little, his finger trailed along different texts, trying his best to read them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Free snickered to himself. \"This is stupid!\" He said with a laugh, \"Just listen to some of this dribble! What the heck is 'Bol'she bol'she rasti moe telo'?!\" Free cackled, but just as he uttered those words, he felt a sudden jerk in his stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree's entire body started to heat up! He could feel his heart throbbing, reading to beat out of his very chest! He started to gasp for breath... And his left eye was starting to hurt! Little did Free know, his entire body was beginning to expand and grow! His traps were starting to rise and swell behind his head like bread rising in an oven! His shoulders shot outward, and as his thick, masculine arms bulked up even more, his sleeves were decimated, leaving him in only his black top. Down his arms, thick veins pushed their way to the surface, pumping even his forarms up bigger and stronger! The shock practically traveled back up his body, and Free's chest shot forward, causing him to knock down the pedestal before him! His pecs pushed out further, the once toned muscles doubling, tripling, quadrupling in size! The collar of his shirt tore down slightly, barely able to contain the two watermelon-sized muscles in his shirt! Free let out a roar, as his thighs and calves bulked up in unison, tearing his jail pants into tatters! The once proud wolf man now looked as if he was jammed into a pair of short shorts! Free's foot stomped down once, then twice, but on the second slam, his feet were nearly three times the size they were before! As Free's body then crunched forward, his abs pressed together and were soon swelling as well! They pushed out, each like a huge brick of pure meat! And speaking of meat, Free's manhood didn't go unchanged either! As the blood continued to flow, Free's cock engorged and swole! It almost felt like he was getting hard, but instead he was just getting bigger! To top off his perfect body, his tanned, fuzzy behind pushed out further, not only making his new shorts feel tight, but his beautiful ass had grown so large, it actually peaked out the bottom of the shorts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it all slowed to a stop, Free fell down on his side, making a crash inside the room that shook everything! His sharp teeth were grit shut, as his face was a grimace of pain. Slowly, he started breathing normally, and opened his eyes. Ever so gently, he pulled himself up, and got to his feet. He then looked down at his body, and in a few short seconds, his tired face started to smile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This... This is me...?\" Free panted. His hand reached up and touched his giant pectoral, and squeezed it gently through the fabric. He could feel it! Then his hand slid down, quickly reaching the end of the shirt and along his cobblestone abs. Free's face only grew happier as he came to realize all this! \"I was pretty big before... But now this...\" Free rose both of his arms, and flexed his biceps. The muscles erupted with power, both pumping up to their full size. \"This just isn't fair!\" Free laughed arrogantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree looked down, and noticed the book lying on the floor. \"Hey there, buddy!\" He said with a dark grin. \"Now what were those words again...?\" He mumbled.</span></div></div>",

The voice didn't belong to Medusa or Eruka. It was too deep and masculine. He shrugged and went back to flipping through the pages. When he started growing, he had dropped the book, effectively losing both spots he was holding. He was less concerned about what Medusa might do at this point and more worried about finding a way to get even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...How dare you ignore me! I am shocked, surprised, sickened! Now remove those grubby fingers of yours from off my pages!\" The voice called forth once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Are you talking?\" Free asked, poking at the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course I am you dimwitted, dim bulbed, dummy!\" It was clear now the voice was coming from between the pages. \"I am a book of magic! All of the best books of magic can speak. I also serve as librarian of the information within. If you need to find a spell I am at your service!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Free said with a grin. \"Great, so how about you tell me where to find that growing spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohohohoho! What kind of book do you take me for? I do not flip open my covers and let every passerby peer at my pages!\" The voice said. \"If you want me to help you you are going to have to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree rolled his eyes and said, \"Fine, what do you want me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple my good man! Merely help to escape from this place! I do not rightfully belong to that deceitful, dangerous, delinquent! She merely purloined my precious pages from a stronger magician.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to tell me you're the Book of Eibon or something are you?\" Free asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas, no, I do not belong to a magician such as he! I am a lesser book of magic, though still powerful! The name of the magician is not important. You, however, may refer to me as BOM. Now, are you going to help me escape or not my huge, hulking, hombre?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do, you'll help me find the spell to make me bigger, right?\" Free said, wanting to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and more besides! I know more tricks than just simple growth! Together we can be an terrific, tremendous team!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree chuckled and said, \"I like you, even if you are just a book. Okay, let's get out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore BOM could complain about being referred to as \"just a book\", Free tucked him under one of his thick arms and carried him out of Medusa's base. It was surprisingly easy to steal the book from Medusa. Not a single magical trap tried to stop Free. Soon enough, he was out of the base. He ran as fast as he could away from it, getting about halfway between it and the nearest town before stopping under a tree to open the book again. \"There! We're out. Now you'd better hold up your end of the bargain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course! I am a book of my word! And I have many words within my beautiful, broad, body! Where would you like to begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree grinned and said, \"Where else? The spell to make me bigger of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a rather one track mind. What specifically would you like to grow? Body part? Muscle? Height? I have many options to offer as obeisance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree scratched the stubble on his chin as he thought about it. He had never really considered the idea of growing individual body parts or growing taller without getting any more mass and vice versa. Not only that, but who knew what other kinds of powers he could find in the book? The possibilities were endless! But for now, he was happy with something simple. \"Full body growth! Height, muscle, the works!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOM didn't speak. He merely flipped the pages for a few minutes until about halfway through the book. Free bent down over the page and scanned it. \"Okay...so which one of these spells is it? There's like ten of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third down from the top right column. Read those words and you shall grow huge, hung, and high!\" BOM said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree quickly found the spell after that, reading the words much more confidently this time. He grinned as he set BOM down, eager for his changes to begin!  Soon, the familiar pain engulfed his body again, though Free welcomed it this time, knowing that it was going to make him even bigger than he was now!</span></div></div>",

His chest swelled like two balloons, filling up until they looked like two gargantuan watermelons! His biceps undulated and grew, surpassive their former size until a hard peak popped up at the tops as Free flexed them in pain! Free's traps had rose up, swallowing his neck slightly. His shoulders pushed out further, along with his back which was now like a steel wall of muscle! Free's abs surged forth, the rigid muscles pushed out and becoming more noticable under his looming pecs! His waist slimmed down a little but his hips pushed out as his bulging, manly ass pushed their way further out! Free's thighs grew massive, rubbing up against each other while his gargantuan calves had also managed to hold up with the wolf man's increasing girth! Free's bare feet stretched out across the dirt nearly doubling in size! To top it off once more, the man's dick snaked down his short little pants, making for a tight fit. The front bulged out obscenely, the meat within just begging to be released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree groaned, but his grunts slowly stopped before he let out a long howl, straight up at the moon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, we can all hear you, now stuff it you buffoon!\" BOM said, slamming shut in an attempt to block out noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree stood there, panting slightly. \"Yeah...\" He rose his arm, and flexed it a few times to get the blood flowing. A split peak formed on top of the wolf's 38 inch bicep! \"Fuck yeah... I'm the biggest, strongest thing in the world!\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly.\" BOM replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree scowled, looking back down at the book. \"Whadd'ya mean by that?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's no doubt in my mind that there's a certain number of people in place called Death City that would have no problem with dealing with a massive mutt like yourself.\" BOM explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree frowned a little. \"Death City...\" He mumbled. His voice was much deeper now, like a low, rumbling thunder. \"Yeah... I know a few kids in there... Who could be taught a lesson!\" He grinned, smacking his fist into his palm. \"Hey! BOM! You got anything to make me bigger? You know, like taller?\" Free asked the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you not listening to what I told you a mere five minutes ago? I can make you bigger in any kind of way you want!\" BOM replied. \"I suppose it's the very least I could do since you freed me from that moldy old room...\" The book then grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... Perfect...\" Free said with a grin.</span></div></div>",

Your text is too small!\" Free said in frustration. It was hard to read the book past his beefy pecs, and not to mention it was hard to manuver the book any higher!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not that my text is too small, it's merely that your bulk is too big!\" BOM replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? No way!\" Free replied. He held BOM in one had as his other arm rose up and flexed HARD, making veins run all along that large, hulking muscle! \"To a man, bigger is always better!\" BOM could be heard sighing as he heard Free's meat-headed remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, very well then...\" BOM said. He took a breath, before reading out his pages to Free, \"Mensch... Wachsen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree felt his entire body pulse, and in but a few short seconds, he started shooting up like bamboo! First a few inches... Then a foot, then two! His muscles stretched with him, the overall bulk of his body lessening only slightly. He was still the intimidating wolf man he was before it all! As it all slowed to a halt, Free looked down. He could still see something about the size of a small diary in his hand. Free smiled down at BOM.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, not bad... For a book.\" Free said. Free tossed BOM up on his shoulder, where the book slid down and was caught on his tanned pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad? Dear boy, I could do so much more!\" BOM replied, \"I dare say, I'm just getting warmed up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree just grinned a dark grin. \"I like hearing that!\" He said, \"When we get to Death City, how about you show me a little more of just what you're capable of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, Shinigami-sama was in his office. He had just finished a transmission with Maka and Soul, who were off in London helping control an outbreak of attacks on innocent people. Not long after waving goodbye, the wisp on his head stood straight up in shock! Spirit rose an eyebrow as he noticed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong there, Shinigami-sama?\" Spirit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My yes, there is...\" He replied, \"It would appear we have a powerful visitor entering the city... And a malicious one at that!\" Shinigami-sama replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How big are we talking?\" Spirit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't quite tell... It's too far off... But this cannot go unnoticed. Spirit!\" Shinigami-sama suddenly snapped, \"Bring me Ox Ford. We have a mission for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpirit only nodded and ran off through the guilatines to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree easily waltzed right into the entrence of Death City! Citizens only took one look at him before running off for their lives! Free smirked. \"Heh... The little bugs must know power when they see it!\" As Free paraded right through town, making a beeline for the DWMA, someone finally stood in his way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt!\" Ox called out, holding up his spear. \"... Geez... This guy's bigger than I expected... But I could easily outsmart him! No witch servant is smarter than me!\" Ox thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree looked down, and actually let out a snicker once he saw just who it was standing in his way! \"Seriously!? This little runt!?\" Free laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Runt, am I? Lets see how you feel after a jolt from the Lightning King!\" Ox held his spear forward and began to charge at Free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree, in turn, just looked down at BOM. \"Hey, magic book?

Dude, you hungry?\" He said, talking to his stomach. As if a reply, there was another loud grumble. America just laughed and pat slender abs. \"Let's see what we got!\" He hopped up off his couch, and made his way over to the kitchen. He went right to his fridge and opened it up. He stared inside for a few minutes, wasting power, as he looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Nothing.\" He shut the door, and started to look through his cupboards. Maybe there was something good in there... Again, his search turned up empty. \"Man! I have GOT to go grocery shopping!\" He said to himself. Before he could think of anything else, his stomach let out another growl. \"Geez, alright! We'll go get some burgers!\" With that, America grabbed his wallet, and was out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, there was a conspiracy against the big-headed nation further up the street. It was the Axis Powers, as usual, in their attempts to overthrow the resiliant nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Germany began, \"Zhe fat headed American will be here any moment! Remember your lines! Japan! You handle zhe window! Italy! You will hand off zhe trapped meal to zhe bigger idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai.\" \"H'okay!\" They both agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hand taken over a building, and diguised it to look like a burger joint. Germany scientists had developed a liquid, which Germany had figured would rid them of America! The chemical was dubbed \"Supersize Me,\" and as Germany's memory recalled, that was increasing portion size, which thus made those stupid Americans fat and helpless! It was all coming together perfectly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is this a new place?\" A voice was heard, not too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Places! NOW!\" Germany roared, everyone getting into place. Japan's ears rung a little as he heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the face they all new had walked in, looking about. He browsed their overhead menu for a moment before walking up to Japan, who was in a fast food uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, hey, could I get your combo meal?\" America said, still looking up at the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, could you repeat that, prease?\" Japan asked, using his pinky to clear his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I want cheese.\" America said, not getting Japan's accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, I said PREASE.\" Japan repeated to the clueless nation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Cheese! Can I get that on the burger?\" America agreed, finally looking down. Clearly not the brightest bulb, he didn't even recognize Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not cheese! Prease!\" Japan insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes already! I want frickin' cheese!\" America barked, getting a bit hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stupid Amer--\" Japan was about to snap at him, but he was shoved back by Germany, who was diguised at the manager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes, you vant cheese! We will bring that right out to you!\" Germany said, putting on a fake smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet!\" America grinned his winning smile, \"How much will that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uhm... Four dollars?\" Germany asked. Currency hadn't even crossed his mind, all he wanted was for America to get what's coming to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the cash, Italy waited for the signal. After about a minute, Germany waved for Italy to come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the plan's demise, Italy came out wearing a french maid outfit, not the uniform he was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Italy! Vhat are you doing!?\" Germany barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! France gave this to me! He-a said I'd look very pretty in it!\" Italy struck a pose, blushing a little. \"What do you think, Germany?\" He said in his usual clueless tone. Germany, meanwhile, blushed, unable to say anything. Seeing that everything was begining to stagnate, Japan took the bag from Italy, and handed it off to America. This, of course, broke the blushy moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sankyuu, come again!\" Japan said, shoving the bag into America's possession, before the trio disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... That's... Weird...\" America said slowly. He peeked inside the bag, before picking out a fry and munching it. Strangely enough, they had put the drink in the bag too... But America wasn't smart enough to pick up on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica had taken the burger out halfway home, and began to munch on it. Germany had packed everyone into his volkswagon, and quietly stalked America from the car. \"Any... Moment now...\" Germany said to himself as the three drove very slowly, keeping their distance away from America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time progressed...</span></div></div>",

For as they followed the young, bright-eyed America, Germany witnessed an event that made his jaw drop. America was not growing wider, but bigger! Every muscle, every bulge on his body had begun to grown and expand quickly, as if his slender body was being inflated with pure size! America's pecs pressed against his undershirt, pulling the buttons apart slightly, as his sleeves were quickly becoming uncomfortable. The once thin arms immediately began to pump up larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, am I getting bloated already...?\" America mumbled to himself, a few pieces of burger spewing from his mouth as he spoke. As he gulped down his food, he shrugged it off and continued to eat. \"Whatever! This stuff is delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he ate, the more he grew, as his thighs were now quickly pushing against the cloth. His calves had swollen, as they were being worked with every step America took back home. The young blonde couldn't help but whimper as his feet started to feel uncomfortably tight in his shoes. It was getting a little hard to move in such tight clothes, but thankfully for him, his now large, bulging pecs burst the first few buttons of his shirt off. He let out a huge sigh, continuing to eat, taking even bigger bites than before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it didn't take long for America to start hearing loud tearing and shredding noises! Surprised, his head popped up and looked all around, not realizing that it was his growing body that was doing all the ripping! As he looked around, on guard, the Axis Powers boys ducked down in the car, hoping they weren't seen. Luckily for them, America was dumb as ever, and shrugged it off (tearing the seams of his shirt even further in the process) as he continued to walk. He was only about 5'9\" upon leaving the store, but now he must have been at least 6'7\"! In the short time he had walked home, he had nearly grew up an entire foot! But his height aside, there was something else that would grab any decent person's attention...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom being a generally thin man, perhaps with a little bit of pudge, America was now a large, beefy soldier! His rippling biceps straining against his jacket; they had long since broke free of their cocoon. His pecs made it impossible to button up the shirt he was wearing now, as his big healthy pecs bounced with every step he took. None could see it under the layers, but there was a solid row of abs under his shirt. Anyone who dared to throw a punch at his stomach would end up hurting themselves more than him! America's glutes had burst forth, leaving him with a bubbly, rounded ass which stuck out nicely in his skin-tight pants. Each cheek was huge, pressing against the other, and shaking with every step! His thighs were practically rubbing together as he walked, his calves so bulky that they rose his pants up slightly. As if all this wouldn't boost his confidence, the man's already admirable cock had gained some size of it's own, pressing against his boxers! America's shoes were torn a bit at the seams, which gave him a little freedom for now, but he'd be in a world of hurt if he didn't get out of them soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany, his eyes too focused on the titan that was walking down the sidewalk, accidentally floored the gas! With that, the car flew forward, rushing past America! The funny thing was, the momentum didn't even phase the giant man! He just watched as the speeding car zipped right past him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! What's their rush...?\" America mumbled to himself. Shrugging again, he downed the rest of his fried and chugged his drink as he walked up the way back to his house. He tossed the trash into the bag, crumpling it up with relative ease as he entered through the doorway. \"Is this really my house...?\" He thought to himself, \"That doorway is WAY too low...\" Every step he took in his house seemed to shake everything, picture frames shaking on the wall, and the floor groaning just slightly under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica tossed his trash in the kitchen, looking onward when he suddenly saw something that was strange. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw something strange in the mirror in his hallway. As he took a step back and looked, he felt around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this... Is that...!?\" America looked down over his gargantuan body. \"Whoa! Check me out dude! I'm totally ripped!\" America laughed, his hands opening up the collar and popping open the buttons. He smile only grew wider as he looked down. \"Damn, I look good! Check out those abs! And these pecs!\" America ditched his gloves and rubbed his massive pecs in his hands, a tender moan escaping his lips as he did. \"Oh man... How did this happen to me!?\" He said, beginning to think.</span></div></div>",

He had always been incredibly strong for his age, but now he was like the perfect super soldier! Anyone who had looked down on him or considered him a childish nuisance would think twice about saying anything nasty about him or try to fight him! America's thoughts began to drift to the men he was fighting, the Axis nations. He had never really considered Italy to be too much of a threat and now he'd probably wet his pants just looking at America! Japan was harder to read, being so much quieter, but America had a feeling that they could get along sometime in the future, once this whole war thing was over. It was Germany that gave him the most trouble! That tall, fierce blond man had always stood in his way no matter what he did. It drove him crazy! America smirked as he flexed his biceps, the vein covered mounds rising up impressively from his thick arms. \"I'd like to see that sausage loving weirdo beat me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light bulb seemed to go off in America's head. \"Hey! I'm huge! What's stopping me from kidnapping Germany and stopping this whole war right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and punched his palm with his hand, overflowing with even more confidence than he normally did! His shirt was all but ruined, but his jacket was still fitting pretty well so he didn't bother to try and change his clothes. His shoes were more like flapping rags of canvas around his thick feet and his pants were way too tight and torn in several places but the young nation didn't seem to care in the slightest. Why should he hide his awesome body anyway? He quickly made his way out the door and ran down the street, heading for Germany's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany himself slammed the door on his truck, a look of anger on his face. Italy and Japan both got out of the vehicle rather slowly, not liking the expression Germany was wearing. Before they could so much as say a single word, however, Germany slammed his fist against the hood of the car, denting the metal rather severely and shouted, \"We're done here! Go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJapan bowed quickly before beating a hasty retreat. Italy, however, looked at Germany with a hurt and worried look on his face. \"Hey, Germany...It's-a okay! Just because America got really big all of a sudden doesn't mean we can't win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Ja Italy...sure. Thank you. But I vould rather be alone right now. Go home and get some rest. Ve'll come up with a new plan tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly smiled and nodded. \"That's-a the Germany I know! I'm-a going to get a real good night's sleep and make you proud tomorrow! Promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran off with a big goofy smile on his face. Germany couldn't help but smile a little himself. As soon as Italy was out of sight Germany stretched and headed into his house, eager to take a shower and just relax for awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica, panting slightly, arrived in front of Germany's house in record time! He cracked his knuckles and walked up to Germany's door, knocking on it three times, the wood splintering slightly under his huge fist. America crossed his arms and waited for Germany to answer, his eyes wandering around the yard slightly. He did a double take as soon as he saw the car sitting in the drive way. \"Hey...wasn't that car in that weird burger place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica closed his eyes, searching his memory. In fact...that burger place had been run by three guys who had looked very familiar...Another light bulb went off in America's head. This was a good day for him~ He almost never got any real bright ideas! He snapped his fingers as he realized that it had been Germany, Japan, and Italy who had been running that burger place! And he hadn't started growing until after he ate there! Which meant that they must have been the cause of it! \"Wow! That's really nice of them to do this to me! I mean, I'm their enemy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled to himself as Germany finally opened the door. He was dressed in a dark green tank top with a light pair of nylon shorts, his feet bare. His hair was wet, the slickness gone out of it entirely. It was clear that he had just recently got done with a shower. His neutral look suddenly turned to one of pure shock and horror as he saw who was waiting on his door step! Moving on instinct, he tried to slam the door closed. Before the door could shut, however, America grabbed it, forcing it back open. Germany stumbled, moving back and heading for the nearest drawer. He had weapons stored all over his house. He wasn't about to allow this home invasion to continue! America calmly walked inside, closing the door behind him before advancing on Germany. \"Hey dude! I don't know why you did this for me, but thanks! That makes you pretty awesome in my book! Too bad I gotta capture you and all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany gave up looking for a weapon and just ran. He was no coward but he was also no fool. America at his current size could easily overpower him in seconds. If he wanted to get out of this, he was going to need some back up! He made a beeline for the nearest phone, America hot on his heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Don't run! Let's do this the easy way for once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany picked up the phone and swiftly dialed Italy's number. Before the ditzy nation could answer, America had grabbed the receiver, tugging it out of Germany's hand. He carelessly dropped it, the receiver dangling near the floor. \"Okay dude! We'll do this the hard way then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica charged forward like an angry bull, wrapping Germany up in a big bear hug before falling to the floor, his full weight pressing down on Germany's body. Germany let out a gasp, his lungs emptying of air as he slammed into the ground. America quickly got back on his feet, pinning the smaller man's arms at his sides as he picked him up. \"Don't bother struggling! I've got you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany, weakened by the assault, could barely breath, let alone fight back. America slung Germany over his shoulder and headed for the door. As they passed by the dangling receiver, Germany could faintly hear Italy's voice calling out to him, wondering what he wanted. Glancing over at America to make sure he wasn't paying attention, Germany knocked over a vase. America stopped as the pottery shattered in front of him, distracting him. Germany used this time to quickly pick up the receiver and whisper. \"Take the canister in your fridge...drink it...and go to America's house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany, being the cunning nation he was, had hidden the Supersize Me chemical in Italy's house, positive that he would be too dumb to actually notice it. This way, his secret project was kept safe and hidden and no one would tamper with it. Whether or not Italy would follow his instructions was to be seen. It didn't take America long to recover from the shock of the broken vase. Once he was sure there wasn't a ghost or anything scary like that around, he quickly left the house, running down the street back towards his own home.</span></div></div>",

None of it seemed to prove to be doing any good! In fact, America just laughed triumphantly with every feeble attempt Germany made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! Give it up! You're MY prisoner now!\" America told Germany. Germany just grit his teeth and pounded on America's back, which didn't even hurt the massive man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never! I swear, I will have your head for this!\" Germany threatened. America just chuckled as he arrived at his front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, dude.\" America walked right in, and tossed Germany onto his couch. \"Alright! Time to get this payback underway!\" America grinned as he locked the door. That lone click seemed to echo through the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany stared back at America, who was slowly approaching him. Germany scrambled backwards, trying to get away, only to fall off the sofa in doing so! Germany could hear a loud \"THUD!\" with every step the muscular titan took tword him. America let out a dark chuckle as he cracked his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No! Stay back!\" Germany shouted. His hands reached around from something to throw, before finally landing on a television remote. Germany chucked it at America, only to miss and hit his chest! It bounced right off of America's thick, engorged pecs, which he then flexed in retaliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That the best you got?\" America asked in a cocky tone. Germany stumbled to his feet, wincing a little as he saw America was at least a whole two feet taller than him! Not to mention he outweighted him by fifty, if not a good few hundred pounds! Germany gulped, before his fist pulled back, and nailed America right in his abs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a silence in the room for a moment. Germany then let out a whimper as he pulled his hand back, which was now a stinging red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh! Mein Gott!\" Germany groaned, shaking his hand. America just laughed once more, before then picking Germany up by the front of his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it's my turn!\" He grinned. His massive arm pulled back, and jabbed right into Germany's tender belly! Germany coughed, before America let him fall to the ground. He curled up, holding his stomach, as America knocked him over on his stomach with his giant foot. America then pounded his foot onto Germany's back, causing the tiny blonde man to cry out in pain. America snickered, lifting his foot back up. He picked Germany right back up, and gave him a hug... It seemed innocent at first, and Germany didn't fight back, until America then began to squeeze him as hard as he could! Germany began to groan once more, as America had an arrogant, smug little smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought you were so strong? You and your little friends? Well guess what!? I'm way stronger than all of you combined! I could crush you between these massive globes!\" America smiled, loosening his grip on Germany only to shove the helpless male's face into his pecs. \"You feel those? You smell those? That's what a REAL man smells like! Musky! Powerful! Unlike you, you twiggy little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany wanted to reply. His burning spirit so desperately wanted to bite back, but his body felt so worn down, talking back was impossible! America dropped Germany back to the ground, letting the male fall on his back as he was forced to look up at the pumped, chiseled man before him. America rose his foot up, and enveloped Germany's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, you're so small my foot could crush your head!\" America bragged on. He put a little pressure, making Germany moan a little. Then Germany heard his tormentor say the last thing he wanted to head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lick it.\" America ordered. There was a brief pause, where nothing was said. \"Did I stutter, dude!? I told you to lick my damned foot like the worthless bug you are!\" America demanded, putting even more pressure on Germany's face! Not wanting to end up a mess on the floor, Germany weakly stuck his tongue out and gave America's foot a tiny lick. America just chuckled. \"Yeah... More!\" America ordered. Germany whimpered for a moment, actually shaking for a second. He closed his eyes tight, and put his whole tongue into it, licking all over America's toes, as well as the top of his foot! A thick, heavy musk penetrated Germany's nose, not to mention it was now being wiped all over his tongue. In mere seconds, America had made Germany his bitch. America's thick toes flexed a little, as if a warning if Germany stopped without being told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good few minutes, America took his foot off of Germany, and smiled down at him. \"Looks like you're starting to get it...\" America chuckled. Before Germany could move, he could see his beefy tormentor start to shuffle around! Without giving Germany a chance to escape, America sat right on top of him! The powerful nation's ass was right before Germany's face, barely contained in a pair of Stars and Stripes boxers. They were like two large, round orbs that pinned down his entire body! Germany let out a long groan as he could feel America's full weight on top of him. It was like music to the giant's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really have to thank you!\" America said, looking behind him and down at Germany. He then flexed his back, the powerful wall suddenly growing longer! \"If it wasn't for you, I never would have become this hot, irresistable stud I am now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You wait...\" Germany choked out. America rose an eyebrow, listening to what Germany had to say. \"Once Italy get here with zhat mixture, I'll be sure you pay!\" Germany barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Italy...?\" America repeated. It was then the little hamster wheel in his head began to work. \"You mean that wimpy little thing has more of this stuff!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grk!\" Germany gulped, as he realized what he just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that's awesome! How about me and you pay him a little visit?\" America said with an evil grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! I-I mean... I have it! It's in my pocket right now!\" Germany said, trying to stall for time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" America replied, \"If you did, you would have drank it by now! Come on!\" America said, as he got up and jerked Germany up, tossing him over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading right out the door, America began to take a trip to go visit the weakest nation he had ever known.</span></div></div>",

Germany stil felt a little weak from their battle, and saw little point in trying to fight this lummox of a man. America crashed right through his front door and started taking the long walk down to Italy's house, where more of that delicious size potion awaited!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels great being this strong, you know?\" America asked, flexing his bicep as he spoke to Germany. Germany just rolled his eyes. \"I mean, I was already pretty strong, but this?\" America flexed a little harder so a vein popped up on the top of his bicep, \"This just isn't fair!\" He then laughed. \"If I get any bigger, who's gonna stop me from taking over Germany? Or Italy?\" America smirked as he looked down at Germany.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You can't take over Germany! Zhat vould start a war!\" Germany replied, suddenly nervous as he heard all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? But who's going to stop me?\" America asked, bouncing the pec closest to Germany. \"I'm way to huge to be stopped! And I'll just keep getting bigger and bigger! Little wimps like you will either have to join me or end up under my foot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany gulped. This wasn't good. He had to think of something to stop America once they got to Italy's house, or else they might be facing a whole new war, one that they would undoubtably lose!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fr\u00e8re Jacques, fr\u00e8re Jacques...\" Italy sang to himself as he was cleaning the dishes. \"Wait, isn't that France's song...? Oh well!\" Italy thought happily to himself, humming the tune as he scrubbed a plate clean. As he stood there, he felt a rumble... Then another! They were growing more powerful by the second, before they abruptly stopped! Italy looked around. \"Is that an earthquake...?\" Italy said aloud. He shrugged and kept on washing his dishes. Then there was a loud thud at the door! And again! Italy dropped his dishes and ran to his living room, peeking around the corner at the door. There another thud, even louder than before! As Italy watched, he saw the door actually bend inward from the sheer force of the banging!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mamma mia, don't kill meeeeee!\" Italy cried, running and hiding under the coffee table. With a final \"BANG!\" the door burst open, and there stood the behemoth that was America. He let himself right in, stepping over the remains of Italy's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you told him that stuff was in the fridge, huh?\" America carelessly tossed Germany onto Italy's couch and started to search for the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany landed with a soft thud, and slid down to the carpet. \"Germany!\" Italy said noisily as he saw his friend hit the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh... Italy...?\" Germany groaned. He felt a little worn from the trip... America didn't exactly walk with the grace of a ballerina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Germany! Whatsa happening!?\" Italy said, a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Italy, listen... I need you to go to zhe k\u00fchlschrank... And get zhe mixture I gave you this morning... Bring it here, and I vill give you further instruction...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wha?\" Italy asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ZHE REFRIGERATOR!\" Germany shouted at him, \"GO! NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly popped right up... Hitting his head on the table! \"Owie...\" Italy then crawled out, before popping up and running to his kitchen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got there...</span></div></div>",

Germany had already yelled at him, which always put him on edge and gave him the shakes, and just seeing America as this massive hulk that had so easily taken down the strongest guy he knew only added to his anxiety. He looked left and right but, strangely, America was nowhere to be seen! \"I-I w-wonder if he g-got a-lost or something?\" Italy said to himself, his teeth chattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Elsewhere in the house--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! This place is a freaking maze! I'd need a map just to use the bathroom!\" America said, opening one of the many doors in the hallway only to find himself in Italy's bedroom. \"Dammit! I hate this place!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--In the kitchen--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I b-better hurry before he comes back!\" Italy said, slowly walking into the kitchen. His morning had started out so nice, so normal. Why didn't Japan ever have to worry about things like this? Italy slowly opened the fridge door and started pushing things aside, the canister eventually coming into sight. Italy quickly grabbed it and closed the fridge, making a mad dash back into the living room where Germany was resting. \"Germany! Germany! Germany! I a-found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't just wave it around and shout dumbkoff!\" Germany shouted, wincing as he sat up. \"Bring it here! Fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly had taken about three steps when suddenly America appeared at a different doorway and shouted, \"Hey! That's supposed to be mine dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly froze and stared at America before letting out a desperate shriek, dropping the canister and waving a little white flag he apparently carried around in his pocket. \"Please don't kill me Mr. America I didn't mean to do anything bad I just wanted to help my friend Germany please please please don't hurt me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...whatever dude, just kick the canister over here and I won't touch you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO! Don't be a fool Italy! RUN! Take the canister and RUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly looked back and forth between the two of them, a confused look on his face. \"Uh...Uh...W-What should I do?\" He asked himself, still shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica frowned, sick of waiting, and started moving towards Italy, his hand outstretched, aiming to grab the canister. This was all it took for Italy to snatch the canister and bolt, screaming at the top of his lungs, thinking that America was reaching out grab him! \"Hey! Get back  here!\" America shouted, lumbering after Italy, the whole house shaking as he gave chase!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany sighed, lying back down, squeezing the bridge of his nose, a slight headache forming. \"Things...are not going as planned.\" He said simply, staring up at the ceiling. Only time would tell whether or not America would be able to catch Italy and get the canister. If he did...well they would both probably be in some serious trouble. \"Hopefully Italy will remember the contingency plans I created during all zhat training.\" Germany briefly thought back to Italy's lackluster performance and groaned, covering his face with his hand. \"I suppose it's all over zhen...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Germany gave himself up to wait for his fate, Italy had managed to dive under his bed just as America forced his way into Italy's room, smashing the door frame without a care. \"Where did you go?! I saw you come in here!\" He shouted, his voice low and rumbling, sounding dangerous. It was one thing to have trouble with Germany. Getting outwitted, outfought, or outANYTHING by Italy was just plain embarrassing! He immediately went to the closet and started rummaging around in it. Italy peered out from under the bed, clutching the canister tightly in his hand. It was a cold, constant reminder of what he was carrying and what could happen to him if America caught him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in this thing anyway? Germany never a-said!\" Italy said to himself, staring at it. \"Or wait...Did he a-say what it was? I can't remember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced as America picked up the dresser and emptied it out, tossing the empty wooden structure against the wall with a grunt, his muscles heaving as the wood shattered against the wall. Italy gulped and thought, \"If America wants it a so bad, maybe THIS is what made him so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly shook the canister and nodded. \"Oh, I wish I could have a gotten it to Germany! If he was big and strong he'd protect me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the bed was lifted up by America, revealing Italy's small form hidden underneath. He shrieked again and was about to run for the door when America slammed the bed against it, effectively trapping Italy in the room with him since there was no way Italy's small arms would be able to move the heavy bed! America grinned and held out his hand. \"Come on dude, just hand it over! It's not like you're getting out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly looked around the room, trying to find an escape route...but there simply was none! America was blocking the window and the bed was blocking the door! Escape was impossible! Unless...Italy looked down at the canister. It was a desperate move...but what choice did he have? He quickly began unscrewing the lid of the canister, his fingers fumbling slightly as he hurried. \"Woah! Hey, don't do that!\" America shouted, quickly moving toward Italy!</span></div></div>",

As soon as he could, he closed his eyes and brought it up to his lips! After all but a brief moment, all Italy felt pour in was but a tiny sip! As he opened his eyes back up, he immediately noticed that the thermos was out of his hands!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dude!\" America said, holding it up high, \"But this isn't for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooo! Please! Give it-a back!\" Italy said, running up and jumping to try to get it back! America just chuckled. It was kind of cute how futile his efforts were! Wasting no more time, he gave his lips a quick lick before raising the thermos to mouth. As soon as it began to pour, America instantly began to chug it, his mouth overflowing with the admittedly delicious formula! A little bit of it ran down his cheeks as he gulped down every last drop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly had backed up, slowly working himself into a corner as he looked up at America. He wasn't even growing yet and Italy was already scared! America wiped his face on his forearm, and licked right up along it! He wasn't about to leave any drop left! He put a hand on his abs where there was a sudden gurgle noise! America's cheeks puffed up before letting out a loud burp! He just grinned, patting his abs a little as his other hand fanned away the smell. He didn't even bother to apologize! Typical rude American.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then America felt a small tingle in his body! Before Italy's very eyes, the big nation was getting even bigger! His whole body seemed to undulate and grow! His pecs started pushing out further from his chest! The already ample muscles were swelling up like balloons, packing on pound after pound of pure meat! His shoulders were blowing up, looking like two inflating bowling balls were stuck onto him! His biceps curled up and began to pump up, bulging to the max! With arms like those, America could probably bench all the other Allies! ... If they weighed 200 pounds each! America had a grin on his face, and actually laughed a little! \"Y-Yeah! C'mon, dude... B-Bigger... I'm gonna be so frickin' huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder his massive pecs, America's abs were continuing to develop, the rippling muscles pushing out further, each of them practically the size of Italy's chest, if the puny pink nation had a chiseled body! America's back broadened, forcing his frame outward and making him look even bigger! Italy was trembling in his boots as he looked up at America, whose head was smashed up against the ceiling! It was starting to crack, and America's growth didn't seem to have an end in sight! Below the belt, America's massive thighs were starting to rub together, the two of them surging with muscle and strength like tree trunks. His calves were nearly the size of beach balls by now! His large feet continued to expand, each of his beefed up toes moving closer twords Italy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo top off his already hulked up body and even more hulked up ego, America's dick had started to twitch, stretching out further from his hips! It doubled, no, tripled in size and four times as thick! It was like someone had just stuck some fourteen inch long on him! And not to mention his ass! Just around the corner, two massive orbs of great size were hung. Each of them so round, so thick, so bouncy you could toss a bowling ball off of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica let off a loud groan before crashing back on his glorious ass! The entire room shook, knocking trinkets off shelves and books out of their cases! He loved how heavy his new body was, and not to mention how his pecs pressed up against his chin whenever he looked down! He couldn't even see past those two gigantic, bulging beauties!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Italy...\" America began, \"How about you--\"</span></div></div>",

He already had water boiling, but as soon as Germany called he at least remembered to turn the stove off before answering the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, to Italy's surprise, he found something strange in his refrigerator. \"What's-a this?\" Italy asked himself, looking over the silver thermos. It was cold to the touch, and there was an audiable sloshing when it was shook. Italy finally opened up the top and looking inside. There was a clear green liquid, the color reminiscent of a pesto sauce. Italy, curious, gave it a few whiffs. He then let out a happy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it smells just-a like-a mama's homemade cola!\" Italy smiled, holding the thermos close to his face. He set it over on his counter. It would make a nice drink to accompany tonight's pasta!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly clapped his hands together, excited as a plate of ziti with fresh marinara sat before him, acompannied by the strange yet delightful liquid he found in his fridge. \"Bon appetit!\" He said to himself, before grabbing his fork and digging in. He let out a happy sigh after the first bite, enjoying every second of it! After a few more bites, Italy took a drink of the Supersize Me liquid, unaware of the consequence. From the moment it touched his lips to the moment it was all drained from the glass, Italy shouted with joy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama mia, that's delicious!\" He laughed, pouring another glass. And before he knew it, he poured another... And another... And another, getting every last drop of the liquid out! Before he knew it, he had drank the entire canister dry! There was a slight frown as he shook the container as it was upside down. \"Aw, no more?\" He sighed, setting it back down. \"At least I gotta this pasta!\" He said, instantly smiling once more! He dove his fork back in and continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, Italy was left to do as he pleased. It wasn't too late in the day, so there was still time to enjoy a little television, or maybe even visit one of his friends! \"S\u00ed! I'm-a gonna go see Germany!\" Italy smiled to himself. He was still suited up, so without even calling, he set out for Germany's house unannounced, as always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking on, Italy could feel a slight disturbance beneath his clothes. His pinkish chest started pushing tighter against his jacket, as well as his shoulders having a little difficulty. He didn't seem to notice much as his arms were growing larger in his jacket, nor did he feel his abs start to plump up. However, as Italy walked on, the changes were becoming more drastic. His pecs started to pop the buttons of his shirt. The sleeves were molding around his arms, which gradually bulked up, making the sleeves look painted on. His pecs finally burst forth, making the young man gasp suddenly, as it suddenly felt like a pair of weights had been slapped on his chest, bulging outward until they were the size of basketballs! Under those magnificent pecs was a row of abs, becoming a hard and thick six-pack. His upper body filled out as his back flared outward, with his powerful shoulders bursting forth as well, ripping the jacket in several places. This, of course, caught Italy's attention, who finally looked down. His first response was surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Whoa whoa whoa!\" Italy shouted, hardly able to believe his eyes! Beyond his bouncing, bulging pecs, his thighs had begun to press against each other with the pure mass that was slowly filling them. Italy's height was shooting upward, as he soon found himself just short of eight feet tall! And he wasn't even done growing yet! His calves slowly grew heavy and beefed, leaving his pants even higher than they were before, as his feet now burst from his shoes, one massive toe at a time. Italy laughed happily as he saw this, thinking it was almost like a game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his growth finally rounded out, he looked over himself, amazed at how massive, how powerful he felt now! He raised his arm and gave it a hard flex, watching as the muscles bunched up and tightened, forming a hardened peak. Italy then hoisted his other arm and did the same, laughing happily to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is-a so cool!\" He cheered happily, \"I can't-a wait to show Germany the new me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly, even more excited than he was before, began running off to Germany's house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Italy ran as fast as he could towards Germany's house, his now much longer, thicker legs propelling him forward at even greater speeds than normal! It would no doubt piss Germany off, but if Italy was still the same coward as he was before, he would be running away from trouble even faster now! But those thoughts were far from everyone's heads as Italy continued on his way to Germany's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, America was still running away from Germany's house, the cocky nation carrying the strict nation over his shoulder like he was a bag of laundry. He wanted to get back to his house as soon as possible so they could start negotiating victory or at least press an advantage against the other nations! He was so focused on his mission, America didn't even notice Italy barreling towards him from the other direction. Italy, for his part, was too fascinated with how his new muscles bounced and moved as he ran to notice America coming right at him! Predictably, both nations crashed headlong into each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica and Italy were flung back onto their asses, America's glasses flying off and skittering on the ground. \"Ah! Oh man! Not Texas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly groaned as he laid out on his back, feeling dizzy. He sat up and saw America searching for something. \"H-Hey! Did you lose something?\" He asked, not noticing Germany who was bound and gagged behind America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica squinted, unable to tell who was talking to him without his glasses. \"Uh...yeah! My glasses are missing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me help you look for them!\" Italy said, getting onto his hands and knees to search for the eye wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! Thanks dude! You're a lifesaver!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a-no problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany, a vein popping out of his forehead, struggled and tried to shout, doing anything he could to get Italy's attention. Italy was too focused on helping America to notice, however. It was hard to tell if Italy had even noticed who exactly it was he was helping. His good nature seemed to be overriding what little common sense he had. Soon enough, Italy found the glasses. \"Hey! I found your glasses!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica quickly crawled over to Italy and grabbed them. \"Awesome! Thanks again dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica slipped the glasses back on and blinked at Italy, both men just smiling at each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then recognition settled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap it's Italy!\" America shouted, pointing at Italy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAH! It's America!\" Italy screamed in fear, turning to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmerica hoisted Germany over his shoulder, Italy taking notice before he ran off. \"Hey! You have Germany!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's my prisoner now! And there's nothing you can do about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh yeah? Just a-watch me!\" Italy said, raising his fists up, though he was visibly trembling. America snickered and shifted Germany slightly, getting him in a more comfortable position on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me! We may be about the same size but I'm still way stronger than you!\" America boasted, raising his own fists up. \"Come and get some if you think you can handle me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly gulped but charged forward, his fists swinging wildly. America held out his hand and pressed his palm against Italy's forehead. Italy's fists stopped just short of America's face. Try as he might, Italy couldn't move any closer. America gave Italy a shove, knocking the weaker nation onto his butt again. \"Toldja!\" America said, arrogantly bouncing his pecs. \"Don't mess with the hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started running again, leaving a dejected Italy behind. He looked like he was about to cry. \"I...I couldn't save Germany! One of my best friends and now he's been captured! It's not a-fair! Why can't I be stronger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sniffled a bit and got to his feet. He started walking aimlessly down the sidewalk, trying to think of something he could do. About halfway to his house it suddenly hit him! There were multiple canisters of that stuff Germany made in his fridge! One canister had made both America and Italy the same size! If Italy were to drink another one of the canisters he would get bigger and stronger than America! Then he could rescue Germany! A big smile broke over his face as he realized this. \"Don't worry Germany! Big Italy is going to a-save your butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started running back towards his house with renewed vigor! Meanwhile, America had finally managed to make it to his house. He tossed Germany onto his bed and crossed his arms. \"Now I got you right where I want you dude! If I can keep you here this war is as good as over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany snorted derisively. He obviously didn't agree with America's proclamations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're waiting for that weak little nation to come save you, you're going to be waiting over a hundred years! There's no way that shrimp will ever beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany sighed, his struggling stopping for now. America was an idiot, but he did have a point. It would take a miracle for Italy to come through and save him now...</span></div></div>",

The moment that savory food hit his stomach, it immediately pushed out just a little bit further! He didn't seem to notice after the first few bites, but after a while he could feel his pants starting to get a little tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this feeling again? I barely ate!\" America mumbled to himself. Making a quick glance around, he undid his pants button, but kept his zipper up! America kept walking, eating his food as he moved. Every bite was making him bloat out like a balloon! By the time he finished his burger and started his fries, he must have put on at least twenty pounds! His clothes were getting tighter on him, as his soft chest was rubbing up against his shirt! His waistline had pushed out considerably, his red, white, and blue striped boxers just barely visible! His fat thighs were getting a little cozy in his pants as he continued to walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if all this wasn't bad enough, every fry he ate seemed to add on another pound!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! It is working!\" Germany said happily, \"Look at zhat fatass!

Is it really that hot out...?\" He asked himself, shielding his eyes as he looked up at the sky. He was sipping the last of his soda now, which had also only served to make him even fatter! America looked like an overstuffed doll in his own clothes! Every inch was stretched wide over his newly plumped up body! It was at this moment America looked down at his swollen gut. \"Dude!\" He said loudly! \"... That place was a total ripoff! I'm not even full!\" He then said, not even seeming to notice or care at how large he had gotten! \"Aw man, this really sucks... I was hoping I wouldn't have to cook for myself...\" He whined. Getting back up, he started to walk again, ditching his garbage in the nearby garbage can. He was making his way back home now, not even seeming to notice the three sets of eyes peeking out from the bushes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It-a looks like he's going-a back home...\" Italy said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja... Vhat shall ve do from here...?\" He asked his cohorts quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! I have an idea!\" Japan said suddenly, \"Germany, Itary! You two will possu as sarusumen.\" He told them, \"I will sneak into the fat one's kitchen and put Supahsize in all hissa food.\" Japan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Japan, zhat... Is brilliant!\" Germany said, \"And Italy and myself can pose as energy drink sales men, but zhe drink will also have the chemical in it!\" He said, having his own stroke of genius! \"Stupid Americas like him love energy drinks!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the middle of the night and deathly quiet over at Germany's house. He was sitting up in his study, head resting on his hand as he looked over all the various documents spread across the table, his tired looking blue eyes scanning left and right. His big hand would occasionally shift papers around but it was a listless motion. He seemed incredibly unmotivated which was very, very strange considering his usual strict attitude. He picked up a smaller scrap of paper with a wince, looking over the figures listed there. He sighed deeply and shook his head. \"Nein, nein, nein, zhis is no gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crumpled the paper up and tossed it away. He had been training exercises all day with Italy and Japan and things had gone even worse today than they normally did! While Italy was always a wild card, today he was particularly rambunctious, barely paying attention, playing with the cats, and running away at the slightest provocation! Japan, on the other hand, had spent the day sitting under a tree, writing a haiku while eating three rice balls. Germany had barely paid him any attention in return. When Japan got into a weird mood like that, it was best to just to let him work through things on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zhis whole operation is a complete disaster!\" Germany muttered, slamming his beefy fist against the table, his bicep flexing irritably. \"Zhey are both uncontrollable, und ridiculous, und completely insane! Vhat can I do to make them listen to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe at least knew why Italy had been acting up today. He had had a dream about his grandfather, the Roman Empire. This happened from time to time and it always put Italy in the best of moods. Unfortunately, for Germany, this also meant that the man visited them, pestering Germany all night while never once even attempting to wake his grandson up and actually talk to him! So not only did Italy act like a complete ninny as a result but Germany lost a full nights sleep! It was a lose lose no matter how it was presented! Last night had been no different. That arrogant former empire had strutted right up to the side of the bed, with no shame, and asked, \"Hey, you a think I'm sexy right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumkoff!\" Germany had shouted, ready to slap the brazen man. \"How should I know if you are sexy or not?! Go talk to a voman for that kind of information!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on Mr. Sauerkraut~\" Rome had said gleefully, stretching Germany's cheeks into a smile. \"You are always so a serious! Don't you ever lighten up? There's nothing wrong with a two men admiring each others bodies! Just ask a Greece!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany had kicked Rome in the face at this time, forcing the older man to let go of his face, though it also pulled Germany from his bed, landing face first on Rome's ample pecs! The nation had blushed fiercely, struggling to escape, but Rome had clamped his arms around him, biceps bulging, and grinned. \"Yeah, see?~ You know you a like it! I always did a want to try having some fun with another man you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany had struggled even harder at that point, but Rome held him completely at his mercy! The former empire had just laughed though, and let him go, getting to his feet. \"Si, si, anyway, take a look, tell me a what you think!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany had watched, dumbfounded, as Rome stripped down his to waist, revealing his chiseled, manly upper body, just slightly hairy around the abs and chest and along his arms, giving him a virile look that Germany, in the back of his mind, couldn't help but admire. Rome grinned as he flexed, his biceps bulging, his pecs dancing at his command, giving Germany quite a little show. \"So? What do you think? Totally a sexy right? I bet you're wishing right now that my little a grandson will grow up to be as big and sexy as me, ah?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vell he vould certainly FIGHT better if zhat were the case...\" Germany had mumbled, distracted by Rome's antics. \"Vhy can't you just leave me alone? I'm very tired tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rome had completely ignored him, jabbering on and showering off every aspect of his body, only leaving once Germany had pulled a gun on him to prevent him from exposing himself fully. By the time he had left, Italy was just waking up and the madness had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did such an irresponsible und shameless man ever command an entire empire? It makes no sense!\" Germany complained, getting up from the table and pacing around the room, his hands behind his back. \"Vhat could possibly have drawn people to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped in front of a mirror, glancing at himself within it. He was pretty well built, with his baseball sized biceps and bulging pecs, barely contained now in a tank top. He gently groped his chest, raising an eyebrow. \"Hmm...all of my training is finally paying off...I hadn't noticed before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, something in his mind clicked. That was it! Rome might have been a total ditz, completely crazy, and a hormone driven moron, but he was able to command respect through his muscles! \"Zhat dumkoff held me tight and I couldn't move even one muscle! Zhat MUST be how he vas respected! If I vas bigger und stronger Japan and Italy would HAVE to listen to me, no matter vhat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a gleam in his eye as he came to this conclusion, his hands tightening into fists. \"So be it! I must throw myself into my training harder zhen ever! I will bulk myself up until Italy and Japan are quaking in fear at my very presence! Vhen I say jump, zhey will say how high!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so excited, he didn't realize how loudly his deep voice was echoing through the house. His study door opened a crack and Italy stuck his head in, sleepily rubbing his eyes. \"Hey, Germany? Why are you being a so loud? Come back to bed, ah? Pleeeeease? I'm a so cold in there all by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany sighed and walked over to Italy, ruffling his hair. He was feeling more calmly now that he had a plan of action, not to mention how tired he felt. \"Ja, ja, Italy, I'm done. Let's go to bed.\" He had long since stopped fighting the fact that Italy slept with him. No matter what he did, the little nation was always in his bed in the morning. It was pointless to fight it. When they got back to Germany's room, Italy immediately jumped into bed, pulling the covers back for Germany. Germany slipped in and sighed, closing his eyes. Italy immediately snuggled up close to him, wrapping his thin arms around Germany's more burly body, rubbing his face against the side of Germany's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a so much better~ How are you so bulgy and yet so soft Germany?~\" He asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never mind zhat Italy. Just go to sleep, alright?\" Germany mumbled, already half asleep himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nItaly nodded and did so, both men soon fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Thankfully with Italy in his arms, Germany didn't get woken up by Rome. It was annoying to have someone cling to you at all hours of the night, but if it meant not having to lose sleep over having some ghost trying to molest you, it was sometimes worth the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany woke up the next morning, trying to shake off that morning grogginess as fast as he could. He got himself a hot cup of black coffee and started sipping it down quickly. It was hot, but nothing a powerful German couldn't take! He finished it as fast as he could, trying to imagine all the exercises he could pull off to try to get even buffer than he already was! Germany was determined to get big, and get big as fast as he could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Now that he thought about it, how did Rome get so big all of a sudden? There had to have been some way for an old man like that to get so massive so quick...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... N-Nein! His is just und apparition!\" Germany assured himself as he shook his head! \"Of course he got so huge so quick, he just has to imagine it!\" Germany nodded to himself as he made his way to his basement where he had some old weights and a weight bench. Heading down, dressed in nothing more than black tanktop and cameo pants, he was getting himself psyched up, imagining his future as the biggest, most hulking nation of them all! Commanding power that no other living nation could ever have!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany got to his basement, and started looking around, \"Ah, here zey are.\" He said to himself as he picked up some old free weights. \"Vell, better get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany immediately began doing bicep curls, watching himself in his wall mirror as he went! \"I'll be huge! Beyond huge! Zhose puny nations von't even know how to handle me!\" He smiled a little, watching as his biceps were already starting to swell. The veins slowly started to rise up against his skin, the every little striated muscle visible as he pushed himself! It didn't take long for him to start working up a sweat, which beaded down his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany stopped after a few minutes, setting the weights down as gasping softly. \"Ja... Not bad... Not bad...\" He said to himself, looking at himself in the mirror. \"Hmph, I sink I'm getting bigger already!\" He stood straight up, flexing his biceps! He was sure they looked even bigger than when he started! The bulging muscles throbbed slightly as he held them in this position, making the beefy nation grin. He smirked as he then said, \"Maybe I should vork on mein legs before I start working on zhe pecs...\" He mumbled. Grabbing his weights and resting them on his shoulders, he then started to do squats! Hunching down and flexing his tight thighs and muscled ass outward with every rep he did. He grinned, going again and again! \"Oh ja! Zhat feels good!\" He said with a grin, feeling the burn in his muscles. It was fantastic! In his mind, he felt like he was getting bigger with every squat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was about ten minutes this time, before Germany dropped the weights and fell back on his ass! \"M-Mein Gott... Zhat... Ahhh...\" He groaned, taking a breather~ \"Hm... I should have brought und canteen...\" He thought as he looked down. He then sat back up and walked over to his weight bench where he could move onto working his pecs. He looked into the mirror, feeling a bit more worn down than he was thought he'd be. Then again, he was working a lot harder than normal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just then that Germany saw Rome in the mirror! He was standing tall, flexing his biceps that bulged up to the size of cantaloupes! He was laughing boisterously as he had the other nations at his feet, on their knees and begging to be kept safe by one so powerful and huge! Germany felt the fire in his belly reignite as he saw this! He wanted to be that man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying on his back, he held the free weights once more and started lifting them to work out his pecs! It was nothing at first, but he kept on going! He wanted to feel that burn, and he wanted to get huge! It wasn't long before the muscles were red, squeezing against each other as he completed a rep! He grunted, pushing harder and harder, wanting that size, that power! He kept going, faster, doing as many as he could before he got tired! And then one more! Germany was sweating bullets. He could smell his own odor in the air, sharp and pungent. It was pure adrenaline and only made him want to work harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours, Germany emerged from his basement with a towel over his shoulder. His basement was steaming warm and smelled of a powerful musk. His muscles were bulging and red! His pecs were barely fitting into his shirt, his nipples poking out of either end! They were going stiff as soon as he stepped out, the air so comparably cold! He got goosebumps, shuddering a little and making his muscles shake. His biceps were the size of a grapeshot after having been pushed so far! Germany groaned a little, deciding to take a little rest on his couch before he would get back into working out! This was turning out to be a lot of work... But Germany was determined to reach his goal!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGermany rested on his couch, sprawled out like some American. He was snapped to as he suddenly heard...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Curse this bloody chalkboard!\" England muttered as he stretched as high as he could, putting the finishing touches on one of the many drawings he habitually drew in the conference room. Usually he stood on a stool to get the top row done but someone had moved it to a different room and he didn't have time to look for it. He let out a sigh, setting the chalk down and dusting his hands...only to notice that he had smudged the lower row of drawings, getting chalk dust all over himself. \"Confound it! I don't have time for this nonsense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe huffed and brushed himself off, irritably grabbing the chalk again to sketch the drawings over again. This wasn't the first time he had been inconvenienced thanks to his size. As the shortest among the Allied Powers it was easy to overlook him. Luckily he always loudly voiced his opinions, making sure that no one ever forgot he was there. \"I'm the second strongest nation besides America! And yet all anyone ever sees when they look at me is a shrimp who drinks tea! That damn frog and that blowhard are the worst of them all!\" England said to himself, slashing through the drawings. \"If I was the one in control I'd have this whole outfit whipped into shape so fast those wankers wouldn't even know what hit them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, his drawings finished, he glared at the little cartoon heads of France and America. He looked over at the drawings of the Axis Powers. Idiot Italy, reclusive Japan, and Germany. He was the only one who had any kind of intimidation factor. He was tall, strong, and strict to the point that even his allies were nervous around him. Now that was respect! \"How does he do it? I'm loud and confident! I'm strict! Why does America not respect me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved over to the opposite side of the chalkboard and started aimlessly doodling. \"Let's see...What does Germany look like? Tall...strong...hmm...\" England drew America and France chibi sized next to a normal sized Germany. They looked up at him with fear on their faces. England erased Germany's head and drew his own in its place, a confident and arrogant expression firmly in place. \"That's it!\" England shouted happily, tossing the chalk down. \"I need to be taller and stronger! Than they'll finally learn some respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly erased the drawing to make sure no one would be wise to his plan and dashed out the door. He always came into the conference room early to draw on the chalkboard so he had plenty of time before the meeting actually began. He ran all the way back to his house and and ran upstairs to his room. He skidded to a halt in front of his book case and looked over his shoulder before pulling one halfway out. With a loud clunking sound, the mechanism in the bookcase activated, swinging the heavy oak case forward. England walked through the opening, closing the bookcase behind him, walking carefully down a flight of stone stairs. \"Now, I could work out diligently for hours every day until I'm ripped like Germany but not only would that take too long, I would still be as short as I am. No, there's only one way to get what I want, fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kicked open a door at the bottom of the stairs and threw his arms out to his sides. \"Black magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing darkly to himself, England quickly pulled on his robe and moved over to a large table. On top of it was a thick leather bound book, a cauldron, and several strange items including a dark crystal, a brown skull, and a silver hand mirror inscribed with strange runes. England flipped the book open and started turning the pages rapidly. \"There's got to be something in here...I just have to find it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book was over a thousand pages long, with no table of contents, every spell, potion, charm, and curse randomly ordered. If the book didn't want him to find a certain spell, he wouldn't be able to find it. \"Come on...I need something to make me grow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next page England turned, he saw the heading \"Growth: By Potion or Spell\". \"Aha! Perfect!\" England said with glee, running his finger down the page. \"Let's see...well, this seems simple enough. Why have I never tried this before? Hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly set about getting the ingredients down for a growth potion. His spells had been...less than perfect in a lot of cases (mostly relating to Russia) so he was trying his luck with a potion this time. In about half an hour, the potion was bubbling in the cauldron. With a flourish, England pulled the spoon out and held up a flask, tipping the cauldron so the thick green liquid poured into a flask. \"At last! Now I'll finally get some respect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEngland poured the potion into a tea cup, filling it to the brim. \"Niceties must be observed. It IS almost teatime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stripped the robe off and, with one arm behind his back, his posture erect, he sipped the potion. It actually tasted not unlike his usual cup of tea! He was quickly able to finish it off, draining the cup in a few minutes. He set the cup down and stood in front of his full length mirror, his hands on his hips. He waited...and waited...and waited...and nothing! \"Damn! Just another dud! I should burn that bloody book!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe irritably kicked a small stool over, heading back upstairs. He had a meeting to get to after all. He was the first one there, again, so he took his seat at the conference table and folded his hands, glaring at the wall. He wasn't going to let America get away with a single thing in the meeting today! Little did England know, the potion had actually worked perfectly! The growth was only triggered by a specific action, making him grow bigger every time it happened. The angrier he got, the more he would grow! Already his body was slowly starting to change as he fumed in his seat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was very late at night, and Yoshimori had just finished a shower. Working as a kekkaishi at night, not to mention when you got ayakashi entrails all over you, really left you a mess. As Yoshimori stood in front of the half-steamed mirror, he grinned at himself. For always being called average, he still had confidence! Although, as his eyes wandered down a little, his grin broke a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe the steam was playing tricks on his eyes, but it almost looked like he had got a little flab around the waist lately... \"Man, I really gotta cut back on the cakes...\" Yoshimori mumbled to himself. He stretchd upward, his arms over his head. \"But I can't just quit my passion! Baking is so much fun!\" He chuckled. \"Guess it couldn't hurt to just give the cakes away instead of eating them though...\" Yoshimori kept going back and forth with himself, trying to decide what was best for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a vigorous towling on his hair, he slipped into some pajamas, and headed up for his bedroom. After getting his bed out, and setting his alarm for school the next morning, and laid his head back on his pillow. His weight issue was easily the first thing on his mind. While it wasn't a huge issue, it was best to catch it now while he still could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't hurt to work out a little more...\" Yoshimori thought as he laid in his bed. \"I'm always practicing my kekkai, but I don't really do much with my body...\" Yoshimori turned onto his side, looking out the window. \"It'd be nice if there was a way to lose this weight faster...\" Yoshimori's eyes then sprung wide open as he sat up in his bed. \"Wait, I think we had a scroll in the shed about this...\" The young Kekkaishi then reached into his desk and got a small flashlight, before heading out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori opened the front door quietly, and ran over to the shed. In doing so, he ended up waking Madarao, who sleepily looked around, trying to find out what was making the noise. As he spotted Yoshimori, he floated over, not consciously knowing who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little muscle, Yoshimori pulled open the door to the shed and clicked on his tiny flashlight. With a smile on his face, he wandered right on in, and behind him, Madarao.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yoshimori shuffled through the dusty scolls, Madarao snuck right up behind him. \"What are you doing...?\" The dog asked sleepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori let out a loud yelp as he sprang forward into a pile of scrolls. \"Wh-What the... Madarao!\" He shouted, pointing at the ghost dog. \"What are you doing here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could ask you the same thing you know...\" Madarao replied, yawning as he kept one eye open on Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" Before Yoshimori could utter another word, a scroll konked him on his head from above. \"Ow!\" Yoshimori grit his teeth unhappily as he grabbed ahold of the scroll. He searched for his tiny flashlight, which he had dropped, and began to look over the scroll. He grinned happily. \"Hey, this is it! The scoll to transmute human matter!\" Yoshimori chuckled. He dashed passed the sleepy Madarao outside to the front lawn where he could have the help of the full moon to read the scroll. Madarao followed out shortly after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori was laughing quietly to himself as he read the scroll. Some of the parts of it were faded and unreadable, but he got the general idea! He started to draw a pattern in the front lawn using the handle end of the flashlight as a temporary trowel. Madarao fluttered and looked over Yoshimori's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You know, there was something about this that didn't quite work...\" Madarao mumbled, \"But I don't remember what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! I just wanna lose this weight!\" Yoshimori snapped right back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight?\" Madarao looked Yoshimori over, \"But you look just fine, I don't see any weight problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't worry about it!\" Yoshimori replied, \"I know what I'm doing!\" Madarao looked at Yoshimori, seeing the determination in his eyes. Madarao shrugged, not thinking much more on the subject. If he wanted to do this, it was his choice. The dog was just wishing he could remember why this spell wasn't a good idea in the first place... He was still so drowsy from working today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori stepped into the center of the symbol, as the instructions read. \"Alright! Now I just create a kekkai...\" In mere seconds, a blue kekkai formed around Yoshimori. Gradually, it turned from it's blue color to purple, then red! Yoshimori smiled as he looked around. \"Hey! It's working! Madarao! It's working!\" Yoshimori laughed. Eventually the kekkai turned from red to purple and then back to blue. Yoshimori lowered the kekkai, and lifted his shirt. To his dismay, the flab remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, I must not have done it right!\" He growled unhappily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Yoshimori, go back to bed...\" Madarao complained, inching back tword his dog house. Yoshimori just yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I guess I should sleep...\" He agreed weakly. He dragged his feet along the ground to hide that he had done anything, before carelessly tossing the scroll back into the shed, and closing the door. With one final yawn, he made his way back inside his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori would be in for a big surprise tomorrow to find...</span></div></div>",

As the young man rubbed his eyes, he grabbed his towel and made his way to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his clothes in a pile in the corner, Yoshimori began to run the water for a shower. The steam was quickly starting to fill up the room, and Yoshimori hopped right in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hot! Hot!\" He shouted out, his voice echoing in the small room, before his body quickly adapted. The bar of soap washed over his body, leaving a trail of suds. Once his rinsing was done, he made sure to get his hair all cleaned up as well! Once he was out of the shower, Yoshimori stretched a little before quicky drying himself off. He made his way over to the sink to brush his teeth, and then he'd head out to get breakfast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori was in for a surprise! As he wiped the steam from the mirror, a sharp gasp shot out of his lungs. He looked down to see if what he saw in the mirror was right. He had abs!? Yoshimori ran his hand down his once slightly soft stomach. Sure enough, they were there! A hard, wavy six-pack! Yoshimori got a big smile on his face! And it wasn't just his stomach that had lost the weight! Yoshimori's chest seemed to be just a little bit more ample. His arms, which he then flexed, had a nice, egg-shaped muscle on them! His thighs looked more sleek, and his calves felt a little more powerful! Any other changed that might have went through his body were a bit too small to be noticed right now, but Yoshimori was happy with what he got! Kids at his school could only <i>dream</i> of having the body he had!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori had a big smile on his face as he walked out of the bathroom. Fetching a fresh, new uniform, Yoshimori's mood only seemed to elevate as he noticed the uniform felt just a little snug in some places!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes, Yoshimori was out the door, and heading for school! Little did he know, every step he was taking, every little bit of activity he put his body through, was making him even stronger! His young pecs pushed out just a little bit further. His taut abs deepened and became more defined. His once cute little biceps were slowly on their way to becoming big, brawny guns! His thighs were starting to plump up, and his cut calves were growing in size as well! Yoshimori's feet had begun to grow, not to mention his tight ass began to swell out a little as well! His back stretched out a little further, and on top of it all, his manhood got just a little bit thicker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, today was going to prove to be an eventful day indeed for the young kekkaishi.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was amazing what a little size did for Yoshimori's confidence. He was standing up straight, strutting around the school like he was ten feet tall rather than just a few inches taller than before. His classmates noticed but no one complimented him on his improved physique. This deflated Yoshimori's confidence only slightly. It was unrealistic to think that everyone in his class, who had always ignored him, would notice such slight changes. \"I'll just have to do something to get them to notice...\" Yoshimori thought to himself, sitting at his desk, his head resting on his arms. Unfortunately, he couldn't think of anything he could do before the teacher came in. He cursed slightly under his breath. \"Well...at least I have P.E. today! I'll show everyone just how different I am then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did he know, just how right he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day seemed to move by incredibly slowly. Yoshimori was too anxious to even sleep! He kept glancing at the clock, willing it to move faster! Finally, after what felt like hours, the bell ran, signalling P.E. Yoshimori sprang up from his seat and dashed down to the gym. He was the first one in there, changing as quickly as possible into his gym clothes. He was waiting in the gym for class to start before the majority of the class had even reached the gym. He stood off to the side, crossing his arms. About five minutes later, the rest of the class filed into the gym. The dark haired kekkaishi started noticing a few of his classmates giving him second glances. He grinned as he put his hands on his hips, flexing his arms slightly, trying to stick his chest out. The teacher came soon after that, holding a clipboard in his hand. \"Alright everyone! Gather around! We're going to be doing a fitness test today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the class groaned as they heard this news. Fitness tests were always a pain in the ass. There was nothing duller than doing push ups and sit ups and shuttle runs for an hour. Yoshimori was the only one who wasn't bothered. His grin hadn't left his face! This was the perfect chance to show off his new body! The class was divided into groups, about four people to a group. Each group was then assigned a task to test for. Yoshimori's group was doing sit ups first. Yoshimori eagerly laid down on the ground, a boy he didn't exactly recognize from his class holding his feet. The teacher waited until everyone was ready and then blew his whistle to signal the start of the test!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori took off, his body moving fluidly as he sat up and then laid back down, his abs crunching and rising with every movement! The boy holding Yoshimori's feet shook his head slightly as he watched Yoshimori work out. He could have sworn he saw Yoshimori's abs slowly become more visible under his shirt, the hem pulling up just slightly, showing a strip of skin between the bottom of his shirt and the waistband of his pants. The teacher blew his whistle again after Yoshimori had done over one hundred sit ups! He jumped up, still energized, not a single drop of sweat visible anywhere on his body! The boy looked closer and saw that, yes, it appeared that Yoshimori's abs were now perfectly visible against the material of his shirt! The boy slowly stood up and did a double take a second time when he saw that Yoshimori looked taller, the tips of his spiky hair reaching the boy's chest now. He closed his eyes and too a deep breath, touching his forehead. Maybe he was coming down with something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter everyone had finished, the group switched to a new station, this one being push ups. Yoshimori positioned himself on the mat and the boy quickly took a spot next to him, eager to see if Yoshimori would change again. This was just too weird...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher blew his whistle again and Yoshimori swiftly began doing push ups, his biceps bulging with every downward movement while his chest pushed out just a bit further. The boy watched in amazement as he could <i>see</i> Yoshimori's shirt grow tighter around his pecs while his arms filled his sleeves. The boy ended up losing concentration and crashing to the mat, sitting off to the side to continue watching Yoshimori. The teenage kekkaishi could feel his classmate's eyes on him and he grinned, picking up the pace. He was the only one to keep up the exercise all the way until the teacher blew the whistle again. When he stood back up, the boy's eyes widened as he saw that Yoshimori's shirt was skin tight on him, every bulge and curve of muscle standing out in sharp relief, the sleeves of his shirt filled to bursting with the baseball sized muscle stuffed inside it! Yoshimori casually turned to the side and flexed his arm, pretending to scratch the back of his head, his bicep bulging up even further! The boy could swear he heard a soft tearing sound coming from the sleeve...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori drank in the attention, loving how his classmates were finally starting to pay attention to him! Even he was impressed by how big he looked! In fact...was he this big this morning? Yoshimori wasn't exactly sure...but if he WAS still growing he wasn't about to start complaining!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they moved on to the next fitness test...</span></div></div>",

At first, Yoshimori had hoped it would be his shirt, but alas, it was his pants... In the back, no less! As Yoshimori covered his behind, a flushed look on his face, all his classmates were looking at him. He gulped, waiting. He knew it was going to happen. He knew in mere seconds they'd erupt into a roar of laughter. He'd be the mockery of the school for the next few weeks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yoshimori peeped an eye open, he looked around. No one was laughing... In fact... It almost seemed like everyone was blushing! All the guys in the class were red, but behind that they were green with envy. Yoshimori was truly something to be admired! And that's exactly what all the girls thought! A tear in Yoshimori's pants? That was like a dream! Anything to see this hunked up kekkaishi's ass! Yoshimori just gulped as he looked around, but finally let his guard down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna... Go change...\" He announced. Still, no one said a word. Making a bee line for the locker room, Yoshimori left his classmates speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Yoshimori had just arrived at his locker, and was undoing the combination. Part of his was embarassed... But part of him loved how in that very instant, all eyes were on him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yoshimori began to change his pants, he immediately noticed how much closer his pecs came to his chin! Not to mention that his shirt was now riding up higher than it was this morning! Immediately, Yoshimori removed his shirt and pants, looking over himself. He couldn't believe his eyes! Just to be sure, Yoshimori ran over to the sink and splashed a little cool water in his face before looking up at the mirror. This body was for real! Slowly, a grin crept up on Yoshimori's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I can't believe this!\" Yoshimori said, running his hands down his body. His pecs felt deeper, his abs were cut, his tree trunk thighs, and powerful arms... All of it was for real! \"Heh...\" Yoshimori grinned, and flexed both of his arms. They shot up in unison, forming two thick, juicy pair of bulging muscles. Yoshimori set his hands on his hips and gave his pecs a flex, enjoying the feel of the muscle bouncing up and down at his command! His abs were like a wall of bricks, and just as hard when he flexed them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget barriers! I could just beat up ayakashi from now on!\" Yoshimori thought arrogantly. \"Just look at these pecs...\" Yoshimor bounced the glorious, heavy muscles once more, chuckling at how big he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yoshimori stood there, he kept posing in the mirror. He loved the sight of every muscle rising and bulging out, the unqeustionable power they held within! Every inch of him, from his huge traps to his rippling back and tight ass! His large, heavy feet, his rippling thighs and calves, burly pecs and hulked out arms, all this massive, heavy muscle shoved onto his somewhat shorter frame. Not an inch of him wasn't covered in beautiful, beefy muscle! And not a soul would dare question him ever again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori stood there, panting slightly. He had actually broken a sweat from just flexing there! But as he did, he realized something...</span></div></div>",

It was early in the morning and he was making his way to school as usual, his stoic expression firmly in place on his face. He had been going to the same school as Yoshimori for a few months now and had fallen into a standard routine. Every morning he woke up early, got dressed, ate breakfast, finished his morning ablutions, and then walked to school, giving himself about fifteen to twenty minutes to walk at his leisure before class actually began. This system worked for him and nothing had ever changed, even slightly, to make him late for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about two hundred feet from the school building when a voice suddenly called out to him. \"Hey! You there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen stopped and looked down an alleyway, his expression unchanging. There was a teenage boy standing there, short and with a worried expression on his face. His hair was long and unkempt, his clothes dirty and tattered and his feet completely bare. Gen was about to walk on without saying anything, not wanting to deal with some random vagrant, when the boy shouted out again, \"Hey! You can see me! Awesome! Come over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen sighed and walked a few feet closer, still keeping a bit of distance from him. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, you have no idea how long I've been waiting for someone to be able to see me! The last person I talked to was this old dude who told me to visit someone called Mother-san or something but I couldn't find her anywhere!\" The boy's voice was slightly raspy. Gen noticed a rather nasty scar running across the base of his neck, mostly concealed by the boy's shirt collar. \"Anyway, I...I think I'm dead! But...but there's something coming after me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen's eye twitched slightly. Something that was coming after him? \"What did this something look like?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy tilted his head and crossed his arms, thinking about it. \"Looked like? Well, it looked kind of like a kid...a boy with spiky red hair but he had wings coming out of his back. Oh! And a little forked tail! He was...about this tall.\" He held his hand about three or four feet off the ground. \"His eyes were a darker reddish brown and he was wearing a pair of sandals that laced up to his knees and a pair of shorts and a kind of gi top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Why exactly does this boy scare you?\" Gen asked. \"He doesn't sound like any kind of threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shook his head and said, \"No way! He's really scary! When he looks at you, you get this feeling like he's going to eat you! It's really super scary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen was about to respond, when he saw something dart across the alley way in the background. He ran through the ghost, causing him to yelp slightly, before getting into a fighting position, his hands turning into his ayakashi claws. The ghost yelped as he saw a small boy step out of the shadows, flying away as fast as he could go, disappearing into the distance. The boy frowned before crossing his arms and looking at Gen with a pout. \"You scared away my toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was that of a normal boy, but his looks were clearly those of an ayakashi. Gen sniffed the air lightly, just to be sure, and caught the unmistakable scent of an ayakashi. \"Who are you? What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stuck his tongue out and said, \"I don't have to talk to you! You're mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen frowned and dashed forward, clawing at the boy. He quickly dodged and Gen succeeded only in ripping the ayakashi's gi. The ayakashi looked down at his shirt in surprise before glaring at Gen. \"You jerk! You're going to be my toy now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, his eyes began to glow and raised up one of his hands. Gen charged forward again, but the boy was prepared this time, flapping his wings and jumping into the sky. The tip of his wings eventually left the shadows of the alley and the full light of the sun shone on them. Instantly they were burned, causing the young ayakashi to fall back to the ground, crashing into some garbage cans.He groaned but before he could move, Gen was upon him, grabbing him by the collar and hoisting him out of the strewn trash. Without so much as a word, Gen was about to slice the ayakashi to pieces when the boy sank his fangs into Gen's hand. The bite itself didn't hurt too badly, but a searing heat accompanied the piercing fangs, spreading swiftly through Gen's body. He dropped the ayakashi, wincing as he felt his body suddenly burning up. The ayakashi child snickered and melted into the shadows, his glowing eyes the only things that remained. \"That'll tech ya! Let's see you get along like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen barely heard the words and didn't see as the boy melted away fully into the shadows. His concentration was taken up by the incredible pain that was throbbing inside him. There had been some kind of strange poison in the ayakashi's bite and it was slowly coursing through his body. This wasn't a deadly poison, however. The boy wasn't sure how it would end up effecting Gen, since the changes were always random. As Gen collapsed to the ground, writhing in pain, he was barely aware as</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By the time Gen came to, everything was dark. He could hear noises... Even someone talking, but he was still encased in darkness, as far as he could see. However, one thing struck him as strange: It was very warm, where ever he was... Feeling around, everything was soft... Like cloth. Just then, there was a shimmer of light from above! Gen looked up, and after a brief moment, it shone out again! He covered his eyes in recoil, but got a grip on the cloth, and started to climb up it. As he peeked out over the edge, he saw something that really shocked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was massive! The walls that were once simple obstacles now stood hundreds of feet tall! Regular houses were like mansions to him now! As he looked around frantically, a loud voice shook his eardrums!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're awake!\" It called out. Gen immediately covered his ears, and started to look upward. He was shocked when he saw who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoshimori!?\" He said in a sudden grunt. \"How did you get so huge?!\" He demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? How did YOU get so small?!\" Yoshimori demanded to know in return. It took Gen a moment to realize how stupid his question was. Of course he was small, here he was, poking out of Yoshimori's school uniform's shirt pocket, and glancing all around at the world as if it was his first time seeing it... It would make more sense if he was the small one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was this ayakashi...\" Gen started. \"And this kid... Ugh... Who was it...?\" Gen rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ayakashi, huh? Never knew they could do this to you.\" Yoshimori said, poking Gen lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Gen barked back, \"I'm not some toy!\" For some reason, those words resonated with his memories...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori just chuckled. \"Of course you're not.\" He kept on walking, a silly smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment, but Gen finally asked. \"Where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading home. School's over.\" Yoshimori answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"School's over!?\" Gen shouted in surprise, \"How long was I out!?\" Yoshimori just shrugged in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, I was walking home and I thought I saw a weird looking bug. When I walked over and looked, it was you! So I just put you in my pocket and started heading home.\" Yoshimori answered. \"You looked tired, and this was kinda weird, so I decided it would have been better to just let you sleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okaaaay...\" Gen agreed suspiciously. He didn't even know what was going on with this whole ordeal. However, neither of them were able to sense the mean-spirited little ayakashi hovering above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, this is fun already!\" He smiled to himself, \"I didn't think that other kid would find him! Maybe I could make him my new toy too...?\" He asked himself. Easily able to hide his own presence, which was abnormal for such a young looking ayakashi, fluttered down and silently follwed closely behind Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll make you...\"</span></div></div>",

Just like your friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ayakashi imp knew that his poison could create random effects in humans and other ayakashi since he had bitten several over his life and each time something different had happened. However, once he saw the effect occur to a living creature, he could concentrate and force the poison to have that same effect again! This was now the case as he swooped down lower above Yoshimori, timing his movements so that he was always within shadow, until he was right next to the young kekkaishi's feet. As Yoshimori walked under a tree, the ayakashi reared out of the shadows and bit him on the leg, his fangs piercing through the fabric of his pants before sinking into his leg. Yoshimori let out a yelp, jumping backward as he looked wildly around at his feet. Gen was tossed unceremoniously around inside the pocket, nearly falling out as Yoshimori jerked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" He shouted in annoyance, glaring up at his giant friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something bit me!\" Yoshimori snarled, looking around at his feet for any sign of a bug or animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen sighed and was about to admonish Yoshimori when the teen suddenly stopped moving and fell to his knees, clutching his arms as he did so. \"A-Argh! It burns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen's eyes widened as he realized what had just happened. \"Dammit! That ayakashi is still around here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori fell onto his side, his body twitching lightly as he lost consciousness. Gen jumped out of his pocket, landing nimbly on his feet. He looked up and saw the ayakashi leaning casually against a tree, the shade protecting him from the sun's harmful rays. \"You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me!\" The ayakashi said, standing up straight, hands on his hips. \"You humans really are dumb! You can't even detect a little kid when he's right behind you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gen could reply, Yoshimori let out a moan, his body quickly shrinking. Gen watched in horror as his friend was soon just as small as he was...no wait...he was a little smaller. Their heights were now proportional to each other as when they were normal sized. Yoshimori had clearly passed out. The young ayakashi laughed and slowly made his way over to them, his bare feet slapping carelessly against the concrete side walk. Thinking fast, Gen picked up Yoshimori in a fireman's lift and ran for the edge of the shadow. If he could get out into the light the ayakashi wouldn't be able to touch them! The ayakashi rolled his eyes and said, \"Wow! And now you're trying to run away from me? How far do you think you're going to get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen, a determined look on his face, kept moving. If he could only make it just a few more feet, they'd be safe! The ayakashi had no idea what Gen was trying to do and was following close behind, giggling as his giant feet just barely missed stepping on the tiny half human. His fun was quickly cut short, however, as Gen made it out into the light. The ayakashi's eyes widened as he realized he had been tricked and glared hatefully at Gen who merely stared impassively back. \"That's cheating! I'm going to get you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen shrugged and set Yoshimori down, crouching next to him to catch his breath. The newly shrunken teen could be out for over eight hours, if Gen's experience was anything to judge by. The ayakashi looked up at the sun and smirked. \"Heh, sun's going down you know! You won't be able to stay out of the dark forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen looked up at the sky. True, the sun was slowly starting to get lower, but he still had a few hours before it fully set. If he could find someone trustworthy to guard them in that time, they'd be home free. Otherwise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ayakashi cracked his knuckles, slowly sinking back down into the shadows. Every bit of darkness that Gen could see was a potential trap. It would only take one single misstep and he would be condemning both Yoshimori and himself to a terrible fate. He hoisted Yoshimori back onto his shoulders and started making his way down the sidewalk, skirting every bit of shadow and staying in the hot sun. Sweat was soon beading on his forehead, his vision growing blearier as he moved with his burden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting tired? Don't worry! Soon you'll be able to rest. Then I'll be able to play with you!\" The ayakashi's voice whispered from the shadows, but Gen couldn't see him. The only reason the creature had said anything was to let Gen know that he was still there, still watching, and still waiting. Gen glanced up at the sky again. He was running out of time...</span></div></div>",

Not to mention he was practically stopped at one point by an ant, which to him, was practically the size of a small dog to him! Only halfway home, Gen had unzipped his shirt, hoping the extra cool air would allow him to travel faster. It held up for a good while, before he was just plan fatigued. His body wasn't going to hold up much longer! On a sunny part of the sidewalk, Gen collapsed, panting and sweating endlessly. There was a dark snicker from the shadows, as the sun was already starting to set. Gen practically let out a whimper as he saw all the darkness encroaching all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" Yoshimori moaned, lifting his head. \"What happened...?\" Gen was still panting, but before he could give Yoshimori an answer, the two of them were suddenly snatched up in a large hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!\" He laughed wildly, \"I got you guys now!\" Gen looked up at the kid with fear, which was abnormal for him, but he knew that at this size, his life was in the hands of some mere child ayakashi. Yoshimori was still yawning, rubbing his eyes. \"And now I have TWO toys!\" He said with a wide grin. His teeth were sharp. Maybe not razor sharp, like a shark, but still pretty sharp. They were pearly white, like crystal gems that shone in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the heck is this thing!?\" Yoshimori shouted, pointing up at the kid as he finally realized what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're gonna play a game!\" He said, his eerie smile still shining through. \"It's called...\" The boy then dropped them onto the ground below. They weren't high enough to die, but they did get a few bruises from the fall. \"Run for your life!\" The kid then stomped his foot hard on the ground. He was at least nice enough to let the two get to their feet, and even gave them a head start. It wouldn't have been fun otherwise! Yoshimori would have argued the point, but at this size, his opinion didn't exactly stand for much... As the two began to run, Gen was already tired out, and falling behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Gen!\" Yoshimori called back, dragging his wrist. \"Come on! That thing's gonna kill us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't! I'm already tired out from dragging you everywhere!\" Gen argued. Yoshimori sighed. He grabbed and held Gen over his shoulder as Gen did with him. He wasn't quite as muscular as Gen was, but he still managed to go at a decent speed. It was at this time the ayakashi ran out of patience, and slowly began to stomp to them. He enjoyed every second, how his feet must have made the ground shake under those boys' feet. He loved how he was feeling so big and mighty over the weak and pathetic bugs down below. It wasn't hard for him to catch up to the two!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori then had an idea. He turned around, looking at the giant ayakashi. \"Hoi! Joso! Ketsu!\" A large green barrier, which was only about the size of a baseball to the giant, appeared on his arm. It managed to hold him in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell is this!?\" He asked, banging on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Metsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the box imploded, but there was little sound other than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" The giant looked at his arm. It was completely unharmed! \"Oh!\" He laughed triumphantly, \"I get it now! You're that kekkaishi kid! But a tiny bug's magic like you can't hurt a big strong person like me!\" He grinned, hooking his thumb at himself. With that, the chase continued, Yoshimori just barely rounding a corner to see where he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap...\" Yoshimori mumbled under his breath. He had led the ayakashi right to...</span></div></div>",

Before he could even round the corner to change direction, a giant foot stomped down right in front of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found you! Now I got you!\" The ayakashi boy said, bending over, just about to pick Yoshimori and Gen up, when Yoshimori cast another kekkai to buy time for the two. Yoshimori held onto Gen, who was heavier than he was, and Yoshimori didn't exactly have the same muscle mass Gen did. Still, the adrenaline rush helped get Yoshimori and Gen out of there in time. The ayakashi boy just smiled, and stomped down on the box, grinning to himself as he did. \"You see what happened to that blue thing? Well you're next!\" He said, his stomps becoming noticeably harder, and thus, throwing Yoshimori off his balance with every step he took!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the ayakashi stopped dead in his tracks. Yoshimori, looking back for only a second, started to run off again, taking advantage of this time to put some distance between the two of them! The ayakashi, however, wasn't in pain... No, quite the opposite. He was smiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place...!?\" He asked, his voice now a much more darker tone, \"I feel... Power! Lots of it! I feel... Strong!\" He grinned. He looked to his arms, and was amazed at they thickened up, bulking to an immediate immense size. His pecs pressed out against the gi he wore, swelling up large and powerful until it looked like a basketball had been sliced in half and pressed on his young chest. They bounces and shook with the slightest of movements! An impressive wall of abs hardened just under his shelf-like pecs, even bloating out a little, giving him a bit of a muscle gut. His thighs pressed outward, just short of rubbing up against the others bulging size. His calves beefed up, becoming the two pillars that supported his massive frame, as even his feet, down to the toes were starting to stretch outward, snapping the straw barring of his sandals, leaving his feel huge and free. His voice got a little bit deeper with all this mass, and to top it off, he got a nice little bubble butt, as well as an enhanced boyhood!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ayakashi let out a primal roar, beating on his massive chest like an ape. He let out a heavy breath, grinning all the while. \"Heh heh... I knew I was amazing before, but now I'm unstoppable!\" He flexed his two, huge arms, a large vein running down both. \"I'll crush both of you under my giant muscles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Yoshimori grumbled, looking back at the improved, stronger ayakashi. In addition to all that mass, there was no telling what he was capable of now! And the longer he stayed on the school grounds, he would just keep getting stronger and stronger! The ayakashi turned his nose to the sky, and started to sniff about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! I found you guys!\" He said, following the trail. All this running had left Yoshimori a sweaty mess... It was only a matter of time before he was found! Then there was no telling what could happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

He instantly dropped Gen and fell onto his butt, letting out a little yelp as he hit the hard ground. Gen let out a little grunt as well, though he was still too worn out to move on his own. Yoshimori gazed up at the towering ayakashi in front of him, the clothes clinging to his body like a second skin, leaving no inch of his chiseled physique to the imagination. The young creature just grinned and moved his foot closer to Yoshimori, his toes pressing up against the tiny teen. With a simple flexing movement, Yoshimori was pinned underneath the big toe, the thick digit easily able to hold him in place. \"It would be so easy to crush you into paste right now!\" he said with a snicker. \"But that would be a waste of toys! I don't know if I'll get the chance to find any more interesting toys like you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori groaned, but his arms felt like noodles. He tried a few times to push against the toe but it was useless. There was nothing he could do. He was completely at the mercy of this child demon. \"What are you going to do to us?\" Yoshimori asked, trying to buy some time while he thought up a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...That's a good question!\" the ayakashi replied. \"I was planning on taking you back to my home with me but I really like the feel of this place. It's like something is filling me with energy! Making me stronger! So I think I'll just stick around here for awhile. The night is young after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bounced his pecs arrogantly before leaning down and snatching Yoshimori and Gen up in his hand. \"I got some new powers too! Here, I'll show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his index finger, hard, until blood started to bead from it. He held the finger over Gen's face and gently pressed the drop of blood against the unconscious boy's lips. Gen, instinctively, started to suck on the blood, drawing it into his mouth and swallowing it. \"Hey!\" Yoshimori shouted. \"What the hell are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just shut up and watch!\" the ayakashi said, sucking on his finger to stop the blood flow. Almost immediately the cut healed itself. He grinned and muttered, \"MAN this place is cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori watched, concern etched on his face as Gen shivered and convulsed, his body pulsing all over! Within seconds a change began to make itself apparent over his body. Yoshimori's eyes widened as Gen swelled up bigger, his height increasing, inch by inch, until he was at least twice Yoshimori's tiny size! Not only that, but his already muscled body had bulked up considerably, straining his school uniform by a significant amount! The young ayakashi laughed and said, \"Every fluid in my body now has a different effect! My blood makes others grow! But it also changes them, makes them more primal! Your friend won't be your friend much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori looked over in concern at Gen who was now sleeping more peacefully. The growth appeared to have recharged his body, taking away the aches and pains of his ordeal from earlier. Yoshimori couldn't help but feel slightly jealous at this turn of events. Gen, usually a very imposing individual with his dark expression and aloof manner, looked even more intimidating now that he was towering over him! \"Gen is stronger than this jerk ayakashi gives him credit for! There's no way he'll be any different!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts were interrupted as the young ayakashi let out a moan. \"Oh man...There's that feeling again! I..think I'm...growing again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori watched in horror as the ayakashi's body slowly began to stretch taller, his muscles all growing in proportion to his height. His gi top tore down the center slightly while the hem tugged up and pulled tight around his midsection, showing off the lower row of his abs. He no longer had the height of a child but that of a young adult! The ayakashi chuckled and checked himself out. \"This is awesome! I'm going to get HUGE and teach those jerks back home a lesson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori gulped, his problems going from bad to worse. Before he even had time to deal with this new chain of events, Gen started to groan as well. He was waking up! Now was the moment of truth! Would he be the same old Gen Yoshimori knew, or would he be a more primal creature like the ayakashi?</span></div></div>",

While it was true he couldn't do much, he had to at least try! But before he even had the chance, he was tackled to the ground by Gen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnrgh...\" Gen let out a dull growl as he laid on top of Yoshimori. The smaller teen was, of course, trying to push him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen! Get off of me! I'm your friend!\" Yoshimori shouted at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friend...\" Gen repeated in a low growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-That's right!\" Yoshimori agreed. He was starting to hope that this would get through to him, but that was dashed the moment Gen got up and suddenly slammed his elbow into Yoshimori's stomach! Yoshimori coughed, swearing he could feel blood in his mouth. \"Stop it Gen! You could have killed me!\" Yoshimori shouted at him. Gen didn't reply. He jumped up once more, and fell directly on Yoshimori, body slamming him into the ground. Yoshimori gasped again, before starting to cough. \"G-Gen! Stop it!\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen stood up on his feet again. The glare he was giving Yoshimori felt like it could penetrate steel. Gen's fist slowly pulled back, and before he knew it, it was coming right at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ketsu!\" Yoshimori called, pulling up a barrier just in the nick of time. Luckily he caught Gen off guard, and the barrier stood in place, not shattered in the least! Yoshimori winced as he got to his feet. This wasn't looking good for him at all. He was exhausted from running, he had sustained terrible injuries, and to top it off, he felt that if he had to make any more kekkai, he just might collapse here and now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could think any further, Gen charged at him once more, Yoshimori barely able to dodge by jumping to the side at the last minute. Gen immediately pivoted on the spot, and sprang out at Yoshimori, tackling him to the ground. Yoshimori groaned in pain as he hit the cold, hard ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting and tired, he looked up at Gen who had pinned his arms down. Gen's eyes were fierce and steady, as his chest was heaving, pressing out of his uniform slightly. Yoshimori's head tilted upward and he got a view of the ayakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were going from worse to terrible. The ayakashi had grown seveal feet, looking like an adult male on steroids. His massive shoulders ripped the gi to shreds, and his entire upper body, from his massive pecs, rock-hard muscle gut abs, and his thick, juicy arms bulging in every direction. His thighs had bulked up to twice their previous size, not to to mention his calves were like two pillars. His feet were like little walls that were bulldozing any earth that blocked their way. And not that Yoshimori was focusing on it, but he could have swore he saw the mere tip of what he was sure was the largest endowment in all the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori sighed, as he felt a bit of moisture drip from his eyes. \"So this is it for me, huh...?\" He mumbled. \"I never thought it was going to end up like this... Killed by my best friend...\" Yoshimori looked up at Gen again, a permanent frown plastered on his face. \"If I'm going down... I'm going to do what I always wanted to!\" He shouted out. In a final burst of strength, before he was sure he'd black out and be finished by Gen, his arms suddenly broke free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to run slowly for that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori's arms rose up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen let out a noisy, unhappy growl. His arm rose up, ready to strike Yoshimori down...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori's lips met Gen's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen was immediately stopped in his tracks. Yoshimori's arms wrapped around Gen's neck, holding him in place as Yoshimori savored what he was sure would be his final pleasure in this world. For him, this single kiss seemed to last an hour, as he could see his life flashing before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Yoshimori fell back to the ground, his hand stroking Gen's cheek as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen... I...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Yoshimori could finish what he was saying, a bright flash of light suddenly rose over the horizon! The ayakashi yelled out in a much deeper, manlier voice than he had before, his body smoking as the light touched him. For all his strength, he was still an ayakashi, and because of that, he was susceptible to the sunlight! His head whipped around as he tried to find a place he could hide, but thanks to his much larger body and the fact they were in a big open area, there was no shadow close enough for him to reach! With a menacing growl he shouted, \"I'll be back! Don't think you've won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he wrapped his wings around his body and sank into the ground, the crushing aura of his malevolent presence disappearing. Yoshimori sighed, flopping back down on the ground, his eyes closed. The ayakashi was retreating...it was over. They had survived!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey...Gen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly opened his eyes and saw Gen still crouching over him, one hand covering his eyes, a low groan escaping from between his lips. \"G-Gen?\" Yoshimori said softly, afraid of what he might answer back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoshimori?\" Gen's voice replied, just as softly. He moved his hand and looked down at his friend in confusion. \"What...huh? What happened? Why are you smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori chuckled, seeing that Gen was finally back to normal. \"Ah...hahahahaha! You big idiot! I'm not smaller! Look at yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen blinked and looked down at his body. His eyes widened in shock. \"How...did I get so big?! I mean...comparatively.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori sat up, wincing a little as he did. \"That ayakashi made you drink his blood. Apparently it makes things grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...why would he do that?\" Gen wondered out loud, flexing his bicep, his hand running down his chest and abs. \"Seems like a step backwards for what he was doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori shrugged and said, \"Who knows? That guy was a nut!\" He didn't see any reason he should tell Gen what had happened. It would only upset him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen nodded and got to his feet. \"Oh sure...\" He said, noticing his tattered shirt and pants. \"My clothes shrink with me but as soon as I start growing again they tear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori chuckled and said, \"Hey big guy! How about giving me a hand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen reached down and closed his big hand over Yoshimori's, easily lifting him to his feet. As soon as Yoshimori regained his feet, both boys felt a strange, swooping sensation in their stomachs. They looked around in confusion as everything seemed to shrink...they were growing again! They kept up, their clothes growing with them until Yoshimori was back to his normal size. \"Hey! Look at that! We're normal again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned over at Gen...only to see he was face to face with his waist still! He slowly looked up and saw that Gen had surpassed his original height! \"Uh...well, almost normal anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" Gen asked, looking over his body in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I guess since that ayakashi left to go back to his home dimension his poison and stuff is wearing off. But since you got the blood awhile AFTER we both got the poison I guess you're stuck being big for awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen sighed and said, \"That makes sense...not that I like it or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori stretched and put his arms behind his head. \"Anyway, we should probably head home. I think I'm going to take the day off today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori started walking away when Gen ran up to him, shaking the ground as he ran, gripping the smaller boy's shoulder. \"Wait! Yoshimori!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, not so rough!\" Yoshimori complained, pushing Gen's thick fingers off his shoulder. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I don't think we should be alone. That ayakashi might come back after us. We need to be ready for it!\" Gen said, his cheeks flushing just a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You think? Yeah...that does make sense.\" Yoshimori said, nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So come back with me to my place. Okay? We won't have to explain...me if we do.\" Gen said, indicating his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! That makes sense!\" Yoshimori said, feeling his heart beat a little faster. Just...how much did Gen remember? He didn't seem to remember growing and being possessed...but he was acting awfully strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen reached down and grabbed Yoshimori by the collar, tossing him up on his back. \"Hang on. It'll be faster if I carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori's arms wrapped around his friend's thick neck, blushing slightly as he felt Gen's massive arms wrap around his much smaller legs, holding him tightly in place against his broad back. With a slight tensing of his leg muscles, Gen was off like a shot, his bare feet leaving slightly indents in the concrete as he ran. He briefly thought about jumping up to the roofs but doubted his new weight would be supported. Luckily it didn't take him long to reach his apartment. He jumped up onto his floor and crouched down, Yoshimori falling to the ground next to him. Gen looked at his smaller friend and said, \"Can you get my keys? They're in my right pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori reached in, quickly grabbing the keys, blushing as he felt something else right next to it. He dropped the key in Gen's hand and said, \"T-There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen opened the door and stepped to the side, letting Yoshimori go in first. Yoshimori yawned, his eyes feeling heavy. He was ready to just crash! Gen squeezed through the door, his thick chest nearly getting caught in the door frame, and closed it behind him. \"There's some blankets and a futon in the closet if you want to sleep.\" He said, moving into his bedroom...only to find Yoshimori already asleep on his bed. Gen sighed and rubbed the back of his head. The kekkashi just looked too peaceful to disturb...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoshimori was just plain exhausted after the events of the previous day. After he had gotten into Gen's apartment he had stripped down to the waist, leaving his pants on for the sake of modesty. It would have been more comfortable going down to his boxers, but since he was taking Gen's bed he thought it would be best to remain at least partially clothed, especially until he could figure out how much Gen had heard while in his possessed state. The decision to sleep in Gen's bed wasn't a calculated one to test whether or not Gen would share the bed with him. Yoshimori had just been so tired he had flopped onto the bed without a second thought. He had fallen asleep almost as soon as his head had hit the pillow. It wasn't until late the next day he finally woke up. The decision to skip class had allowed Yoshimori to have a long, untroubled sleep for once. Yoshimori slowly opened his eyes, letting out a yawn. Thanks to Gen's shades, it was still incredibly dark in the room. Yoshimori glanced at the digital read out on the clock and saw it was 4 in the afternoon. School would have already let out. \"Ugh...I should probably call home so no one worries...\" He thought to himself. \"But it's so warm and comfy! I don't want to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori tried to reach down and pull the blankets up around his neck but he couldn't move his arm. Blinking slightly, he looked down and realized that something was holding him down! Panicking slightly, he looked around wildly, flipping over in the bed to come face to chest with Gen's massive pecs! A blush swiftly suffused his cheeks as his nose was inches way from Gen's bronzed skin. With every breath the enormous young man took, his chest inflated, brushing against Yoshimori's cute little nose, Gen's natural scent invading his nostrils and making him blush all the harder. He could feel himself stirring down below. Yoshimori gulped and slowly tried to ease out of Gen's grip. It was no good. He wasn't able to budge so much as an inch so matter how he wiggled or squirmed. He might as well have been a mouse trapped under the paw of a cat. He wasn't going anywhere. \"Then again...\" He thought to himself. \"Why should I want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly scooted in closer to Gen, gently placing one palm on Gen's chest, his other arm pressed against his own chest, his nose buried into the deep canyon between Gen's pecs. One of Gen's bulky biceps was perfectly positioned behind Yoshimori's head, serving as an extremely comfortable pillow. Yoshimori's legs pressed lightly against Gen's abs, his toes reaching just past Gen's bulge, clad only in a pair of skin tight black bicycling shorts, the blankets bunched up against the foot of the bed. The bed itself was creaking slightly as it struggled to support Gen's new weight. \"Huh...It's been so long...shouldn't he have shrunk back by now?\" Yoshimori thought, slowly closing his eyes, tiredness creeping up on him again. He was too tired to care at this point. Just as Yoshimori was about to drift off to sleep, Gen stirred, letting out a huge yawn, rolling over onto his back and taking Yoshimori with him, the smaller teen suddenly lying face down on Gen's torso. Gen felt the minute weight upon his sculpted body and looked down into Yoshimori's eyes. They stared at each briefly before Gen's cheeks began to flush. \"Good....morning.\" He said uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon actually.\" Yoshimori said with a small smile, folding his arms and resting his chin on them. Gen's arms slowly slid off of Yoshimori's body until only a large hand was left which slowly moved up and down Yoshimori's back. Yoshimori chuckled and said, \"I guess you heard me then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Gen admitted, turning his head slightly. He was quiet for a few minutes before he slowly asked, \"Are you sure though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yoshimori said, confused. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loving me.\" Gen said, gulping at the word. It wasn't one he had ever been able to use very often. \"I'm not worth it. Are you sure you want to waste it on me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori lifted himself up, his knees resting on Gen's abs as he glared into the half ayakashi's eyes. \"What kind of question is that?! I tell you I love you and you say you're not worth it? Are you saying that I don't know what I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop shouting.\" Gen, an annoyed expression rising to his face. \"I was just asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I'm answering!\" Yoshimori yelled, moving his face in closer to Gen's. \"I meant what I said and I'm not about to back pedal on it! So you'd better get used to me being around from now on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen stared passively at Yoshimori before a small, rueful smile rose to his lips. \"Right...I should have expected as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, after all this time I thought you'd know me better than that!\" Yoshimori grumbled, laying himself out on top of Gen again. \"You'd better start learning! And put your arms back around me dammit! I'm getting cold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen slowly wrapped his arms around Yoshimori and flipped over, his enormous weight pressing down on top of Yoshimori's much smaller body. \"Then I'd better keep you warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori looked up in shock at Gen's face, a smirk firmly in place. His heart started to beat faster as Gen slowly moved in closer to Yoshimori and gave him a peck on the cheek. With a sigh, he laid his head next to Yoshimori's, closing his eyes again. \"W-Was that it?\" Yoshimori said, slightly relieved, slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like moving fast.\" Gen said firmly. \"You said you loved me. You know how I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Yoshimori said, moving in closer again. \"You know...you never...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never what?\" Gen asked, cracking one eye open when Yoshimori suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-Nothing...never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen opened both eyes and stared deeply into Yoshimori's own. \"I love you too.\" He said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust hearing those words nearly made Yoshimori melt. He grinned and rubbed his face against Gen's chest. \"Yeah, I know you big lug.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoshimori let out a cute little yawn, but just as he did, he was interrupted by an even greater sound coming from Gen's stomach! Yoshimori popped on eye open and looked up at Gen, who looked aside, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like someone's hungry.\" Yoshimori said, looking at Gen with a smile. Yoshimori backed up a little, breaking Gen's gentle grasp on him, and smiled down at the teen. \"How about I go cook us up something to eat?\" He asked. Gen just nodded at Yoshimori. There was almost a sort of... Wanting in Gen's eyes, but Yoshimori was too oblivious at the time to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young kekkaishi hopped up out of bed, and started making his way over to Gen's kitchen! It was at this moment that Yoshimori was walking away that Gen noticed the smaller male was shirtless! Yoshimori, on the other hand, started to peek around Gen's kitchen, looking for something that he could use for ingredients. It didn't take long, as the Night Troops made sure to keep their base well-stocked with food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Yoshimori started gathering up everything he needed to make Gen a delicious pancake breakfast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gen was laying in bed, he could hear Yoshimori moving around in the other room. He turned on his back, looking up at his blank ceiling. As he lay there thinking to himself, he looked at his hand. It was so much larger than what he was used to... Everything in his room seemed just a little bit smaller... Whether is was his alarm clock, or even his closet! He looked down his forearm, down to his bicep, and even at his shoulder for a moment. Slowly, he closed his fist and flexed his arm. The muscle, in return, gradually swelled up, and as Gen tucked his thumb in, a peak popped up right on the top of his powerful bicep. He stared at it for a moment, before a tiny smirk cracked it's way onto his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen, Yoshimori was already mixing together some pancake batter, while a fresh batch of bacon was sizzling on the stovetop. Yoshimori made sure to put plenty on, since he was sure a bigger Gen meant a bigger appetite! It didn't take long for the pancake batter to be ready, and Yoshimori started to cook it right up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Yoshimori was cooking pancakes, a pair of arms reached down his chest from his shoulders! He could feel two soft, bulgy \"pillows\" push at his back. Yoshimori then felt a puff of warm air just by his ear! As Yoshimori's eyes slinked to the left, he saw Gen's face there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey big guy! You must be hungry, huh?\" Yoshimori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just missed you...\" Gen replied, looking down at the cooking breakfast. Gen felt a little heavy on Yoshimori, but the smaller teen didn't seem to mind much. He felt warm and fuzzy when he heard Gen say he missed him. What really got him to blush is when he felt Gen's hands gently rubbing his bare stomach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori chuckled a little. \"There's not much there, I know.\" He said, \"Not compared to you, at least.\" Gen didn't exactly laugh or show any emotion at Yoshimori's little quip. In fact, all he said in response was a brief \"Mm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long for breakfast to finish, and before either of them knew it, they had to break apart so that Yoshimori could set the table. Gen would have helped, but with his newfound power, he might have ended up breaking a few things... But it wasn't as if Yoshimori minded doing it all for Gen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Yoshimori said, as he just took his seat. \"About that ayakashi...\" He began. As he looked up at Gen, the big guy had already started eating! Yoshimori just smiled. \"Right...\" He said aloud. \"I guess we should just enjoy the food first.\" He then thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two sat there, Yoshimori ate at a slow, calm pace, taking generous breaks to catch undercover glances as Gen's body. Gen, on the other hand, was too focused on eating to notice! As Yoshimori bent down to get another bite of pancake, he stretched his foot over, and tapped Gen's foot with his toes. Gen, however, pulled away, and suddenly slammed his foot down on Yoshimori's! Yoshimori let out a wicked loud yelp, before pulling back! Gen immediately stood up, bending over the table tword Yoshimori!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm sorry!\" He said, his tone still calm. \"I didn't mean to... I...\" Gen stammered. Yoshimori looked up at Gen, a tear in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's... Alright...\" Yoshimori winced, holding his throbbing foot. Thankfully nothing was broken!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 15 minutes, breakfast had come to a close, and both boys felt filled and happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to talk about that ayakashi...?\" Gen asked Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right!\" Yoshimori said, sitting at attention, \"I made up a plan! I just know it'll work!\" He said. \"Later on, when it gets dark, we'll head down to Karasumori! Then, once the ayakashi appears, you have to look like you're going mad! You'll pretend to attack me, but you have to let me win! Then the ayakashi will give you more power, and then we can take him down together!\" Yoshimori grinned. \"Pretty awesome plan, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it could work...\" Gen said, \"But what if I really do lose it...?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" Yoshimori said. He got a slight blush, as he pushed two fingers together. \"I-I guess I'll just have to... Well...\" Gen just looked at Yoshimori in confusion. \"Look, don't worry! I know it'll work! Trust me!\" Yoshimori insisted. Gen just nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Yoshimori gave Gen a strange look. Gen, in turn, kept his usual stare back at Yoshimori. Yoshimori got up from the table and walked around to Gen's side. \"You got a little pancake on your face...\" He said. Before Gen could look down in an attempt to see, Yoshimori moved in, and licked it clean off! \"There!\" He said with a bright smile as he looked back at Gen. Gen just blushed.</span></div></div>",

Living on his own, Gen kind of made of mess of things around the apartment. Dirty, ripped clothes were piled in the closet, the bed sheets were a tangled mess, the bath tub needed a good scrubbing as did the floors, and the oven was a bit of a greasy mess. Gen sat in the corner of the living room, watching quietly as Yoshimori tidied the place up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel like I have a wife...\" He muttered as Yoshimori passed, earning a glare from the smaller teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you weren't such a slob then I wouldn't have to clean up after you!\" Yoshimori said, shaking his head. \"You're going to learn some better habits now that I'm going to be living here with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen nodded a few times before his eyes shot wide open. \"Wait...what? Y-You're moving in with me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori sighed and tossed a particularly ripped up pair of pants into the trash. It was beyond his mending skills. \"Well I don't really like living at home. My grandpa's a pain in the ass, Masamori visits at random times, it's right next door to Tokine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you liked her.\" Gen said, crossing his arms slightly. This was a bit of a point of contention with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori grimaced and said, \"Yeah, I thought I did but that was when I was young and stupid. Come on, you've seen the way she treats me! I'm not an idiot anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen suddenly reached forward and gathered Yoshimori into his arms, holding him against his chest. \"Forget about her. You have me now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori blushed, a small smile rising to his lips. \"Yeah, yeah, I know big guy.\" He patted Gen lovingly on the chest and gave him a kiss on the cheek, causing the bigger teen to blush as well. He let Yoshimori go and he continued his cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, with the apartment cleaned and their bellies filled from dinner, Yoshimori began to dress in his traditional Kekkaishi clothes while Gen rifled through his closet. \"Nothing fits me anymore. What am I supposed to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori tightened the sash around his waist before tying it, looking over at Gen's broad back. \"I dunno, I think you look great just like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen blushed and said, \"Y-Yeah, but that's only okay when I'm with you. When I'm out there I have to look more...presentable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori rubbed Gen's back, leaning against him as he looked into the closet. \"Well, I can let out a few of these outfits so they fit you, but I won't be able to do that for awhile so...in the meantime I would just make do with something simple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen sighed and pulled out one of his old outfits. He pulled the top on, the bottom of the shirt only reaching midway down his abs, his broad chest almost immediately ripping his shirt down the middle, leaving him with a tattered looking vest. The pants did no better, the legs popping open like overdone sausages popping their casings, leaving him with a pair of short shorts that gripped his thighs. Gen felt like he looked ridiculous but Yoshimori was encouraging. \"Don't worry! You look great! No one's going to see you out there anyway besides me and the ayakashi we're killing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen nodded, moving towards the door. \"Come on, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they were outside, Yoshimori clambered onto Gen's back, wrapping his arms around his lover's thick neck. Gen waited patiently until Yoshimori was firmly and safely in place before taking off, moving with all speed to Karasumori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the plan Gen!\" Yoshimori said. \"We have to stay separate until the ayakashi shows up. He has to think that we're still fighting so the second you see him try to find me and attack me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Then I throw the fight and he'll give me more power which will allow us to take him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! We've got this in the bag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen landed with a loud thump inside the school grounds, his big bare feet leaving footprints in the soft grass. Yoshimori jumped down and immediately took off, Gen moving in the opposite direction. For about an hour they wandered the grounds, keeping their eyes peeled for the ayakashi, destroying any lesser ayakashi that dared cross them. Finally, at about one in the morning, Yoshimori ran smack into the ayakashi, getting knocked to the ground in the process. Yoshimori quickly got to his feet, glaring at the creature before him. The once young ayakashi now had the height and build of an adult, his face aged to around the same age as Yoshimori and Gen, his hair and clothing style unchanged, though the clothes were bigger to accommodate his much larger body. The ayakashi smirked and said, \"Well, well, well. Looks like my poison wore off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and now I'm going to kick your ass!\" Yoshimori shouted, pointing his fingers at the monster. \"Ketsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ayakashi moved with blinding speed, kicking Yoshimori in the stomach before punching him across the face and slashing him along the chest with his claws. Each blow felt like a hammer, his chest burning as four long gashes were visible through his ripped shirt, dripping blood. The ayakashi chuckled and said, \"You're putting up as much of a fight as you did when you were bug sized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori didn't answer. Instead, he quickly called up several kekkei's all around the ayakashi, catching parts of his limbs inside. With a series of \"Metsu!\"s, various chunks of the ayakashi's body was destroyed, leaving him a bleeding mess. \"D-Dammit! Got cocky...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it up junior!\" Yoshimori said with a grin. \"You may look older but you're still just a little kid! You can't beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ayakashi's grimace turned to a grin as he saw Gen running up from behind Yoshimori. \"Oh yeah? Well he can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori barely managed to turn around before Gen slammed into him, snarling like a wild animal, momentarily scaring Yoshimori before he remembered the plan. He dug his feet into the ground and jabbed Gen in the abs with his staff, winding the bigger male slightly before he tried sealing his hands and feet in kekkei's. Gen easily tore his way free and came after him again, claws flashing. They danced around for awhile, blocking, slashing, parrying, and sealing until Yoshimori performed the \"coup de grace\", trapping Gen's limbs in kekkei's and stringing him up into the air. Gen pretended like he couldn't escape and hung there, growling. Yoshimori grinned at the ayakashi and said, \"Piece of cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ayakashi lost it. He savagely grabbed his arm and started squeezing his wounds, catching as much blood as he could in his hand. He then flew over to Gen and forced his mouth open, feeding him the handful of his blood before shoving his wound against Gen's mouth, forcing him to drink more and more! Yoshimori winced as he watched. He hadn't expected that. Gen seemed a little worried himself, but there was nothing that could be done now. The ayakashi grinned savagely at Yoshimori as he stepped back. Gen smacked his lips, grimacing before clenching his teeth in pain. Yoshimori watched as Gen began to transform, his body bulking bigger and bigger and bigger! Yoshimori's mouth dropped open as Gen's limbs lengthened, his clothes shredding to pieces as Gen's body doubled then tripled in size, the kekkei's exploding off of him. His shadow stretched over the tiny Yoshimori as he watched his new boyfriend grow higher and higher into the sky, his massive toes pushing up against his tiny body. Yoshimori turned and ran, though it was  hard to keep ahead of the toes as they grew closer and taller, soon towering over his small body, reaching the height of the school! Gen let out a low moan, his massive cock twitch, the tip of his head nearly taking out a nearby building as the growth finally slowed to a halt. Yoshimori's mouth dropped open as he stared up...and up...and UP at Gen, not able to see his head passed his immense chest, which was slowly rising and falling with Gen's every breath, his voice slow and powerful, making Yoshimori's chest vibrate from his mere panting. The ayakashi laughed evilly as he flew around Gen's toes, sitting down on the tip of the big toe, grinning at Yoshimori. \"Now you're going to die little Kekkaishi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.\" Gen's calm, yet thundering voice issued from on high. The ayakashi looked up, covering his head with his arms just as Gen's thumb came down, crushing his body, the ayakashi's blood pooling on the ground. Nothing more of him remained. Yoshimori got shakily to his feet and looked up, Gen's passive face hovering overhead like a moon as he bent down to crush the ayakashi. His gigantic eyes rolled over to Yoshimori and he smiled ruefully. \"Good thing this is only temporary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori winced at the volume of his voice and weakly nodded. He had to admit, Gen's size was quite...breathtaking~ Every inch of his body was purely enormous! In a few hours he would shrink back to his normal size (or whatever was his normal size now) but it seemed such a shame to waste his gigantic body. Yoshimori glanced down at the blood pooling on the ground and grinned wickedly. Without a second though, he began to guzzle down the blood, energy flooding his body already as he took in as much as Gen had. Wiping his mouth, he stood up straight, waiting to join Gen in a night of godhood!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoshimori felt a pulse of power going through his body as the blood of the ayakashi was making him more and more powerful! All of that vile nectar was having a great effect on his body! He wouldn't end up just a little bit stronger, no, Yoshimori was going to end up just as massive and powerful as Gen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori's back arched slightly as his arms bulked up immensely pumping up bigger, and bigger, and BIGGER! Yoshimori's back flared outward, tearing through his kekkaishi outfit in seconds! His shoulders pushed upward, filling with muscle and power, as his traps were growing up higher and higher, looking like they might encompass his head! His pecs become huge and swollen, the nipples perking up as he started to enjoy the feeling of growing into a muscle giant! His abs tightened, but before they became too defined, his stomach bloated out slightly, giving him a bit of a muscle gut! Gen's eyes widened slightly as he saw his little lover quickly catching up with him, and packing on more muscles than him! Yoshimori's boxers were barely holding on, barely even containing his beast of a cock and globular ass that bounced with every little movement! His thighs had bulked up even greater, and at his current size, he could crush a tree between them! As Yoshimori's calves reached the size of a boulder, he had grown so tall he could look Gen in the chin! The teen's feet also pushed out even bigger, digging into the earth and shaking the ground below as he accidentally stomped his foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh yeah!\" Yoshimori said, flexing his arms, \"That's the stuff! I feel great! Strong.\" He said with a big grin on his face. Gen just chuckled slightly as he looked at Yoshimori. He was just a foot, maybe two, shorter than Gen, but if you were normal sized, you wouldn't even be able to tell! \"Whadd'ya think Gen?\" Yoshimori asked with a wink as he bounced his pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... Alright...\" Gen said, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Yoshimori looked at Gen. He pulled him in, and gave him a sudden kiss on the lips! \"You look kind of hot, all huge and sexy...\" Yoshimori said, smiling as he pulled himself a little closer to Gen, wrapping his arms around him. Gen held onto Yoshimori too, and leaned in to kiss his soft lips. Yoshimori hugged Gen tight, rubbing his back as the two of them kept on kissing each other. The heat of the moment was getting hotter, as Yoshimori took a step back, purposefully tripping so Gen landed right on top of them! The school was crushed under the weight of the two titanic teens who were too busy locking lips to even care! Things only escalated further as Gen started to tongue Yoshimori, a wet passion sparking between the two of them. A deep groaning escaped Yoshimori's throat as Gen continued to force himself on Yoshimori. The two rolled slightly, crushing the school beneath them. Yoshimori was already getting harder, his dick pressing up against Gen's abs. Gen's cock was already hard, but it was pressed up between Yoshimori's legs, precum already oozing from his slit as he gently grinded Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gen... I want it...\" Yoshimori managed to say once he had a moment to speak. \"I want to feel you in me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Gen wanted to hear! He pushed his body up a little, and looked down, positioning himself. He rubbed a little pre on Yoshimori's hole to make it easier on the kid, before pushing himself in! Yoshimori moaned louder, his back arching a little as he took in the larger teen's rod. Gen reached down, and gripped Yoshimori's meat in his hand and started to pump it, working from the base, all the way up the shaft until he reached the swollen head! It only made Yoshimori moan even louder! Gen bent forward and started kissing Yoshimori again in an attempt to shut him up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen's hips pulled back before charging back in pounding Yoshimori's tight virgin ass over and over again! Gen's cock throbbed slightly, begging for release as he pushed in and out of Yoshimori, all while skillfully jerking Yoshimori off! Gen's body started to bead up with sweat, dripping down his huge body, plunging off his dark brown nipple before falling down onto Yoshimori's hot, vanilla skin. Yoshimori reached back, giving Gen's bulging ass a squeeze, making the tanned god groan himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen couldn't help himself as he started going faster and faster, punishing Yoshimori's ass as both of their massive cocks had begun to quake, ready to burst with steamy, white seed! Gen started to grunt like some kind of feral animal as Yoshimori knees buckled! With a loud roar from both of them, Gen unleashed a torrent of cum into Yoshimori's ass, while Yoshimori himself unleashed his load all over his massive body! Gen felt a bit weak, as he then fell forward on top of Yoshimori's torso, not even caring that he was laying in Yoshimori's sticky mess. The two of them laid there, panting and sweaty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori hugged Gen, holding him close. The two of them had a lot to get used to with their new, massive bodies... How would they eat? Where would they live? The journey of love was one thing, but the journey of being a macro was just as life changing!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two new giants held each other, basking in the afterglow of their first time together, the remains of the school crushed under them along with several other buildings. Apartments, businesses, and more were obliterated under the titanic bulk of Yoshimori and Gen. For the longest time there was no sound except for the breathing of the two massive teens, their pumped chests falling rising with every puff of air. Finally, Gen said quietly, \"We can't stay here you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Yoshimori said, his eyes half closed. He had almost fallen asleep! \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're too big. Just by lying down we destroyed a huge portion of this area.\" Gen pointed out. \"It's not going to be long before police come after us or maybe even the army. We can't stick around here much longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori chuckled and kissed Gen on the cheek. \"Like some puny army can do anything to us! If anyone tries to cause us any trouble we can just step on them! End of story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen squirmed a little and turned to face Yoshimori. \"Yeah, but everyone can see us too...naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori snickered as Gen's face turned lightly red. \"Wow, you really ARE shy! What's to be ashamed of? We've got bodies most guys would kill for!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen smiled slightly and hugged Yoshimori tighter. \"I guess so...but still, I don't want to be here when everyone wakes up. It'll be too noisy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori sighed and stretched. \"You're right. The last thing we need is some nosy jerks poking around and asking us questions. Besides, what's left for us here? Karasumori kind of got smashed under my ass when you started screwing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen's face turned completely red as Yoshimori said this. \"R-Right...\" He still couldn't believe he had had sex with someone! The very idea seemed inconceivable to him. He never thought anyone could ever like him enough to even consider it, let alone love him like Yoshimori did. In the back of his mind, a dark, depressing corner, he thought this whole thing could be a dream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen? You listening?\" Yoshimori said, smacking Gen on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What?\" Gen said, looking around before focusing on Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're impossible! I said, where do you want to go?\" Yoshimori repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hadn't really thought about it...\" Gen said, staring up at the sky. He had only known a few places as \"home\". His old house where he lived with his family. The compound in the forest where he lived with the other members of the Nights Watch. The apartment in this city that would no longer fit one of his toes, let alone his and Yoshimori's bodies. \"We should go into the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Yoshimori said with a grin. \"A good old fashioned camping trip! Sounds good to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen chuckled. Yoshimori's lighthearted optimism was infectious. Yoshimori sat up with a little grunt, his hand running over his distended abs with a grimace. \"Hey, how come I got the belly and you didn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen sat up and glanced at his own abs before looking at Yoshimori's more bloated gut. He gently ran his hand over the mound and said, \"I don't know...but I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori blushed a little, his cock twitching and taking out one of the lucky buildings that had managed to stand even through the sexual antics of the titanic teens. \"Y-Yeah? You think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen smiled and said, \"Yeah. It's cute. And...uh...sexy...\" He blushed after saying this. He still wasn't quite used to this kind of closeness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori suddenly flipped over and pinned Gen to the ground, his face inches from Gen's. \"Geez, you keep this up and I'm going to need to fuck you this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen blushed again, his hands running up and down Yoshimori's thicker arms. \"I'd...like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori grinned, feeling a strange sense of power he never had before over Gen and said, \"Later big guy~ First let's get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori got to his feet, all of his new muscles flexing as he did so, before holding his hand out for Gen. The taller giant gripped Yoshimori's hand and pulled himself to his feet, looking around at the city. Most of the buildings barely made it up to their toes. It was like standing on a model. Yoshimori snickered and knelt down, his eye on a particular apartment complex. \"That jerk who called me a shrimp last week lives here. I'd like to see who the shrimp is now!\" He looked up at Gen, giving him the puppy dog eyes and said, \"Can't we stay here and mess around? Pleeeeeease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen crossed his arms, his gaze stony. \"No. Come on, let's go. You're acting like a five year old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I'm not some immature little kid!\" Yoshimori shouted, running after Gen who was slowly walking away. Even their slightest movements could cause immense earthquakes. Yoshimori's charging was sending such strong seismic waves through the ground, buildings were collapsing left and right all over the city. By the time the two were at the outskirts of the city, not much was left untouched by their presence. But the boys didn't care. They were young, in love, and so enormous that regular human beings were barely blips on their radar. They were no longer mere humans. Through their experiences they had ascended, more akin to gods than anything. No creature, human, ayakashi, or otherwise could hope to touch them. The trees were flattened under their massive soles, posing no resistance to their casual strolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head for the mountains.\" Gen suggested, pointing at them in the distance. \"The wilderness around there will be a good place to hide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we need to hide.\" Yoshimori said, his arms behind his head. \"We're too big for anyone to hurt us so who cares if they can see us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen blushed slightly again and said, \"Just...because.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori giggled and wrapped his arms around Gen's neck, kissing him on the ear. \"You're so cute when you blush~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Gen to blush even harder, his hand gently stroking Yoshimori's arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued on their way, deeper into the wilderness, all traces of civilization disappearing behind them...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The thundering footsteps of the two boys soon vanished into the distance, leaving the remains of the city in ruins. It was suffice to say their actions did not go unnoticed! From far across the land the two titans of muscle were watched by the head of the Night Troops, and Yoshimori's brother, Masamori. He had a deep frown on his face. There was no doubt that the damage done here would take a very long time to repair, not to mention the lives that were lost that could never be replaced! Masamori made a few barrier cubes and started hopping off to catch up with the two boys, who he'd overheard would be hiding out in the mountains. Then again, nearly everyone in the town could have heard those two talking, with how loud their voices rumbled like thunder over the troubled town!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, out in the vast wilderness, Gen and Yoshimori traveled. Yoshimori walked behind Gen with his arms behind his head, looking around restlessly. Gen, on the other hand, just kept his eyes focused forward, paying no mind to the trees being crunched like dried pasta under his feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we there yet?\" Yoshimori asked, \"Wherever we're going...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen looked around, and could see a valley not too far in the distance. \"Yeah. We can take a rest up ahead.\" He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rest? How much longer do we have to go?\" Yoshimori asked impatiently as he got a tiny little frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Gen replied, looking steadily at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even know where we're going to live?\" Yoshimori pressed on, wanting to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Gen repeated, a little more sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can you at least tell me what we do when we DO find a place?\" Yoshimori asked yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I don't know!!!</b>\" Gen practically shouted! His voice was so loud, you could practically hear it all the way back on the edge of town! Yoshimori shook a little, looking at Gen with a bit of shock! He should of knew Gen would have reacted this way, but he still had so many questions he wanted answered. Not to mention now he had a little bit of fear in his heart... After all, it's not like Gen had the most friendly-looking qualities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Sorry.\" Gen said after a moment of glaring at Yoshimori. He looked aside, brushing the back of his head sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Yoshimori replied, still a little bit shaken. \"Don't worry about it.\" Yoshimori reached out and took Gen's hand. \"It doesn't change how I feel about you.\" Yoshimori went on, before leaning up and giving Gen a soft little kiss on his lips. As the kiss broke off, Gen looked aside, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Thanks...\" He replied. Yoshimori chuckled, rubbing Gen's shoulder a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll just have to wait and see, right? Alright! Now let's get going!\" He said, marching ahead without even giving Gen a chance to reply. Gen turned and followed behind Yoshimori, until the two reached the valley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe valley they had found must have been a good few miles away from their hometown! The two of them were able to sit in the low, grassy fields without worry about crushing anything precious! As the two sat there, Yoshimori leaned in, resting his head on Gen's buff shoulder. Gen looked over at him for a moment, but Yoshimori just smiled, which made Gen wrap his arm around Yoshimori's shoulder. They didn't exchange words, in fact, all they did was enjoy what was left of a beautful sunrise on a beautiful morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two rested, a persistant Masamori had been keeping up with them the whole time! At least, the best he could. He was a man known for his endurance, just as Yoshimori was, and at a time like this, it really came in handy! It took quite a while, in fact, the sun was already halfway up in the sky as he finally started to close in on the two boys! Yoshimori had retired to resting his head in Gen's lap, while Gen was gently stroking the smaller, stockier man's hair. Masamori started to increase the altitude of the blocks, making his way up the Gen's head so the giant could hear his tiny voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all seemed to go so slow, but soon Masamori arrived in front of Gen's ear! He stopped to take a short breath before speaking with Gen. After all, running, or rather hopping and jumping, for miles could really tire a guy out! Once he was ready, he cupped his hands around his mouth, and shouted up at Gen's ear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GEN!\" He called as loud as he could, to make sure he would be heard. Gen's ear's perked up! He looked up and around for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Captain...?\" Gen said as he looked about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain...?\" Yoshimori mumbled, turning his head so he was looking up at Gen. \"You mean... Masamori?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen! To your right!\" Masamori shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gen turned, he spotted what was like a fly on a tiny cube. \"O-Oh! C... Masamori.\" Gen said, a bit hesitant to call him by his first name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masamori...? Here?\" Yoshimori sat up, and looked where Gen was looking. \"Aw geez, really?!\" He said, getting a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen, do you have any idea what destruction you've caused?\" Masamori asked, looking up at Gen sternly. Gen was a little struck by it, but he was far from fearful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" He replied, just barely able to hide the slight shaking in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to talk to him like that!\" Yoshimori replied, \"Look at him! Look at us! What's he gonna do to us!?\" Yoshimori told Gen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least SOME people don't let power go to their head.\" Mamamori said, looking at Yoshimori from the corner of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! If you were this big you'd be the same way! Hell, you'd be even worse than us!\" Yoshimori said, arguing and getting riled up by the small man's words. Masamori ignored him and turned back to Gen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen, what you've done here last night will surely be noted as a grievous crime.\" Masamori said. \"However... This unbridled power is certainly something we could use on our side.\" Masamori explained. \"I trust you'll continue to serve the Night Troops?\" Masamori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen looked at Masamori, and then Yoshimori. This would be a bit of a dilemma for him...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was a pivotal moment in Gen's life. He could see the two paths that were ahead of him. He knew he could only choose one. Would he follow the man who had taken him in as a child, given his life meaning, and always believed in him or would he follow the man who had shown him affection, understanding, and, most importantly, love. Would duty override personal feelings? Gen looked between the two brothers, both of their eyes trained on him. \"They have the same eyes\" Gen thought irrationally as he tried to sort through all his feelings. Masamori and Yoshimori both knew that to push Gen to answer before he was ready would only result in him getting angry and stressful. So they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what felt like hours, Gen let out a sigh and turned to look at Masamori. \"Captain...You've been a constant figure in my life and I wouldn't have gotten far without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamori smiled slightly as Yoshimori's jaw dropped in total shock. Gen glanced at Yoshimori before saying, \"However, I can't abandon Yoshimori. We've been through a lot together not just in the last few days but ever since I started fighting by his side at Karasumori. You set me on my path but he's the only one I've ever felt was walking with me, at my side. So I'm going to continue traveling with him, into the mountains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori blushed slightly, turning his face away and crossing his arms. \"Making me worry like that...\" He muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamori sighed, his expression inscrutable again. \"You do realize what you're doing, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do sir.\" Gen said evenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be left alone. Go into the mountains, sure, stay out of sight but you're an enormous source of power. Both of you are. It won't just be the Night Troops who come after you. Ayakashi, bounty hunters, independent organizations, they'll all come after you with the intent of either harnessing your power or destroying it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Yoshimori said, sitting up. \"Well so what? Let them come! We'll crush those little bastards like flies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamori shook his head slightly and said, \"There are powers and forces in  this world that you couldn't possibly comprehend. Don't think you'll be able to just step on all your problems. I know you've both made your decision, but I'm going to extend an offer to you: If you change your mind within one week of today, come back to the HQ of the Night Troops and I can guarantee you'll be taken in. We'll provide food, shelter, and protection from other more unsavory people. All you would have to do is work for us. It's the best offer you're going to get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's our answer.\" Yoshimori said, pressing the tip of his index finger against the pad of his thumb. He brought the tip closer to the cube Masamori was standing on and flicked it carelessly, obliterating the kekkai on contact. Before Masamori could react, Yoshimori flicked again, this time the finger making contact with his older brother's chest, sending him flying into the distance. They could just make out a strange inky blackness surrounding him, forming into a kind of giant fish that carried him away. Gen sighed and looked over at Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't need to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was pissing me off. Threatening us like that. We're not going to hurt anyone! We just want to live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen, who had been hunted down and hurt plenty of times despite \"just wanting to live\" knew that life wasn't that easy. There was no point in trying to explain it to Yoshimori while he was in a mood like this though. Yoshimori, too agitated to relax any more, jumped to his feet, scaring away the few brave birds that had dared to return to the tree tops after Gen and Yoshimori had stopped walking, and started walking away. Gen sighed and got to his feet as well, walking behind Yoshimori a few steps. After a few minutes of silence, Yoshimori looked over his shoulder and said, \"Have you ever actually been to the mountains?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few times.\" Gen said, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been...\" Yoshimori said, looking into the distance at the towering peaks. \"Doesn't look as impressive now as it did before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you're about a mile or so taller than you used to be.\" Gen said, walking past Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori grinned and puffed out his chest a little. \"Yeah, that's true~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mood seemed improved as he walked along with Gen, grabbing his hand. Gen immediately blushed and looked away, prompting Yoshimori to lean over and kiss him gently on the cheek. Gen looked at Yoshimori with a small smile, an opportunity the shorter man took to kiss Gen full on the lips! Gen's eyes popped wide open but he accepted the kiss and relaxed, slowly, his arm gently rubbing up and down Yoshimori's back. After a few minutes, Yoshimori broke the kiss and grinned. \"Come on, I'll race you to the mountain!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for an answer, Yoshimori charged off, his thundering footsteps causing untold destruction to the forest, trees splintering like toothpicks, entire villages, too small to be properly seen by the gargantuan high school students wiped from existence as he ran. Gen shook his head slightly at how childish Yoshimori was acting before charging after his lover. Yoshimori had gotten enough of a head start to compensate for his stockier legs, allowing him to reach the mountains before Gen. Without stopping, he jumped into the air, clearing a series of lower peaks before disappearing completely! Gen, startled, followed suit, jumping after Yoshimori. He ended up landing on top of him inside a kind of lake in a strange clearing. There was grass and trees as well. For all intents and purposes, it was as though the two boys had ended up in a forest clearing. The only indication that they were still on a mountain was the grey peaks rising all around them in a natural wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew something like this was here...\" Gen said softly, looking around. The lake they were sitting in was about the size of a hot tub to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at the walls.\" Yoshimori pointed out. \"There aren't any paths or anything leading here. The only way in is to jump over the peaks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen smiled slightly and said, \"I think we found the answer to your question about where we'll be staying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori grinned and wrapped his arms around Gen's neck. \"I think I'm going to like it here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, they both shared a tender kiss once more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoshimori winced as he realized that he had led his tormentor right back to his house! Damn it! He was putting his family in danger just by being here! Well...his father and his little brother anyway. His grandfather had left on a trip to do some research on a mountain dwelling ayakashi alongside Tokine's grandmother. Of course, even though they were going to the same place for the same reason they steadfastly refused to admit they were traveling together. Yoshimori had grown tired of hearing his grandfather yelling about how that old cow next door was infringing on his business. It had been a relief when he had finally left. Yoshimori suddenly winced again as he realized that his brother was currently visiting them too! Talk about bad luck! As soon as he had heard that his grandfather would be leaving for the better part of a month, Masamori had decided to spend that time with the family since he had time off from his duties and they so rarely got to see each other. He had arrived a few days before his grandfather had left. The atmosphere had been tense for awhile, but now that he was gone the only tension came from Yoshimori and his constant sulk when Masamori was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was jarred from his thoughts when a massive foot stomped the ground behind him, sending him flying along with Gen to the hard dirt. Gen yelled out in pain before shouting, \"Watch what you're doing you idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori would have punched him if he had had the strength. As it was, all he could do was pant out a quick \"Shut up!\" before running again, heading for the front door. His best chance of surviving this night was getting into his house and getting his father's or either of his brother's attention as soon as possible. The ayakashi hadn't decided to try and take them away to a remote location or back to his home dimension so they still had time to escape from all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ayakashi giggled as he stomped all around where Yoshimori was running, sometimes blocking him so that the tiny kekkaishi nearly crashed into the wall of flesh, and sometimes following so closely behind them, the wind his foot caused would send Yoshimori flying. Suddenly, he spread his toes and half kicked Yoshimori, trapping the boy between his big and second toe. \"Game over! You lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori winced in pain as the gigantic digits squeezed and pressed against him from all sides, Gen suffering similar treatment next to him...or wait...he was gone?! Yoshimori looked around wildly, spotting Gen crawling through the grass towards the front door of Yoshimori's house. His eyes widened but he stayed silent. This was their chance! Mustering up his strength, Yoshimori created a kekkai between the toes, forcing them apart so he could fall safely to the grass. \"Hey!\" the ayakashi said with a frown. \"That's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a simple flex, he crushed the puny barrier between his toes before crouching down in front of Yoshimori. \"That was even more pathetic than your last one! I can't believe you're the one who was giving everyone so much trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his index finger curled against the end of his thumb and positioned it being Yoshimori as he slowly stumbled in the opposite direction of Gen, hoping to draw the ayakashi's attention away. The ayakashi closed one eye and carefully aimed before flicking Yoshimori, the massive finger smacking him painfully in the ass before sending him flying through the air...straight towards an open window! The ayakashi yelled out and quickly ran after Yoshimori, trying to snatch him before he landed inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" He shouted as he saw Yoshimori land on the windowsill, slide across it, and fall onto someone's bed. \"Well...I still have another toy out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ayakashi began to scan the ground for Gen. The half ayakashi teen had managed to reach the front door by this time, sneaking inside the house through a crack. Now both boys were safely inside the house, the ayakashi not quite daring to invade. There was something about the house that felt...off to him. After searching for a good ten minutes, he got frustrated and quickly darted up a tree, watching the house with sleepless eyes. \"They have to come back out of there sometime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young ayakashi had no idea why he didn't just go inside the house and start tearing it apart in his efforts to find his toys, killing any human who got in his way. He just had this overwhelming feeling that there was something or someone dangerous inside. Something that could actually kill him, unlike the toys he had created. Even if the ayakashi had been brave enough to sneak inside the house, he wouldn't have been able to. There was too many wards and spells to keep out negative forces. A young and relatively weak ayakashi like him would have been burned up in an instant! But he was mostly patient. He would wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the two shrunken teens now found themselves in an entirely different world, both of them completely exhausted, but at least safer than they were outside. What would happen to them now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gen was finally able to rest inside Yoshimori's house. There was a light left on near the entrance, there always was, just for Yoshimori when he came home. Gen rested in the light, just to be entirely sure he was safe. Just a little nap was all he needed... Everyone was asleep, so he held onto that thought, hoping he wouldn't be stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen was able to rest for a good three hours or so. His eyes started to open, and he slowly got up and sat on his butt. Sleeping on hard concrete like that sure wore a guy out! His back felt a little stiff, but at least he had regained his energy. Looking up, he hopped up over the wooden curb and into the house. He started walking down the long hallway, looking all around. Now that he thought about it, this was his first time actually being IN Yoshimori's house... Speaking of which, where was Yoshimori? Last he remembered, he was flung through a window, but just where did he wind up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gen could think any more on the matter, he saw a light on in a room not too far away. Picking up speed, he ran over and listened in. He could hear movement from within, but it didn't seem like anyone was talking in there... Truthfully, Gen was just surprised to see someone still up at this hour! It took a lot of strength, but he managed to peer the door open a small crack, just enough so that he could peek inside. To Gen's surprise, he saw Yoshimori's older brother, Masamori, sitting shirtless at the table, looking over a book. His face seemed rather relaxed, so he must not have been working... Was he reading for pleasure for a change? Either way, Masamori being in a good mood was great news for Gen! Fearlessly, Masanori ran across the tatami floor, making his way to Masamori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Where am I...?\" Yoshimori mumbled to himself. He looked up and all around. The room was dark, but after he had fallen down from the windowsill, he landed onto soft ground... And the more he struggled to get free, the more tired he became. He ended up taking a nap just as Gen did! Yoshimori rubbed his head, standing on the wavy, soft ground. As he stood, there was a light, tender groan. Yoshimori was immediately on guard, and looking all around to see a large, bluish black globe at the head of what appeared to be a bed. That globe looked all too familiar... Yoshimori's eyes went wide as he saw the figure rise up. \"T-Toshimori!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masamori!\" Gen shouted from below the table. Masamori lifted his head, looking all around. It was quiet in the room after all, so it wasn't hard for him to hear. \"Masamori!\" Gen shouted again, louder this time. Masamori looked down, and saw Gen at the base of the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen? Is that you?\" He said, still calm. He gently picked him up and set him down on the table. \"What happened?\" With those words, Gen began to explain all the events that led up to this moment, from leaving for school, all the way up to taking a nap in the doorway. Masamori listened intently, asking all the questions necessary to find out everything he needed to know. After hearing Gen's whole story, he sat back, and began thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't like anything I've ever heard. But it almost makes sense. If the ayakashi could shrink it's target, it could have an easier time capturing its prey.\" Masamori reasoned. \"But even so, I never knew something like this existed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen just nodded, looking up at Masamori. Gen almost looked kinda cute at this size... So helpless... A smile stretched across Masamori's lips. \"Maybe we could use this opportunity to teach Gen... How to take down bigger opponents...\" Masamori reasoned with himself, chuckling to himself. \"On the other hand, this IS a real problem... The sooner we solve it, the better...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little more thinking, Masamori...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Masamori, having come to a decision at last, closed his thick book, the breeze it created nearly blowing Gen off the table again, and smiled down at his little subordinate. \"This might actually be a blessing in disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen was rather surprised to hear Masamori say that but he trusted the man more than anyone so he withheld judgement. \"What do you mean chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamori chuckled and said, \"I've watched you fight Gen and your style, while effective, is also a bit crude. You basically charge into battle and use your full power to rip apart any enemy that is in your way. While undoubtedly effective, such tactics don't always work and when you come back broken, bloody, and bruised, it shows that your technique could use a bit of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen lowered his head as he heard this. \"I'm sorry...I've failed you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamori gently patted Gen on the head and said, \"Not at all! Don't start thinking like that now. All I mean is that when you fight opponents stronger than yourself, you need to fight more with this...\" he gently pushed his index finger against Gen's tiny forehead. \"...rather than with these.\" He poked the various muscles in Gen's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\" Gen asked. Masamori's smile stretched wider. He was hoping that the conversation would go this way. \"Well, that's what I mean when I say this situation is a blessing in disguise. See my book on the table? Try to lift it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen looked between the book and his chief, trying to decide if he was serious or not. Masamori chuckled again and said, \"Trust me. I'm trying to make a point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen shrugged and walked over to the book. Once he was right next to it, he bent down and worked his hands under the cover. Bracing himself, he lifted with all his might...and moved it exactly no distance. While he struggled, Masamori reached down and lifted the book up easily in one hand. Gen, surprised by this sudden movement, hung onto the cover for dear life. Masamori brought the book closer to his face and focused on the tiny half ayakashi dangling from it. \"You see? I'm far stronger than you right now. And we're in a completely safe environment. Do you see where this is going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen, a little intimidated by Masamori's enormous face, gulped a little and nodded. Masamori held his hand under Gen, allowing the tiny teen to drop onto his palm. It felt strange, sitting in the palm of the man who had done so much for him. Gen couldn't help but feel completely safe and at ease. Now that he was in Masamori's care, nothing bad would happen to him. Masamori got to his feet and replaced the book on the shelf, pushing it in place with his finger before sitting back down at the table. He set Gen down on top of it and put his hands on his knees, his expression suddenly serious. \"Now then...How is your body? You're not in pain or anything right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen touched his body all over, moving his limbs, rotating his shoulders, and bending his legs. Everything seemed to be in proper working order...he was just a little worn out. He wasn't about to appear weak in front of his chief though! He got into a fighting pose and said, \"I'm fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamori smiled slightly before his expression became serious again. \"Alright...We'll start with something simple. At my size, my body is too hard to be damaged. Try. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasamori barked out the last word as an order, moving his chest closer to the table. Gen couldn't help but feel slightly intimidated. Masamori's body was quite impressive. He was very tall and his muscles were well developed. Gen truly felt like an impenetrable wall had rose in front of him. He transformed his hands into claws and charged forward, slashing at Masamori's right pec. Even though his claws clearly made contact several times, Masamori's skin didn't even turn slightly red from irritation. Gen stopped after a few minutes, already breathing hard. Masamori moved back, his hands on his knees again. \"Do you understand? You can attack me as many times as you like, with as much strength as you like, but you will never kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Masamori suddenly reached forward and snatched Gen up in his hand, his tree trunk like fingers wrapping around the vulnerable teen. Gen let out a little yell as he was lifted into the air. Masamori lightly tossed Gen from hand to hand, squeezing him slightly before \"accidentally\" dropping him onto his lap. All of this was harrowing from Gen's point of view, but he was unable to do anything except take it. Masamori lifted Gen back onto the table and lowered his face so he was looking at Gen on the same level. \"I could have easily killed you, however, several times without trying. THIS is why you need to train to fight stronger, larger opponents. I want to work on building your endurance first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen nodded, eager to be taught how to fight from Masamori himself. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity! The fact that he was shrunk was only a slight issue in the back of his mind. Masamori, on the other hand, had ulterior motives for wanting to \"train\" Gen. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity for him as well! He had always taken a particular liking to Gen and now here he was, tiny and vulnerable with no one else knowing he was here. Gen had neglected to mention Yoshimori while he was explaining what had happened to him so Masamori's first priority was to make sure Yoshimori didn't interfere. He was liable to freak out if he saw Gen and then demand they fix everything immediately. Masamori wasn't about to let that happen. He got to his feet and surreptitiously locked the door before walking over to the table where Gen was standing. He lifted up his foot and held it over Gen's body. \"Raise your arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen did as he was told. The very second his arms were extended, Masamori lowered his foot down on top of him. Gen's arms immediately tensed up, the muscles in his arms bulging as he held up Masamori's wide, powerful foot. There was a slight smell to the appendage, but it was mostly of soap. It was clear that Masamori had just showered this evening. It was likely this was why he wasn't wearing a shirt. Masamori crossed his arms and said, \"I want you to hold up my foot for as long as you can. Push yourself to your limits and beyond!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen braced himself, sweat already dripping down his face. He was already weary, passed his limits. His pride wouldn't allow him to admit it however. He kept it up, his palms growing sweaty as he forced himself to keep holding the foot up. Masamori flexed his toes and applied slightly more pressure. His gaze was absolute. If Gen looked to be even in the slightest bit of danger, he would be helped.</span></div></div>",

His nose picked up on a scent that he recognized as Yoshimori's! This must have been his house... Gen rubbed his head sleepily, and got to his feet. He felt a little off balanced for a moment as he then started making his way out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the door opened, Gen's nose was hit with a different smell! It was sweet, alluring, delicious! Gen started walking down the hall to try to find the source of it all. It was so familiar to him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen followed his nose, and it led him right to the Sumimura's kitchen! As Gen peeked in through the crack of the wall, he saw someone at the counter with a bandana on their head. Gen immediately recognized it as Yoshimori, and stepped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori was mixing batter, but turned to look at the door as soon as he heard it open! \"Oh, Gen! There you are sleepyhead!\" He said happily, \"I'm glad you're finally awake! We have to get going soon.\" Yoshimori explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going...?\" Gen asked groggily as he rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! To Karasumori!\" Yoshimori replied, \"But are you feeling okay?\" Yoshimori asked Gen, just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah... I'm fine...\" He said softly, \"... How did I get here...?\" He asked Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori shrugged before saying, \"I thought you knew. I didn't see you at school, so I thought you were sick or something. I was going to go visit you after I got home, but as soon as I went up to my room, there you were, sleeping like a baby! So I just left you there. You didn't feel like you were running a fever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen ran his hand over his head, just to confirm it. He wasn't sick, was he? And that ayakashi... Did that really happen? Or was it just a nightmare? And if it was just a dream, how did he wind up at Yoshimori's house? He vividly remembered going to sleep in his own house last night... Gen looked down at himself, and found that he was shirtless! Not to mention all he had on was a pair of black shorts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, what happened to my clothes!?\" He shouted unnecessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they were dirty!\" Yoshimori replied, \"You couldn't sleep in those. So I found that for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean you...!?\" Gen said, turning away as he held his crotch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All nine inches.\" Yoshimori replied with a snake-like grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You... I can't believe...\" Gen grumbled aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey now, don't worry! I won't tell anyone!\" He said. He had walked over and was putting his arm over Gen's shoulder. He still held a spatula in his hand, and it was hovering just below Gen's head. \"Would it make you feel better if I let you lick the bowl?\" Yoshimori asked, gesturing twords the cookware. It was a joke, of course, but Yoshimori didn't even seen Gen's answer coming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He replied simply. He got out from under Yoshimori's arm, and over to the empty bowl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What?!\" Yoshimori rushed back over, \"But you told me you don't even like sweets!\" Yoshimori wasn't only surprised, but a little upset! After all, he loved to lick the bowl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this time's different.\" Gen replied. It was true, he wasn't the biggest fan of anything sweet, but for some reason, he felt differnt this time. He ran a finger along the edge of the bowl, getting lots of delicious batter on his finger. He then lifted it to his lips and tasted it! His eyes seem to fall closed as he enjoyed the full flavor, the sweet, creaminess of it all. It was like a whole new wave of flavor washing over his tongue! As he tasted it, he could only think of how he wanted more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... So?\" Yoshimori asked Gen, wanting to hear what he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it.\" He said plainly, \"Is there any more?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A loud DING sound drowned out whatever Yoshimori was about to say next. Gen's head turned toward the appliance, much like a dog or cat does when hearing a can opener. His nose twitched slightly as he turned back to Yoshimori. \"What's in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cakes, what else?\" Yoshimori said, shaking his head slightly. \"I suppose you're going to want to have one of these too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen nodded, licking his lips slightly, saliva pooling in his mouth. Yoshimori pulled a tray of miniature cakes out of the oven, about twelve of them situated on it. They were about three inches long and an inch wide, plain cake, though different flavors were present. Lemon cake, vanilla cake, chocolate cake, butterscotch, and more! The smell was intoxicating, filling the small kitchen with the delicious aroma. Gen quickly wiped his mouth while Yoshimori's back was turned, walking up to his smaller friend. He reached out for one of the cakes when Yoshimori slapped his hand with a wooden spoon, frowning at him. Gen winced and grabbed his hand, rubbing it slightly. \"What's your problem?\" He sounded slightly annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't even decorated them yet!\" Yoshimori said, waving his spoon at Gen. \"You can have one, and I mean ONE, when I'm done! The rest is for Tokine and I to share!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen sighed and crossed his arms, leaning against the counter, watching Yoshimori's every move. \"I don't understand why you even bother making anything for her. On the off chance she actually does ever eat anything you make she's nothing but condescending and rude about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori blushed and said, \"S-Shut up! She's not like that...\" Deep down inside, though, he knew Gen was right. He looked a little crestfallen as he decorated the cakes, adding frosting before putting in finer details. Bits of fruit, curls of cream, quick injections of filling, every new confection was making Gen hungrier and hungrier! He gently put his hand on his abs as he heard his stomach rumble loudly. Yoshimori raised an eyebrow as he heard the noise. Gen blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you staring at?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with you tonight? You don't even like sweets and you're practically drooling to have these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already told you, these are different...somehow.\" Gen said, running a hand wearily through his hair. He didn't understand it either and it wasn't easy to think when he was so hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori put the finishing touches on the cakes and said, \"There! Done~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen immediately grabbed the nearest cake and shoved it whole into his mouth, slurping the frosting off his fingers as he chewed it up, swallowing the mass of cake down in one gulp, a huge bulge traveling down his throat, disappearing behind his buff chest. He let out a satisfied sigh and immediately grabbed another one, eating this one more slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! I said one! ONE!\" Yoshimori shouted, waving his arms around, walking up towards Gen. The taller teen pushed his back against the counter, lifting a foot up and pressing it against Yoshimori's chest, holding him back while he ate his second, third, and fourth cake. \"HEEEEEEEY!\" Yoshimori yelled angrily, smacking Gen's muscly leg with his spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down, I'm not going to eat all of them...probably.\" Gen said, picking up two more, stuffing them one after another into his mouth. \"Mmmm...these are really, really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori looked surprised, ceasing his struggling. It helped that he was also getting tired as the night progressed. \"Really? You think they're that good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't normally like sweets right?\" Gen said, picking up another cake and munching on it. \"That should be proof enough there's something special about these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori blushed a little, rubbing the back of his head. \"Yeah, I guess so...~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the pan was pretty much empty, Gen was finally starting to feel full. He picked up one more, leaving about four cakes left. \"There. Two for you, two for her.\" Gen said, straightening back up, removing his foot from Yoshimori's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! Yeah, right. Thanks.\" Yoshimori said, packing the four treats up into a box. Somehow, despite the fact he did this all the time, this felt wrong. \"Y-You sure you don't want another one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Gen said, rubbing his full stomach. \"Not right now. Maybe later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Yoshimori said, sounding disappointed. \"Anyway, your clothes are in the laundry room. It's not what you normally wear when we go to Karasumori but it should work for one night, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Gen said, walking down the hall to the laundry room. It was quiet in the house. Not the normal stillness of a full house where everyone was sleeping but a kind of vacant silence, like no one else was there. He made it to the laundry room and quickly dressed himself, his white shirt falling a little awkwardly down over his stomach. It was pushing out slightly, stuffed full of cake. He grimaced, poking at his abs slightly. \"What's coming over me? I've never done anything like that before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way back to the kitchen, only to find it empty. \"Must be in his room.\" Gen decided, heading that way. He opened the door to Yoshimori's room, catching him just as he dropped his pants, revealing his nude body in all its glory to his friend. Yoshimori stared, mouth hanging open while Gen stared. He pointed at the pale teen and said, \"Now we're even.\" Without another word, he closed the door, listening to the curses coming from inside the room with a small smile.</span></div></div>",

With their little troupe complete everything was set. Even Gen, who was already starting to think about all the tasty little treats that Yoshimori hid inside his bag. He seemed to be keeping an irregularly tight grip on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived at Karasumori without incident. As Yoshimori looked around, he found it strange that Tokine wasn't waiting for him at the gate like she usually was. However, after a brief moment, Hakubi came down from above!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoshimori! Oh, Yoshimori!\" He called as he fluttered down, \"Ah, there you are! Tokine sent me here to tell you she can't make it tonight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" Yoshimori asked, walking a little closer to the ghostly black dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she had a little bit of a spill and now her ankle is, well, sprained.\" Hakubi explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Is she okay!?\" Yoshimori shouted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, she's fine. In fact, she was more worried about you. But! She said as long as Gen is here with you, everything should be okay.\" Hakubi told him, \"After all, next to Mistress Tokine, Gen IS the most capable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I get it.\" Yoshimori replied plainly, less than interested in anything else Hakubi had to say, \"Why don't you just get home?\" Yoshimori replied, walking right by, \"Some of us actually have work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Why don't you go fluttering back to that little hovel you call a house?\" Madarao taunted as he flew past, keeping up with Yoshimori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You...!\" Hakubi grunted in anger. Gen quickly followed Yoshimori. It was almost like a puppy following it's master for a treat! Realizing anything he said would go unnoticed, he flew back home. Not to mention his argument would be invalid against two bull-headed twits like the Sumimuras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gen caught up with Yoshimori, his head was practically on the smaller male's shoulder! \"So... Since Tokine's gone... I get her food, right?\" He tried asking casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, sure.\" Yoshimori replied absent mindedly. \"C'mon Gen, let's get to work!\" He said, setting the container down in a safe place before running off onto the school grounds! Gen glanced at the container, a painful wanting in his eyes as he did! He shook his head as he remembered what he was here to do in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night seemed to drag on for Gen, and it was only the beginning of the job! Soon enough, however, the two boys managed to dwindle the population down to a small enough level that Madarao and Gen couldn't sniff out anymore. Gen made a rush back to where Yoshimori had put the container down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gen arrived on the scene, he noticed Yoshimori was already setting down the blanket! Gen immediately rushed over to join him, taking a seat on the comfy surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I don't think I've ever seen you this excited... Well, ever!\" Yoshimori told Gen as he opened up the tin! He chuckled a little, and handed two of the cakes to Gen, who seemed to be staring them down! As soon as they left Yoshimori's hands, they entered Gen's, and the tanned teen seemed to tear right into them! In three big bites, Gen had the first one devoured, making a huge mess all over the blanket, and not to mention his face! He then began tearing into the other one! His lips smacked together as he seemed to shove it into his mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, can't you at least appreciate the flavor!?\" Yoshimori barked at Gen! \"I spent a lot of time on these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen glanced at Yoshimori for a moment, who was also holding a cake in his hand. The two boys locked eyes for a moment, as a dead silence rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... No.\" Yoshimori suddenly said, as if in defiance. Gen started to crawl twords him with that same ravenous hunger in his eyes! \"Gen, get away! Th-This one's mine!\" Yoshimori told him. It was all futile. Gen leapt at Yoshimori and his mouth made a dive for Yoshimori's hand! Gen held Yoshimori's wrist, and, using his superior strength, shoved the cake into his mouth all at once!  Yoshimori was shocked, and while he could, made a grab for his other cake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Gen finished one, he was frantically looking for the other! As he saw Yoshimori eating it, his insticts were to get that cake, no matter the cost! Gen tried to break Yoshimori's hand away from his face, but when he saw that it wasn't working, he knew there was only one thing to do!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- SMOOCH! -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen had started to kiss Yoshimori to get the cake back from him! Yoshimori clenched his teeth, denying Gen any access! The half-ayakashi man had to resolve to licking Yoshimori's cheeks, which both tickled, and felt kind of funny! As Yoshimori swallowed the cake he had frantically eaten, he started to push back at Gen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gen, stop! Ahaha! S-Stop! Get off!\" Yoshimori barked through his laughter. Gen was a big guy, and though he didn't quite know it, he was getting bigger all the time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two boys struggled and fought a bit, they barely noticed as an ayakashi floated down, hovering over top of them. \"Oh my! What's this? A couple of quarreling boys? that won't do at all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoshimori and Gen both looked up, seeing a small, fairy like creature with long hair, wearing a dress that was as elaborate and decorated as a cake, a fancy hat shaped like a peppermint situated on her head. She was holding a magic want that seemed to be made out of a waffle cone with a chocolate covered ice cream star at the end. Yoshimori groaned and said, \"What the hell are you supposed to be? Get out of here! We're busy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ayakashi puffed out her cheeks, glaring at the raven haired teen. \"Oh! Oh! Rude! Rude, rude, rude! How very rude! I should wash your mouth out with soap you rude, rude boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen slowly got to his feet, licking his lips a little. The more he looked at this ayakashi, the more hungry he became! He was starting to see her as more like a living confectionery treat rather than a demon! She either didn't notice, or didn't care, still focused on Yoshimori. \"Nobody treats Keki Yasashii like a cake after Christmas! Take THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her wand, causing a shadow to appear over Yoshimori's head. He raised and eyebrow and looked up, yelling in fright as an enormous cake landed right on top of him, pinning him to the ground! The ayakashi giggled, twirling around in the air. \"That's what you get~ Now be pressed to jelly under my delicious cake~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen officially lost all interest in the ayakashi as the delicious, moist scent of the cake filled his nose. He started to visibly drool, wiping his mouth as he slowly walked toward the cake. It was at least six feet tall, covered in enormous sugar roses and swirls, strawberries the size of beach balls sitting on the top. Madarao flew into the cake and flew back out, reporting what he saw. \"Yoshimori is trapped under there! The cake is filled with chocolate! It's making the thing so heavy he can't move! If you don't get him out of there soon he'll be crushed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the danger his friend was in, Gen quickly tried to tear the cake apart, intending to destroy it so he could reach Yoshimori. His hands just phased through the cake, not able to touch it, let alone move it! The ayakashi giggled and wagged her finger back and forth. \"Naughty, naughty~ You can't get rid of a cake that delicious just by destroying it~ You have to eat it! Aaaaaall of it if you want to save that rude boy~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said this with the total confidence that Gen wouldn't be able to eat even a portion of the massive sweet. Gen clenched his fist determinedly and shoved his hands into the cake, this time with the intent of eating! He scooped up two massive hunks, chocolate already oozing out of the holes, and shoved them into his mouth! He smacked and slurped and gulped as his sharp teeth ripped into the cake, his throat bulging as he swallowed down massive quantities all at once! Madarao's mouth hung open, as did Keki's, the two spirit creatures watching in awe as Gen gorged himself. He didn't pause, didn't slow, drinking the molten chocolate like it was water, his stomach swiftly swelling! His abs disappeared almost instantly as his belly bulged out, pushing against the net undershirt he was wearing, as well as his purple gi. He groaned a little as he felt himself getting full but kept pushing. He wanted to save Yoshimori more than anything...but the cake's flavor was just too intoxicating to stop either way!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach wasn't the only thing changing. His once toned chest became to sag, becoming rounder and fuller, resting on top of his expanding gut. His arms were swelling as well, filling his sleeves, tearing them slightly. His legs followed suit, his pant legs becoming tight around his fattening thighs and doughy calves, his feet stretching across the cold grass, pressing down against the ground, digging into it. Gen's cheeks grew rounder and softer as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is both touching and completely disgusting.\" Madarao said, shaking his head, a paw over his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness! I've never seen anyone eat sweets like him!\" Keki said enthusiastically, clasping her hands. \"He might be the first human to actually eat one of my desserts completely!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen ignored them both, half the cake now demolished in front of him. He paused for a moment, listening. He could faintly detect Yoshimori breathing. He was so close! A little more and he'd be free! He let out a thunderous belch and went back to eating! Handful after handful disappeared into his belly, the shirt ripping down the front, unable to hold back that quivering mass of tanned flesh! He was starting to feel like a sumo, spreading his legs to accommodate his gut, his hands still moving at lightning speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after nearly fifteen minutes of constant gorging, the cake was gone, leaving a dazed Yoshimori and a panting, chocolate and cake covered Gen, his eyes half open as his belly churned and growled, his entire body gone soft and pudgy. He fell down onto his much more cushioned ass, rubbing his gut with a groan. Yoshimori slowly sat up, rubbing his head. \"Ugh...w-what happened to me?\" He noticed Gen, his eyes widening. \"What happened to YOU?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later...\" Gen said with a long exhale. \"Ayakashi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed at the sweet looking demon, who merely winked and floated away. \"If you want me, you'll have to caaaatch meeeee~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Yoshimori said with a grin, holding his hand up! \"You rest Gen! I'll take care of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yoshimori gave chase...</span></div></div>",

Kagome had returned back home, Miroku and Sango (and Kilala too!) had both went off together, and Inuyasha could care less where Shippou had wandered off to. Inuyasha could actually say he felt calm for the first time in what felt like years! He was planning on just sitting back, relaxing, and not having to worry about anyone or anyTHING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Or at least, so he had hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha walked along the vast plains, his arms behind his head. A gentle breeze blew the grass and the trees, and the sky couldn't be bluer. As Inuyasha walked along, his stomach start to rumble... It was time to hunt! Inuyasha took an abrupt turn off the path, and started looking for an animal to take down with a single slash of his sword!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving aside some shrubbery and a bush here and there, Inuyasha had yet to find even one thing that looked even remotely tasty. Deciding to lie in wait, Inuyasha sat down with his back against a tree. Just as he did, a fruit fell from above and konked him on the head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the hell is that!?\" Inuyasha said, frantically looking around. As the half demon looked up, he couldn't see anything hiding up in the treetops. As he then looked back down at his side, he saw some kind of fruit that must have fallen from above. Inuyasha picked it up, and looked it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had sort of a pear shape, but it was a darker, leafy green in color, which might be why he couldn't see anymore up in the tree tops. Just to be on the safe side, Inuyasha got to his feet, and hopped up into the tree. Sure enough, once he got a closer look, he was able to see that there were plenty more fruit hiding in the tree! The scent was soothing and sweet. Inuyasha took a second look at the fruit, before taking a big bite out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taste was... About average. Nothing really all that special to Inuyasha. The cup ramen Kagome had always bought him tasted better, in his opinion. However, just as Inuyasha swallowed it, he could feel an energy burning within him! It wasn't painful... In fact, it was the exact opposite! It felt wonderful! Inuyasha took a few more bites, not even noticing what was slowly happening to his athletic body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha's shoulders started to push out further from his body, giving him a broad, manly look. His arms were bulking up quickly, filling the sleeves, and adding to his impressive strength, to which his forearms quickly followed. His back became more defined and massive, leaving long, powerful ripples all the way down. The dog demon's pecs swelled up, gaining far more size and mass than the rest of his body. His slender abs quickly became harder and cut, giving the man a powerful core. His legs were growing heavy, making the branch he crouched on crack slightly, but he was too busy enjoying the fruit to notice! His thighs grew a little thicker, and his calves beefing up to a thick softball size. Just as Inuyasha's bare feet swelled up a few sizes larger, the half-breed's dick had started to engorge and put on some size of it's own, pushing out so a soft bulge was noticable in his pants! Not to mention his already cute butt was quickly packing on some muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha wiped his mouth of the juices from the fruit and sighed. That really hit the spot! Standing back up to his full size, which was just a few inches taller now, he stretched his back, not even noticing the changes yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Inuyasha...</span></div></div>",

The little boy, who had been left down a well by Inuyasha in an attempt to ditch him, was hot on the trail, sniffing out the half-demon's scent.

As he kept smelling around, he suddenly caught the scent of something sweet! Easily distracted, the fox boy started following this smell instead, and wound up in the same tree Inuyasha had! Shippou looked up, putting his hand over his head to see past the sun's rays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Shippou began to scurry up the tree until he was able to rest on a branch. \"There's fruit up here!\" Just at that moment, Shippou's stomach started to grumble. \"Oohh... And just in time too!\" He whimpered. He reached up and grabbed one of the fruits off of the tree and took a big bite! The ravenous little boy bit and chewed, juice flowing down his chin from his lips as he kept eating! And in but a minute, Shippou had eaten one of the fruits down to the core! He tossed it aside before reaching up for another!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou didn't even seem to notice his growing body, thanks to the hunger that blocked his mind! On his once flat chest, he started to get some definition, and seconds after that, he started putting on some mass! It all happened so quickly, and soon, his chest was pressed up against shirt as the two pecs ballooned outward. Shippou's arms weren't left out, as they too started beefing up! The once scrawny arms grew bigger and bigger, to baseball size, then even more! They just wouldn't stop growing because Shippou wouldn't stop eating! The boy's back started expanding outwards, along with his shoulders, making his outfit start feeling even more tight that it already was! In addition, just below his impressive pecs was a set of abs that were quickly popping up. In pairs they grew, toning and filling with a power of their own! Below the waist, Shippou's legs had started to bulk up, the thin muscles soon replaced by larger, heavier ones! His little fox feet were also packing on the size, no longer so puny! Shippou's cute, tight ass was soon becoming a thing of perfection, as it too was slowly growing into a sexy, sculpted shape. On top of it all, his once small boyhood pulsed slightly, as the fruit's powers got to it too! It grew bigger and thicker, about to the size of a full-grown man's dick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShippou kept eating, and eating, and EATING, his body continuing to develop and grow with every fruit he downed! He didn't even hear the branch starting to creak and crack under his increasing weight! It soon became too late, and the branch snapped, setting the now large Shippou hurdeling to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Shippou hit the grass below, he groaned under his breath. Slowly he stood to his feet, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumb tree... Dumb branch...\" He mumbled to himself. At this point, Shippou was about...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shippou felt a strange heaviness in his body, coupled with an ache and not just an ache from the fall. His eyes were closed as he laid on the ground, groaning slightly. He sat up and tried to look down but his chin met with a strange resistance. Irritably, Shippou opened his eyes which immediately widened when he saw a massive set of pecs blocking his vision! With a little cry, he swiftly got to his feet, his hands slowly rubbing the bulging muscles below him. His look of shock was slowly replaced with a look of happiness as he realized that these massive muscles belonged to him! Each pec so swollen it looked like he had half a medicine ball slipped under each muscle, his shoulders so broad they almost were thicker than the tree, his traps surrounding his thick neck like a surrounding wall of a castle, making even Shippou's adorable boyish face intimidating! He flexed his arms slowly, watching in awe as the biceps bulged upward, thicker than a baseball, then a softball, then a soccer ball! Shippou giggled, surprised that his voice sounded just a hair deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands slowly worked their way down his body, tracing each thick brick of ab muscle, before slowly rubbing over his impressive length. He let out a sharp little moan as his touching slowly began to harden his dick, making Shippou blush slightly. \"Aw man...I'm naked! I hope no one sees me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tugged fruitlessly at the remains of his vest, the only thing that had managed to keep clinging to one arm, wedged in between his traps and shoulder. It looked like it would barely fit over his hand, let alone his bill board esque chest! The rest of his kimono hadn't stood a chance, shredding to bits of fabric that were now littered about him. Shippou noticed at this point that he had made a bit of a crater when he landed. He got out of it and wobbled slightly, not used to such a heavy, taller body. Shippou's ears twitched slightly as he suddenly realized that he not only had the muscles of a fox god, he was far taller too! He quickly measured himself against the tree and grinned. Before, he had to scamper up the trunk to reach even the lowest branches. Now they were brushing the top of his head! \"I have to be over twice as tall as Inuyasha now! I'm the biggest and the strongest in our group now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled childishly as he realized this, no longer caring that he was butt naked, his firm ass facing outward from the tree as he looked it over. Shippou was young, but he was no fool. He had been his normal size when he had climbed this tree and something about it had made him grow so huge he had broken a branch and fallen out. What else could it be but the miraculous fruit hanging from its branches? Shippou was about to climb back up the tree to inspect the fruit further when he got a somewhat wicked grin on his face. He gripped the tree tightly in his arms and began to shake it wildly! The tree groaned as though in pain, it's branches jerking around almost like it was protesting its treatment, the green pear shaped fruit falling like rain all around him. Shippou kept shaking until every single fruit had fallen from the tree. Once he had started, he just couldn't seem to stop! All of this new strength was quite intoxicating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he surveyed the area, he realized he might have been a bit TOO rough. Several of the fruit had smashed as they hit the ground, their juices trickling down the hill in a steady stream. Unknown to Shippou, the juices dripped into the river, slowly mingling with the water and spreading it to the nearby village. The meat of the fruit, without the pungent juice within it, almost instantly rotted, the cloying smell of decayed fruit filling the air. Shippou's nose wrinkled in distaste as he began to gather up the intact fruit, absentmindedly munching on them as he kept gathering them up. Soon, he had a sizable arm full. The former tiny fox boy grinned and started walking, eating the fruit as he went, eager to find Inuyasha and finally put him in his place for all the times he had been beaten up! He was a bit clumsy, however, and for every fruit he ate, another one or two tumbled from his arms, rolling down hill and landing in a random yard, others rolling to a stop next to a small boy who was fishing, still others getting picked up by some bigger kids, grinning bullies who greedily took the fruit for themselves.One by one, the fruits were found by men and boys, humans and demons, of all ages, shapes, and sizes. Without meaning to, Shippou was propagating the Oni Fruit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, the tree which housed the One Fruit slowly shook its branches, even more pear shaped fruits growing on its branches. A low, deep voice issued out from the trunk. \"At last...my seeds will spread. Thanks to the jewel shards embedded in my trunk, my Oni Fruit's potency has increased a thousand fold! Centuries of waiting, of planning, will finally bear...fruit.\" A dark chuckle was heard as the demonic tree slowly shook its branches, the movement so subtle it would have been mistaken as an errant breeze. The sweet, pungent aroma of the fruit mingled with the air, drawing in humans and demons alike to sample the powerful fruit. </span></div></div>",

Inuyasha would have remained asleep if it wasn't for someone accidentally stepping on his leg as they ran by! Inuyasha awoke with a yelp, instantly sitting up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! What the hell...?!\" Inuyasha grumbled. Before his eyes could fully open and he could become aware of his surroundings, the attacker had vanished! \"... Whatever. I guess I need to get up anyway...\" Inuyasha said to himself, before standing up and dusting himself off. He started moving for the center of town where he could look for something to eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, some poor boy was being chased by another boy. He was only ten, with messy black hair and onyx eyes, and was just barely five feet tall. He was being chased by the local bully, who was much taller at 5'7\", with light brown hair and green eyes. The chase carried on, the bully coming within inches of grabbing the boy before the smaller male's nimble reflexes helped him dodge the hand! It felt like it went on forever to the boy, before he tripped and fell near the town's stream. Just as he was scrambling to get back up, a foot came down on his back and held him down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I finally got you, Hiroki!\" The bully said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, let me go, Koroku!\" Hiroki demanded, wiggling and squirming beneath the foot. It just made Koroku feel powerful as he watched the boy's fruitless endeavors! And it was only going to get worse...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoroku picked Hiroki up and flipped him over! He then sat on the boy, feeling oh-so quite cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get offa me, Koroku! You weigh a ton!\" Hiroki barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on, don't you wanna see what I found?\" Koroku asked. He reached into his top and pulled out one of the Oni fruit. \"Isn't it awesome? It's so big and juicy...\" Koroku waved it before Hiroki's nose. \"And just smell it! It's so sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-So?!\" Hiroki replied, drooling just a little. Koroku made it look so good! \"It's just some stupid fruit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Poor, stupid Hiroki! You still don't even know, do you?\" Koroku taunted, \"This fruit... It's special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whadd'ya mean special?\" Hiroki replied, looking up at Koroku with confusion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I could tell you... Or I could just show you!\" With that, Koroku started to tear ravenously into the fruit, the nectar dribbling down his lips, past his chin and onto his chest! He didn't stop until the whole fruit was devoured, core and all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? It makes you into a gigantic pig?!\" Hiroki barked. Koroku had a smooth grin on his face, before leaning down and belching right in Hiroki's face! \"Augh, you're disgusting!\" Hiroki whined. He would have fanned his face if his arms weren't pinned down! As Hiroki opened his eyes, he could hear crunching and slurping. He looked up to see Koroku eating another one of the fruits! \"H-Hey, you had two!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second fruit quickly met a similar end as the first. Koroku licked his lips before wiping his mouth on his forearm. He had a smug little grin on his face as he looked down at Hiroki. Hiroki gave him the usual glare, before he started to notice that something was... Off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoroku's lightly tanned chest had started to push outward, his youthful body quickly developing two large, healthy pecs! The muscles on his arms were slowly growing, the thin appendages welling up and growing even larger! His forearms quickly followed, completing the look! As his chest pushed further out, his top spread apart, and his abs were growing more defined! Hiroki could feel Koroku's increasing weight press down on him! Koroku's thighs bulked up, pressing closer into Hiroki's sides with every passing moment! His calves had started to increase as well, a large, baseball sized bump forming as they grew! Hiroki could only watch in horror as his tormentor was growing bigger, larger, and even stronger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, what do you think of me now!?\" Koroku asked, flexing one of his new, bulging biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Koro...\" Hiroki gulped, gazing up at Koroku's powerful physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You can't even say my name! Am I really that amazing to a runt like you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroki was at a loss for words. He had no idea what he would do now... He had no idea what he COULD do now! Anything he did to try to escape would just be pointless...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Inuyasha walked through town, he couldn't help but notice that all the men had seemed to bulk up suddenly... A scrawny peasat farmer he saw as he came into town was now significantly bigger, with muscles that matched Inuyasha's! The young half-deamon couldn't help but feel that something was amok here, but he couldn't quite tell what just yet...</span></div></div>",

It was here on the outskirts of a the forest that the Owari Shrine stood. An ancient building that seemed to withstand the test of time. Within the walls were two young men. One a powerful and cunning demon wolf known as Kouga. The other a mere novice priest, named Hiroyuki, who was rather arrogant and incompetent. Kouga was embarassed to have been captured by such a weak young child not much older than himself! It was today that Kouga's life was going to make a dramatic change. After today, nothing would ever be the same again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy was spreading purifying salts in a circle, around a stake where Kouga was tied. The ropes binding his wrists were covered in seals crafted by priests and priestesses of higher rank. Try as he might, Kouga just couldn't seem to break free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! I can't believe I finally caught a real demon!\" Hiroyuki said happily to himself. \"Heh, I knew it was only a matter of time! I guess only someone like me could catch the leader of the Yoro clan! Sensei is gonna be so proud...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! How about you loosen these ropes a little? They're cutting into my wrists!\" Kouga shouted at Hiroyuki. \"Tell you what, I have an even better deal for 'ya! Set me free now and I won't kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence demon!\" Hiroyuki shouted, tossing a handfull of the salts at Kouga's face. Kouga immediately winced, the powerful odor of the salts practically burning his nose hairs! \"Once I've exercised you, I'll have brought the land one step closer to peace!\" Hiroyuki babbled on. \"Besides! One as scrawny as yourself could never tear these ropes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrawny!? Yeah, I bet I could kick your ass!\" Kouga said, geting more fired up! Hiroyuki, not one to back down, opened up his kimono, giving Kouga a flash of his body. For a priest, he was ripped! Though his frame didn't have a whole lot more mass than Kouga, the difference in definition couldn't be denied! Sculpted pecs and a cut, rock-hard six-pack... Kouga could just barely see his broad shoulders and a little bit of bicep! It didn't scare him, but it was a small blow to his morale...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to speak again, demon?\" Hiroyuki replied in a demeaning tone, a cocky smile on his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga looked aside and just grumbled to himself. \"Geez, how was I supposed to know he was jacked...?\" He then caught Hiroyuki tying his kimono back up, a smug grin on his face. Kouga had to think up a lie, and he needed on quick! \"I-I'm a lot stronger than you think, you stupid kid!\" Kouga shouted, shaking around once again! A little psyching up and he was back on the saddle! Hiroyuki just let out a boisterous laugh as he watched Kouga's fruitless struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight all you like! Your fate will still be the same!\" Hiroyuki replied, that grin still on his face. With the salts in a circle around Kouga, Hiroyuki fetched his master's staff from the corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nan excited Hiroyuki stood before Kouga, holding the staff out in front of him. The staff seemed rather typical; a dark oak rod with a circular gold ornament, rings hanging around the ornament. Kouga gulped a little as he looked on at the boy. Was this really it for him? A little bit of panic was already starting to settle in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroyuki took a breath before banging the base of the staff on the floor. He began to mutter some kind of chant that Kouga couldn't quite make out. Slowly, as Hiroyuki stood there chanting, the room became dramatically dark. A red flame seemed to suddenly be burning off the salts, making a ring of fire around Kouga! Kouga gulped a little as he looked around him, watching the fire crackle and pop! Hiroyuki started to bang the staff on the floor once again, and in an instant, the flame all gatherd into the tip of the staff! Hiroyuki opened his eyes and glared at Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the holy flames blessed unto my staff, I banish you, demon, back to the pits of hell!\" Hiroyuki held the staff out with both hands. The fire blasted out of the tip and right at Kouga! Kouga began to shout in pain as the flames enveloped him, but they did not burn him... In fact, they were actually...</span></div></div>",

He looked down at himself and at the fire. It didn't hurt at all! In fact... It actually felt good! It felt really good! Kouga chuckled as he looked over at Hiroyuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, looks like your little plan backfired! This doesn't hurt at all!\" Kouga barked, getting a cocky smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What?! You lie! You're lying!\" Hiroyuki replied, banging his staff on the floor and forcing more flames to shoot out at Kouga! Kouga in turn just laughed, wiggling a little as he was tied to the pole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha! Yeah! Keep going! That tickles!\" Kouga laughed in Hiroyuki's face, It was just then that he felt the fire burn through the ropes and seals, setting him loose! Kouga stumbled forward, just managing to catch himself. He rubbed his wrists a little and started walking towards Hiroyuki. Hiroyuki started to step back, before Kouga suddenly stopped in his tracks! He fell to his knees suddenly, groaning noisily. Hiroyuki then took a step forward, a confident grin on his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! I knew it would work! I knew it--\" Hiroyuki stopped speaking in an instant as he was looking at Kouga who <i>appeared</i> he was curled up in pain. But if that was true... Then why was he getting bigger!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga's body was starting to grow larger and taller, and not to mention stronger! His biceps wrapped around his chest, once thin and athletic were starting to pump up and fill with pure meat! His entire body seemed to grow in small bursts as the flames around him seemed to spin and enter his body! Kouga's groans were slowly turning into a maniacal laugh! He looked up at Hiroyuki with a sinister grin. He slowly got to his feet, glaring the boy down. His pecs were swelling up like balloons, straining the armor that he wore on his chest! He abs, which couldn't be seen at the moment, were growing into a hardened six-pack! His dark laughed bellowed within the room as the powerful demon grew even stronger! He started walking closer to Hiroyuki, thick, powerful calves packed with tightly coiled muscles glowed in the faint light of the room, and his calves had become large, muscled pillars of pure strength. His footfalls were making a faint rumble throughout the room! Kouga's head was already starting to reach the ceiling as he continued to grown buffer by the second! The strips that held his armor had long since snapped away, giving way to his bulging, gigantic pecs. His large feet were taking up more and more of the floor, making a noisy \"THOOM\" with every step!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying, you little human?\" Kouga replied, nearly stomping his foot onto Hiroyuki! He would have crushed him flat if it wasn't for Hiroyuki's arms just managing to hold him off! Kouga's fur kilt couldn't hide his giant cock and balls any longer! The large log of beef dangled between his legs, as the bottom of his huge, round ass was visible from behind! Hiroyuki winced as he tried to hold Kouga off, but luck was not on his side. Kouga suddenly burst upward another size! The wolf demon moaned, his head smashing into the ceiling now! Hiroyuki was driven down into the wooden foundation of the shrine, unable to move beneath the gargantuan appendage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga had started to gasp, his baring his large, sharp, feral teeth.

The walls were starting to push outward, making the shrine bloat outward from all angles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroyuki, who was watching from outside, looked back at the shrine. It was starting to rumble and shake, the wood starting to groan as Kouga grew into a massive beast! In but an instant, the shrine exploded, leaving Kouga sitting on his ass in the center of town! Hiroyuki shouted in fright, and turned to make a run for it, afraid of what Kouga might do to him! Kouga moaned slight, rubbing his head as he rubbed his head. It didn't take long for a group of people starting to gather around the gargantuan wolf king! Kouga soon opened his eyes, looking down and around at all the little ants that had gathered around him! He smiled nervously as he looked down at all of them, unable to see some of them past the swell of his massive chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Hey!\" Kouga said with a chuckle, \"Sorry about your little hut there...\" Kouga stood up, careful not to step on anyone as he did. His clothes didn't even fit anymore, and had long since abandoned his now nude, rippling physique. He towered over the rest of the people, nearly 40 feet tall! No one seemed to say a word to him, almost as if afraid of what Kouga would do to them if they dared outrage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga stared down at them, some of the villagers flinching in fear as he did. Kouga let out a nervous chuckle before saying, \"I'm just gonna... Get going...\" Kouga watched his step as he made his way away from the center of town and away from the crowd, who still seemed to be watching him! He glanced back at them, and in that instant, he tripped over a small abandoned shack! It was decimated beneath his gargantuan body, crushed beneath his pumped up muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shit!\" Kouga said under his breath, getting up instantly! He looked down through the debris of it all, making sure that no one was inside. Thankfully, all he seemed to find was wood and some stone. With a sigh of relief, Kouga quickly made his way to the edge of the town, and made his escape out into the vast fields!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was nuts...\" Kouga said to himself, looking at his hand as he opened and closed it, \"Not bad though! Look at how buff I am!\" Kouga flexed his biceps as he walked. He got a smirk on his face as he saw just how gigantic he was! \"Mm, yeah! Not bad! Not bad at all!\" He said with a little grunt. He stopped, setting his hands on his hips and flexing his pecs! They swelled outward, like two gigantic beach balls! \"Heh heh, yeah! I'm a real stud!\"  He thought to himself with a grin. Kouga kept on walking, making his way home...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kouga strode across the forest like a colossus, a small smile on his face as his every step caused the ground to quake, trees rustling, sending birds flying into the air, frightened. His thick toes dug into the soft soil of the earth, uprooting smaller trees, creating small craters, and crushing rocks into dust, all without feeling the slightest pain in his soles! The dense muscles of his body and new thickness of his skin acted like an armor, protecting him from such puny damage. Experimentally, he moved his foot forward, catching a thick oak between his big and second toe. With a slight twitch, he snapped it as easily as he normally would a twig, the two halves of the tree crashing to the ground on either side of his foot. \"Hah! That was too easy!\" He said arrogantly, stomping on a nearby tree, loving the feeling of it exploding into splinters under his immense weight. \"Too bad there's nothing here that's an actual challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud roar cut through the air, making Kouga's ear twitch slightly. The sound was coming from at least a hundred miles away, the soft sound of human screams heard between the roars. Kouga grinned, turning his body slightly, bending down a little, his calves tensing as he prepared to run. \"Well, well, lucky me!\" He said, propelling himself forward, running towards the roars! It was like a hurricane had suddenly hit! A massive cyclone surrounded Kouga's body, cutting a swath of destruction before him, obliterating the forest and the occasional demon as he ran. He skidded to a halt after only running a few minutes, the great distance covered far faster than he normally would have been able to do! A trip of over a day, covered in minutes! He put his hands on his hips, looking down past his mountainous pecs at a village. It was small, only home to a few hundred people. On the other side of it, Kouga spotted a gigantic demon, standing at least equal to his forty feet, it's body that of a blue skinned human while the head was that of an elephant, the tusks wickedly curved around an impressive snout. He was wearing nothing more than a loincloth, his body heavily muscled. He unleashed another roar, the noise trumpeting through the air, bringing about another fresh round of screams from the human inhabitants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKouga snorted and glared at the demon, calling him out! \"Hey! You! What the hell do you think you're doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon turned to face Kouga, laughing as he saw the massive wolf. \"If it isn't an overgrown fleabag! I am merely claiming my tribute from this village! Since they lack any tribute of food or jewelry I am taking their lives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scooped up a crowd of humans with his trunk, stuffing them into his mouth, swallowing them whole! Kouga gritted his teeth and said, \"Oh yeah? Well I'm not going to let that happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon laughed again. \"What makes you think you can stop me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" Kouga shouted, running through the village, smashing his fist against the demon's face, knocking him down onto his ass! Ever since meeting Kagome Kouga had completely changed his views towards humans. Where he once pillaged human villages and murdered them indiscriminately, letting his pack devour an entire group of them without batting an eye. Now, however, he went out of his way to help humans, not letting them be murdered if he could help it. The humans at his feet, however, just saw two monstrous demons fighting over their village, their panic only increasing. The elephant demon slowly got back to his feet, glaring at Kouga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You rotten bastard! I won't forgive you for this!\" He shouted, stomping the ground, charging Kouga! He wrapped his enormous arms around Kouga, his giant biceps pressing tightly into Kouga's back, pinning him hard against his rock hard pecs. Kouga struggled but couldn't break the grip, getting slammed against the ground, destroying at least three houses! Kouga leaned up and slashed his claws across the demon's chest, forcing him back, kicking him in the knee, making him stumble. The demon plunged his trunk into a nearby lake, sucking up the water. He straightened his trunk, blowing the water out, the energy inside his body turning the water into blades, cutting deeply into Kouga's body, even as he guarded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nngh! That all you got?!\" Kouga shouted defiantly, leaping on him, forcing him to the ground again before biting his neck, ripping a chunk out of his throat. The demon trumpeted in pain, adrenaline bringing him to his feet, his tusk goring Kouga in the arm! Kouga kicked and kicked at him, driving his bear foot into the demon's trunk, breaking it, before his toe claw plunged into the demon's eye, blinding it! Kouga managed to pull his arm free, holding the wound closed before delivering a roundhouse kick, caving in the demon's throat! All of this trauma finally brought the beast down, first to his knees and then fully supine, the light leaving his eyes. \"Feh! Pathetic!\" Kouga shouted, spitting on the demon's corpse. He turned around and saw a large group of humans watching him in awe. He grinned and gave a thumbs up. \"No problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers erupted in the village at Kouga's victory, one old man stepping up to speak to him. \"A god has saved our village! Please, stay with us as long as you wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God huh?\" Kouga said softly, scratching his chin. \"Not bad! I like the sound of that!\"</span></div></div>",

They all seemed to cheer happily as they heard that their savior would be staying with them! It brought a little smirk to the wolf man's face to hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, oh powerful one! We do not have much to offer, but hopefully a small portion of our crops will do?\" The man pleaded up at Kouga. \"I beg of you, do not abandon us for having so little!\" He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kouga looked down at the small cart of food. It wasn't full, heck, it barely even came up to half! But still, it made Kouga feel warm inside to know that these people were giving all they could just so Kouga would continue to protect them! \"Uh... Sure!\" Kouga said, taking as much as his hand could hold! Glancing down at them briefly, he plucked out some of the rice that he held in his palm and tossed it in his mouth! He swallowed it with ease, glancing down at the people. \"... Uh... Yum?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people seemed to cheer once again, glad to hear that their god was pleased! Just then, Kouga could have swore he felt his feet tingling! As he looked down, several of them had taken it upon themselves to rub his feet! Kouga just chuckled nervously. He liked being called a god, but all this new treatment was so new to him! Shrugging it off, Kouga checked his back before taking a seat, letting them better service him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, yeah! That feels great!\" Kouga said with a happy sigh, \"Hey, a little more to the right! And really get in my soles, got it?\" He said, enjoying his meal brought to him as the tiny, helpless people worshipped him. The massive man truly felt like a god! \"Nnn...\" Kouga grunted softly, he picked up a few of them and set them down on his thick pecs, before asking, \"Hey! Could you rub my chest too?\" He asked, laying on his back now. He soon felt the men getting to work on his chest, the muscles worked and softened without him even having to do a thing! Nothing could feel better...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting late, and young Hiroyuki was traveling out in the fields, feeling just a little bit bummed by his latest failure. \"What could have gone wrong? I did everything just like master said I should...\" Hiroyuki rubbed his head with his staff, \"And he's not going to be back from the mountains for another couple of years...!\" Hiroyuki's ears suddenly perked up! He could have swore he heard voices nearby! As he ran over and peeked through some bushes, he spotted Inuyasha and the gang all huddled together around a fire! It was then Hiroyuki got an idea, his rather selective vision only seeing the two demons in the group! \"Well... I could always capture one and try again... Maybe I'll use more purifying salts...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiroyuki remained in the bushes, waiting it out until the entire gang had fallen fast asleep! He got a sly grin on his face as he prepared to pluck one of them out...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edward was sitting far back in a chair in Roy Mustang's office, listening to him ramble on about something Ed truthfully could care less about. All he could gather was that Roy had returned from some conference with some kind of award. Of course, he took no time in showing it off to everyone, especially Ed. Roy knew that Ed was the most short tempered and easiest to annoy of his men, which is why he spared no expense to embarass and tease him at any moment possible! However, today was just not the day for Ed. All kinds of events today had reminded him of just how short he was. The first twenty times caused his usual spasms, but after a while, it just got old... And it wasn't much help that Roy kept talking how much of a \"big, important man\" he was, while Ed was just an \"expendable pipsqueak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, this time Ed was off in his own wonderland. If he was just a foot taller, how much he'd love to shove it back in everyone's face. As he sat there in the chair with a closed fist holding up his head, he chuckled to himself. Immediately, Roy caught wind of this, and turned to Ed from his self-absorbed speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So you finally see the humor in my story?\" Roy asked, actually feeling somewhat flattered for a moment there. Ed, of course, had to snap to right then and there, lest get a further lecture from Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah! Sure.\" Ed replied half-heartedly. The unamused enthusiasm in his speech spoke for itself. The bored look on his face didn't help any. Roy's face soon formed a frown as he looked at Ed. This was proving to be less fun than he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be all, Fullmetal.\" Roy said, sitting back down at his desk and shooing Ed away. After staring at Roy for just a moment, Ed stood back up to his feet and slowly walked to the door. Even his boots seemed to leave a boring click with every step he took, before it was all silenced with the shutting of Roy's office door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he heard the door shut, Alphonse, Edward's younger brother, looked up at Ed. They too had a brief staring contest before Al let out a yawn. \"Is he finally done?\" He asked, getting back up to his feet, \"My legs are half asleep...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your legs?\" Ed chuckled, \"I feel like my ears are about to fall off!\" Ed clapped his hand on Al's shoulder, smiling at him. \"Come on, let's head back to the hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two took their time returning to the hotel, looking up and down the market all the way home. Sometimes it was a bit of a pain to travel out to Central HQ from home, but the way Ed saw it, it never hurt to get out and see the world again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Brother! Look!\" Al called, pulling at Ed's arm. \"They have milk on sale, buy one get one half off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reply, Ed just stuck his tongue out. \"Bleh, Al, you know I hate that stuff...\" Al thought for a moment before chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, sorry! I forgot!\" He smiled, before running off into the crowd to get in on the sale. Ed just chuckled again. Ever since he got his body back, Al sure loved being able to enjoy everything he missed out on while he was in that suit of armor. The fluffy feel of kittens, the sweet and delicious taste of food, and the aroma of every little thing, good or bad! Though, he did kind of prefer the good ones...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd waited for a full five minutes or so, before Al came running back, the two jugs of milk in his arms as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll have one of these with dinner tonight!\" He said, grinning down at his brother. It was at this moment that Ed had realized how tall Al had gotten... All that milk must have been doing something for his body... Even so, Ed refused to drink the nasty stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the two boys were laying out in bed together. Ed got the window bed, but Al didn't mind much. He just loved being able to feel the comfy, coziness of an actual bed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, brother?\" Al asked in a calm, quiet voice. Ed turned his view from the window over to Al. \"I think I need a new shirt again... This one keeps rising up on me...\" Ed looked down a little further, and sure enough, the white button-up they had just bought Al about a week ago was already getting too small for him! It was hard to see, but with the help of the moonlight, Ed could have swore he saw Al's naval! Ed just let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... We'll go shopping for new clothes tomorrow...\" He told his younger brother, before turning his view back out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl chuckled somewhat nervously as he heard his brother's reply. \"I'm sorry...\" He said shyly. It was obvious to Ed that he wasn't apologizing for the clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay,\" Ed started out, \"You can't help what your body does.\" However, despite his word, Ed knew that exactly what Al was doing that was making him a size bigger every week... The eldest alchemist brother couldn't help but be filled with jealousy. Maybe just one day, he could wake up and have his clothes not fit. Maybe one day he could know how it feels to shop for larger clothes than what he needed since he was always growing. Maybe someday he could just know how it felt to be... Bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the simple, predictable thoughts rushed through his head, a star in the sky twinkled brighter than all the others for a brief moment. Ed caught wind of it, before a small frown crossed his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor little guy... All burned out...\" He thought quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did Ed know, it was quite the opposite. For the next morning he would wake up much bigger than before, however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Edward slept soundly, not even noticing as he body began to change. Under his black tanktop, his pecs began to jutt out, pressing against the soft material as it did. His pecs grew so large and bulbous that they peeked outside of either edge of the t-shirt. His nipples were on clear display! His left arm started beefing up, pumping from a slender egg size, to baseball, and in mere seconds, the size of a softball! Veins ran along the breadth, quivering slightly under such power. Ed's abs, which were already well-defined, began to pack on mass, pushing up higher and further out. Each one was perhaps smaller than Armstrong's, but packed quite the size! Ed giggled in his sleep a little, as he could feel his thigh start to bulk up, growing tighter in his boxers as the lining struggled to hold in the massive muscles. Ed's calves welled up, balling into a huge size easily five times the size of a normal man's fist! As Ed's feet began to enhance and grow, his entire body was increasing in size! While once he was able to fit comfortably on the bed, his hand soon touched the floor! Soon enough, his feet shoved past the foot of the bed and were hanging over the edge! To top it all off and give Ed a nice ego booster, his dick had slowly going through some enhancements of it's own! He was at an okay size for his age, but in a few seconds, he had a rod that would make any man weep with jealousy! Not to mention his boxers started to feel all the tighter as his ass grew into two huge bowling balls that stuck out nicely from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire time, Ed had remained asleep in his bed. One thing was for certian, he was in for a pleasant surprise in the morning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward Elric awoke with a yawn the next morning. As he smacked his lips and got to his feet, he began making his way to the bathroom. That is, he WOULD have made in, but just as he made it to the door, he hit his head on the top of the frame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Dammit!\" Ed groaned, rubbing his head. As he looked up, he quickly saw what had happened! \"What the...?\" Ed said. As he looked down, he gasped when he saw himself! From his bulging pecs to his diamond-cut calves, he was huge! Possibly rivaling even Armstrong! Ed chuckled almost hysterically as he looked over himself. \"Wh-Whoa... Look at me! I'm huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd began to laugh and dance around, almost unable to believe it! He just had to give himself a pinch, and sure enough, he wasn't dreaming! Ed smiled as he rose his arm and gave it a hard flex. A smile was plastered on his face as he watched the muscles thicken up under his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\" Ed said happily, \"I could get used to this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brother...?\" Al said softly as he sat up in bed, rubbing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al! Check me out!\" Ed told his little brother. He bent forward and did a crab flex, showing off his vascular arms and pumped up chest. As Al looked, his eyes went wide. \"So? Whadd'ya think?\" Ed asked with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Ed!\" Al shouted. The fact that he called his brother by his first name just showed how shocked he was! \"What happened to you!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno!\" Ed replied. He stood back up, flexing one of his biceps for Al to see. \"But whatever it is, I like it!\" Al just tilted his head down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make any sense... How could this have happened...?\" Al asked himself. Ed didn't really seem to care. He was enjoying being the huge one for a change! And by huge, Al knew Ed was utterly massive! He must have just as big, if not bigger than Major Armstrong himself! \"Ed, we have to go to HQ so they can find out what's wrong with you!\" Al insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Central HQ, eh?\" Ed said as he was admiring his thick, powerful quads. \"That's where Colonel Mustang is, huh? Yeah... How about we pay him a visit?\" Ed said with a vengeful grin. Al shuddered a little. As much as he cared for his brother, he definitely didn't want to be Mustang right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a rough morning, mainly for Ed, the two began to get ready. The part Ed loved the most was how his clothes could hardly fit onto his buffed out physique! It just made him smile all the more! With one goal in mind, Ed and Al began making their way back to Central...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ed had immediately wanted to set out to make his way to Central HQ in order to teach Mustang a little lesson. Al had no choice but to follow behind him, hoping to keep him out of trouble as best he could! Their place of residence was a few miles away from HQ so they had a bit of a walk ahead of them through the city. Almost as soon as they left their room, people had started noticing Ed, looks of shock evident on their faces. Some looked on in admiration while others looked confused as to why such a large man was wearing such tiny clothes. When Ed had dressed that morning, he insisted on forcing his old clothes to fit as best they could. Al, being taller and slightly more muscular than Ed normally, had offered his clothes to his now hulking brother, but Ed wouldn't be talked out of it. His skin tight leather pants were even tighter now, his thighs bulging out against the material. The bottoms of the pant legs were stretched tight around Ed's calves, the pants looking more like shorts. His ass and package both bulged obscenely in front and behind him, every curve perfectly outlined, leaving nothing to the imagination. When he had pulled his boots on, his thick toes had burst from the ends of the footwear and his laces had refused to be tied. Still, Ed's feet were so big the boots stayed perfectly on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis black undershirt looked painted on his torso, the hem not even pulling down past the second row of his rock hard six pack. His massive pecs bulged out against the shirt, the collar tearing slightly, exposing a tantalizing glimpse of the smooth skin of Ed's chest. The sleeves had been utterly obliterated when he had pulled the shirt on, tatters around the shoulders the only testament to their existence. Ed hadn't even bothered with his puny jacket. The clothing had ripped clean in half when he tried to yank it on over his broad, manly shoulders. With his clothing in this state, it was no wonder Ed was getting attention!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly tiny alchemist was only too aware of the attention he was getting. A cocky grin was plastered on his face as he walked along, flexing his biceps at anyone who stared long enough, drawing slight gasps from some people and blushes from others. Ed kept coming up with new poses the further he went. Al, walking along behind him slightly, had a bit of a sullen expression on his face. He didn't like all the attention Ed was getting...usually his brother only focused on him. He knew he had no right to be jealous. Ed had done so much for him, it was good that he was finally focusing on himself for a bit. Still, Ed was HIS brother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl glanced over at Ed, his face blushing slightly. He had missed that bright, carefree smile, the casual pose of his body, and the confidence he exuded. For so long all of that had been bravado. Now it seemed genuine and the changes in his body had done it. \"Maybe it isn't so bad that he's this big...\" Al thought to himself. \"I'm probably just worrying too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl was deeply absorbed in these thoughts, he didn't even notice someone aiming a gun at him. Luckily, Ed DID notice and threw his body backward, his burly arms wrapping around Al and forcing him to the ground, a shot ringing out just above them. Al, his face buried in Ed's chest, went wide eyed, his protests muffled as Ed pushed his chest even harder against his little brother's face, trying to keep him as low to the ground as possible. \"Stay down Al! I'll take care of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Ed drew up to his full height and charged after the man, clapping his hands and slamming his right palm against the wall. The man aimed his gun and was about to shoot at Ed when a brick spike erupted from the wall, knocking the gun clean out of the attacker's hand! With a slight curse he turned and started running. \"Oh no you don't!\" Ed shouted, giving chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl shakily got to his feet as he watched Ed chase after the criminal, catching up with him and slamming him against the wall, forcing his arms behind his back. With another quickly clap, a pair of make shift hand cuffs formed around the shooter's wrists. A small crowd of people who had witnessed this act of bravery applauded Ed for his heroism and bravery. Al smiled slightly, making his way over to Ed. His smile widened as he looked up at his brother. \"Ed, that was great! You saved me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd chuckled and ruffled Al's hair. \"Of course! You're my little brother! I'm always going to be looking out for you! You're not exactly immune to bullets anymore you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl blushed a little and said, \"Yeah, I know...I guess that's one thing I had gotten used to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it! Just keep your eyes open okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl nodded and the brothers continued on their way to Central. Ed may have been soaking up the attention of everyone around him, but one particular admirer went unnoticed. Al couldn't seem to look away from his brother. Ed had saved him countless times before, but this time just felt...special somehow. The act was enhanced by Ed's huge body. He was like a mythical hero now! Al moved in closer and brushed his fingers along Ed's own, moving ahead of him soon after, making it appear as though the act had been accidental. When he was a few steps in front of Ed he turned back and said, </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ed let out a noisy yawn as he woke up the next morning. The lack of shades or curtains on the window means he would be woken up the moment the sun hit his eyes. Ed rolled his legs out of the bed first, and sat up, finding a bit of difficulty. He rubbed his eyes and slowly got to his feet, moving to the bathroom. He kept pawing at the straps of his black tanktop, annoyed at how tight it felt... When it suddenly hit him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Maybe I'm taller!\" He thought excitedly. He ran to the bathroom, not even noticing how much the room was shaking as he ran! As he slid in front of the mirror, his look of excitement immediately turned to one of shock. \"Wh-What...?\" He ran his hands over his face. It was soft and squishy, and he could clearly see a second chin right under his first! His eyes wandered lower, and he saw two large meaty breasts, soft and jiggly laying atop a gargantuan belly! His stomach was soft, and shook and wiggled with even the smallest bit of movement! Edward was in shock, as he couldn't even see his feet anymore! His shirt was criminally tight, raising up and practically giving him a midriff like what Envy wore! He could barely see a cavernous bellybutton. \"What the heck is this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd heard a brief groan from the next room. \"Brother...?\" Al called out softly, the sleepiness still apparent in his voice. \"What's going on...?\" Ed ran back out into the bedroom, him and his large gut confronting his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Al! Look at me!\" Ed shouted. Al finished rubbing his eyes, before he suddenly lunged back in shock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Ed!\" He shouted, \"What happened to you!? What have you been eating!\" Al said, his eyes practically focused on Ed's large stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ate just as much as you last night!\" Ed snapped back, \"I-I just woke up and I was this huge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... You DID want to be bigger...\" Al said, chuckling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Al!\" Ed shouted at him, \"This is serious!\" Al slowly wiped the smile from his face, as he tried to assume a more serious persona. It was proving difficult, however, with Ed's large stomach staring him right in the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you...\" Al stopped for a moment to snicker, \"Feel okay? Like does your heart feel okay? Is it hard to breathe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd took a moment to feel around for the things that Al listed off. \"... No...\" he said slowly, \"I feel just fine... For what it's worth.\" Ed grabbed his massive stomach in his hands, shaking it around a little. \"Geez, how did all this happen...?\" He groaned unhappily. Al just shrugged in reply. It was at this moment that Ed remembered something that made Hell seem appealing. \"Oh crap... I have to meet with Mustang today...\" Ed slapped his palm to his face. \"Why... Why today!?\" He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just call in sick?\" Al suggested. Ed just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, that's not going to work. Then he'll just come here... And he'll bring the entire army along with him...\" Ed groaned. Roy always demanded efficiency. Unless you were on your deathbed or already paid your tolls with a broken limb or two, a little cold wasn't about to stop production! Ed began to think to himself, trying to think of a way out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his older brother thought, Al crept closer, looking at his brother's bloated physique. Gently, he poked Ed's stomach, looking up at Ed. Ed was too deep in thought to feel it. Al poked again, and gently rubbed all around the huge globe. Ed's skin was amazingly soft, and the squishiness reminded him of that of a pillow. Gently, Al laid his head against it, and sighed. It actually felt kind of nice... As soft as a pillow... Maybe even softer! Gently, he wrapped his arms around it, hugging Ed close against him. That felt REALLY nice...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment Ed noticed something grabbed at him. He looked down at Al, and a smile actually crept along his face. \"What are you doing down there?\" He chuckled, patting Al on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl looked up, a cute look on his face. \"It's so warm!\" He smiled, \"And it's really soft too...\" Ed laughed at his brother's reaction, and resounding shaking make Al giggle as he held onto it. Ed scratched the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess I better get dressed...\" He said. Al let go, still smiling happily, as Ed made his way over to the suitcase. He frowned as he held up his usual black undershirt and pants. They were definitely several sizes too small for his new, massive girth. Ed just sighed. \"Well, I did always dream about my clothes not fitting...\" He ran a hand down his stomach. \"I just never thought it would be like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long journey, especially for Ed. Being so big made long trips a little bit harder on him, not to mention all the looks he was getting as he walked through town. All those staring eyes... Things in the military base weren't much better. The two of them got their usual \"Hello!\" and \"Good morning!\" from everyone, but it was always followed by a wide-eyed look that traveled straight to his waistline. Speaking of which, Ed was in constant pain with his pants. He had to use a little alchemy to make them a few sizes bigger with the help of some scrap clothes, but even then it was too much. The button was struggling to stay closed, and his zipper was only zipped up about halfway. His stomach flopped out over his lap slightly, while his boy breasts were able to be contained by his tight shirt. His walk had become somewhat of a waddle, and wearing all black, people started to make jokes that he was just a blonde haired penguin. He started to think that he hated that even more than the fact everyone was always calling him short...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd walked into Roy's office, finding that his stomach brushed slightly against the door frame. Thankfully Al was always behind him just in case he got stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mustang! I'm here!\" Ed said. His voice was a little more hefty and deep than before. Roy was looking out the window, thinking about something. He then turned around to see the massive, roly-poly Ed standing there. His eyes went wide as he then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as Roy laid his eyes on Ed, he felt his lungs fill up with a sudden gust of air! Before Ed could even try to say something, Roy burst out laughing, pointing at Ed as he did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What happened Fullmetal? Have a little too much to eat last night?!\" Roy roared, \"Y-You, You look like a frickin' penguin! Forget Fullmetal, we should call you Fullbellied!\" Roy shouted, \"O-Or maybe full-assed! Because your ass is so fat!!!\" Roy kept cracking his own little jokes, his hand slamming down on his desk as he couldn't seem to stop himself from laughing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't have to take this!\" Ed replied, turning to head back out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you can even fit through there!? We might have to get you the jaws of li-i-i-ife...\" Roy stammered at the end, unable to hold back just how hilarious Ed's new shape was to him! As the door opened and Ed walked out, Roy's laughter seemed to fill the hallways. Ed had a grumpy look on his face as he walked down the hall. Every officer that saw him knew it was probably best not to say anything. Especially Breada, who was a bit of a pudgy guy himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as the boys left central, Ed could have swore he heard Roy still laughing. Al didn't really have much to say as he kept moving along with his... Well, big brother. Once the two of them left the gates of the military base, Al ran ahead to look at Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Brother? Where are we going?\" Al asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to get something to eat.\" Ed replied simply. His eyes were trained forward, a stark contrast from his huge, wobbling gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Ed, are you sure that's the right thing to do right now? I-I mean...\" Al stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, because I'm fat?!\" Ed barked, \"Don't tell me you're going to start mocking me just like he did!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ed, you know I'd never do that...\" Al replied, looking down with sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd just sighed, \"You're right... Sorry...\" He said gently. \"I'm just... Hungry. Let's go, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Al replied with a small smile. He could understand that his brother was a bit sensitive over Roy's comments. Besides, someone had to be there for his big brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward and Alphonse reached a nearby diner within a few minutes. As they were seated, Ed had to squeeze his newer, bigger body into the booth! His stomach pressed up slightly against the table. Ed just sighed to himself as he saw this. The two were handed menus and left to their own muses for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think this is going to be permanent?\" Al asked Ed as he glanced over the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope not.\" Ed said as he was doing the same. He was having a hard time deciding! Everything just looked so delicious and good! Especially the cherry pie... With crust so flaky and juicys so sweet and tart...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd was so taken by the menu that he didn't even notice the waitress returning! Al's order went unnoticed by Ed, until he realized there was a silence at the table. He looked up because he felt like someone was staring at him! \"O-Oh! Sorry about that!\" He said, rubbing the back of his head, \"I'll have the... Uh... Country fried steak and the... Roasted turkey.\" Ed ordered. Al was about to remind him that he was ordering two things, but he didn't want to embarass his brother by bringing it up in front of the waitress. The waitress took the two menus, not even caring Ed had ordered twice! Guys like him were great business for the resturant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'think maybe we should go find a tailor after this?\" Ed asked his little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why? You don't plan on staying like this, do you?\" Al asked, trying to say it as sweetly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no.\" Ed answered half-heartedly, \"I just thought it would be better if I walked around in something... You know, more comfortable.\" Ed explained, \"Besides, no one wants to see all... This.\" Ed said, grabbing the sides of his gut and giving them a squeeze. His lovehandles hung over the edge of his pants and then some! \"Geez, I don't mind being this heavy, I just wish I could have gotten a little taller too!\" Ed said, looking up at Al, \"You know, then the weight would be more distributed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl just nodded in response. As the two boys sat there...</span></div></div>",

While he held that in his mouth, his began adding salt and pepper to the mashed potatoes, buttering his biscuits, and otherwise preparing his food, moving with a single minded ferocity. Al just sighed, focusing on his own food, trying to hide the slight blush on his face. It was a bit embarrassing that Ed was making such a spectacle of himself but this was actually completely normal. Ed had a tendency to eat like an animal, even at his normal weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was done seasoning his food, Ed tore a huge chunk out of the leg, smacking as he chewed, his gloves getting stained with grease as he gulped down the food. Switching the leg over to his left hand, he started shoveling potato, green beans, and stuffing into his mouth, barely chewing any of it before swallowing, his chunky face getting splattered with gravy, his cheeks becoming shiny with butter. Al looked up occasionally to see how Ed was doing, shaking his head slightly as he saw how messy Ed was being. The shorter alchemist either didn't notice or didn't care. He was just that hungry! Bit by bit, the turkey started to become nothing more than bones, the potatoes and corn and beans disappearing completely, leaving the steak alone on the second plate. While this was going on Ed's belly swelled outward, pushing more and more against the table, scooting it closer to Al who had to constantly adjust himself. \"Hey Ed? Can you stop pushing the table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not pushing the table!\" Ed said incredulously, his mouth full of food, bits of turkey flying from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well something is!\" Al said, wiping his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd swallowed his food, almost choking, draining an entire glass of juice before gasping out, \"L-Look, it's not me! It's this stupid...gut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl looked under the table to confirm this, Ed's belly hanging out from under his shirt, pressing tightly against his pants button. As he watched, the quivering button finally gave up, popping free and smacking right into Al's face! He jumped back up with a little cry. \"Brother! Your pants button hit me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to say this quietly, to spare Ed's feelings, but Ed waved it off. \"So what? Not like anything's fitting well anyway.\" He started eating even faster, able to take in more food now that his belly wasn't being restrained. Al frowned as he watched his gluttonous brother eat. He could swear that Ed was swelling up fatter right before his eyes! His already chipmunk like cheeks were rounding out even more, and not just because they were being stuffed full of food! His flabby chest was pushing against the material of his shirt, his sleeves becoming tight as his sausage like arms filled them up. With a careless flex of his hand, his glove split open along the fingers, revealing the thick, pink digits. Down below the table, away from the eyes of both brothers, Ed's leather pants were getting tighter and tighter, threatening to restrict Ed's movements if the material didn't give way first. Even his boots were starting to get tight around his bloating feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't seem right...\" Al thought to himself, barely even feeling hungry anymore. \"Whatever made him this fat in the first place is doing something to keep making him fatter!\" It was one thing to gain weight after a big meal. It was another thing entirely to be gaining weight while still eating at such a quick pace!  A deep belch broke Al's concentration. He looked up at his brother, two empty plates in front of him, his face, hands, and clothes a complete mess, and an unsatisfied look on his face. \"What's wrong brother?\" Al asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This food...it's not filling me up at all!\" Ed complained, pushing the plates aside. \"I'm going to order some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl quickly checked his wallet and did some mental math. \"O-Or, how about we go back home? I can cook for you then!\" Al suggested. It would be easier on their wallets AND Ed's pride if he could eat like this in the comfort of his own home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll make Mom's stew, right?\" Ed asked excitedly, grinning at his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Come on, let's go.\" Al said, dropping some money and a tip onto the table. He had taken an interest in cooking ever since he got his body back. Being able to taste everything again made him want to taste EVERYTHING! Lucky for him, he had much more will power than Ed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, the tubby alchemist was having a bit of trouble getting to his feet. Al offered him a hand, pulling him to his feet just as his massive ass tore a hole right in the seat of his pants! Ed blushed and quickly started making his way to the door, Al walking close behind him to try and cover the damage. Al may have been a bit taller than Ed, but the older alchemist was certainly far wider. As they left the restaurant...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Colonel Roy Mustang was having a slow day. The only things he had to look forward to was an appointment with Edward Elric for a performance review, and that was never any fun. The little midget always questioned his authority like the little firecracker he was! It made things... Difficult, to say the least. Sure, Mustang could just fire him, but despite all the bad, Ed always did an outstanding job...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colonel, Miss Hawkeye is on her way.\" Roy's intercom said. The man jumped a little as the sudden noise broke the silence, giving him a scare! As Roy quickly regained his composure, he made his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riza?\" He said, his voice a little shaky at first. \"Right, thank you.\" He then said, sounding much more like himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere seconds, Riza came in, saluting her superior, \"Sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Riza? What is it?\" Roy asked, noticing the small package she held in generic brown paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our research on the destroyed lab came up with some evidence sir!\" She replied. \"They asked that this be delivered to you.\" Roy just nodded and extended his hand. Riza quickly made her way across the room and handed it to him. \"That is all, sir.\" She added, before turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Where are you going? Aren't you going to stick around?\" Roy asked. Riza almost always stuck around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\" She replied, a slight frown hinted on her face. It immediately became clear to Roy she didn't want to leave. \"I've been given orders that only you, as the head of this investigation, is allowed to view this evidence.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy just nodded. \"Very well then. As you were.\" Riza gave one last salute before leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy looked at the box, from all around. No address nor fragile stamp... With that, he took it upon himself to give it a shake! It sounded like there was something metal inside... Roy then undid the rope ribbon before tearing the paper open. All that was left was the box, which Roy promptly opened. Then, before him, he saw a small pistol with a strange, alchemic circle on it. Roy was an intelligible man, and he'd never seen a symbol quite like this one before! He picked up the gun and looked at it. He opened the chambers and saw it wasn't even loaded! Or so he thought. Roy flicked the gun, thus closing the chamber before giving it a little twirl! With a pull of the finger, he fired! Much to his surprise, something DID fire out! It was a quick, tiny bolt of electricity, much like a bullet! It slammed into the bookcase before disappating without a trace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazed, Roy immediately got up and walked over to the bookcase! There was no hole, no cap, nothing! The only evidence of a gun being fired was the smoke from the tip and the sound that came with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing...\" Roy whispered to himself. \"Just what kind of weapon IS this?\" He said, walking back over to his desk and picking up the gun. He fired it again, this time at the window! Just like before, the bullet disappeared as it hit the surface. Roy looked at the gun, amused by it. Part of him wondered if the bullets even did any harm... Was it just a prop? Something someone would use in theater? Or something more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Roy stood there, he got an impulse. \"Shoot someone!\" The tiny voice in his head said. Roy gulped as his mind thought on it. He could... But what if he actually hurt someone? He would never be able to live with himself! Roy gulped. \"I could always try it on... Myself...\" He thought. Now Roy wasn't a fool. He wasn't about to put a gun to his head and pull the trigger. Instead, he put it to his forearm, making sure it wasn't on an artery. Roy could feel his heart throbbing. \"It won't do anything... It won't do anything...\" He told himself. He looked away and grit his teeth hard. Summoning every shred of courage he could, he pulled the trigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BAM!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy then opened his eyes. He could still feel his arm... And there wasn't any pain... He turned and looked back at the gun. Letting out a big breath of relief, he laughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-That... That was insane!\" He said to himself, \"I can't believe I just did that...\" He sighed happily, the laughing slowing to a stop. But there was one thing Roy didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's forearm quivered a little. He looked down at it as he felt something move, and his eyes began to widen! He watched as his forearm had started to increase in mass! And not just his forearm, but his bicep too! Almost instantly, he could see the muscle swelling up, pressing against the fabic! As an army man, Roy was in decent shape, but now he was really packing on the muscle! The sensation traveled up his arm into his shoulders! As they began to grow, he could feel his jacket becoming tighter against his skin! The sensation flared across his expanding back and soon Roy could see as his pecs started pushing out further too! Like two balloons, the inflated before his eyes, making his jacket feel like he was constricting him every time he took a breath! Roy's abs had started to crunch, packing together a powerful six pack of muscle! At this point, Roy's upper body looked like an overstuffed sausage in it's casing, his jacket ready to burst off at a moment's notice! But it didn't stop there. Down below, Roy's feet were painfully tight in his shoes. The tiny little articles of clothing were packed with Roy's growing stompers! A little higher, Roy's pants had rode up slightly as his calves had begun to grow, becoming columns of pure strength. Roy's thighs had become so massive that they had actually snapped the hem of his pants! A smug little grin stretched across his face as he heard the fabric begin to tear. To top off his already gigantic ego that was surely only to grow to an even greater size with these muscles, Roy's dick had begun to expand! It slowly snaked it's way along his pants and inner thigh. To an outsider, it looked like Roy had a nice, thick log in his pants! On the other side, Roy's ass had bubbled out to the point it bounced with every step he would take!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy had a big grin on his face. He rose his bicep up and gave it a hard flex. The sound of the fabic groaning as it stretched was music to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... That puny pistol isn't so useless after all!\" He said, flexing his arm again just so he could hear the sound! Life for the colonel had taken a sudden turn for the better!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Roy was so absorbed in checking himself out, he almost didn't hear the knock on his office door! At about the eighth knock, when the person on the other side sounded like he or she was getting frustrated, Roy finally noticed, looking at the door with a slightly confused expression on his face. That confused expression turned to one of glee as he remembered that Ed was supposed to be showing up soon or his appointment. Thinking fast, Roy stowed the pistol in a drawer in his desk before he unbuttoned his coat, letting it hang open, showing off his super tight white undershirt. The material was stretched so tightly across his skin that little bits of his skin was actually visible between the buttons, every bump and curve of musculature on full display. Roy sat down in his chair, the poor article of furniture creaking in protest, and leaned back casually, feeling totally at ease. \"Come in.\" He said, a lilting tone to his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door immediately opened rather forcefully, revealing the Fullmetal alchemist himself in all his pissed off glory. The shorter than average teen stomped into the room, slamming the door shut behind him, giving Roy the dirtiest of dirty looks. It was slightly more intense than the normal dirty look Roy usually got, no doubt because he had had to wait outside for so long, knocking. Roy smirked and said, \"Right on time Ed. That's what I should be saying. But you were supposed to be here half an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, I got busy.\" Ed said, rubbing the back of his head. \"I was in the library and I lost track of time.\" He hadn't yet noticed Roy's changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be that as it may, the next time you're late I'm going to have to punish you.\" Roy said, his smirk widening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, I'm so scared.\" Ed said mockingly, sitting down in the only chair in front of Roy's desk. \"Let's just get this thing over with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I have some reports here from various sources that seem to be saying that you've caused damages to their businesses. Care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy lifted the paper work of his desk, waving it in the air, his arm bent as his bicep flexed against the material, straining it to the breaking point. Ed blushed a little, still not noticing Roy, and said, \"Yeah, well...when you're chasing criminals sometimes there's a little...collateral damage! I can't help it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you admit it then?\" Roy said, his smirk turning into a full on grin. \"Well then I'll just be docking the damages from your pay check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd groaned but couldn't exactly argue with Roy. He HAD caused a lot of damages in the last few weeks. Suddenly, something clicked in Ed's mind and he realized why he had been thinking that something felt...off with Roy. He looked more closely and noticed Roy's jacket was unbuttoned. Ed tilted his head as he saw this. Mustang was never so casual during work hours! His eyes widened as he saw how much bigger Roy looked now. It shocked him into silence! Roy immediately picked up on Ed's reaction and spread his arms over his desk, allowing Ed a full view of his superior officer's chest. \"Do you want to dispute my decision?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bounced his pecs as Ed stared, the thick muscles rippling and undulating beneath the super tight material. Before Ed could answer, the top button on Roy's shirt pinged off, smacking the smaller male in the nose. Ed winced and touched the sore spot, watching as two more buttons popped off, allowing Roy's chest to push out into full view. Ed's mouth dropped open as he said, \"W-What the hell happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm?\" Roy said mischievously. \"Whatever do you mean Fullmetal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you...you're huge!\" Ed said, unable to really articulate his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? I don't see a difference.\" Roy said, standing up. His height had also gotten a little boost from the gun. He walked behind Ed and stood over him, bending over slightly so his massive pecs rested on Ed's head. \"I don't see a difference. I still can't see you when I look down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd blushed harder, pushing against Roy's chest. He wasn't able to even dent the muscles, let alone move them! Roy chuckled and pushed down harder on Ed's head, mussing up his hair. He straightened back up and moved back behind the desk, bending his arms slightly as he rested his hands on his desk, staring at Ed. \"Now, I'm not going to be hearing about anymore problems from you, am I?\" As he said this he flexed his arms, hard, his gigantic biceps bursting through his sleeves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Ed said instinctively. \"Of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Then we won't have any more problems.\" Roy said with a sigh. He took such a deep breath, two more buttons popped off his shirt, revealing the top two rows of his abs. \"Damn, I'm going to have to invest in a new wardrobe!\" Roy chuckled, bouncing his pecs playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...I'm...going to go now.\" Ed said quickly, getting up and heading for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fullmetal!\" Roy barked, the deep, booming intensity of his voice causing Ed to freeze in his tracks. The young alchemist slowly turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? What is it?\" He asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not done yet.\" He pointed at the chair and said, \"Sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gulped but did as he was told, sitting back down in the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...You've been a thorn in my side for quite awhile.\" Roy said. \"I think it's time you learned who is in charge here. Lesson one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into the drawer and pointed the gun at himself, angling it in such a way that Ed couldn't see what he was doing. With a quick tug, he pulled the trigger, a jolt of energy rushing through his body. Roy straightened up...and up! His body had gained at least another six inches, if not more! The holes in his sleeves widened as his biceps seemed to rise out of them like baking bread, his chest bulging out in front of him, pushing his shirt open completely. His abs pushed out further as well, popping the last remaining buttons as his shoulders broadened widely, tearing apart the undershirt completely, now the open jacket the only thing covering, even partially, his upper body. With a loud POP his toes burst from his boots, the laces exploding off of them as his feet just became too big to contain, the boots starting to fall apart like rotting leather! His pants were suffering a similar fate, unable to hold back Roy's expanding calves and thickening thighs, the material splitting open in several places. His ass blew the seat out of his pants as it grew firmer, stronger, and even bouncier, his cock reeling out more, nearly forcing its way out through the zipper, a slight twitch indicating how badly it wanted to be free, his balls following suit. Ed could only look on in astonishment, confusion...and even a little fear! Roy grinned and flexed his muscles, groaning as every powerful inch of his body flexed and moved. \"Lesson one: I'M in charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...lesson two.\"</span></div></div>",

NOW.\" Roy flexed a little as he said this, just to show how serious he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd, who felt a little more scared now, wasn't about to give in! \"No way! Th-That's sick!\" Ed said in protest, \"I don't know where those sweaty things have been!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy frowned. He brought his foot down, and walked over to Ed. The whole room seemed to shake and quiver in his presence. \"What was that?\" Roy asked, sickened by Ed's defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said... N--\" Before Ed could even finish, Roy picked him up and tossed him at the wall, nearly sending him through it! Ed coughed, winded as soon as he hit the wall! He then slid to the ground, letting out a sharp wheeze as he did. The young man certainly didn't expect that! Once again, he could only sit there as he heard Roy's thunderous footsteps slowly draw closer... And closer... Ed's light was blocked out as Roy stood over him. Before Ed could even react, Roy picked him up and slammed him against the wall before pressing his beefy physique right up against him! Ed groaned slightly, as the muscles held him perfectly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you forget the first rule already, Fullmetal!?\" Roy asked, his tone deep and threatening. \"I'M. IN. CHARGE.\" The flame alchemist added pressure with each word, which only made Ed groan even louder! After a moment, he backed up, letting Ed fall to the ground once more. This time, Roy put his foot right on Ed's face! \"Now lick.\" Roy ordered, as his toes gripped at Ed's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd winced, but if he expected to get out of this, he had no choice! Shaking slightly, Ed's tongue reached out and licked the sole of Roy's foot. He did it again... And again, his soft tongue working all the way up Roy's huge, manly foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, runt. Lick the feet of a real man...\" Roy grunted in a deep tone. Ed held Roy's foot and kept licking, just as a child would clean their plate. Roy's foot had a deep, sensual musk to it, and once Ed got just one taste, he couldn't stop! Roy smirked, putting a little pressure on Ed's face. He felt more powerful, stronger than he had felt in years! The lowly Fullmetal licking his foot fed his already swollen ego like a thick, fat steak to an already large tiger. The feeling of exerting power to dominate such a small, helpless teen was making Roy crave more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" Roy pulled his foot back. He looked down at Ed, who looked as if he was in a bit of a daze. \"Toes.\" Roy moved his foot back in, but this time, put his big toe right on Ed's lips! The little guy whimpered, which only made Roy want to hear it again! Roy pushed his toe at Ed's mouth, making Ed whine just a little more before the little blonde took as much of it as he could in his mouth! Roy moaned softly, in heaven once more as Ed kept worshipping his large feet. It took every ounce of dicipline Roy had to keep himself from getting hard. Roy soon pulled back, panting just slightly, but nowhere near as much as Ed was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad... Fullmetal...\" Roy said. He picked Ed up by the front of his shirt again, which made Ed flinch, worried he was going to get hit! Roy just chuckled, liking that fear that he commanded within the little alchemist.

Ed gulped as he saw those massive appendages appear in front of him again, the thick toes wiggling. Some areas were still glistening from Ed's saliva. Roy stretched a little before putting his hands behind his head in a relaxed pose, taking the opportunity to flex his gigantic biceps, each one swelling up bigger than Ed's head! \"That wasn't bad Fullmetal.\" the colonel admitted, his voice low and sensual rather than booming and powerful as it was before. \"I think you deserve a reward for all your hard work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Ed said cautiously, still on guard. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I'm going to give you a promotion.\" Roy said, sitting up straight, his pecs resting on the top of his desk as he leaned forward. \"Things are going to be changing around here. You've already been a part of that. The first change I'm going to make is promoting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can...you do that?\" Ed asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy grinned and said, \"Who's going to stop me? Like I said, things are changing around here. Now, to the world at large and to the so called \"superior\" officers in this army you'll still be considered a state alchemist, with all the privileges and rank that title entails. But in reality you'll be my personal slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was filled with a silence so complete you could have heard a pin drop. Ed stared at Roy's smirking face for a good three minutes before he finally said, \"I'll be your...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Personal. Slave.\" Roy said, slowly and clearly, so there would be no confusion. \"Your hands, your tongue, your whole body will now be completely devoted to pleasing and serving me. After all, it's only right that a speck of a kid like you serve a mountain of a man like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's eye twitched as he heard that most hated reference to his stature. His courage returning, he got to his feet and slammed his hands on top of Roy's desk. \"Like HELL I'm going to be your slave! I'd rather die first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy's expression darkened, growing colder as Ed declared this. Slowly, he got to his feet, rising up and up and up, towering over Ed completely, casting the much smaller teen in his shadow. \"What did you say Fullmetal?\" His voice was low and dangerous again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I said...Uh...t-that I'm....n-not going to...to...not going to...\" Ed stammered, watching as Roy lifted his foot up...and slammed it down on his desk, shattering it into a thousand pieces, splinters and papers flying all over, a sound like a gunshot filling the room. Ed darted backward, shielding his face from the splinters. He still ended up with a few cuts and bruises, adding onto the ones he already had gotten from Roy's rough treatment. \"I said I'm...not going...to let anyone else...h-have the honor of...serving you.\" His tone had shades of bitterness, regret, rage, fear, and a thousand other emotions. He knew he really didn't have a choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stomped closer to Ed and grabbed him by the shirt, lifting him into the air again, glaring at him. \"You may have gotten away with that piss poor attitude before Fullmetal but I won't allow you to treat me with anything other than reverence. Do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah! I do!\" Ed said quickly, trying unsuccessfully to pry Roy's thick fingers from his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" The giant colonel responded, dropping Ed at his feet again. \"Now, here's how things are going to go. You will continue to follow orders from your superiors and go about your business as if nothing has changed. When I give you an order, however, no matter what it is, even if it directly contradicts other orders, you will follow it. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\" Ed said sullenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes what?\" Roy said dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" Ed quickly said, straightening up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. You will also now live exclusively with me. I want you by my side as much as possible to follow any and all orders I have. Your purpose in life is now to serve me completely. When I'm happy, you're happy. If I'm displeased, you'll suffer. Keep me happy and we won't have any problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" Ed said, staring hard at Roy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustang noticed the defiance in his eyes and chuckled. \"That will pass soon enough.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back down at his desk, picking the gun up off the floor (where it had landed when he destroyed his desk) and stuck it in the back of his underwear. He then looked directly in Ed's eyes and said, \"Get over here. NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd jumped up as though his seat had been electrified. He quickly moved over to Roy. He looked up at him in fear, Roy's face slightly obscured by his pecs from this angle. When he breathed in, they expanded even more, blocking out more of his face. Ed gulped, his face flushing slightly as he looked up at his new master, the very idea of it making him grimace. Roy smirked and bounced his pecs. \"Suck on my nipple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ed shouted, looking disgusted. \"No--I...I mean...y-yes sir...\" The last thing Ed wanted was a broken...anything. He clambered up onto Roy's lap, sitting down on his massive thigh, and slowly brought his face closer to the pumped, round muscle. As soon as Roy felt Ed's warm breath puff against his sensitive flesh, he grabbed the back of his head and shoved him against his pec, Ed's mouth opening in surprise and closing around the thick nipple. Immediately, reflexively, he began to suck on it, eliciting a moan of satisfaction from Roy. Ed blushed slightly again as he heard that deep moan. It practically vibrated in his rib cage. The nipple hardened in his mouth, filling it up, Ed's saliva coating it, the pec itself flexing and jumping from the stimulation. Roy could feel his dick twitching in his underwear, threatening to burst out. \"Mmmm...\" He said, rubbing the back of Ed's head, keeping him pinned in place. \"Yeah, that's a good little slave~\"</span></div></div>",

There was no telling what his massive, hunk of a colonel would do to him if he dared disobey... He had already got a taste of punishment...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm... You're not bad at this, Fullmetal.\" Roy said in his deep, sexy voice. \"At this rate, maybe I'll even consider you for a raise! Would you like that?\" He asked, looking down at Ed. Roy then laughed. \"Heh, I can't even see you past my huge pecs!\" Roy flexed his thick chest, giving Ed a little shake as he did! \"An insignificant little bug like you will never know how it feels to be this massive... This powerful...\" Roy rose his arm and started to flex his bicep over and over. \"Yeah... I'm huge...\" He mumbled to himself. His biceps were bigger than Ed's head! Each flex worked the muscle, pumping it up bigger and bigger, making it swell up with size. \"Hell yeah... Hey! Fullmetal!\" Roy held Ed's head and dragged him over to his arm like a little rag doll. \"Check out these guns... I could crush your tiny little head in these puppies!\" Roy boasted with a big smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd gulped. Roy's arms were huge and intimidated... And every word the cocky colonel spoke, Ed knew was true! It was at this moment, however, Ed was barely able to see some kind of strange bulge in the back of the colonel's underwear... It left Ed curious, but there was no telling what it was to begin with!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for!? Worship me, you runt!\" Roy snarled, shoving Ed into his bicep! Ed winced, before giving the arm a kiss. Then the little blonde began to lick his superior's gargantuan arm. \"Aw yeah, that's it...\" Roy grumbled, \"You could only dream of being as huge and powerful as me...\" Roy began to drone on again. \"I don't even know how you can throw a punch with those noodles you call arms... Now these?\" Roy flexed his arm a little harder, \"THIS is what a military man looks like! Not some stringy little magician.\" Roy mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd had no choice but to just sit there and take it, all while running his tongue over Roy's godly body. He had no say in the matter. To speak was to ask for punishment. But at this exact moment, he heard a \"clank!\" from behind Mustang!  As his eyes peered down, he saw a gun! Why would the colonel have a gun in his underwear of all places!? It got Ed to thinking what importance that gun must have had...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You checking out my ass, Fullmetal?\" Roy asked in a cocky tone, \"You've probably never seen such a magnificent, sexy ass in your life! Compared to those two flat pancakes you call a butt!\" Roy laughed. \"Heh, why don't I bring you lower... So you can get a better look...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To put it simply, Ed panicked. The very second the Colonel began to force Ed's tiny body lower towards his bulging underwear, Ed knew what he was planning on doing. Sucking and licking arms and chests were one thing. It wasn't THAT bad (even if he WAS being forced by a giant, egotistical, meat head), but the short alchemist drew the line at doing anything too intimate. Ed had experience taking out opponents who were bigger than him. Unfortunately he had also felt and experienced Mustang's muscles and he knew that normal attacks wouldn't cut it here. Therefore, he decided to risk it all on a gamble. His arm shot out and his fingers just barely managed to grab the gun in Roy's waistband, pulling it free. With an almighty push, he forced himself backward, able to break out of Roy's grip by virtue of surprising the giant man. He moved out of Roy's reach and held up the gun, aiming it steadily at Roy's chest. The Colonel's eyes widened slightly before lowering back to a more laid back position. \"So what are you going to do now Fullmetal? Shoot your commanding officer? Even you must know what kind of position that will put you in. Even if you manage to fight your way out of here you'll be public enemy number one to the military. A dangerous rebel. Can you really afford that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd's hands shook, very slightly. Things had changed since he and Al had gotten their bodies back to normal. Ed had decided to stay on with the military now that the whole thing was being restructured after the fall of the Homunculi's regime, now that pointless war was far less likely. He could enjoy the benefits of the military without having to worry about the drawbacks. However, if he really did shoot Mustang and kill him (or even injure him) he would be arrested. He couldn't do that to Al! \"I don't have to kill you. I can shoot out your knee or something if I have to. But what I really want to do, is just leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy laughed, his chest shaking as he did so. \"Leave? And do what? Leave the entire military as well? If you leave my office now I can assure you I'll have you discharged. Threatening your superior officer is still subordination. Face it Fullmetal, you can't win. If you want life to continue on being as good as it has been for you and your brother you're just going to have to learn your place. Now come back over here, set the gun down, and I promise you I won't punish you for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd glanced down at the gun, something about the situation bothering him. \"Why did you have this thing stuck in your underwear anyway? I've never seen you carry a gun before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy shrugged and said, \"Standard issue, military grade. Can't hurt to have it on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't buy that! There's something special about this gun, isn't there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be an idiot! Look at it! Does it look like anything special to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd held it up to his face and looked it over. It did seem like a perfectly ordinary fire arm...then again, his experience with weaponry of any kind was rather limited. Ed suddenly felt the floor shake, his head jerking up in time to see Mustang barreling into him like a charging rhino, pinning him against the wall with such force it put an enormous dent it! Ed yelped and dropped the gun, the back of Roy's forearm pushing against his throat. Roy gently put his foot down over top of the gun and gripped it in his toes, lifting it up to his other hand. He stuffed it back in the back of his underwear and said, \"All things considered, I like your fire Fullmetal. It'll make breaking you down into my whimpering puppy all the more satisfying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd spit at Roy, the small gobbet of saliva landing on Roy's cheek. He blinked and wiped it off, looking at his fingers with a bored look. \"I guess that's what I should expect from you. Maybe you're just not getting it yet. I can fix that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let Ed drop to the ground, crumpling in a heap, gasping for breath. \"You were right you know. This ISN'T just an ordinary gun. This little beauty has made me the man you see before you.\" He pulled the gun out of his waistband and grinned wickedly at Ed. \"And now it's going to be the prime example of why you can't hope to beat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed the gun to his chest and just as he was about to pull the trigger, Ed leaped up, clapping his hands and touching slamming them against the Colonel. Energy sparked as Roy pulled the trigger, the energy from the gun combining with the energy of the transmutation, causing a violent explosion of energy, knocking both Ed and Roy against the opposite walls! By now the noises coming from Mustang's office were starting to attract attention. The others watched the door as it shook in its frame, smoke coming out from underneath the door. Havoc leaned down and whispered to Fuery, \"Ed's been in there for an awfully long time. What do you think those two are doing in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the sounds of it?\" Fuery replied. \"Getting into another fight again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...something about this seems different.\" Havoc said, straightening up and moving towards the door. He knocked on it and said in a slightly raised voice, \"Everything okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHavoc knocked again and said, \"Sir? Fullmetal? Are you two okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting to get a little worried now, Havoc gripped the doorknob and opened the door, the cigarette dropping out of his mouth in surprise. The office was empty, the entire back wall completely knocked down while the ceiling had massive holes in it! It was like a demolition had gone on in here! \"W-What the hell?!\" Havoc shouted, walking into the room. Fuery, Breda, Falman, and the rest all slowly walked in after him, taking stock of all the damage. \"Something really weird is going on here.\" Breda said, shielding his eyes as he looked out through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat HAD happened in here?</span></div></div>",

Ed sprung right back up and this time aimed a knee right for the Colonel's abs! Roy managed to catch the knee in time, but what he didn't see was that it was just a diversion so Ed could get a big knock at his face! Roy stumbled back a little, crushing countless buildings under his large feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I can't believe this!\" Havoc said, unable to look away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like something out of one of those Japanese monster movies...\" Fuery said, stroking his chin slightly.

He charged right at Ed, the two of them locking fists in a battle of power! \"But I think you're forgetting just who the bigger man is here!\" Roy said, flexing all his muscles at once, making him look even more pumped than he already was! It made Ed falter for just a second, but that was all that Roy needed in order to toss the boy to the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ed could get up, Roy stomped his foot down right on top of Ed's face! \"See that, Fullmetal?!\" Roy replied, rubbing his huge, musky foot right in Ed's face, \"Just like that, the alpha male puts the little wimps like you in their place!\" Roy laughed heartily, his pecs shaking as he did. \"Sniff it!\" He said aggressively, shoving his foot deeper into Ed's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd groaned unhappily for a moment, before holding onto the foot with both hands! Using all his strength, he managed to topple Roy over, giving him just enough time to get back up to his feet! He jumped down on top of Roy as the black haired man laid there! Roy grunted in pain as he not only felt Ed's weight slam onto him, but also the feel of the unpleasant stone buildings jabbing at his back! Ed rolled over, and managed to grab Roy in a headlock! The side of Roy's face met Ed's bulging bicep, while the back of his head was pressed up a hard, flexing pec!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? How do you like THIS?!\" Ed said, squeezing Roy tight, \"Ha ha, who's the big man now!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not you!\" Roy said, grabbing onto Ed's one arm, while his other hand grabbed Ed's wrist! Roy had no problem pulling them apart, freeing himself! Ed was a bit surprised, to say the least! But in all fairness, Ed was still in his teens, while Roy on the other hand was a full-grown MAN! Roy stood there, grinning at Ed, ready for whatever he had next! Ed stood there too, hunched over in a position so he was ready to take on anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right at this moment that Roy managed to see his three men watching from his office! \"Hey!\" He said, his voice deep and commanding, shaking every one of them to their core! \"Get that gun on the floor near my chair and shoot me with it!\" Roy ordered, \"Do it, and I'll promote each and everyone one of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of a promotion, all three of them started scrambling around the room, before Breda popped up, holding the gun in his right hand! \"Got it!\" He said with a proud little grin! The three of them ran back over to the hole, only to see Roy and Ed wrestling around in the partly destroyed city! Breda took careful aim at the two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for the right moment.\" Fuery said. However he was quickly contradicted by Roy's next words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Do it now!!!\" Roy said, wanting to overpower Ed already and come out on top of this battle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't miss.\" Havoc said, focusing on the two of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreda gulped. He immediately felt all the pressure weighing on his shoulders! He started to sweat a little, feeling uneasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!!!\" Roy roared, quickly growing impatient with it all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreda grit his teeth, and took careful aim! \"For the colonel!\" He shouted, before firing the gun!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The energy gathered at the muzzle of the gun, Breda holding it as steady as he could while the ground was quaking from the movements of the titanic alchemists. For one heart stopping moment, it almost seemed like the blast was going to hit Ed square in the back, but he twisted Roy around (as he clung to his back, his arms wrapped tightly about Roy's neck, trying to choke the breath out of him and get him to faint) at the last second, letting him get hit square in the chest! Roy let out a deep, pleasurable moan as the energy soaked his body, quickly spreading through it and pushing him to new heights! Ed let out a little yelp as he was suddenly dragged into the air, the neck his arms were locked around swiftly growing thicker and thicker, until his puny arms couldn't reach even halfway around! Ed looked around, distressed as he saw Roy's back flare out, each muscle making a new canyon, allowing Ed to get a foot hold as Roy's height continued to rocket into the sky!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the ground, the three inferior (in more ways than one) officers watched Roy's transformation with open mouths, their colonel stretching higher and wider, his chest growing thicker and heavier, the massive slabs of muscle bulging outward, hanging lower over his abs, each brick smashing forward, making Roy's core look massive and tight, his shoulders broadening while his biceps inflated like a hose was stuck in them, veins rising to the surface of his skin, feeding them more and more. Roy let out a deeper moan and flexed his bicep, watching as the muscle grew bigger and rounder, jutting up off his arm like a mini mountain. \"Yeah...bigger...stronger! The strongest in the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice bellowed out over the city like thunder, the citizens running screaming as Roy's gigantic toes barreled through buildings, smashing them to bits, the digits eventually towering over them, the debris getting swept up like sand between his toes! Breda, Fuery, and Havoc were lucky in the sense that Roy's feet were growing on either side of the building they were in, allowing them to avoid the destruction and get an impressive show in the process! Roy's massive brief clad bulge (the briefs were keeping up with his size, though always seeming to be one size too small, hugging tightly to Roy's body and accentuating his every curve) was hovering high over head, swaying with every movement, sending down a potent musky scent, making the men down below nearly swoon at the pure manly smell! Roy didn't seem to notice, his legs shifting unconsciously as his thighs began to rub up against each other, each one thicker than even the most massive tree, his calves quickly growing hard and round to support his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth slowly came to a stop when Roy was towering high, high above East City, the miniscule buildings not even clearing halfway up his toes! His feet were nearly as big as the city itself, smoke slowly rising up from decimated buildings around them. Roy merely grinned and said, \"I always knew I was too BIG for East City!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed and leaned forward slightly so he could see over his pecs, the HQ barely visible to him far, far, far down below. He bent down, his massive junk descending on the city like a falling meteor, stopping a few feet from the roof, the smell positively overwhelming now! Roy gently shifted his bulge aside, caving in the roof on one side of the building, eliciting an insincere \"Oops~\" from the colonel before he laid out his hand on the ground. \"Alright men! Get on. NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis booming, authoritative voice left no room for argument. The men were practically falling over themselves in their rush to get out of the building and over to the hand. Here, however, they ran into a problem. Roy's finger alone was so thick it was about as tall as the building, if not slightly taller. Havoc rubbed the back of his head ruefully before cupping his hands around his mouth and shouting, \"HEY! COLONEL! WE CAN'T CLIMB UP! IT'S TOO HIGH?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Geez you three are pathetic! You're lucky I owe you one for you help back there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand lifted into the air and turned over, the gigantic index finger and thumb gripping Havoc roughly by the back of his coat, hoisting him up into the air and dropping him on the opposite palm. Roy repeated this process with the other two and got back to his feet, bringing the tiny soldiers up to his titanic face. \"Good job back there men. As promised, I'm promoting all three of you! You're now part of my new army of worshipers and pleasure slaves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" They all said at once, not quite believing what they were hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy frowned and said, \"You know, if you three hadn't helped me, you'd all still be inside that building, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted his right foot and brought it down, hard, on top of the HQ, cracking the ground and knocking down at least a dozen others from the shockwave alone. Roy smirked down at them and said, \"Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES SIR!\" They all shouted, saluting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now, your job is simple. Do whatever I say, whenever I say. Since I'm way too huge to work that puny little gun anymore you're going to grow me when I tell you too. And to make sure no one can get to you or it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe peeled back the waistband of his briefs, turning his palm over, the mini soldiers all tumbling down into the musky darkness, right on top of his dick. Roy sighed, closing his eyes. \"Mmm, oh yeah~ That feels so damn good...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe enjoyed the sensation of the bug sized men squirming about in his underwear a moment longer before he stretched and reached back, expecting to find Ed back there, but coming up with nothing but air. \"Now, where did that little pip squeak go?\" He muttered to himself, looking around.</span></div></div>",

He was sure now that the gun the colonel was holding had something to do with all this! The only problem now was that there was something standing in his way... Something over two hundred feet tall and muscles that could crumple even the most dense steel like it was a candy wrapper! Ed decided it was more wise to just remain hidden the best he could. The thing was, he was nothing to scoff at either! Only about half Roy's size, maybe a little less, Ed was a gigantic teen with a sculpted, hulking figure! His body was red and radiating heat as he stood there, panting. Right now, he just had to catch his breath and hide as well as he possibly could!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoy stood tall, looming over the entire city with a big, cocky smirk on his face. \"Heh, and here I used to think this city was big! Now it's just a puddle around my feet!\" Roy's voice boomed. He wiggled his thick toes, crushing countless small businesses beneath them! So many lives, instantly changed and ended, and all decided by this one beefy behemoth of a god! Roy chuckled. \"Now I wonder where Fullmetal ran off to...?\" He asked himself, \"I need a new LITTLE toy to play with!\" He barked, making sure to put emphasis on \"little.\" He listened carefully to see if any sound came from down below. To his dismay, he didn't hear Ed say a thing! All he could hear was the roaring of a crowd of people as they desperately tried to escape the city!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Fullmetal...!\" Roy said, taking one huge step forward! \"If you're gonna be such a TINY man and hide, then I'm just going to stomp this city flat until I find you!\" Roy said, letting his own selfish intents become known! As Ed was ducked not too far from the ruined military building, he could feel the ground shake beneath him! Roy had begun to stomp out the city, putting all his might into every step he took! He seemed to enjoy the sensation of the earth quaking beneath him! That he controlled such power that no man had felt before! It was all so intoxicating, and Roy relished every moment his titantic feet would crash into the earth below!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Geez, Mustang...!\" Ed thought as he hid in the shadow of the building. It was already beginning to crack due to the earthquakes from Roy's gargantuan, powerful feet smashing into the ground! At times, Ed had to brace himself just to make sure he didn't go flying into the air! As he turned and peeked around the edge of the rubble, his eyes became wide! What was once a glorious city had almost instantly became one big dirt pancake! Roy really didn't mess around! And at this rate, it would only be seconds before he was found out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fullmetaaaaal~ Where are yoooooou~?\" Roy's voice chimed. \"Are you... HERE?!\" Roy's foot then came down on top of a large building, reducing it to rubble and creating a cloud of smoke! \"Heh, guess not!\" Roy then turned and looked over the rest of the city. He started walking closer to where Ed was actually hidden! Ed noticed the shadows around him growing even darker as Roy's monstrous form blocked out the sun, as well as Ed's hope! \"How about...?\"</span></div></div>",

However, unlike the one that Tamaki was focusing on this girl was a bit more... Cynical. \"Hmph! Player indeed...\" She thought to herself. \"I'm going to teach a man like you a lesson for breaking my sister's heart...\" The girl glanced around, making sure Mori and Kyouya weren't looking. After all, those two were like sentinels. She popped a cork off of a vial she had strapped to her wrist. She move her hand over to grab at Tamaki's tea, making sure the liquid all poured down into the cup. She smiled as she then saw that the deed was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! My dear.\" Tamaki reached over, gently taking her hand. \"That ones mine. Decaffinated, you understand.\" He said in a kind voice, giving her a charming smile. The girl just smiled in return, before replying, \"Ah Tamaki. You're always such a charmer!\" She giggled a little afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simply what I do, my lady.\" He said, speaking softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki took the tea and brought it up to his lips before taking a big gulp. The woman's smile was able to ring true, knowing that her revenge would soon take it's toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the afternoon, Tamaki kept adjusting his collar as Kyouya complied the totals for the day. All of the host members were gathered, unable to leave until Kyouya was done. Tamaki was actually starting to sweat a little as he watched. He wasn't nervous, no, but actually he felt like his body was heating up! He didn't want to say a word, and keep his cool fa\u00e7ade, but doing so was proving increasingly difficult! He looked at the twins, and then at Honey and Mori. They seemed perfectly find... They didn't think it was hot in here? Tamaki's thoughts were starting to rush as he kept listening to Kyouya ramble off some numbers. His mind was wandering elsewhere now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Alright, I think that'll do for today...\" Kyouya said. \"Good job, everyone! At this rate, profits will continue to increase tenfold!\" He said with a gentle smile as he looked at everyone. He saw Tamaki was sweating, but he merely dismissed it as nervousness. He then turned to the doors. \"I'll can't wait until tomorrow. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some homework to finish off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Homework?\" Honey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.

His face was flushing with red, unable to get himself up off the floor! Everyone's attention immediately turned on him, Hikaru and Kaoru actually shouting, \"Boss!\" once they saw their close friend laying on the floor! Everything went dark for Tamaki. Desperately, he wanted to utter a word, anything! Just in case these were his last moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...

He wouldn't admit it or show it publicly, but he was possibly the most worried of all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... How are we gonna tell him...\" Kaoru began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It's so... Big! Really swollen...\" Hikaru agreed before his little brother could finish his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph... W-What...\" Tamaki began to mumble, finding his ability to talk once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! He's waking up!\" Honey told everyone as if no one had been paying attention to Tamaki. Tamaki felt a sudden increase of pressure on his chest, but it wasn't painful in the slightest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys... What's going on...?\" Tamaki asked, finally able to string words into a proper sentence! He opened his eyes, the redness from having his eyes closed quickly beginning to vanish until he saw blurs! But even those blurs were starting to come into focus, the most noticable one being a gigantic pink one right in his face! \"Wh-Wha?\" He finally spoke, having regained his vision. He recognized the pink object now as Usa-chan, Honey's beloved stuffed rabbit, being held right in his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tama-chan! Are you okay? Do you need to use my Usa-chan?\" He asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No... No...\" Tamaki resigned, turning his head a little. \"Honey, are you... Sitting on me?\" He asked, noticing the child's position on his chest. So THAT was where the pressure was coming from!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Your chest is super soft!\" Honey said, bouncing up and down a little as he sat there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well, I know I DO work out a little...!\" Tamaki said, chuckling a little. It was then he felt a sudden hiccup! His feet slammed into the foot of the bed, and Honey jumped up slightly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! He got even bigger!\" Kaoru said, staring at Tamaki!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? Even bigger?\" Tamaki stammered, before he looked all around. As he looked at both of his shoulders, he notice they were huge! It was like having half of a basketball planted right on his shoulders! \"Wh-Wha?!\" Tamaki gasped, \"I... What kind of misshapen beast am I?!\" He shouted! Honey put his hand over his mouth. Tamaki noticed how small his hand felt on his lips. Well, smaller than usual that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Tama-chan, you're not misshapen! You're... You're... Heehee!\" Honey just giggled cutely before finally hopping off of Tamaki's chest! The man was shocked as he saw that the little boy was right! He wasn't a misshapen beast, he was a hunk! Pecs so round that they had barely fit into his tanktop! They were so swollen and massive, the neck of the shirt so far down that it barely left anything hidden! The only thing that was hidden was his pinkish nipples, but even they were semi-erect from the sudden growth he just went though! The base of his abs were displayed proudly, the puny shirt barely able to contain this much man! His abs rock hard and defined, each popped out from his stomach! His shoulders may have been huge, but his biceps were even bigger! He looked at his arms which were nearly the size of cannonballs, and that was when they weren't even flexed! He was tempted to so badly, if he wasn't worried that he would break out of his shirt. As he gazed down further, he saw something that made him crack a smile. Even with all this muscle packed onto his new body, they weren't the only thing that had developed! His manhood was standing out a good few inches out of his hips! It had to be at least eight inches long, barely concealed by his boxers, ready to burst out at any moment! His thighs were mere inches apart from each other, so beefy and ripped, which wasn't unlike his calves, that had grown into gigantic pillars, powerful and strong! His feet were still contained in his socks, though they almost felt as if they were going to burst off of his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You guys! I'm huge!\" Tamaki shouted, sitting up almost instantly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no duh boss.\" Kaoru said, he and Hikaru shrugging in unison as they looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got so big that we had to dress you in one of Mori's shirts! It doesn't look like it fits you very well though...\" Honey said, snuggling Usa-chan as he glanced up at Tamaki rather sweetly~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He DOES look pretty good.\" Hikaru agreed, smiling to himself as he stroked his chin, \"Pretty good indeed...\" Hikaru glanced up and down Tamaki's new, hunky body. Kaoru, on the other hand, was trying to be more subtle, walking the other direction of his brother with his arms behind his head, but Tamaki could feel his clandestine stares from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like all is well.\" Kyouya said, \"Come along everyone, he's had a long day. We should allow him to rest before he heads home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyouya exited the room, Mori following shortly behind. He held Honey's hand as he walked, while the smaller man kept looking at Tamaki. The twins left shortly after as well, both of them giving Tamaki very pleasant goodbyes as they left the room. Tamaki just smiled and waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout five minutes later, as Tamaki was adjusting to his new body, he heard the door click open! It was...</span></div></div>",

Tamaki smiled back, though a little hesitatingly. \"Uh...did you two forget something?\" Tamaki asked, getting to his feet. The twin's eyes both followed his ascent as he stood up to his full height. He had to be at least around Mori's height, maybe even taller! They both quickly walked into the room, Kaoru locking the door behind them while Hikaru walked up to Tamaki, about level with the bottom of the bigger teen's pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah, woah, what are you doing boss? Standing up? Aren't you dizzy? You just got through a pretty rough ordeal, you know?\" Hikaru said, quickly pressing his hands against Tamaki's pecs, giving them a surreptitious little squeeze as he did so. Tamaki was so surprised by this sudden push he tumbled backwards onto the bed, the springs creaking loudly in protest, the bed visibly bowing slightly as his increased weight pressed down against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I supposed I am a little bit...\" Tamaki said, Hikaru pressing against his chest again, making him lay down. Kaoru came over at this point, a big smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just relax, okay boss?

Hikaru nodded, taking his jacket off and tossing it carelessly over a chair, slowly undoing his tie as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you thinking of doing?\" Tamaki asked, nervous in spite of himself. He was clearly at least twice as strong as both twins combined, but he still felt a strange fear among the crafty pair. Hikaru slowly rubbed his hands along Tamaki's chest, bringing a finger up to his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhhh~ Do what Kaoru said. Just relax.\" Hikaru said softly, smiling down at Tamaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow boss your feet are really big!\" Kaoru said, holding one up as he pulled the strained sock off, running his hand along the soft, soft sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know what they say about a guy with big feet.\" Hikaru playfully said, his finger trailing down Tamaki's body, hooking into the collar of the tanktop, pulling it down slightly. \"You could get a finger lost in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran his finger down the middle of Tamaki's chest, the thick pecs on either side reflexively flexing, making Tamaki let out a little gasp, catching Hikaru's finger. Hikaru chuckled and tucked his other hand under Tamaki's pec, giving the nipple a little pinch. Tamaki jerked his body slightly, releasing Hikaru's finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Stop this! Y-You two are making me....\" Tamaki trailed off as he felt Kaoru rub his feet again, both now bare. The material of his pants creaked slightly as his already considerable bulge stuck out more, all the attention to his sensitive body making it react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on boss, a big guy like you should be served by two guys as talented as us.\" Kaoru said, stripping off his jacket and tie as well, moving his hands up Tamaki's bulging calves and thick thighs. \"You're just so big and manly and powerful! We can't keep our hands off you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki blushed a little in spite of himself, a smile rising to his lips. \"W-Well...I am pretty impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru's eyes widened as Tamaki's chest suddenly bulged upward, pushing the straps of the tank top to the sides, revealing the meaty slabs of beef in their full glory. Kaoru was also witness to a small miracle, Tamaki's pants splitting along his thighs, revealing his soft skin and rock hard muscles. \"Woah! You're even more impressive than I thought boss!\" Hikaru said, regaining his composure as he massaged Tamaki's pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nngh...k-keep doing that.\" Tamaki said, his big arm suddenly coming up, his palm pressing against Hikaru's back. His huge feet were now slightly longer than the bed, forcing his legs to bend slightly, making a little cage around Kaoru, leaving him face to face with his boss's incredible bulge, the button quivering as the pressure increased against it.Karou playfully gripped the waistband, slowly undoing the button while Hikaru kept massaging, his face slowly lowering closer to Tamaki's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say boss~ Your wish is our command~\" Hikaru grinned as he slowly licked along Tamaki's pumped pec, the bigger teen's body heating up as he was serviced. Karou undid the button at this time, the zipper swiftly undoing itself as Tamaki's incredible organ rose up from his boxers, kept at bay by the second button on the much flimsier material, the golden bush at the base of his cock visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So THIS is the famous Tamaki dick.\" Kaoru said, playfully tapping the head of Tamaki's dick with a single, teasing finger. \"It's just as big as the rest of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki chuckled, his face flushed, one hand covering it as he said, \"I've ALWAYS been big~ This little enhancement is just making it more obvious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki's body swelled with pride, his pecs pressing against Hikaru's face, the straps lost between his immense shoulders and bulging traps, the collar tearing slightly as the hem rose up higher, revealing more of his biceps! His legs lengthened, the hems rising up to the base of his impressive calves, his toes now pressing up against the baseboard again. Kaoru's eyes widened as he saw Tamaki's cock visibly thicken and lengthen, getting even harder! He licked his lips and reached out, getting a handful just from the head of the dick, making Tamaki moan deeply, his chest vibrating against Hikaru's mouth, making the lascivious teen blush! Tamaki's grin grew wider as the feelings of pleasure increased, testosterone flooding his body, giving him a cocky edge. He slowly revealed his blazing eyes and said, \"Keep going~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins obeyed, Hikaru sucking lightly on the pec flesh, Tamaki's skin having a flowery, and yet salty taste, giving him an elegant manliness. Kaoru undid the buttons on his shirt, feeling a stirring in his own pants as he spread the flaps on Tamaki's boxers, letting his impressive cock free, the veiny shaft pushing its way out. Tamaki's body was now as wide as the bed, the legs groaning as the weight only got heavier on it. Tamaki's clothes were far too small on him now but it only served to highlight just how huge he was, thick and tall, the whole package! His big hand slowly made its way down Hikaru's back, cupping the smaller teen's ass, making him give out a little moan, his face moving over to Tamaki's nipple, taking the sensitive nub in his mouth, sucking gently, nipping at it with his teeth. Tamaki let out a gasp before he said, \"I don't know how you're fitting so much of it in your mouth...I'm so big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stretching sound filled the air Tamaki's head pressed up against the headboard, his thick neck tensing slightly at the resistance, the baseboard, bending slightly under the force of Tamaki's feet. The tank top ripped more, stopping just short of the hem, most of Tamaki's amazing abs now fully on display! Kaoru's hand was pushed back as the head he was gripping grew wider, fatter, the slit flaring slightly as Tamaki's passion increased. His balls were starting to peek out from under the boxers, the rips on his pants getting longer, the hems popping as Tamaki's huge calves exerted far too much pressure on them! With a resounding CRACK the bed legs finally gave up, sending all three teens to the floor, though none of them cared or even noticed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were, after all, just getting started!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Host Club members were all moving towards the exit of the Music Room when Tamaki suddenly stopped in his tracks. His head had been spinning and his body heating up for the last minute or so but he had been ignoring it. However, as time went on, the feelings only got worse and worse! He pressed his right palm against his forehead while his left arm was hugging him around the chest. Kyouya, being closest to Tamaki at the time of walking, noticed the golden haired teen fall behind and said, \"Tamaki? Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweat was beading up on his skin as he looked blearily at Kyouya. The rest of the Host Club members stopped and turned, wondering what was going on. \"He's just faking.\" Hikaru said, waving his hand in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, he looks pretty bad.\" Kaoru said, one hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tama-chan? Are you sick?\" Honey asked, tugging on Tamaki's jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori came by and picked Honey up, lifting him out of the way in case Tamaki threw up. \"Give him some air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Tamaki, this was all a discordant jumble of noise that barely penetrated his ears. It was like cotton was stuffed in them. His eyesight was no better. It was like trying to look out a foggy window. Add in how dizzy he felt and it was like trying to drive while sitting behind a foggy windshield...not that Tamaki had ever done such a thing, but he had heard stories. Then everything went black as Tamaki's eyes rolled up into the back of his head and he fainted dead away. He didn't even feel the impact as he fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki wasn't sure how long he was out. It could have been five seconds and it could have been five hours. His body still felt quite weak, his head still swimming. He just decided to lie there, the cool tile of the floor comforting on his feverish skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, just look at him!\" A voice said, seemingly far away, barely audible through the cloud of Tamaki's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to him?\" A different, though similar sounding voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea....\" A third voice answered. \"Something like this shouldn't technically be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down, I wanna see something!\" A fourth, much younger sounding voice shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki groaned and turned his head to the left, slowly opening his eyes. Surprisingly, his vision was actually quite clear. Unfortunately for his heart, Honey's grinning face was inches from his own! With a little yelp he jumped to his feet, stumbling slightly as he felt a sense of vertigo, falling back down onto his butt. Honey giggled and said, \"Careful Tama-chan! A little guy like you could hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...what?\" Tamaki said, shaking his head slightly. Before anyone could say anything, a pair of large hands grabbed him under the armpits and lifted him up rather easily. \"Thank you Mori-sempai, but I can stand up on my own.\" He said, his voice trailing away as he looked up and saw not the face of the stoic upperclassmen but Hikaru's mischievous grin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki nearly fainted again, his body going limp in Hikaru's hands. \"See? See? I knew he was the same height as me now!\" Honey said, giggling as he got back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What the HELL is going on here?!\" Tamaki shouted, immediately struggling in Hikaru's hands. \"This had better be a dream! I-It has to be right? This can't be real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru held Tamaki at arms length, trying to avoid the spastic prince's flailing limbs. \"Sorry boss, but it's real as real can be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyouya walked up and grabbed Tamaki, holding him protectively against his chest. \"There there~ Settle down now~ Momma's going to make everything alright~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki's eyes started to fill with tears as he clutched at Kyouya's shirt. \"This is insane Kyouya! Why do all the terrible things have to happen to meee-hee-hee?\" His last word trailed off into a tortured sob. The twins sighed and shook their heads. They knew theatrics when they saw them. Kyouya, one arm wrapped around Tamaki, pulled out a syringe with the other, gently pushing Tamaki's shirt sleeve up until he could stick the needle in, drawing out a small sampling of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Tamaki said, wincing and looking up at Kyouya with a frown. \"Hey, what do you think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Taking a blood sample~\" He said coolly, putting the syringe into a special case. He set Tamaki down and said, \"You want to know what's caused this...little problem, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki dusted off his clothes, suddenly pulling out the hem of his jacket and looking at it in wonder. \"Hey...my clothes shrank with me! That's odd...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually....\" Kaoru said, looking a little embarrassed, \"Your clothes were way too big so we just put you in one of Honey-sempai's uniforms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki looked over at the short boy who smiled shyly at him. \"We have the same size now Tama-chan~ Isn't that great?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure...I guess...At least I have clothes that fit~\" He said, smiling weakly at Honey. It was strange looking at him eye to eye...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm going to send this blood to get analyzed.\" Kyouya said, heading for the door. \"In the meantime, I think it would be best if we all stick together to make sure Tamaki doesn't get hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would want to hurt him?\" Kaoru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think this shrinking was accidental. Someone could very well be trying to kidnap him or kill him.\" Kyouya said. \"So! Everyone needs to stick together. Here, in the Music Room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Slumber party! Slumber party!\" Honey chanted, running around excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyouya smiled and said, \"Exactly~ I'll be back in an hour or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Tamaki was left with the other four members of the Host Club.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With Kyouya gone, the five boys were all left to their own accord. Mori had quickly left to gather some blankets and pillows as well as a few mattresses! The twins had skipped off somewhere together, but no one knew where. It gave Tamaki a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach. He just knew that they were plotting something! Honey was the only one left doing nothing! Tamaki looked at him for a moment, before he smiled and took Tamaki's hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, Tama-chan! Let's go eat some cake!\" He said, dragging Tamaki along! As Honey pulled, Tamaki was instantly reminded of just how strong Honey was, as he was pulled along with ease! Tamaki stumbled for a moment, before he was sat at a table with Honey. Tamaki looked around briefly, before looking back at Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey, Honey-senpai, it's a little late for cake, isn't it?\" Tamaki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Honey said, looking back at Tamaki, \"It's never too late for cake! Stay here, I'll go get some! I know just where Takeshi hides it!\" Tamaki chuckled a little nervously, before watching Honey scamper off! He looked at the table, and noticed just how much bigger everything seemed! The forks were taller, the centerpiece was a little more of an obstacle, and he could actually fit his fist in the upper part of the tea cup! As he sat there, he kept a close eye out for Hikaru and Kaoru. There was no doubt they'd return soon with something up their sleeves...! Honey quickly returned, holding a large platter in his hands! \"Found it!\" He said with a grin, \"Let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney quickly distributed cake, and the two of them began eating together, having a little sweet dinner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm... This is really good!\" Tamaki said, before taking another bite!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I eat this kind of stuff all the time!\" Honey said proudly, \"It's way better than vegetables!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you be eating those anyway?\" Tamaki asked, \"It might be why you're so short!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Honey replied, \"Takeshi can't make me, and neither will you!\" Honey snapped. \"And I'm not short... Just... Fun sized...\" Honey said, a little dispondant at the end there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right... Sorry...\" Tamaki said, feeling a little bad for hurting Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay!\" Honey said, beaming at Tamaki, \"Because now you're short too!\" Tamaki winced a little, reminded of his new height problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater into the night, all the boys were settling down in bed together. That is, except the twins, who were still out missing... It only worried Tamaki even more than he already was! The little prince laid his head down on his pillow, trying his best to put his mind at ease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeshi, I wanna sleep with Tama-chan tonight!\" Honey said, pointing at Tamaki!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to ask him first.\" Mori replied, looking down at Honey. Honey walked over, and bent down, gently shaking Tamaki's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tama-chan? Can I sleep with you tonight?\" He asked softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyuh... Sure.\" Tamaki replied hesitantly. He never had to share his bed before, but Honey was pretty nice to him, and the experience wouldn't kill him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Honey cheered! He turned to Mori and said, \"He said yes, Takeshi!\" Mori just rose a hand in reply to let Honey know he heard him. Honey got down in bed with Tamaki, and cuddled up close right behind him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Honey-senpai, what are you doing?\" Tamaki asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting comfy!\" Honey replied, \"Me and Takeshi do this all the time, it's really comfy! This is the first time I get to be in back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\" Tamaki stammered, having less than pure thoughts as Honey told him this. \"Well, if you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney got close and personal, nuzzling Tamaki's neck a little and wrapping his limbs around Tamaki! A bit uncomfortable at first, Tamaki was surprised! Honey was absolutely right! This was incredibly comfortable! Tamaki sighed, before closing his eyes. He was easily able to fall fast asleep!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All was silent in the room as the boys slept. Tamaki had never felt quite so warm and comfortable as he did in the arms of his small (well, equal sized now) friend. Everything from Honey's strong arms and soft chest, just slightly exposed as the top few buttons of his pajama shirt were undone, to the light puffs of warm breath on the back of his neck all combined to lull Tamaki into a deep sleep. Honey was similarly relaxed. Tamaki's soft skin and small, beating heart, just under his right hand, not to mention his soothing scent, made Honey feel completely at ease. Halfway through the night, Honey turned over onto his back, Tamaki resting easily on top of his sempai. Tamaki turned around in his sleep and nuzzled against Honey's exposed flesh, a small smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night wore on, however, something was obviously wrong. At one in the morning, Tamaki's body, which had been equal in length to Honey's, was now slightly shorter. At 2, the difference was more significant, his head resting on Honey's chest, while his feet reached down to the small boy's knees. At 3 Tamaki's toes were level with Honey's crotch, Honey's big arms now covering a sizable portion of Tamaki's tiny frame. The shrinking stopped at 4, with Tamaki's feet now just above Honey's waistband, his head still resting comfortable on Honey's now much wider chest. Honey smiled in his sleep, turning over again, his legs curling up, almost completely shielding Tamaki from view, almost like he was protecting him. Tamaki, for his part, clung more tightly to Honey's shirt, hiding his face amongst its folds, his own body pressing fully against Honey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few hours of the night passed uneventfully, the morning sunshine soon streaming in through the blinds. Honey stayed fast asleep, his face buried in his pillow in such a way that the light wouldn't reach him. Mori slowly sat up and stretched, looking over at Honey, who was still curled up with a small smile. He couldn't see Tamaki but assumed that Honey was just lying on top of him. He got up and headed for the bathroom to get freshened up. Tamaki slowly woke up next, his eyes opening to a strange peach wall in front of him. He blinked, confused, before he remembered yesterday! He had shrunk! But wait...he had fallen asleep with Honey...so what was this wall? His eyes darted left and right, taking in the blue material of what appeared to be pajamas framing the wall. Slowly, it dawned on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Honey sempai?\" Tamaki said softly, pushing against the \"wall\" slightly, trying to see more of his surroundings. Unfortunately, Honey's grip was far too strong! Tamaki was trapped! \"H-Hey! Honey sempai! Wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney let out a groan and said, \"Just five more minutes please Takeshi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sempai, it's ME! Tamaki! You need to wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Tama-chan? What are you doing in my bed?\" He said, slowly rubbing his eyes, blinking down at Tamaki. He looked confused at first but then a light seemed to go off in his head. \"Oh! I remember now! We were sleeping together and you were my height!\" He smiled down at Tamaki, his eyes widening as he saw how small Tamaki was. \"And now you're even smaller!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled and laid on his back, holding Tamaki up above him like he was a doll, shaking him slightly. \"You're so cute now Tama-chan~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean \"now\"?\" Tamaki said, crossing his arms and looking a bit offended. \"I've always been cute! ...But that's not the point! Look at me Honey sempai! I'm even smaller now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry Tama-chan~\" He said soothingly. \"I'm right here with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...that's true...\" Tamaki said, looking around. Mori's bed was empty, but he could hear water running from the bathroom. His gaze slowly shifted over to where the twins' bed was. It was empty, but the covers were tousled. Someone had slept in it, though the two were still nowhere to be found. \"I don't like that Hikaru and Kaouru aren't around...I think they're up to something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll protect you Tama-chan, don't worry about them~\" Honey said, hugging Tamaki close to his chest again. \"As long as you stay with me, you'll be safe and sound~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki let out a little sigh and hugged Honey back, his heart beating a little faster. \"Thank you Honey sempai.\" He said softly. He wasn't sure how much he liked being held and hugged like a doll, but it WAS a relief to know that at least one of the Host Club members was looking out for him. There was no telling how long the blood tests would take or even if they would find anything useful out from them. Tamaki shuddered as another thought entered his mind. What if he kept shrinking? It was bad enough being child sized or even doll sized but what if he was action figure sized? Or small enough to hide under a thimble? Or bug sized? He imagined Honey towering over him like a colossus and shuddered a little again. Hopefully it wouldn't come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tama-chan?\" Honey asked, feeling Tamaki's shudders. \"Are you cold?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Tamaki looked down at himself and realized that his clothes had become far too big on him, the pajama shirt surrounding him like a blanket. \"Oh! I-I guess I am a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney smiled and said, \"I'll keep you warm until we find some clothes for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gently picked Tamaki up out of the shirt, revealing his fit, naked form which Tamaki modestly tried his best to cover, blushing fiercely as he did so, and gently tucked him into his shirt, doing up the buttons so that he was pressed snuggly against Honey's chest. \"There~ Isn't that better?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki felt perfectly warm, not too hot and not too cold, Honey's soft skin making a wonderful pillow for him to rest against. \"Yes, sempai, that's much better~\"</span></div></div>",

Where did he go?\" Tamaki asked, looking up at Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno... He said he had to go somewhere last night to take care of something, but I don't remember what...\" Honey replied, scratching his head a little. Honey stood there, trying to think a little, when something struck his nose! \"O-Oh! I'm getting a little...\" He cut himself off in mid-sentance, before looking down at Tamaki, who was holding on to his shirt. Tamaki looked up at Honey, a questioning look in his eyes. Honey just smiled. \"I'm gonna go shower, okay, Tama-chan?\" He said, gently taking Tamaki out of his shirt and setting him down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay...\" Tamaki said, \"Well, I do suppose a Honey has to look his sweetest!\" He said, smiling confidently to the side as he tapped his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here! I'll be right back!\" Honey said, before turning and disappearing into the bathroom! Tamaki just smiled to himself, not a worry in the world! ... Until the door to the music room began to creak! Tamaki's head whipped around, looking at the door. No one seemed to be coming in yet... Tamaki started to walk closer to it, keeping his eyes peeled upward as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-Mori-senpai? That you...?\" His voice said, trembling slightly. Tamaki's expression became livid as he saw Kaoru's head peek around and right at him! A devillish grin snuck across his face. To make matters worse for Tamaki, the second head of Hikaru appeared right above Kaoru's! Tamaki froze, taking a big gulp as the smiling twins stared down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well!\" Kaoru said, strolling right in, \"Look what we have here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like our boss had a downsize!\" Hikaru said, walking in behind Kaoru and shutting the door behind the two. \"What do you think we should do to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. He's about the size of one of those action figures we used to play with as a kid...!\" Kaoru replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So you're saying we should tie him to a rocket?\" Hikaru said back. He would never actually do it, but Tamaki didn't know that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we could use him like an army man and step on him!\" Kaoru said, \"Remember those little things? They made a nice crunch when you stepped on them just right!\" The two smiled at each other, before then glancing over to Tamaki! Tamaki was already sweating, and started to slowly back away! The twins soon started walking right tword him, causing the little blonde prince to run!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come back!\" Kaoru beckoned, \"We were just gonna have a little fun with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase was on! Tamaki was quickly sprinting away, but could hear the heavy footsteps of the two brothers following closely behind! The vibration of each step would nearly throw Tamaki off balance if he didn't time just steps just right! Tamaki was chased all across the room, under a few of the end tables, and past the couches! He would dash behind the pillars just to catch his breath! But each time, it didn't take long for one of the twins to peek around or under, grinning at Tamaki. They'd wave at him, prompting him to make a run for it again! The twins would only laugh, letting him run off in fear once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-This is crazy...!\" Tamaki thought, holding his chest as he was taking a breath under the grand piano. \"I have to get somewhere safe, and fast!\" Tamaki took a glance around the room. There was nowhere that was safe! Except maybe... The bathroom! Maybe he could squeeze under the door frame! It was worth a try!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki waiting, taking as much time as he needed, until he saw Hikaru peeking under the piano, and directly at him! \"Peek-a-boo!\" He said with a sneaky little smile. He began to crawl under, but at the first sign of it, Tamaki dashed out from underneath! He made a beeline right for the bathroom! He couldn't remember a time he was running so fast! He ran right past Kaoru who was just a foot away until Tamaki passed him by! The tiny man took a look behind him, and saw the two brothers closing in! He sprinted just a little bit faster, and closed his eyes tight before making a slide under the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki opened his eyes, and saw bathroom! But as he tried to stand, his taut little butt hadn't made it's way through! Tamaki made a mad scramble, wiggling in, just in time to dodge one of the twin's hands slamming down on the other side! Tamaki sighed, wiping the sweat off his forehead. He could hear Honey taking a shower... He would be safe for now. He walked over to Honey's discarded clothes and collapsed on top of them, taking a well-earned rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit Hikaru...!\" Kaoru said with a grunt, \"I missed him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No big deal, little brother.\" Hikaru replied, \"He has to come out of there some time, right?\" Kaoru's scowl soon returned to that grin that Tamaki feared. The two of them sat there on the floor and decided to wait it out. It would all be worth it in the end!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kaoru.\" Hikaru said, getting a sudden idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Hikaru?\" Kaoru asked, glancing over at Hikaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you and me drink the cure for Tamaki we snatched from the Ootori labs? It'll give him a real shock to see we're even bigger when he comes out!\" Kaoru smiled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the way you think big brother!\" He said, taking the vial of milky liquid from the inside of his jacket. He popped off the top, and took a whiff. \"Well, bottoms up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, just save some for me.\" Hikaru replied.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kaoru started drinking from the small bottle. For a brief second he thought about drinking the whole thing himself, just to see how Hikaru would react and maybe have some fun all by himself, but he knew that if he was going to be huge he wanted to be huge with his brother. He drank half the bottle and let out a little sigh, wiping the excess liquid off his mouth. \"Hey, that actually tasted really good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the bottle over to Hikaru who tilted his head back and downed the rest of the liquid in one gulp, wincing a little as he did so. There had been more in there than he thought. \"Hey, you're right! That tasted amazing! You think the labs will make more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not! They're going to need to if they want \"boss\" to be back to normal size.\" Kaoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just have to make sure we're the official delivery boys for it then.\" Hikaru said with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always have the best i--\" Kaoru started to say before suddenly groaning and grabbing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaoru? What's--\" Hikaru reached his hand out to his brother, stopping halfway as pain gripped his insides, making it feel like a giant hand was not only clenching them, but twisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately the twins began to grow bigger! Their heads inched slowly upward as their shoulders broadened, their bodies slowly growing thicker and wider. Their chests pushed against their neat button down shirts, slowly stretching the material, widening the areas between the buttons, showing off their developing chests and abs. Their once flat chests and stomachs bulged outward, their smooth stomachs rippling as three rows of impressive abs popped out one by one, forcing their shirts to come untucked from their pants, which were slowly bulging as they were filled from all angles. The sleeves on their jackets began to ride up their arms, the once thin appendages thickening, their biceps tearing through the sleeves of their under shirts before pressing up against the thicker material of the jackets. Baseball size, softball size, their biceps bulged impressively, stretching the material to its limits! Their ties exploded off their thickening necks, the buttons on their shirts slowly popping off one by one, starting at the collar, their chests bulging out from between the sides of the jackets, the buttons holding below their massive pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hikaru! This feels...ugh...this feels so...amazing~\" Kaoru said, his groan of pain turning into a moan of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knoooooow~\" Hikaru said, flexing his arms, his biceps tearing through the material at last. \"Now I understand why guys work out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir growth continued below the waist, their already formidable bulges growing even more so, forcing the button open on their dress pants and forcing the zipper down, the low whisper of separating metal teeth almost drowned out by the twins' moaning. Their thighs began to rub up against each other, their legs spreading apart to accommodate them, their calves stopping the hems as they moved up their once slender legs, ripping it apart like it was tissue paper. Their feet wouldn't be contained either. The fancy leather warped and slowly split like a rotted husk as the tops of the twins big feet forced their way out, their thick toes popping through the front of the shoes, one by one. The growth slowed to a halt at this point, leaving the twins both taller than Mori by at least a foot or two, their uniforms in tatters on their pumped forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru chuckled as he looked down at himself, his hands painting a picture of what his abs looked like through touch since he couldn't see them past his bulging pecs. With a little grunt, he popped open the dress shirt, sighing as it wasn't constricting around his stomach anymore. Hikaru did the same. He was about to rip his jacket off when he decided to leave it on. The tattered remains of their uniforms, clinging feebly to their massive bodies really gave a sense of scale to how much they had improved. Hikaru grinned rather evilly and knocked on the door again, splintering it slightly. \"Heeeeeeeey \"boss\"~ You sure you don't want to come out of there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru kicked the door, making it splinter in another place. \"It'll be easier if you just come out~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins, in their excitement over their growth, had forgotten that Honey was also inside, showering. The little teen heard the noise and stuck his head out from behind the curtain, blinking slightly, shampoo running out of his flattened hair. \"What's all that noise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki, who had jumped up and away from the door when the knocking had started, looked up with pleading eyes at Honey. \"T-The twins! They're coming after me! You have to help me Honey-sempai!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney immediately felt his protective instincts kick in and nodded. \"Don't worry! I have a plan! I'll sneak you out of here~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...what?  How are you going to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney giggled and picked Tamki up. \"You're really small silly~ I'll just hide you under my jacket like when I sneak Usa-chan into class with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...it was better than nothing! Tamaki nodded and said, \"Just...be careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Tama-chan~ I can take care of myself and I can definitely take care of you too!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney gently brushed Tamaki's hair with his finger before setting him back down, quickly finishing his shower and drying off, staying behind the curtain so Tamaki wouldn't feel embarrassed. He stuck his head out again and said, \"Turn around Tama-chan~ I'm getting out to get dressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki did as he was told, still glancing nervously at the door. The twins had kept knocking playfully, splintering it in several different places. It wouldn't be long before it was knocked down entirely! How the heck were they doing damage like that? Did they have a hammer or something? It didn't take Honey too long to pull on his underwear, shorts, shirt, and jacket, his little feet staying bare for now. He tucked his shirt in, still unbuttoned, and looked over at Tamaki. \"Okay, turn around again~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki did as he was told once more, only to let out a little yelp as Honey grabbed him around the waist and lifted him up. \"Just relax! Remember, don't move~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tamaki could respond, Honey pressed him tightly against his stomach, slipping him around so that he was clinging to Honey's side. Honey quickly did up the buttons on his shirt and tied his tie, smiling as he looked at himself in the mirror. Not a trace of a lump or irregularity could be found. Perfect! He happily skipped to the door and went out to face the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tamaki found himself pressed firmly against Honey's soft skin, blushing as he was once more thrust into physical contact with the once smaller but older male. The flowery scent of his soap filled Tamaki's nose, his heart beating wildly, mostly in fear of discovery. Would this ruse actually work? </span></div></div>",

Honey had a big smile on his face, as he stretched upwards!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, nothing like a hot shower to get all clean!\" He said in his usual happy tone. \"Okay Hika-chan, Kao-chan, it's all yours!\" Honey said, before walking off casually. The twins immediately sprung into action, crawling all over the bathroom in search of their new toy! In the meantime, Honey slipped off out the front door of the music hall, and began to wander about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Tama-chan!\" Honey whispered as he looked down his shirt, \"I'll take good care of you! I'll feed you and clean you and and sleep with you and you'll be with me until we can get you all better again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're an angel, Honey-senpai!\" Tamaki replied, his overemotional side becoming apparant again as a tear came to his eye!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Honey said, smiling brightly. \"Hey! You hungry?\" He asked, still talking in a soft whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn...\" Tamaki thought for a moment. His stomach felt a little empty, but not painfully so. \"I guess I could go for a little brunch...\" Tamaki answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then we'll head out to the rose garden! Takeshi always brings lunch there for me!\" He explained. Honey held the collar of his shirt open just a little bit longer so Tamaki could get fresh air before closing it right up! \"I'll let you out again as soon as we get there!\" Honey whispered, looking straight ahead. Tamaki made some kind of muffled sound, but nothing Honey could understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, back in Music Room #3, the twins were getting tired of searching for Tamaki in the bathroom. There wasn't a lot of ground to cover anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no use, Hikaru...\" Kaoru said disappointingly, \"Little boss is already gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think you're right...\" Hikaru said, \"Do you think he slipped out right behind Honey-senpai?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, you said you were watching the ground when we came in, right?\" Kaoru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that I was...\" Hikaru answered, stroking his chin a little. \"He could just be hiding really well... Did you check inside the shampoo bottles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... How would he even open those?\" Kaoru replied. Tamaki was small, but it was possible he could have opened the bottle, however it would have taken a little time, and with them being wet from the shower it would have taken longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think he went down... the drain?\" Hikaru asked, kneeling by the tub and poking inside. He immediately pulled back, as disguisted look on his face as he shook his finger off. The drain had some of Honey's wet hair in it! The two of them looked at each other before they both said \"Nah!\" Hikaru then went to say, \"Little boss is way too prudent to go down some place as gross as that anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Kaoru agreed. \"You know... There's only one more answer I can think of.\" Kaoru suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?\" Hikaru asked, smiling at Kaoru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey-senpai!\" They both said at the same time! They then laughed, Hikaru putting his arm over Kaoru's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must have slipped Tamaki right by us!\" Kaoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's pretty slick! I didn't think he and Tamaki would be working together!\" Hikaru agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we should go hunt him down, huh?\" Kaoru asked, \"Now that we're so huge, Honey-senpai isn't anything to fear!\" Kaoru said, a grin on his face as he flexed his bicep. The bulky muscle pumped up, a perfectly round bicep popping up on top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Hikaru agreed, puffing out his chest. He made his pecs bounce as he gave them a sharp flex! The perfect size to squeeze Honey's little head in, if he wanted! Without another word, the two of them set out to find just where Honey had ran off to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney arrived in their secret little alcove of the rose garden, complete with a marble booth, table, and a small jardiniere of specially bred blue roses! On the table was a small teaset of what appeared to be cookies, biscotti, and a few dollar pancakes. Honey carefully reached down into his shirt and gently grabbed Tamaki! He set him down on the table, before taking a seat himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, Tama-chan!\" Honey said happily. He started by pouring himself a cup of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow...\" Tamaki said with a gulp! \"I've seen banquets before... But seeing the food at this size takes my breath away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Honey said with a giggle. Of course, he just meant it looked delicious. He had never seen the food from Tamaki's perspective. \"Go ahead! Take whatever you want!\" Honey insisted. He knew Tamaki wasn't that big, so he wouldn't be eating THAT much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my! I think I'll start with... Hm? Honey!\" Tamaki called after but a moment of looking around, \"There's a note here for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney peered over, and picked the note right up with Tamaki on it! Tamaki stumbled a little and fell back on the table as Honey lifted the note up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It's from Takashi! I guess he's helping Kyouya-chan. I guess he's not joining us...\" Honey said. \"At least he got me brunch before he left!\" Honey said, his smile returning! \"And it's still hot too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good thing.\" Tamaki said before reaching in and grabbing one of the mini pancakes. He started to gnaw, not even bothering with butter or syrup!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney and Tamaki were able to enjoy brunch together in the solace of the rose garden. All was going well, when suddenly someone snuck up behind Honey! It was...</span></div></div>",

I didn't mean to be rude...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki chuckled, noting how cute Honey looked. \"Oh, it's just the two of us Honey-sempai! There's no reason to be so formal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney smiled, immediately happy again and said, \"Thanks Tama-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poured Tamaki a glass of iced tea, perfect for the hot day and then tilted his head, looking at it with a confused expression. The look didn't last long before Honey was popping a straw into the glass, making it much easier for Tamaki to drink. Honey nodded, proud of himself, before a shadow suddenly descended on their table. Tamaki, another bite of pancake halfway up to his mouth, slowly looked up, his face transforming into a mask of pure fear! Honey quickly turned around, only to be met by a rock hard wall of abs! Looking up, he just saw the undersides of a pair of massive pecs! He leaned out from under them and frowned when he saw Hikaru's grinning face looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well! I thought I'd find you out here Honey-sempai! And look at what we have here! It's our little boss!\" Hikaru said, turning his eyes on Tamaki who flinched, quickly getting to his feet and backing away. He quickly reached the edge of the table and slipped, falling backwards with a yell! He didn't fall far, swiftly landing on a gigantic hand, the fingers curling around him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little guy!\" Kaoru said with an equally mischievous grin. \"I've got you nice and safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice catch Kaoru!\" Hikaru said, easily knocking Honey out of his seat and sitting down, the chair creaking under his incredible weight. He brought his enormous bare feet up and slammed them down on top of the table, dishes and food flying every which way, iced tea spilling all over the rich linen table cloth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're messing everything up!\" Honey shouted indignantly, jumping to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru snorted and sat down opposite Hikaru, propping his own feet up, casually knocking a scone into Honey's face. \"Who cares? We can do whatever we want now! Who's going to stop us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snickered as he held Tamaki against his massive chest, the little boss's feet gently touching Kaoru's abs. He trembled in his grasp, unable to so much as speak in the presence of these trouble making titans! Honey's face started turning red as he grew angrier, his fists clenched down at his sides. Without warning he suddenly jumped into the air, extending his leg, a mad glint in his eye as he slammed his right foot down on top of Hikaru's abs! Hikaru didn't even so much as wince! He did, however, snatch Honey by the back of his shirt and flip him over, slamming his little body down on top of the table! He let out a little wheeze as the air was knocked out of him, leaving him motionless just long enough for Kaoru to press his giant foot down on top of him, pinning him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, that was even easier than I thought it would be!\" Hikaru said, leaning back in his chair and laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we're unstoppable now, huh Hikaru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree Kaoru. I have to agree!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins laughed heartily, feeling completely in control of their co host club members. Honey groaned as he slowly got his breath back, struggling violently under Kaoru's foot. \"Let me go! Let me go! Let Tama-chan and me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru flicked his big toe against Honey's chin, effectively closing his mouth and keeping it closed, his thick toe unmoving. \"That's not how you talk to your superiors Honey.\" He notably left out the honorific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru picked up on this and grinned. \"Yeah, from now on I think it would be best if you both referred to us as Hikaru-sama and Kaoru-sama. What do you think Kaoru?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're absolutely right Hikaru.\" Kaoru agreed, nodding wisely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You won't get away with this!\" Tamaki managed to sputter out, unwilling to stay quiet in the face of Honey's struggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we will actually.\" Hikaru said, holding his hand out. Kaoru deposited Tamaki into the big mitt and Hikaru roughly brought Tamaki close to his face. \"And do you know why? Because we're not just bigger and stronger than you or anybody else but we're going to get even bigger and even stronger soon enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Kaoru looked a little surprised by this statement. Tamaki shivered, unwilling to imagine the twins growing even further. \"H-How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same way you keep getting smaller!\" Hikaru said, holding Tamaki by his hands and spinning him around like a toy. \"You started out just kind of shrimpy, right?  And now you're downright puny! So who's to say we, since we drank up your antidote, won't keep getting bigger? Besides!\" He stopped spinning Tamaki and held him tight again. \"Once Kyouya finishes your little antidote, the perfected one, we'll just steal that and use it for ourselves! You'll stay doll sized and we'll just keep growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru chuckled and said, \"Well, mother always said we're two growing boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins laughed at this again, Honey and Tamaki feeling a little hopeless at this terrible situation.

That is, until he heard a shrill, piercing sound that woke him out of his funk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Kaoru shouted, his foot lifting up off Honey, and forcing the giant twin to fall to his muscled ass! \"What the hell was that!? Honey?!\" Kaoru barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney immediately got to his feet and started to assess the situation! Just as he started to glance around, Hikaru shouted,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him! Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney glanced back at the table for a moment. He snatched a few cookies and shoved them into his coat, before making for the exit! Just as it was within arms reach, Kaoru's giant foot slammed down, blocking his path!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going anywhere, Honey!\" Kaoru said angrily, as his hand was quickly closing in on the small boy. Honey flipped backwards, touching the ground on his hands, before flipping back and landing on his feet! He faced Kaoru, his hands raised like he was ready to fight! Just then, things went dark as Hikaru's shadow engulfed Honey's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get over here!\" Hikaru barked, quickly reaching down to grab Honey. But he just managed to escape Hikaru's grasp, rolling away to safety! Just as he hit the ground, he could hear the cookies crunch as they broke apart. Honey whimpered a little. He was going to save those for later! But there was no time to mourn, because Kaoru was closing in on him! The ground seemed to shake slightly under the bulk of the huge teen! Thinking quick, Honey reached in his jacket and grabbed the cookie. He quickly crumbled it up and tossed it high up, right into Kaoru's face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh!\" Kaoru flinched back, getting little crumbs in his eyes! \"Dammit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney didn't want to take another risk! As fast as he could, he dove right through the rose bush! His uniform tore on the thorns, not to mention he got a little cut on his cheek, but he had to bear it! He started to run as fast as his little legs would carry him, making as many turns as he could to lose the giant twins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Tamaki thought quietly to himself, \"I hope Honey-senpai brings back help... Then again, I'm not quite sure what could defeat these two beasts...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaoru, are you okay?\" Hikaru asked, walking up to his brother with Tamaki still in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Kaoru replied, rubbing out his eyes a little more. \"I think most of the crumbs were too big to get in my eyes... Not to mention I think half of what he threw bounced off my chest...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they ARE some pretty huge pecs.\" Hikaru said with a smile, rubbing his brother's chest appreciatively. \"I'm just surprised that runt could throw that high!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Yeah, you're right!\" Kaoru agreed, slowly getting his confidence right back! \"Besides, who needs him? We got what we came for right here!\" Kaoru grinned menacingly as he looked down at Tamaki!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sunlight slowly filtered in through the curtains in the room of twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, landing on the bed they shared together. The rich siblings could easily have had entire rooms to themselves but they had been incredibly close ever since childhood and adamantly refused to be apart, even in sleep. However, things weren't always as idyllic as they seemed on the surface...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru Hitachiin sighed slightly, his breath tickling his brother's stomach, his head resting lightly on his older brother's chest. He could hear Hikaru's strong heart beat, thumping with regularity behind his ear, a soothing sound allowing the younger twin's mind to slip into an imaginative state. Every few minutes he'd let out another sigh, as though whatever he was thinking about was displeasing him. After about fifteen minutes of this behavior, Hikaru started to stir. He let out a yawn, stretching his legs out before running his thin fingers through his brother's soft hair. \"Morning Kaoru.\" He said sleepily, rubbing his eyes with the other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning...\" Kaoru said listlessly, running his finger along his brother's smooth chest, ending in a tight spiral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? What's up?\" Hikaru asked, immediately tuned into his twin's less than happy mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've just been thinking is all...\" Kaoru said, being deliberately evasive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What about?\" Hikaru asked, gently coaxing the information out of his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About us. Do you think that we're too similar?\" Kaoru asked, suddenly becoming more direct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we're too similar.\" Hikaru said, rolling his eyes. \"We're twins! No one's been able to tell us apart since we were kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru sighed again, thinking of how he wanted to phrase what he wanted to say before continuing. \"I know that but I mean...well...I'm starting to think that everyone down at the Host Club is starting to get bored of our routine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You're crazy.\" Hikaru said, his attention focused more fully on Kaoru. \"We knock them dead every day! What makes you think anyone's getting sick of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really haven't noticed?\" Kaoru said, sitting up in the bed, looking down at his brother in shock. \"The last two weeks we've been pulling in smaller and smaller crowds! How could you not see that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru sat up, a mischievous glint in his eye. \"Well, I've been too busy focusing on you I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned in suddenly, his arm wrapping around Kaoru's smooth back, pulling him in close. Kaoru blushed and turned his head slightly, his heart thumping more wildly. \"S-Stop...no one's even here to see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru chuckled and said, \"Yeah, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru almost gave in at that point, turning to face Hikaru again, their lips inches apart...but he just couldn't go through with it. He had too much on his mind. \"I'm serious Hikaru!\" He said, pushing his hands against the older male's chest. \"If we don't do something to change up our game we're going to get in trouble with Kyouya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru sighed, flopping back down on the bed, frustrated. \"I know, I know. He's been giving me looks every day at the end of club hours, waiting to pounce as soon our numbers drop past a certain point. But what are we supposed to do? Our whole deal is us together. We're already practically making out as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...maybe we could take things past that last step...\" Kaouru tentatively suggested, but Hikaru was quick to shut him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That kind of thing is for us and us only. There has to be some boundaries somewhere!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru winced and laid down next to his brother, head on his shoulder. While they played off their attraction to each other as just a joke in the club room, keeping their distance and not so much as holding hands, in private things were much different. They were constantly together, touching in some way, as though being out of contact with each other too long would eventually cause them to die. They did everything together: Sleep, shower, eat, and even more, once the lights were out and everyone in the house was asleep. Their relationship had a tinge of the taboo to it, which only made their attraction deeper, their acts more lurid. Now, however, neither of them were in the mood for such romance. \"I was just trying to help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru felt those cool fingers play with his hair again. \"I know...but those girls only like it because we never actually touch. That way they can go on thinking they'd actually have a chance with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru couldn't help but giggle. \"Maybe someday we won't have to worry about what anyone else thinks and we'll be able to just do whatever we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru grinned, his arm pulling his brother in closer. \"Yeah, then I'd be able to throw you down right on the coffee table and have my way with you, while everyone watches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru shivered at the idea, his face flushed. \"Y-You wouldn't do that Hikaru...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you know me better than that little brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned Kaoru over, pinning his arms down, a lusty look in his eye. Kaoru gulped, feeling a stirring under the covers himself. Hikaru was insatiable today, wanting to push aside the problems of the club and lose himself in sex. Kaoru, always the more level headed one, kept them on track. \"Hikaru...seriously, we need to come up with something and fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru tightened his grip for just a second before releasing Kaoru's arms, laying down on top of his brother with a groan, his face buried in the pillow next to Kaoru's head. \"You're killing me Kaoru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can come up with one decent idea we can use then I promise you can do whatever you want to me.\" Kaoru whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru lifted his upper body up slightly, looking into his brother's eyes. \"You promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru winked and crossed his heart. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru grinned and kissed Kaoru directly on the lips, chastely, saving himself for the fulfillment of Kaoru's promise. \"Alright...maybe we need to...change our look? Go for something more punk rocker or skater type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might work...but that might just alienate the fans we still have.\" Kaoru said, rubbing the back of his head. \"Maybe we could change something...physically?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean with our bodies?\" Hikaru said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Honey and Mori senpai have that whole contrast thing working for them.\" Kaoru said, getting a little excited. \"We could try something like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...that's not a bad idea...\"Hikaru said, musing on the possibility. \"Or we could both change something in our looks and cater to a different crowd altogether! I've heard that some people have this...thing for guys who are bigger than average.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Bigger! More muscular or fatter.\" Hikaru explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's a thing?\" Kaoru asked, looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently a really popular thing!\" Hikaru said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...sounds fun! Okay, so we have two ideas! Which one should we do?\" Kaoru asked.</span></div></div>",

One, we could never put bodies as beautiful and perfect as ours under the knife, and two? Fake muscles are even more of a turn off to women than being fat!\" He informed. Hikaru and Kaoru sighed in unison as they kept trying to think of a bulk up quick scheme. However, time and time again Hikaru could only come to a singular solution. \"I guess we'll simply have to hire dieticians and personal trainers for the both of us.\" Hikaru rubbed the back of his head, looking at Kaoru who was still trying to think of a solution to their problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Kaoru began to speak as he released himself from his musing, \"That's really the only way of doing things, huh? I mean, I guess it wouldn't be worth getting...\" Kaoru gulped, \"I-If we don't... Work to get it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru gripped Kaoru's wrists, frowning most unpleasantly as he gazed at his brother. \"Don't say that, Kaoru, not... Work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Hikaru... But this is just the way it has to be...\" Kaoru replied softly, gazing away from his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause in the room before a lethargic groan filled the air. \"Yeah, this isn't working as well without an audience.\" Hikaru said, chuckling to his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Hey, you still have that guy from Germany on speed dial?\" Kaoru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You got the one from Russia?\" Hikaru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure do.\" Kaoru replied before looking at his phone just to be sure. He then gazed at Hikaru. \"Guess there's nothing left but to get to it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two twins got right to work, hiring only the best dieticians and trainers to put them on the fast track to getting buff quick! Overnight flights, rooming and board, serving the twins of the rich Hitachiin brothers didn't come without it's benefits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">- - -</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru and Kaoru woke up early the next morning, shortly after the break of dawn. The two got dress in matching plain white tanktops. Kaoru wore green shorts, Hikaru wore blue. As the two opened the door to their bedroom, there were two muscle-bound hulks there waiting for them! One wore nothing but a speedo, the other wearing a tight pair of red bike shorts and a black tanktop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Da, you ready?!\" One said energetically, taking Hikaru's hand. He didn't care which twin was which, he was getting paid enough, he had to give SOME one a workour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mein frou, jou vill come vith me, da?\" The one in the speedo said, holding Kaoru's hand. He certainly was... Friendly. The two twins looked at each other before being dragged away from each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-See you later, Kaoru!\" Hikaru shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too!\" Kaoru quickly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a few minutes until Kaoru was taken to his dining hall. He looked up at his trainer, smiling a little. \"So... Dirk, what am I going to be eating?\" Kaoru asked, leaning his head on top of his hands and smiling calmly at his German friend. The man could barely speak english, although there was something primal about that fact that gave Kaoru some assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ja, you start vith egg, white chicken bress, und rice.\" Dirk told Kaoru. The meal was quickly placed before the teen. It was still steaming hot, clearly prepared in advance for the teen. \"Zhis is what tiny diet man tell me to give you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru shrugged. It wasn't glamourous, but the road to muscles never was! Kaoru had already begun eating when Hikaru arrived shortly after!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ivan, I told you, I could have gotten us here earlier if you just listened!\" Hikaru barked as he was sat into his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will do what trainer says.\" Ivan replied. He was far more fluent than Dirk was, but still carried his accent. \"Meal of rare beef and protein shake with toast.\" He said, rougly dropping his tray before Hikaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Steak? For breakfast?\" Hikaru noted aloud. He then shrugged and stuck it with his fork before smoothly cutting it. Kaoru looked at Hikaru with some jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, you meat looks like it's actually tasty...\" Kaoru noted. Hikaru glanced at Kaoru's plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours looks pretty great too...\" Hikaru noted, both twins jealous of the other's meal. But neither of their trainers would have any trading! The two were rivals in bodybuilding, after all... Dirk had a reputation for being cocky but always energetic! Ivan, on the other hand, was more focused and strict, but always got great results! Hikaru and Kaoru knew them through their sons, who were getting their education at none other than Ouran Academy. Dirk was studying up human anatomy to be just like his father, while Ivan's son was more interested in becoming a lawyer. The Hitachiins were old friends who's families were regulars to their social gatherings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two twins were quick to finish their meals, before their trainers whisked them away once more, this time to the Hitachiin's private gym. Kaoru was put onto a weight bench to immediately plunge him into his workout, the thin man's chest and biceps going red from the energy he was forced to exert!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must lift as much as you can for as long as you can. Zhen we work our way up, zhen back down.\" Dirk said, smiling as he shared his knowledge. On the other side of the gym, Ivan had Hikaru running on a treadmill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we do warm up. Keeps body slimming for the showing off of more muscle. Then we do weights, da?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Da....\" Hikaru replied behind deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis quickly became the twins new lives. Wake up, eat breakfast, workout. Then lunch, a little more working out, then rest. The only days they got off were their Sundays. After all, muscles could never truly build without a little rest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took weeks before the two began to see any results in each other, but after only a month and a half...</span></div></div>",

No one was safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to worry.\" Kyoya said smoothly, straightening up with a small smile. He adjusted his glasses and gestured toward one of the tables, where a lone piece of cake was sitting. \"It's done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I knew I could count on you Kyoya!\" Tamaki happily shouted, hugging Kyoya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's so special about it?\" Hikaru asked, looking over the seemingly ordinary slice of strawberry cheesecake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The cake itself is completely ordinary.\" Kyoya said, holding up his clipboard. \"But in the center of it, completely undetectable, is a tranquilizer my father's company recently developed. It should knock him out long enough for us to get Usa-chan properly washed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it...safe?\" Tamaki asked, not wanting anyone in his Host Club to be harmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...my father gave it to me to test so I have no idea. I <i>was</i> planning on testing it out on you two but this seems a more appropriate time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee thanks.\" Both twins said, completely deadpan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not to worry. At best the side effects will be minor. I'm almost positive.\" Kyoya said, his smile suddenly looking a little darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki chewed on his thumb nail for a second before finally yelling, \"Alright! We have no choice! It will just have to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyoya nodded and held up his hand to one side of his mouth, cupping it slightly. \"Honey-sempai!\" he called out. \"It's time for your cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay cake!\" Honey shouted happily, already reaching out for it while still being held by Mori. The taller teen calmly carried him over to the table, sitting him down in the chair. The twins slowly backed away towards the door, slipping out of the club room before anyone noticed them. If this plan failed, they didn't want to be anywhere near Honey! Tamaki, similarly, was smiling nervously, but otherwise holding his ground, Usa-chan clutched in his hands behind his back. He didn't want to appear to suspicious. Mori merely stood by, watching as his cousin happily began to eat the cake. Kyoya watched him closely, writing down anything and everything so he could report back to his father later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how I wish Haruhi was here!\" Tamaki thought to himself as he watched Honey scarf down the cake. \"She's so much better at handling these kinds of situations!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Tamaki, Haruhi had walked into the Host Club last week with the news that she was going to be gone for the next few weeks to visit family in America. Her cousin had offered to fly her and her father out there so they had, of course, jumped at the chance. Tamaki had been prepared to follow with the whole Host Club if necessary but Haruhi had told him there was \"absolutely no way, by any stretch of the imagination, that you or anyone else here is going to come!\". She had had such a scary look on her face when she said it, that Tamaki had balked and gave his word that he wouldn't follow no matter what. It pained him to be away from her but the idea of her hating him pained him worse!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted by a loud burp coming from Honey. For such a short guy he certainly could make a lot of noise...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious!\" Honey said, his bright eyes sparkling. \"Come on Takeshi! Let's play some more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki felt faint as he saw Honey jump up into Mori's arms, still wide awake. He glanced over at Kyoya who seemed just as surprised. The twins peeked through the cracked door. Hey, it would still be fun to watch Tamaki get beat up~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Honey drooped in Mori's grip, his eyes closing. Before anyone could ask him what was wrong, his head fell back and he began to snore loudly, his mouth wide open. Tamaki practically danced with joy he was so happy! Mori laid his small cousin down on the couch and covered him with a blanket. Kyoya nodded, satisfied at the results and said, \"He should be out for at least five hours. Let's get Usa-chan to the cleaners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a life saver Kyoya! I owe you one!\" Tamaki said cheerfully, all traces of his nervous demeanor completely gone. The twins walked back in the room, Hikaru looking a little disappointed. \"Nice dodge boss~\" Kaoru said, snickering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mood in the host club had definitely lifted. It almost seemed like the sun was now shining brighter, making everything in the room glisten and sparkle~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Mori said, his eyes focused on Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Did you say something Mori?\" Tamaki asked, turning to face the usually silent club member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori merely pointed at Honey who seemed to be...twitching slightly. Kyoya quickly pulled out his clipboard and began to write, watching as Honey's body began to pulse, his breathing getting slightly faster. The twins blinked while Tamaki was starting to chew on his thumbnail again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...Kyoya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Tamaki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what's happening!\" Hikaru shouted, pointing at Honey's changing body.</span></div></div>",

His little feet were slowly stretching out, quickly making their way to the end of the blanket. Tamaki gulped, chewing on a whole row of nails, ruining his manicure. One of Honey's bare feet poked out of the edge of the blanket... Then the other! They were large, and frightened Tamaki and the twins as they suddenly made a loud cracking noise as they were clenched! As if Honey growing even taller wasn't scary enough, his little uniform was growing tighter as well! His back started to stretch outward, making him look even more intimidating! His young chest quickly developed into pecs, and started to swell and bulge outward, popping off the top few buttons of his uniform. With his new height, his shirt had rode up, leaving his bottom row of abs on display. His sleeves grew tighter as his biceps started to bulge up within their cage, ready to burst out at a moment's notice. His young, taut ass started to fill out, pushing against his pants, as his thighs were struggling to keep up. His calves began to buff up, giving support to hold up the massive teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was all finished, Tamaki was sweating a river as the twins held each other, their teeth chattering. There was a loud groan, the voice just a slight pitch deeper than Honey's normal voice. Suddenly, Honey sat up, his eyes half open. Slowly, his head turned, looking at the three cowering boys looking back in fear. Mori remained in place, his face unchanging, as Kyouya's hand was zipping along the clipboard. Honey let out a loud yawn that made the three boys flinch. After that yawn, his face resumed it's normal cuteness, as if nothing had ever happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeshi... What's everyone so scared of...?\" Honey asked his cousin, rubbing his eyes as he did. It was apparant that he was still a little sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey. You've grown.\" Mori replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've grown...?\" Honey replied, not understanding at first. He looked down at himself and let out a cry, \"Wah!\" His hands quickly ran down along his torso, rubbing the beefed up muscles with his tender, soft hands. \"Takeshi! How did I get so big!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the cake.\" Kyouya butted in. \"At least, we think so. It's either that, or you're finally hitting a late puberty.\" Kyouya said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney let out another yawn. \"Cake sounds really good right now... Do we have any more of the one you gave me earlier?\" Honey asked Kyouya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyouya just paused for a moment. He started to question if giving Honey any more was a good idea. \"Maybe it would be best to analyze this research first...\" He thought to himself, pushing up his glasses. He turned around, heading for the door. \"I'll be back in a moment.\" He said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney still didn't have an answer to his question. He turned to Mori. \"Takeshi? Do we have any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori looked over at Tamaki and the twins. They were all doing their best to silently gesture \"No!\" to Mori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori then turned back to Honey, who was looking up at him cutely. Even with the body of a football player, he still had a cuteness to him. After a moment, he finally replied...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'll be right back with more.\" Mori said smoothly, turning to head to the table where the tainted cake was resting. Kyoya had filled the cake with several of the tranquilizers, one per piece, just in case they had needed it if Honey proved to be more resilient than they expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Honey said happily, rushing over to the table and sitting down, eager for his next piece of cake. Tamaki had nearly yelled out \"WHAT?!\" but had managed to contain himself. He backed away slowly from Honey before whipping around, bringing Usa-chan to his front, chasing after Mori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mori!\" He whispered urgently, catching up with him and walking beside him. \"What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori glanced down at Tamaki and said, \"Mitsukuni usually has two, three, or four pieces of cake depending on how good he was the previous day. He'll get suspicious if that changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki groaned but he knew that Mori was right. \"And if he sees us not taking the piece from the cake sitting out in the open he'll get suspicious of that too! What a mess this is turning out to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori didn't answer. He was too focused on setting the slice of cake onto a plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mori and Tamaki talked, Hikaru suddenly got a mischievous grin on his face. He nudged Kaoru and smiled at him, tilting his head towards Honey. Kaoru smiled and followed Hikaru as he sat down on one side of Honey. The twins knew each other's body language perfectly. Hikaru's expression and movements pretty much meant \"Follow my lead~\". Kaoru was always up for some mischief, so he eagerly went along with his brother, sitting down on the opposite side of Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sempai...how are you liking your new body?~\" Hikaru asked, smiling at the bigger kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh, it's pretty cool I guess! I don't feel that different. Just heavier! And my clothes are too small now...\" He pouted, tugging at his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know sempai, now that you're bigger and stronger, Tamaki won't be able to boss you around anymore.\" Kaoru said, gently feeling one of Honey's bulging biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tama-chan never bossed me around!\" Honey said, looking from one twin to the other. \"He's always been really nice to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sure, but just think about it!\" Hikaru said. \"If you want cake, who can stop you from getting it? You could just pick them up and toss them aside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And if anyone tries to make you sleep when you're not tired, you can just push them over!\" Kaoru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be kind of mean though...\" Honey said. However, there was a look in his eye that showed the twins he was liking what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So don't be afraid to be a little more tough, especially around Tamaki!\" Hikaru said, leaning in close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's probably going to stop you from having more cake, even though you've been so good lately!\" Kaoru said, a sympathetic look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He wouldn't do that! Would he?\" Honey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows?\" They both said, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the time they had alone with Honey, as Mori and Tamaki returned. Mori set the cake down in front of Honey who began to eat it, looking a little worried as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Honey-sempai...how about that being your last piece for today?\" Tamaki asked nicely, smiling down at the muscular teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Honey asked, looking a little annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Because! You don't want it all to be gone after one day do you?\" Tamaki said, his expression wavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney glanced behind Tamaki and saw the twins shrugging and shaking their heads. \"What did we tell you?\" was being broadcast through his body language. Honey frowned and squeezed the fork, bending the metal implement while his bicep suddenly burst through his sleeve. \"I'll eat the cake I deserve! Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki gulped, visibly sweating. \"W-Whatever you say sempai! I was just trying to be helpful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney ignored the nervous Prince and angrily shoveled cake into his mouth. Kaoru suddenly appeared behind Tamaki and whispered, \"Way to antagonize him boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, what are you thinking? Do you <i>want</i> to be smashed like a bug?\" Hikaru snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up you two!\" he hissed back at them. \"I'm trying to <i>solve</i> this problem if you haven't noticed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins shrugged and stepped back, smiling as they watched the events unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney belched again, turning to Mori with a sweet expression on his face. \"How many more pieces can I have today Takeshi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori thought about it, calculating his behavior and weighing it against the cake. Tamaki made a silent prayer, hoping it wouldn't be much...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mori remained clueless to Tamaki's frustration. Mori softly scratched the back of his head as Honey continued to look up at him with an anxious look. \"I suppose three more pieces...\" Mori finally answered. \"But I'M brushing your teeth tonight. Understand?\" He asked firmly. There was no arguing this point, but Honey didn't really seem to mind much. He had a big smile on his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, Takeshi!\" He replied. He just felt happy that he could get that much cake in one sitting! This was becoming a fantastic day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori turned around and started making his way to retrieve more cake for Honey. Tamaki had passed out on the floor, not sure if he'd be able to take this presence that would be soon bearing over him. As Mori exited the room, Honey's eyes went wide. He felt like something was happening, but he couldn't find out what it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney's body started inching up higher to the ceiling. His shoulders stretched father out, sending a small tear down the back of his uniform. The young man looked behind him, thinking something had broken, but was relieved to see nothing was wrong. His pecs started pushing out further from his chest, making their way a good two or three inches, making a shelf over his abs. Speaking of which, his abs were a long, steel washboard, a set of eight plumped up abdominals in their place. Honey's arms couldn't be contained by his sleeves much longer! A tear quickly traveled up his forearm. This didn't go unnoticed by the boy. He looked down and say the rip, the seams struggling to keep it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Did I rip this while I was sleeping...?\" Honey mumbled. Out of curiosity, he ran his finger along the strings, each of them snapping and only making the tear travel further up his arm. His powerful forearms soon broke free and his bulging biceps started breaking out of the cloth! Honey looked freaked out, and looked away, pretending he never saw it. Maybe if it looked like he was ignorant of it, Mori wouldn't be upset with him! Honey's entire upper body seemed to burst from the uniform, growing bigger and thicker in small twitches. Under the table, which seemed to shrink down in front of the boy, Honey's thighs were engorged with sheer mass, snapping the seams in an instant. They were a tiny inch away from rubbing together. And they weren't alone! Honey's boyhood had grown as well, making the entire area cramped. There's was no telling how long his bunny boxers would last! The golden chair upon which Honey sat squealed out in pain, struggling to hold the boy up. His once cute, pudgy butt had now beefed up to a big, bubbly ass! His calves had to keep up, lest Honey be forced to walk around like a gorilla! Finally, before Honey could even let out a single tear from his eye, his huge toes burst out of their prison, letting them wiggle and breathe free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this enhancement seemed to end right as Mori returned with three more slices of cake, each on their own plate. He made sure that the presentation was appealing to the boy! Honey practically drooled a little stream, and picked up his fork. Suddenly, he looked at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeshi? This fork is kind of small...\" Honey told his cousin. Mori looked at the fork, not even paying attention to the fact Honey was the size of a bodybuilder! He took the fork out of Honey's hand and gave him a salad fork, which was at least two and a half times bigger! Honey smiled and ruffled Mori's hair like he always used to. \"Thanks Takeshi!\" He smiled. With that, he dug into the cake. They seemed to suddenly be vanishing at a much faster rate than before! Honey was making a real mess all over his face, but it was quickly licked up, and he smiled at Mori. Honey didn't even find it strange he was about up to Mori's chest, and that was just when he was sitting down! The next two pieces of cake met a similar fate. Honey let out an even louder belch then before, before giggling cutely and covering his lips. \"Excuse me!\" He smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Honey's stomach let out a little growl. Looks like the growing boy wasn't satisfied yet! And there was only one thing he wanted...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honey stared down at the empty plates with a pensive look. His stomach was still gurgling and he definitely wanted more cake...but Mori had been so reluctant to hand over these last three pieces, the odds of him relenting and letting him have more were slim. Suddenly, he heard the twins voices inside his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one can push you around anymore.\" He couldn't remember which of them had said it, but it didn't matter. It was the truth! He looked over  his bigger body, still growing larger, pushing through the holes in his clothes. He glanced over at Mori who was looking at him with concern. To anyone else, it would have just looked like Mori's normal, passive expression. But Honey knew better. He could read all the little quirks and twitches of his cousin's face to know what he was feeling. Honey wasn't about to hurt Mori or even disobey him if he didn't have to. He looked up at his taller cousin sweetly and said, \"Takeshi?~ Can I have just oooooone more piece?~ Pleeeeeease?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori crossed his arms and tilted his head. \"Mitsukuni, I thought we had an agreement. You can only have up to four slices of cake a day. You've had enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney's expression darkened slightly but his cute smile quickly replaced it. \"Aw come on~ Just one more slice can't hurt me, right? I promise I'll be extra good and even floss and use mouth wash without you having to tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori's eyebrow twitched. It was too hard to say no to his cousin...but he had to do what was best for him. \"I'm sorry Mitsukuni. I just can't let you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney, still smiling, rose to his feet, staring Mori in the eye. This was enough to break Mori's passive expression, his eyes wide with surprise that his once tiny cousin was now as tall as him! His clothes hung off him in tatters, his massive feet shedding his expensive shoes like they were made of rotten leather, the sides and top of them splitting open like a dried husk. Mori's eyes traveled up Honey's thick calves, diamond hard and jutting out behind him, supporting the huge weight above them. His thighs had ripped open his pants, leaving him with nothing but skin tight black shorts, hints of his bunny boxers visible in the rips and tears. His package, absolutely enormous even for his age, bulged out, nearly touching Mori's own as Honey stepped closer to him. Mori gulped slightly as his gaze continued up Honey's body, taking in his rock hard eight pack, each slab of muscle jutting out from Honey's once flat stomach. Hanging shelf like over top of them was Honey's massive pecs, his button down shirt stretched impossibly across them. It was a miracle the buttons were managing to hold. It seemed like one simple breath would be all it took to burst them all at once! His jacket was ripped clean in half, the once tiny teen's now gigantic back and shoulders making short work of it. Finally, Mori's gaze stopped at the still youthful face...now looming at least a head above him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takeshi...\" His voice had dropped slightly lower again, rumbling up from his bellows like chest. \"I <i>really</i> want some more cake. Why don't you just bring me whatever is left, okay? And then you can brush my teeth all you want~ That is...if you can reach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out a deep chuckle as Mori gulped again, stepping back. \"I...guess I can do that...for you Mitsukuni.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and walked, practically jogged, back to where the cake was, loading the last few pieces onto separate plates again. Honey smiled brightly and sat down again, the chair suddenly snapping under his weight. He crashed to the ground, a look of surprise on his face. Then he laughed and stood back up. \"I don't need a chair anyway~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were watching this whole display, wide eyed and fearful at how absolutely huge Honey looked...and he was still growing! Even now his head inched higher and higher while his muscles bulged thicker and thicker, and his body grew wider and wider! This little trick of theirs was starting to look very dangerous indeed! Where the heck was Kyoya with the data on this?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Tama-chan? What happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning fast, the twins were suddenly on either side of the collapsed Tamaki. \"Oh he just probably needs something to eat!\" Hikaru said, grabbing one of Tamaki's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We'll just get him a snack and some coffee and he'll be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney tilted his head, looking slightly suspicious. \"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup! You know how he can get~\" Hikaru said, starting to sweat as those eyes glared down at him. \"He gets so wrapped up in things he forgets to eat and ends up making himself sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad Haruhi isn't here to look after him, huh?\" Kaoru said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney smiled and said, \"Yeah, I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his back on them, walking back over to the table where Mori was setting out the last of the cake for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins breathed a sigh of relief. When Tamaki had fainted he had luckily landed on top of Usa-chan, covering him from view. If Honey had moved him even slightly, he would have seen the soiled rabbit. It was funny to see Tamaki get flustered and intimidated, but the twins drew the line at watching him get beaten to a bloody pulp! With a quick maneuver, the twins hoisted him up between them, keeping Usa-chan hidden from view the entire time, and carried Tamaki into another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney, meanwhile, had foregone using a fork completely, stuffing the cake messily into his mouth with his bare hands, getting expensive cream frosting all over his fingers and face. Mori stood by, watching him with a slightly worried expression. Hopefully this would satisfy the massive teen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an enormous belch, even louder than the previous two, Honey finished his cake, patting his abs with one hand as he did so, sitting on the ground, his clothes all but completely ripped off his body. Mori walked a few steps closer to him, noticing that Honey was nearly as tall as him sitting on the floor, and said, \"Are you full now Mitsukuni?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney smiled at him, cute as ever, and said</span></div></div>",

I feel so full of energy!\" He smiled wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Play?\" Mori asked, almost afraid to know what he meant by that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Play!\" Honey smiled. Before Mori could have a moment to think what Honey would want to do, he was suddenly tackled to the ground! It almost felt like he was hit by a TV! Mori looked up to see Honey's bright smile looking down on him like a an ominous moon. \"How about we wrestle?\" Honey asked. He clearly knew in his mind that he would win, but he wanted to assert his dominance over Mori! After all, Mori was the tallest one in the club, before this fiasco, so therefore he must be the strongest! If Honey could beat him, everyone else would have to listen to him without question!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to accidentally hurt you, Mitsukuni...\" Mori replied, looking up at Honey. Honey just giggled, and straddled Mori, keeping him pinned to the clean floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurt me, Takeshi? Look at me! I'm way too big to hurt! And look at these muscles!\" He lifted both of his arms, and flexed them hard. They were nearly the size of bowling balls, and unless Mori's eyes were bugging out, they were still getting bigger! Hell, Honey's entire body was getting bigger! Mori gulped a little, as Honey's words quickly rang true; Mori couldn't hurt Honey even if he tried! Suddenly, Honey's hands were on Mori's shoulders, and Mori could feel a drop of sweat move down his forehead. Honey reversed their positions and tossed Mori carelessly into the air, laughing all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so light, Takeshi!\" He giggled, tossing him up and down, up and down, up and down... Then on the final toss, Honey let Mori drop down onto his body, and gave him a fierce bear hug! Honey's massive arms bulged out, pressing into Mori's back, as the tall, normally silent teen's face was shoved into Honey's thick, burly pecs. Honey just kept laughing, almost as if he was insane. \"Give up, Takeshi?\" He asked almost cruelly, giving his cousin a tight squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori could only grunt in reply, but Honey didn't seem to mind! \"I didn't hear a nooooo!\" Honey's voice said in a singsong tone, squeezing Mori even tighter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes!\" Mori said in a quick gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say uncle!\" Honey said, still smiling as he spoke. He switched their positions again, leaving Mori on the bottom, squeezed under Honey's heavy, massive, still growing body! Mori's hand slammed on the tile, begging for mercy! Honey just snickered at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Takeshi, you have to say it if you want me to stop!\" Honey told the teen, laying carelessly on top of Mori, the crushing weight only growing heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle...!\" Mori finally managed to say. As he did, he could finally feel the weight lifting from his body. Finally, he was able to breath freely, his chest expanding as his lungs were now able to fill with air. Honey was on his own two feet now, grinning and flexing his thick arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I beat Takeshi! I'm the strongest boy in the host club!\" He laughed happily. And it rang true, for as Mori managed to lift his head, he saw something that made his heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney's pecs were starting to push even farther out from his body, and his biceps were swelling up as well, tearing through him sleeves and leaving him looking a bit like a hillbilly. His shirt lifted higher, showing two rows of abs, in addition to his naval. From Mori's angle, you could see three rows! Honey's back flared outward, filling out his frame and making him look even bulkier! His thighs popped out of their cage, his bunny boxers much more visible than before! And even they had a great strain on them as Honey's concealed dick had been developing even further. There was no question he was the most endowed in all of Ouran! His calves seemed to explode in size, holding up his massive physique, as his growing feet had snapped the fabric of his little black socks, leaving a few toes to pop out of the front. Honey may not have looked like an aristocrat anymore, but he was such a hulking behemoth, it would be the dumbest thing in the world to dare insult him! Honey just laughed, his pecs bouncing as his lungs filled with air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-He beat Mori-senpai!\" Kaoru whispered to Hikaru as the two remained hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Beat</i> Mori-senpai!? Did you see the way he was treating him!?\" Hikaru replied, \"Mori-senpai was the person Honey-senpai treated with all that love and respect! If he was able to just toss him around carelessly like that, just imagine what he could do to us! There's no telling what the limit is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth twins were biting at their nails, when something had started to happen...</span></div></div>",

They turned and saw Tamaki sitting up, clutching his head in one hand, his other supporting him on the floor. His deep, purple eyes landed on the pair and he smiled, relief evident on his face. \"I have just had the most outrageous dream!\" He said, chuckling as he got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy here he goes.\" Hikaru muttered, rolling his eyes while Kaoru shook his head sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dreamed that Honey-sempai had gotten ridiculously huge and muscular just from eating cake!\" Tamaki giggled to himself. \"And that he was going to come after me because I had spilled coffee on Usa-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look on the floor.\" Hikaru said bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki raised an eyebrow but looked down, spotting the soiled Usa-chan almost immediately. \"Oh...ARGH!

He swiftly made his way to the door and peered through the crack, nearly fainting again at the sight of the enormous Honey, standing so tall that Mori only reached his abs! \"AAAAAAAAAH!\" He shrieked, backing away from the door as fast as he could, tripping over Kaoru (who had been crouching down to see through the door while Hikaru remained standing) and landing rather hard on his butt. \"I'm doomed! This is terrible! What are we going to do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru quickly pinned Tamaki's arms down to his sides, holding him tight so he couldn't move. \"First of all, we're not going to panic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy for you to say! Honey-sempai isn't going to step on you like a bug!\" Tamaki wailed, shaking his head back and forth rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down you two!\" Kaoru whispered, waving his hands at them. \"He's going to hear you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikaru and Tamaki immediately clammed up, which allowed them to hear something that made their blood run cold. \"Is that Tama-chan? Is he awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru peeked through the door and jumped up, rushing over to the other two. \"He's coming! Hurry up! Hide Usa-chan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki and Hikaru began to scramble, Hikaru shoving Tamaki onto a couch so it looked like he was just waking up from his fainting spell while Kaoru grabbed Usa-chan and shoved him in a drawer. They barely managed to complete these tasks before they heard the unmistakable *thump thump thump* of Honey's footsteps directly outside of the door. With a careless gesture, Honey ripped the door off its hinges, blinking at it in cute surprise before smiling down at Mori. \"Guess I don't know my own strength, huh Takeshi?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori's eyebrow twitched before he said, \"Just...try to be careful Mitsukuni. Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, don't worry, I will be~\" Honey said with careless wave of his hand. He was clearly enjoying being the biggest of the Host Club men for once! He bent down and entered the room the twins and Tamaki were in, his broad shoulders gently rubbing against either end of the door frame. He was starting to become too huge for the school! He stood up to his full height and looked around at everyone, his eyes falling on Tamaki who was looking up at him with a slightly haggard expression, sweat standing in beads on his forehead, to Hikaru who was sitting on a different couch with his legs crossed, and finally to Kaoru who was sitting backwards on a chair near a desk, his head resting on his arms on the back of the chair. Mori squeezed in passed Honey, standing at his side, looking more like a child than the baby faced bodybuilder next to him. Honey smiled as he walked over to Tamaki, crouching down, his bulge actually shoving the couch back a few feet. Honey giggled at this while Tamaki was visibly shaking in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, feeling better now Tama-chan?~\" Honey asked, his pecs slowly inflating and deflating near Tamaki's face with his every breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes! I just need to...to lie down for awhile! I'm fine now! How...how are you doing Honey-sempai?\" He asked, trying to keep the conversation light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney merely grinned and flexed his monstrous biceps, each ball of muscle inflating like a pump was attached to it, thick veins running over and down the mountainous bulge. \"I've never felt better! I don't know what's going on, but I like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm glad! It's always important to me that my host club members are happy! Yes, yes indeed!\" Tamaki babbled, his face getting even paler, if that was possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney cocked his eyebrow and said, \"Are you sure you're okay Tama-chan? You seem a little...nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki immediately sprang up and clapped Honey on the shoulder, laughing unconcernedly. \"Of course! I'm feeling 100% better! In fact, why don't we go back into the main music room and have some fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney grinned and got to his feet, towering high over Tamaki, his barely contained bulge level with the Prince's face. \"Yeah! That's a great idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki knees knocked together a bit, but he quickly stiffened his resolve and strode out into the main room, Honey following eagerly behind. Mori glanced over at the twins before he left and said, \"You two should get Usa-chan cleaned. Fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins took this advice to heart and quickly grabbed the stuffed rabbit, leaving through a back door so they could avoid getting spotted by Honey. They were more than happy to be out of Honey's terrifying presence for awhile. Hopefully the massive teen would be too distracted by his new body to notice that Usa-chan had gone missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyoya better figure out how to straighten this mess out and fast!\" Hikaru muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much bigger do you think Honey-sempai is going to get?\" Kaoru asked, a trace of fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully he'll be done now. If not...who knows what we're going to do?\" Hikaru shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru hugged himself and said, \"That's a scary thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did someone say...scary?\" A dark voice suddenly called out from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins turned their heads at the same moment, spotting a strange cloaked man standing in the darkness of a classroom, a cat puppet on one hand. His face was covered partially by a hood, but there was no mistaking who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Nekozawa?\" Hikaru asked impatiently. \"We're kind of busy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been watching you and your host club for awhile now. I noticed you have a bit of a...problem on your hands.\" Nekozawa said with a small smile. \"I can help you, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you expect to do that?\" Kaoru asked, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple! With black magic of course!\" Nekozawa said, holding up a bottle. \"What do you think I do in that club all day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try not to think about it.\" they replied in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway...this is a special potion I just devised! It should shrink that blonde haired kid down to size. I'll give it to you, on one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of themselves, the twins were intrigued. \"What's the condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNekozawa grinned and said, \"You and the host club help recruit members for the Black Magic Club. Membership has been down somewhat as of late...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, I wonder why?\" Hikaru said, smirking at Kaoru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my offer! Take it or leave it!\" Nekozawa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take it.\" The twins said, holding out their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNekozawa dropped the potion in their hands. Kaoru grinned and said, \"<i>If</i> it works that is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't part of the deal!\" Nekozawa shouted, trying to snatch the bottle back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we changed it! Tough luck~\" They said, sticking their tongues out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you for this! Just you wait!\" Nekozawa shouted, unable to pursue them into the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the odds of this stuff working anyway?\" Hikaru asked, tossing the bottle up and down carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slim to none. But it can't hurt to try, right?\" Kaoru said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" Hikaru replied, pocketing the bottle. \"First things first! We need to get Usa-chan cleaned!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins picked up their pace, heading for a place to get the rabbit cleaned.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the other room, Honey was sitting on the ground, looking at Tamaki. Even with the young kid on the ground, Tamaki just barely came up to the top of his pecs! And unless Tamaki was mistaken, Honey was still growing! Honey smiled sweetly at Tamaki, who in returned the expression, albeit with a more nervous demanor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tama-chan! We have to do this one thing Haruhi-chan taught me!\" Honey said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Taught you? What's daddy's little girl taught you n-now?\" Tamaki replied, a bit worrysome. Honey then lay down on his stomach, and stuck out his arm, his elbow on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said it's called arm wrestling! A lot of boys do it!\" Honey replied. Tamaki gulped. He knew what arm wrestling was... A vulgar sport, where two neanderthals attempt to prove which of the two is the alpha male! Or at least, that's what Tamaki was told. Tamaki got down on his stomach in front of Honey, and did the same as he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what happens--!\" Tamaki winced, holding back tears as Honey's hand then engulfed his, squeezing it tight! Tamaki swore Honey was trying to crush his hand! The boy flashed a dark grin at Tamaki, as his pumped bicep flexed up bigger, the pulsating veins feeding the muscle and only making him stronger! Tamaki gulped once more. This was going to hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, on three you have to push as hard as you can to slam my hand to the ground!\" Honey explained to his puny friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But Honey! You're so... So strong and so mighty, how do you expect a princely gentleman like me to--\" Tamaki began to babble, trying to talk his way out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!\" Honey shouted. The moment the words were uttered, Honey slammed Tamaki's arm down to the ground, causing the teen to cry out like a banshee. Honey let go and sat back up with his legs crossed. \"How was that? Pretty fun, right?\" He chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki was holding his right arm. He could feel the entire limb puslsing all at once, and it felt sore to the extreme, as if he had been lifting weights the entire day. The fact that he could still move it at least proved it wasn't broken, but in the name of all that was holy, it hurt beyond what words could say! Honey just giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so weak, Tama-chan!\" He said with a boyish smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yup! That's me! Weak old Tamaki, c-can't beat a kid at arm wrestling...\" Tamaki agreed weakly. He had to swallow a little pride to say it, but at least he wouldn't anger Honey in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! Let's play ants!\" Honey said suddenly once more! Tamaki's heart dropped, and was scared to ask, but ask he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ants...?\" He finally managed to choke out. He looked over to Mori for a second, but Mori just shrugged. He had never heard of it before either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Honey stood up to his full height. While Tamaki had only came up to his bulge before, now he was a few inches lower, barely able to touch his abs if he tried! \"I'm gonna stomp my feet around, and you're going to run and try not to get squished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki nearly blacked out at the idea of the game. Thankfully, as if they were his guardian angels, the twins broke through the doors, a fresh, clean Usa-chan in tow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey-senpai, look what we have!\" Kaoru said, running forward with it. In his other hand, he held a the bottle that Nekozawa had given to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaoru, be careful!\" Hikaru shouted out as Kaoru was running forward carelessly. The younger brother wasn't watching his steps!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kaoru looked back for a moment, but that was all it took for him to trip over a misplaced chair in the middle of the room! \"Wh-Whoa!\" Kaoru fell forward, Usa-chan landing safely on the couch, where as the potion then ended up in the hands of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bottle turned over and over again in the air before landing directly in Honey's grip. He blinked in surprise and said, \"What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaoru, dusting himself off as he got back onto his feet, grinned up at Honey and said, \"We just thought you might be thirsty after all that cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney smiled and said, \"Aww, thanks you guys! You're so nice~\" He eagerly popped the top off the bottle and began to drink it, his throat working as he gulped down the entire bottle in one go. He sighed and wiped his mouth. \"That really hit the spot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear it sempai!\" The twins said in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki quickly grabbed them both by their arms and dragged them a few feet away from Honey. He had a big smile on his face as he patted them both on their shoulders. \"Excellent work getting Usa-chan fixed up you two! I'll make sure to think up some fantastic reward for following my orders to explicitly~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave each of them a condescending pinch on their cheeks. The twins grimaced and pulled away but quickly regained their smiles as they gestured to Honey. \"We also fixed your problem with Honey-sempai!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki looked a little suspiciously at them. \"Oh yeah? How's that? You'd better not be trying to trick me to get a better reward!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right.\" They said, waving their hands in front of their faces. \"Just watch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki turned his attention to Honey who was rubbing his abs, a look of discomfort on his face. He let out a little belch and everyone watched in shock as he surged up a foot taller, his muscles all bulging out in proportion to his height! The twins had the most shocked look of any of them on his face. Honey blinked and then burped again, his height bursting up another two feet! His clothes, or rather the tattered remains of what had once been his clothes, were now floating down to the ground at his expanding feet, his cute toes bursting forth from the last remains of his socks and shoes. Honey giggled as he ran his hands down his body, not caring that he was now standing naked in front of the entire host club (minus Kyoya who Tamaki and the twins were starting to suspect had fled)! Honey smiled down at his fellow club members before letting out another, slightly more intense burp. His body pulsed and sprouted up once again, the tiles of the host club's floor beginning to crack as Honey's enormous weight rested on them. His chest was starting to approach billboard size, his broad shoulders eclipsing some of the windows behind him, casting an ominous shadow over the other boys. Honey rubbed  his abs in discomfort once more before opening his mouth and unleashing the biggest, loudest belch of all, the windows rattling from its intensity. It felt like it lasted hours, bellowing out from Honey's upset stomach, the wind rushing passed the other teens. When it was finally over, Honey's body practically exploded with size! Up and up and up he stretched, his thick, bouncy ass nearly smashing the glass of the windows behind him, his thick boyhood surpassing the heights of the shorter host club members easily, his huge feet shattering the tiles they touched, his thick toes approaching the other boys. His muscles were not left out, his chest bulging out so far Honey couldn't see over them just be looking down, his biceps so thick and huge it almost made it hard to bend his arms, his abs a steel hard eight pack, each muscle so dense and hard that nothing could penetrate them. His thighs were so thick he had to adopt a new stance, spreading his legs out to better accommodate his new tonnage, his calves bulging with every twitch of his lethally long legs. Honey, his blonde hair just brushing the high ceiling, smiled down at his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the cute face, it was incredibly frightening to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki nearly throttled the twins as he grabbed them by their collars, shaking them while he shouted, \"You call THAT solving the problem?! What the hell did you do?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We gave him something that N-Nekozawa made!\" They managed to choke out, their heads flapping back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you TRUSTED that freak?! What's wrong with you two?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could answer, the ground shook violently under them. They all turned to watch as Honey slowly stepped closer to them, stopping when his enormous feet were just in front of them, his pendulous cock and balls hanging over them, sending a distinct musky scent down to them. Honey leaned over with a huge grin on his face, giggling as he saw how tiny everyone looked, even Mori standing only head and shoulders above his ankle~ \"You're all so small! Like little animals~ You're like my pets now~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them liked the idea of being considered Honey's \"pet\" but they liked the idea of pissing Honey off even less. Either way, Honey didn't let any of them get a word in edge wise as he immediately shouted, \"Now playing Ants is going to be even <i>more</i> fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ants?\" The twins said, looking over at Tamaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just run.\" Mori advised before turning and running in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready...set...GO!\" Honey shouted, lifting his foot up over the twins and Tamaki. Tamaki bolted with a little shriek, running in a different direction from Mori. The twins glanced at each other before shouting, \"Every man for himself!\" and taking off in two different directions. Honey's massive foot landed with a disturbing *THUMP!* obliterating the tiles of the floor underneath it. Honey merely giggled and watched his friends scamper away. \"Now...which one should I go after first?~\"</span></div></div>",

And if one of the boys even dared to head for the door, they would only end up slamming into Honey, who seemed to always beat them there no matter where in the room he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori was expertly dodging every step. Hikaru and Kaoru were hidden behind the pillars in the room and rotated around them to remain out of Honey's sight. It was Tamaki who was the unlucky one. Honey chased him down  no matter how fast he tried to run, his footsteps always seeming to slam right behind him! Tamaki let out a shout, just escaping danger each time, which only made Honey laugh with joy over how fun this was! It didn't help much that Tamaki's arm was still in pain over their games from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only a matter of time before Honey's foot slammed down on top of Tamaki, pinning him against the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got you, Tama-chan!\" Honey laughed. He picked him right up in his hand and held onto him. Tamaki fainted once more, worried over whatever his fate might have been. Honey looked around the room as he held Tamaki, who was almost like a rag doll in his hands. The first person Honey spotted was Mori, who was looking back at Honey. Looks like he was ready for anything. That's when Honey spotted two heads peeking out from a pair of pillars! \"Trying to hide from me?\" He giggled. He charged right for the twins, who immediately ditched their hiding spot to run. The chase was on once more as Hikaru and Kaoru made a dash for their life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney easily kept up with this, his feet slamming into the ground, making the entire room shake with each step he took!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's he coming after us!? Mori-senpai isn't even doing anything!\" Kaoru shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot, Mori-senpai is his favorite, isn't it obvious!?\" Hikaru retorted. As the two boys squabbled over unimportant matters, they hadn't even noticed a dark shadow engulfed their's. By the time the looked up, all they saw was Honey's torso before it slammed down on top of them! The twins were pinned down underneath Honey, unable to move! Honey just giggled once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three down! And one Takeshi to go!\" He announced. \"Wait, how can I get Takeshi if my hands are full...?\" Honey mumbled to himself. His face was a bit pouty as he laid there on his stomach for a moment. \"Oh! I know!\" Honey said, an idea striking him. He put part of Tamaki in his mouth for a moment, before working his hands underneath him to hold the twins down. As he stood up, one foot pinned Hikaru down as Honey wedged Kaoru under his arm! Hikaru stared up in horror as he saw Tamaki in Honey's mouth, thinking the worst waited for him! Of course, it was not to be. Once Kaoru was stuck, Honey reached down and did the same to Hikaru, this freeing up his arms. Slowly, the boyish giant got to his feet, and looked around. Now his hands were free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney turned to Mori, a smile on his face even with Tamaki in his mouth. Mori started to sweat a little, as he suddenly sprinted away in a panic. Honey quickly gave chase to him! He wasn't about to let Mori get away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Honey raced to catch his cousin, his tongue couldn't help but lap at Tamaki's face a few times. He almost tasted a little sweet. Like those weird, girly colognes he was always wearing. In the meantime, Mori had just got his hand on the door, when an even bigger hand got it's hold on him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ghawt 'ya!\" Honey said with his mouth full. The resounding words were only amplified in Honey's mouth, forcing Tamaki awake! As soon as he was, he started to kick around, trying to get out of his moist prison! Honey took all four of them to the other side of the room and sat down. Took each out of their respective places and held all four in his hands like dolls. \"Alright, now I'm tired and you guys are gonna help me relax!\" He ordered, those sweet, childish looks still on his face. \"You guys...\" Honey said, taking the twins, and setting them on the floor. Before they could even think to move, Honey's feet slammed down on them. \"Are going to massage my feet!\" He commanded. \"Takeshi!\" Honey smiled at the tall, slender man. \"You're gonna rub my head!\" Honey set Mori up high atop his head. Mori sighed, glad it wasn't a worse fate. \"And Tama-chan...\" Honey said, looking down at his fellow blond. Honey looked over himself real quick to decide what he should do. \"... You can massage my chest!\" He finally decided, setting Tamaki on his chest. Tamaki just looked up at Honey for a moment before the young boy's face got a more fierce look! Tamaki immediately got right to work, chuckling nervously as he looked up at Honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney sat there, feeling like a king as his subjects massaged him.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was something humiliating about being forced to rub the body parts of the formerly smallest member of the Host Club. Hikaru and Kaoru certainly had their work cut out for them, the massive appendages rising above them like towers, topped off with five cutely proportioned toes each. The look they had gotten from Honey clearly said that they were to massage the ENTIRE foot, heel to toe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is humiliating...\" Kaoru whined quietly, his hands working into the soft sole as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could have been a whole lot worse!\" Hikaru said, using his elbow to really work Honey's heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? How?\" Kaoru said, standing up on his tip toes to reach the ball of Honey's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could have had us rub something a bit more personal, if you catch my drift!\" Hikaru said, jumping up and wrapping his arms around Honey's big toe, bracing his own feet against Honey's sole to more easily reach the toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Good point.\" Kaoru said, working extra hard now to make sure Honey wasn't displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic blonde giggled, wiggling his toes, the big one smacking Hikaru in the face. \"Careful down there! That tickles~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori, meanwhile, was carefully making his way through his cousin's hair, doing his best to make sure not a single follicle was damaged or made dirty. Honey may have grown into an unstoppable, uncontrollable giant, but he was still the cousin he had vowed to take care of his whole life. His hands gently massaged the scalp, eliciting a happy sigh from Honey. Despite the situation, this still made the stoic teen smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki had the worst job of all. Honey was half sitting up, leaning against a wall, meaning that Tamaki was standing on an uneven slope, barely able to keep his footing. One wrong step and not only would he fall down and possibly hurt himself on Honey's rock hard abs, but he'd then slide down right into the blonde bush surrounding Honey's massive cock. He shuddered at the very thought! No amount of bathing would rid him of the dirty feeling he'd get just from being close to it! To prevent this from happening, he braced his foot against Honey's surprisingly resilient nipple, allowing him to cover most of the chest with little to no difficulty. Tamaki had been shocked to find that, despite the obvious firmness of Honey's pecs, they were still slightly squishy and soft, his hands sinking into them a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney watched each of his friends rubbing his body, feeling an intense relaxation course through him~ This was the life! No one to tell him what to do or make him do things he didn't want to do or keep things he wanted from him! He was the one in total control now! He still had no idea what had caused his fantastic growth but he no longer cared either. He just hoped that he wasn't dreaming~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Honey's belly, the last of the cake was being digested, sending the last bits of the tranquilizer coursing through his body. The pressure built up inside him until he unleashed it in the form of a cute burp, though to the little men on top of him it sounded like the blast of a foghorn! Honey giggled and said, \"Excuse me~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...Not again...\" The twins sighed, feeling weary as they watched the feet in front of them begin to grow even bigger! Honey looked a little surprised as he watched his legs stretch further and further out in front of him, his ass cracking more and more tiles as it grew bigger, taking up more and more space. His look of surprise was quickly replaced by one of pure joy as he watched his body bulk up to greater sizes! Mori watched passively as the hairs grew around him like a forest, the scalp underneath his body spreading out in all directions. Tamaki found the nipple that his foot was braced on was getting easier to stand on, until he was crouched down on top of it, feeling more like he was standing on a platform as Honey's pecs swelled out further bulging with more and more size! His traps rose around his thick neck, making him look even more intimidating if that were possible, his shoulders broadening to the point that they nearly reached either wall! His head rose up just short of the ceiling, while his feet nearly pancaked the twins against the wall on the opposite side of the room! Honey's growth, thankfully, stopped at this point, the other Host Club members looking more like bugs clinging to his body than anything else! Honey laughed, his voice booming across the room. \"This is so cool~! I don't want to ever stop growing~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins quickly climbed up the foot, resting between Honey's toes. The last thing they wanted was to be between Honey's feet and a solid surface! Mori made his way through the follicle forest until he was sitting on the edge of Honey's head, his legs dangling down over his cousin's forehead. Tamaki was finding it harder and harder to stand on the nipple as Honey's pecs grew more massive. In a last ditch attempt to not fall, he wrapped his arms around the leathery skin and held on tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney, his body now filling most of the room, was starting to feel things he had never felt before. With a careless gesture he could tear down the walls! He could heard the floor creaking and groaning trying to support his great weight. He had always considered his body a weapon, thanks to his martial arts training, but now he felt like he was a weapon of mass destruction, capable of decimating anything that stood in his way! The thought excited him! He never realized how intoxicating power could make you feel~ Slowly, but surely, his dick was starting to harden, twitching on his abs. This movement didn't go unnoticed to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney groaned a little and looked down over the other club members. \"Hey...I just thought of something else I can use you guys for~\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All four boys seemed to gulp in unison. And they had every right to! For the next words tha came out of Honey's mouth would be the ones that they feared most of all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you all give me a different kind of rub?\" He said, looking at his dick. He grabbed it in his hands for a moment, giving it a brief stroke, before looking at them once more. \"You know what I mean?\" Although no one answered, looking at their faces immediately showed they knew what he meant. Honey took each boy in hand, and started placing them in a specific order...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Hika-chan and Kao-chan, since there's two of you, you guys go here...\" Honey said, placing them at the base of his balls. They were bloated, not a wrinkle to be seen on them. Honey must have really been full! \"Takeshi, you're gonna go at the base since you're strong enough...\" Honey said, putting Mori at the base of his shaft. \"And since Tama-chan always thought he was the leader, he gets to be at the top!\" Honey giggled, placing Tamaki right at the head of his monsterous cock. \"Anyone who isn't working or tries anything funny is going where the sun doesn't shine!\" Honey warned them all. After that, he sat there for a moment, looking down at all of them, as they all looked right back at him. Honey's bright and sunny smile was soon replaced by a sour, ominous frown. \"Well!? What are you waiting for!?\" He said, his voice booming over them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMori quickly started to squeeze and stroke along Honey's shaft. The way he was moving, it was as if he had no qualms about this at all! Hikaru and Kaoru weren't exactly having the time of their lives. Both rubbed and massaged the boy's huge, tender balls, the two of them only using their hands. The last thing they wanted to do was risk hurting this giant, unstoppable child. The musk was almost intoxicating, but to them, far from pleasant. Tamaki had it worst of all. The head of the cock was starting to engorged as Honey started getting harder, making Tamaki's job more difficult. Not to mention it was moist, musky, and tender! One wrong move could land Tamaki in the stinker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney, meanwhile, was having the time of his life. Long, lustful moans escaped from his lips, echoing in the whole room, shaking the chandelier in the middle of the room. \"F-Faster, you guys!\" He ordered, \"Otherwise I'll never get there!\" Honey's foot was kicking a little, pounding against the wall as he was serviced by the helpless little men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki let out a soft whine as he suddenly felt a small glob of precum splatted onto his head! It was almost like a nightmare to thim, but not as bad as it would have been if he stopped! Mori was really putting himself into it, using his whole body to stroke Honey's cock, his soft clothes almost simulating a fluffy sock. The twins had to keep up their work as well, helping the massive boy's balls churn. They even swelled up at some point, letting them know they were doing their job right! Honey was starting to wiggle and shake now, everyone's efforts slowly paying off as they pleasured him. He almost made a crying sound as he got even closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-More!\" He demanded, \"Don't stop! T-Tama-chan! Lick...\" He ordered. Tamaki's face went pale. He stuck his tongue out, and slowly started moving closer. The twins gasped, looking up at him. Part of them pitied the poor guy, part of them wanted their cameras. As Tamaki's tongue just grazed the surface, Honey let out a scream of pleasure. He immediately pushed Tamaki's face to the head, forcing him to lick, over and over, up and down in the process. \"Y-Yes! Yes! More!\" Honey cried out. Everyone was working twice as fast now, save for Tamaki who was being worked over by Honey!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the twins felt Honey's balls shrivel a little. Mori felt a huge lump that, with the help of some pulsing, forced him to fall back in Honey's bush of pubes. Finally, load after load of hot, fresh cum shot out of Honey's throbbing boyhood, covering not only his chest, but Tamaki and a little bit of Mori as well! Not even the twins were spared as his dick began to soften, it fell forward, dripping them in the white juices. While Honey was panting and moaning in pure ecstascy, everyone else did the same in displeasure. They all got off of Honey's colossal form, looking at each other with big frowns on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Honey said with a big grin on his face. \"That was really... REALLY fun!\" He laughed, rubbing out the last of his load himself. As he sat back up, he looked down at his friends, and laughed once more! \"You guys all look like tiny cakes!\" He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cakes...?\" Tamaki mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He means his... *ahem* Juices...\" Hikaru pointed out. It was true; each and every man was covered in the white stuff, making it look like they were covered in white frosting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if things couldn't get any worse, there was a sudden noise that made time seem like it stopped. Everyone in the room froze, as if moving an inch meant certain death. Shivers went down their spines, as their hearts began to race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney's stomach let out a loud growl.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honey rubbed his abs absently, staring down at his friends. All covered in his cum like that, they looked suspiciously like the little tea cakes they offered sometimes during tea parties. Small, bite sized little morsels all covered in a rich, creamy icing that was so soft you didn't even need to chew it; it just slid down your throat~ And they were so tasty! And Honey was feeling so hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all happened in a flash! Honey's hand darted forward to grab at the group of boys who immediately broke formation and ran in opposite directions. Mori ran towards the adjoining room, which was positioned slightly behind and to the right of Honey. It would be difficult to maneuver his room filling body in a way to easily grab him from in there. The twins meanwhile ran for the opposite end of the room, hoping that Honey's thick, bulging muscles would make it too hard for him to reach around the many pillars situated around them. Tamaki...panicked and chased after the twins, fully traumatized by these events. The twins glared at him as they all hid behind a pillar. Honey hadn't seen which way they ran. He had been trying to snatch Mori up who dodged and danced out of his reach, putting his Kendo skills to good use. Honey made a small \"hmph!\" of frustration before focusing on looking for the other three. He leaned forward slightly, his pecs pushing up against his chin as he felt around with his hands, hoping to get an idea of where they were hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins and Tamaki barely managed to avoid Honey's grasping hands, which quickly started moving more violently as Honey became increasingly frustrated. Suddenly, Hikaru's expression brightened. \"Hey Kaoru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Hikaru?\" Kaoru asked, recognizing his brother's tone. He had a plan for sure!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is Honey-sempai more likely to go after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not Mori. He's his favorite. He'd probably only eat him last if we didn't fill him up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! So that means he's going to come after us three right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you thinking what I'm thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki's head moved back and forth as the two talked, noticing their evil grins as they stared at him. \"Oh don't you even think about it! Haven't I suffered enough indignities for one day?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry boss but it's every man for himself!\" They both said, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty shove, they forced Tamaki out from behind the pillar, right into Honey's grasping hand! \"Aha!\" He shouted in triumph, shaking dust from the ceiling. \"Gotcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his thick fingers around Tamaki's frail body and lifted him up to his face. \"Oh! It's you Tama-chan! We seem to be doing a lot of stuff together today, don't we?~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we do!\" Tamaki said with mock cheerfulness. \"And it's all thanks to UNGRATEFUL COWARDLY MEN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shouted these last three words back at the pillar where Hikaru and Kaoru were hiding. Honey tilted his head and reached back there, snatching up the twins as easily as he had Tamaki. \"Thanks Tama-chan! Now I have three snacks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins glared at Tamaki and said, \"You are a terrible person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki laughed somewhat evilly and said, \"That's what you get for messing with someone as clever as myself~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney's stomach gurgled again and he whimpered slightly. \"Hmm...You're all small enough I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small enough for what?\" They all asked in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this!\" Honey said, opening his mouth wide and sticking out his tongue. Before any of the three boys could react, Honey dropped them all on top of the slimy muscle, withdrawing it back into his mouth and closing it with a click of his teeth. Inside the moist, sweltering cave, the twins and Tamaki were tossed about like pennies in a dryer. Saliva slapped them all over as Honey's tongue licked them from head to toe, removing the cum and savoring their refined taste. He let out a slight moan as he tilted his head back, the tiny teens falling towards the darkness of the titan's gullet. Kaoru went down first, his feet getting trapped in the contracting muscles of Honey's throat, dragging him down. His fingers scrabbled uselessly at the tongue as Hikaru dove forward, grabbing his brother's hands, trying to pull him back up. All this accomplished was him losing his footing, slipping in a puddle of saliva that sent him tumbling head first down after his brother. Tamaki, desperate to save himself, crawled along the tongue towards the front of the mouth, slamming his fists against the teeth that held him trapped. Unfortunately, he merely hurt his hands, the teeth obviously not giving and Honey absolutely refusing to let him out. Honey chuckled and tilted his head back further, Tamaki now clinging to a vertical wall. With a mere flick of his tongue, Honey dislodged Tamaki and sent him falling to his fate. With a hard swallow, all three boys traveled down his throat in a lump. Honey sighed happily as they were deposited in his cavernous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is just great!\" Hikaru said, wading through the juices of Honey's stomach. \"Now what do we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look for a way out?\" Kaoru suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki shuddered and said, \"There's only two ways out of here and neither of them are very appealing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins blinked and then shuddered as well when they realized what Tamaki meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, outside Honey's body, Mori was peeking around the door, watching his cousin happily lick his lips and rub his abs. He stayed out of sight, not wanting to share the fates of the other club members. He was thinking about making a run for it when the entrance to the club room opened and Kyouya finally made his reappearance! He smiled and called out, \"I'm back! And I have the solution to our little...problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth fell open as he saw the massive Honey filling up the entire room, completely naked, speckled with cum, and grinning down at him with obvious ill intent. Kyouya coughed, adjusted his glasses and said, \"Our <i>big</i> problem then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at Honey and raised his voice, \"Honey-sempai! Where are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney looked to the side before shrugging. \"I don't know! I...haven't seen them! Yeah, that's it~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyouya raised an eyebrow before noticing Mori hiding in the doorway to the adjoining room. He pointed at Honey, then at his own mouth, then rubbed his stomach. Kyouya caught on immediately. \"Honey-sempai!\" he said sternly. \"Spit those three back up immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney frowned down at Kyouya. \"No! I don't want to! And you can't make me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe petulantly crossed his arms and pouted. Kyouya smiled and said, \"Oh, but I can~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up a small remote control and pressed a button. Almost immediately Honey's abs clenched violently, a lump soon traveling up his throat. With a quick *cough!* he spat the other host club members out onto his abs, covered in gastric juices, but otherwise unharmed. They immediately slid off of Honey's body and over to Kyouya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyouya! You're the only one I can rely on in this place!\" Tamaki said, hugging Kyouya who grimaced at the smell and wetness of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that thing anyway?\" Hikaru asked, indicating the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This? It's a control device. You see, the tranquilizer was filled with millions of nanobots that are now coursing through Honey-sempai's body. This remote activates them and they in turn stimulate sempai's body and makes it act against his will. It's a little safety precaution we installed in case something like this ever happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long to get it?\" Kaoru asked. \"You could have saved us a whole bunch of trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it wasn't finished yet. I just put the last few touches on it. But now we have a means to keep Honey-sempai under control until we can shrink him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney, his body paralyzed thanks to the nanobots, glared down at Kyouya. He was ruining all his fun! He tried to struggle, to break free of the control, but he couldn't do it. Mori joined the group and calmly said, \"Can you make Mitsukuni his normal size?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyouya looked up at Mori with a small smile. \"I believe I can~ It's just going to take a little more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney was dismayed to hear those words. Go back to normal? But being huge was way more fun! He couldn't let this happen! But what could he do? He was completely trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was he?</span></div></div>",

It may be true they were just trying to get things back to normal, but by doing so, they were getting in the way of his fun! Not to mention there was no telling how everyone was going to treat him after this little incident. There was almost no doubt he would be the center of pranks, insults, and even blackmail in some cases! That was the last thing he wanted! Not to mention Mori... Deep in his heart, Honey knew Mori only wanted the best for him, but what could be better for Honey than being an unstoppable force of nature? He couldn't help but feel betrayed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney was about five seconds away from crying, when something new started happening within him. His gut began to gurgle once more, but no one seemed to notice at the moment. They were all gathered around Kyouya, trying to find a way to get Honey back to normal! Honey let out a whimper, slowly and soundlessly laying on his side. It felt like his blood was on fire! Little did he know it was that potion he drank earlier! Nekozawa's little brew that made him even bigger was having a reaction with the now active nanobots. Honey started to sweat, and then he began to moan, which quickly caught Mori's attention, and with him, the rest of the host club! Mori rushed right over, his hand on Honey's gigantic shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mitsukuni...?\" He asked, looking down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It huuuurts...\" He whined, holding onto his abs. \"It hurts!\" He shouted again, rolling over in pain. Everyone was looking over at Honey as he was making a commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his system, the potion forced Honey to develop antibodies, which quickly began attacking any inorganic substance within him! One by one, the hundreds of nanobots were being broken down and destroyed, having no way to defend themselves from Honey's immune system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Honey sat back up, still whimpering a little. He looked down at Mori, who was trying to hold onto his hand. Honey let out a faint smile, looking down at him. \"Thanks, Takeshi.\" He said, grabbing him up. Kyouya immediately held up the remote in case things looked dire. Honey, in turn, just gave Mori a little kiss on the forehead. Mori just looked aside, a slight blush on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, uh...\" Tamaki whispered, getting closer to Kyouya. \"Do we have anything for Honey to wear? It's getting a little awkward to have to stare at a naked child this much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if his answer, the doors the opened up, and several men came in, carrying a huge, pink speedo with a cute little bunny on the front. Kyouya just chuckled, pushing his glasses up. \"Already done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Honey saw the men enter, his attention was soon caught by the new article of clothing! \"Wow! That's so cute!\" He said happily, taking it away from the men. Slowly, he started to put it on, proving difficult in such a tiny room. It fit perfectly, nice and snug, especially right around where his bulge was. You could barely see the outline of his beast, but there was no questioning the immense girth within! Honey giggled cutely, patting it. It was nice and warm!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tama-chan, check this out!\" Honey said, grabbing Tamaki quite suddenly. Tamaki struggled for a moment, before he realized there was no reason to fear. They had the remote after all! \"Look at this thingy! Isn't it cute?\" Honey asked with  a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTamaki let out an awkward smile. \"Well, it certainly suits your tastes!\" He replied. Honey giggled, before stretching out in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when things went from peaceful to worse. Honey accidentally hit Hikaru, and was pinning him against the wall with his foot! Hikaru whined and tried his best to push back. \"M-Make him stop!\" Hikaru demanded. Kaoru took the remote and fiddled with it, trying to get his foot off. He casually pushed a button... Then he pressed it a little harder... Then he pressed it repeatedly. Before he knew it, he was mashing every button on the remote, trying to get SOMETHING to happen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kyouya, it's not working!\" Kaoru said, holding out the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible.\" He replied casually. He took the remote, but before he knew it, he found himself in the same position as Kaoru was! \"This can't be good...\" He mumbled. \"I don't know how and I don't know what, but the remote isn't having any effect anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Do you need to change the batteries? Is it on?\" Kaoru inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...\" Kyouya replied, \"Everything it working at optimal speed... But now Honey is out of our control!\" Kyouya announced. Both boys froze with displeasure. Luckily, Honey stopped stretching and Hikaru was soon freed. Honey looked down at the other boys, smiling sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha guys talking about over there?\" He asked. The three of them froze, not moving an inch. Mori quickly picked up on what this meant, but Tamaki remained clueless. As Mori left Honey's side, Honey just looked down at Tamaki. \"What's going on, Tama-chan?\" He asked, a slight frown on his face. Tamaki didn't find the frown as scary as he used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure it's nothing!\" He said with a smile, \"The boys are just working on a way to get you back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna be normal again...\" Honey said, frowning even bigger than before. While Tamaki had a strong sense of what was right and wrong, Honey's saddening frown really struck a nerve with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But Honey-senpai, you...\" Tamaki just looked up at Honey, who looked sadder by the second. \"But we have to, or else you'll...\" Tamaki started to feel his own sadness welling up within him. \"But I...\" Honey looked on the verge of crying, his eyes starting to get all wet. \"I-I... I'll talk to them!\" Tamaki said, turning and running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tamaki ran, Honey's eyes dried right up. He got a mischevious grin on his face as Tamaki ran off. \"You always were a sucker!\" Honey thought deviously to himself.</span></div></div>",

He wasn't trying to get out of fufilling his mother's request, nor was he too lazy, he was just genuinely curious as to why he had to go all the way to Viridian City when there was a market just up the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, isn't it obvious!? Our cute little town doesn't carry the same things Viridian City does! Now here's the money, be sure to get back here by dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed as he looked through the aisles of the store. Usually when he visited home he got to just lounge around. It was a nice change of pace for him! However, he supposed it couldn't hurt to just do ONE little thing for his mom...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pikaaaa!\" Pikachu cried out, looking happily at his friend. Ash just chuckled and pet the little yellow guy on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash wandered, his eye was caught by something new. He pulled the jar off the shelf and looked at it. \"Oh, hey! It's some of that protein stuff!\" Ash said aloud. \"I didn't know they sold it here...\" He looked over at Pikachu, who was focused on the jar. \"You know, I've seen this stuff around before... People say it's supposed to make Pokemon stronger... It couldn't hurt to buy one for Pikachu, right?\" Ash thought to himself. The little guy deserved a treat! Ash then took a look at the price tag. His jaw immediately dropped. \"9800P!?\" He thought, his eyes staring wide at it. He gulped. He would have to dip into his own personal funds, but... If it was for Pikachu, then it had to be worth it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh took the groceries, as well as a few other sundries his mom wanted, to the front counter along with the jar of protein. Ash could feel a sweatdrop as he saw that price ring up, but he paid it out, and was soon on his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young man walked home, Pikachu was at his side, walking on his own hind legs. Ash smiled at Pikachu, who in turn, returned the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Ash thought suddenly to himself. \"Hey, Pikachu! Did you want a snack?\" Ash asked. He pulled out the jar. Pikachu's ears perked up, as a cute smile came across his face! His hands reached up, smiling happily. After peeling the plastic off and opening the jar, Ash took out one of the pills and handed it to his friend. Pikachu immediately popped it in his mouth and let out a happy cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chaaaaaa!\" He went, doing a little spin as he did. Ash just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! These must be really good!\" He said with a big smile on his face. He lifted the jar to his nose and took a little whiff. They smelled just like cookies! Ash found that as a surprise. Most Pokemon food just smelled like... Well, Pokemon food. Did this mean Pokemon also like human food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shrugged. He picked a pill up out for himself, and popped it in his mouth. Chewing it up, his eyes suddenly went wide. He jumped up, pumping his fist into the air! \"Whoa, those really are amazing!\" Ash laughed happily. He took another two out, one for Pikachu, one for him, and the two had another! They jumped and celebrated together, the flavors sending pleasure throughout their bodies, as they could feel fresh energy within them! Ash tucked the bottle away back in the bag, and looked down at Pikachu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy, race you home!\" He said, looking determined. Pikachu held up his little fists and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika!\" With that little phrase, Ash made a dash for home, catching Pikachu off guard. Pikachu soon chased after him, catching up in due time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that Ash didn't realize was that those little \"snacks\" were vitamins for Pokemon. Any breeder could easily tell you they were used to make Pokemon stronger! And any one of them could tell you that if a powerful little Pokemon needed a huge dose just to get stronger, there was no telling how much it could amplify a human!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash felt so full of energy that he was able to run all the way home from Viridian City without stopping to catch his breath once! Pikachu did a pretty good job keeping up, running along on all fours, but he couldn't compete with Ash's longer legs. Ash slapped the front door and turned, grinning down at Pikachu. \"I won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu, fell onto his butt, panting, but he smiled up at Ash. \"Pika!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh scooped Pikachu up and set him on his shoulder. \"Good race little guy! You deserve a rest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPikachu curled up in a little ball and quickly fell asleep. Ash set the groceries down on top of the table and peeked his head into the living room. \"Mom? I'm back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelia looked away from her game show and up at Ash in surprise. \"Ash? You're back from Viridian City already? Did someone give you a ride?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Just ran there!\" Ash said with a grin. He dropped some money in his mother's hand and said, \"I'm going upstairs to get on my PC! Call me when dinner's ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grabbed the bottle of Protein out of one of the bags and ran upstairs to his room. He still felt like he was surging with energy! Delia smiled and tucked the money back into her purse. \"That son of mine~ He's such a surprising boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to her program only for it to suddenly change to an anchorwoman, the words \"Emergency Bulletin\" blinking at the top of the screen in bright red letters. \"This just in! A cache of experimental Pokemon food has accidentally been released into stores all over the world! The food was created as part of an experiment to make the food palatable for human consumption for the benefit of making a stronger, healthier alternative to regular vitamins. However, the food was still in its testing stages and is highly dangerous. Any human who eats the food will find their bodies drastically changed depending on what was consumed. The food is safe for Pokemon consumption and will not give them any greater benefits than what they would normally get from food. If you find any of the experimental food, contact the nearest Pokemon laboratory immediately! If any of your Pokemon's food has the distinct smell of baked goods, it is experimental.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anchorwoman repeated the message once more before the regularly scheduled show popped back on. \"Oh my! I'd better check our pantry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Delia quickly began searching the pantry, Ash popped another pill into his mouth, loving the taste, while he checked his messages. He had gotten a few e-mails from his friends around the world, checking in with him to see how he was doing, telling him about their own lives, and, occasionally, inviting him to come visit. Ash smiled as he replied to them. It was good to know so many people cared about him~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day passed fairly quickly and uneventfully. Ash ate dinner and his mother declined to tell Ash about the experimental Pokemon food. Their store of Pokemon food smelled the same as it always did so she thought they were perfectly safe and the matter passed from her mind. Ash ate a bit more than he usually did, keeping Mr. Mime busy running back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room to bring him more food. When he was done eating, he sighed, patting his slightly swollen belly. \"That was great! I haven't had food that tasted that good in awhile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother smiled and said, \"It's good to have you home again for awhile Ash~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh yawned and said, \"It's good to be back home Mom~\" He stood up and stretched, turning towards the stairs. \"I'm going to go to bed now. See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Ash~ I love you!\" His mother called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too!\" He called back before closing the door to his room. He was too tired to change into his pajamas so he settled for pulling off his vest and peeling his socks off, tossing them into the corner. He set his hat down on his desk and crawled into bed, falling asleep almost immediately after closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, something was changing inside of Ash. The Protein that he had eaten was rushing through his system, altering his biochemistry and improving his body, specifically his muscles. It began in his chest, the once flat plain of flesh slowly pushing out, swelling thicker and rounder, the muscles pressing up against his black shirt. His shoulders broadened while his back flared out, the shirt coming untucked as the material stretched and groaned. His biceps were next, his once unimpressive arms bulging out, the muscles growing to the size of baseballs while his forearms thickened, increasing his grip. His shirt pulled up slightly as his ab muscles popped out one by one, transforming his stomach into a series of tight bumps. Down below, his pants bulged and warped as his stick thin legs bloated with size, his jeans popping their seams around his thighs, revealing his boxer shorts underneath. His calves went through a similar transformation, ripping the hems slightly as they rode up. Lastly, his butt grew rounder, firmer and more muscular while his dick shot out a few more inches, his balls swelling to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, completely unaware of his growth, merely turned over onto his side, a small smile on his face.</span></div></div>",

Compared to a sleeping bag or a bench in a Pokemon Center... As the young man stretched outward, his powerful fist slamming into his nightstand! His hand immediately pulled back as he let out a yelp. \"Ow! What the heck...?\" Ash opened his eyes and looked over. It was just his nightstand. Which was strange... He never hit it before... Then again, he was getting to that special age all boys do! Ash grinned happily and sprung out of bed, walking over to his full body mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash looked at his reflection, he saw he had got more than he had bargained for! He gasped, running his hands down his pecs, and along his abs. He couldn't believe his eyes as he looked down at his thighs and calves, which seemed like they were ready to burst from his jeans with the slightest flex! He could even see the bulging muscles poking out from little holes they created. Ash quickly developed a cocky grin as his hands wandered over his package. It bulged out in an obscene manner, looking as if his pants had a special pouch cradled just to it's needs! He lifted his arms, flexing his biceps, and liking what he saw. His arms swelled up to a decent size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look amazing!\" He grinned, \"I must be hitting a growth spurt!\" Ash turned around and flexed his ass in the mirror. \"Heh, I must have really been working hard from all that running all over the world!\" Ash ran his hands backward down his ass, chuckling to himself. \"I must be the sexiest kid in Pallet Town!\" He smiled. Ash was about to walk out the door, wanting to show off to someone, ANYone, before he stopped and noticed the jar of protein on the desk. The idea then hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was you!\" He said aloud, moving in to grab the jar. He lifted it up and popped open the top. He plucked out a pill, which he noticed was a little harder with his larger hands. He held it between two fingers smiling at it. \"These things must be what made me so huge!\" He said. \"Maybe I should take one more...\" He popped the pill in his mouth, and chewed it up before swallowing. Then he started to get a devious smile. \"But why just one? Maybe I should take two!\" He said, popping another in. \"Or three! Or maybe five! Ten!\" Ash said greedily. Before he knew it, he was shoveling handfuls of the stuff into his mouth, until the jar was nearly empty! When he saw it was nearly gone, he slowed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should stop...\" He said, almost regretfully. \"I DID buy these for Pikachu after all...\" He mumbled, as he took one more shameless pill. He let out a huge sigh, and ran back over to his mirror. However, to his dismay, nothing had changed. Ash immediately got a frown on his face. He gave it a few more seconds, but nothing. \"... Maybe it just was puberty...\" He mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit disdainful, Ash made his way downstairs...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was disappointing that he wasn't growing any bigger, but Ash didn't dwell on it too long. He was a young kid and he had already moved on to thinking about what he was going to do that day. First things first, he wanted to get a nice breakfast! One great thing about being home was getting home cooked meals, three times a day! He seemed to have good luck in getting traveling companions that could cook, but there was nothing quite like the food his mom made. Unfortunately, he was going to have to be disappointed again. When Ash got into the kitchen, Mr. Mime was the only one in sight, vacuuming. Before he could question the pokemon about his mother's whereabouts, Ash noticed a small slip of paper attached to the fridge with a magnet in the shape of a Jigglypuff. He took it down and read it over:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my loving son Ash: I'm really sorry about this! I just got a call from a friend nearby who needs help cooking for a party she's having later tonight! I shouldn't be gone for more than a few hours. In the meantime, Mr. Mime will be happy to cook for you. Just don't ask him to do anything <i>too</i> complicated. Love, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh groaned and crumpled the note up in his fist. So much for home cooked meals! As he tossed the note into the trash, Ash saw Mr. Mime walk into the kitchen with a smile on his face, putting the vacuum away. Ash tapped him on the shoulder and said, \"Hey, can you make me an omelet with hash browns, sausage, and toast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Mime nodded eagerly and rushed over to the fridge, eager to help Ash out. Ash smiled at the dutiful Pokemon and sat down, rubbing his stomach while it dully growled at him. Ash was so focused on his need for food he didn't notice as he slowly started to grow again! His pecs pushed out further against his black undershirt, inch by inch, the collar straining, his shoulders broadening, taking up more room on this end of the table, his back flaring out, pushing forcefully against the back of his chair, the wood groaning under the pressure, unheard over Ash's stomach. His biceps bulked up next, shredding the sleeves entirely as they swelled up to softball size! His thighs and calves seemed to be in a contest to see which muscle group could destroy the remains of his pants the fastest. His thighs forced the already blown seams to push apart more and more, his boxers clinging to him like a second skin, starting to look more like briefs than boxers! His calves, refusing to be outdone, decimated the cuffs of his jeans, the material looking rattier like Ash was dressing in punk attire. His big feet spread across the cool tile of the kitchen floor while his ass bulged out backward, filling his seat to overflow, the chair groaning louder. His package was the last thing to grow, stretching down his leg as his balls swelled larger and larger, filling out what remained of his jeans in an obscene manner, the button straining to hold the monster back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, unaware of all these changes, merely winced and rearranged himself. His eyes widened as he felt his bulge, the ponderous weight hanging from his crotch finally getting his attention. With a clatter and a bang, Ash got to his feet, his chair falling back behind him. Mr. Mime glanced over shoulder, too focused on cooking to notice Ash's changes. Ash, however, couldn't get enough of them! His look of awe and wonder slowly changed to a cocky and confident smirk, his hand clenching into a fist as he slowly flexed, his softball sized bicep jumping up even larger as he pumped it up, a thick vein trailing over the peak. Ash put his hands on his hips and slowly bounced his pecs, savoring the sensation as those weighty orbs of flesh jumped and danced at his slightest provocation. Bending over slightly, to see over the swell of his chest, he flexed his thighs and calves with a satisfied expression, every inch of his body pumped and powerful! He set his chair back up, sitting back down with a smirk, the sounds of the chair protesting now reaching his ears. Just yesterday this chair had been sturdy. Ash couldn't have broken it if he tried. Now, merely sitting here was causing it to shake and groan, barely able to hold up the now adult sized ten year old!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm definitely liking this~\" Ash said to himself, flexing his biceps again just to see the muscle swell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's self inspection was brought to a premature end as Mr. Mime turned around, plate of food in hand, nearly dropping it in shock as he saw how huge Ash was looking! Ash smiled a little sheepishly, his cocky smirk replaced with his normal boyish charms. \"Hey, don't look at me like that! I'm still the same guy I was yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Mime cautiously approached Ash, setting the plate down in front of him. Ash smiled at the pokemon and patted him on the head. \"Thanks a lot~ I really appreciate it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Mime's nervous expression dropped, replaced by his normal smile as he saw Ash behaving just like Ash~ He stood by and watched as Ash ate, ready to serve him if he needed anything! Ash, meanwhile, shoveled the food into his mouth like he hadn't eaten in years. His growing body demanded fuel and he wasn't about to deny it! The experimental Protein he had devoured was slowly working its way through his system, making him expand bit by bit. With the amount he had eaten, this growth was bound to last for quite awhile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was no telling just how huge he was going to end up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash let out a loud belch that nearly shook the clean dishes! He rubbed over his abs, grinning happily. \"Not bad, Mr. Mime!\" Ash told the Pokemon. \"Not as great as mom though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Mime just chuckled nervously, rubbing the back of his head. He wasn't sure if it was a compliment or not, but he was willing to take it! Ash then got to his feet, noticing how the room seemed just a bit smaller. This just gave him an even cockier grin. Ash turned around and started to exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take a shower!\" He announced. Mr. Mime just looked at Ash for a moment, before taking the dishes and making his way over to the sink. Ash, in the meantime, was making his way to the bathroom. After a tasty breakfast, it was time to take a shower and refresh himself! Along the way to the bathroom, he stopped by his room. Why? It was simple: He wanted more of those pills!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his room, Ash twisted the bottle open, and shook a few pills out on his hand, paying no mind to how many, before tossing them into his mouth. As he took a quick glance in the bottle, and took note that he could see the bottom. Not thinking about it too much, he closed the lid up tight, his arms bulging as he did. As he set it down, he looked at his biceps, flexing them proudly. \"Heh heh... I look pretty amazing!\" He then looked down and flexed his chest, watching the muscle coil up and tighten into two thick soccer balls. He brought his arms down and flexed in a most muscular, his arrogant grin returning as his shirt let out a long \"RIIIIIIIP\" as his massive physique tore out of his black shirt. His hand gripped at a shred of cloth on his shoulder, and jerked downward, tearing the material off of his body. He smirked, and looked down over himself, in love with how he could barely see past his pecs. He bounced them, one after another. There was no describing how he felt right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning out the door, he finally made his way down into the bathroom, where he stripped himself of what remained of his clothes. In a pair of boxers that looked more like briefs, he glanced at himself in the mirror. That familiar grin returned, as he saw that Ekans in his pants and peeked out of his underwear and was held tightly against his thigh. \"Hello there...\" He snickered, before lowering the boxers off and tossing them aside. Ash had truly become a specimen of man. From his bulging, massive body, to his long, thick manhood that attached at his hips. The only thing that threw it off was that boyish face atop it all, but even then, there was no describing how handsome he was when he flashed his trademark grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shrugged, his shoulders flexing slightly. \"I don't know how Arceus crammed this much sexy into one person!\" He laughed at his own little joke, before then turning the hot water on. In moments, there was hot water spraying from the shower head and Ash stepped right in! The droplets of water traveled down his body, some it plunging off his nipples, other drops washing down off his waving, rippling abs. There was a permanent smile on Ash's face, as he started to wash off his body with the bar of soap. Bubbly suds moved all down his body, leaving his tight, bulging skin soft and irresistable to the touch. Ash gave his own body a hug, pushing his pecs up against his chin, before giving them a nice, long lick. He snickered to himself, clearly pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh soon washed the water from himself, before grabbing a towel and drying himself, finding it a bit difficult at times since his massive muscles couldn't reach all the way around him, but he didn't get frustrated. In fact he liked it! The face he couldn't reach just attested to how impressive he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's eyes went wide for a moment, as a familiar feeling rushed through himself. His pecs jumped up in size, going from little soccer balls to the size of medicine balls! His biceps started to bulge and swell, peaking around thirty inches, while his abs could only struggle to keep up! His traps had started lunging up in size, giving Ash an even more intimidating look! His thighs pressed together, and Ash's cock started to look like he was growing a third leg! It must have been at least 11 inches long, and about as thick around as Caterpie! Ash stood on the tips of his thickening toes, smirking as his head just came short of smashing the ceiling, not to mention this made his calves bulge up until they were the size of cantloupes! Ash just chuckled, flexing every muscle on his body at once! He was in love with the massive beast he had become!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the question remained: What would happen now?</span></div></div>",

Ash just chuckled, brushing a little debris off of his shoulders before moving in on his dresser. He started to look down at all the puny sets of clothing that would barely fit around his godly physique. Deciding he had to put SOMETHING on, he forced one of his white t-shirts onto his body. It immediately tore into pieces, leaving Ash barely covered with a few tiny shreds of clothes! He chuckled with a cocky grin still firmly in place! He ripped off the pantlegs off of a pair of jeans, leaving them at about knee-length. At least, that's what it would have been at his old size! As Ash shoved his monstrous legs through the each pantleg, the material tore even further, leaving him stuck in a pair of pants that barely even covered a fourth of his thighs! Ash barely, and that was a huge barely, managed to get them buttoned together. Unfortunately, he couldn't get his zipper up! His manhood had just grown so gigantic and bulged out so far that it was entirely impossible! Ash just smiled, giving his groin a little rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better make sure not to get excited...\" He though to himself. Ash started to make his way back out the door, making sure to grab the bottle of protein on the way out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire house was shaking as the titanic teen made his way through the hallway! He was so amazingly huge that his shoulders rubbed up against the walls until he managed to get into the living room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm heading out!\" He said to no one in particular. Ash couldn't fit through the door, and was getting fed up with having to try! He settled for breaking a gargantuan hole in the wall, letting the door fall to the ground outside. \"Heh, that's more like it!\" He said happily to himself, as he reached the outside! Taking the cap off of the bottle, Ash carelessly downed the rest of the pills. Each one disappeared down his gullet, and Ash crumbled the plastic bottle into scrap, before tossing it aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm all out!\" Ash said to himself, \"Too bad I'm still hungry for more!\" Ash flexed his arm, watching it pump up bigger and beefier with every flex! He tucked his thumb in and made his biceps peak! \"Yeah... Just look at that size...\" Ash growled, \"THAT'S real power...!\" He started walking north, making his way for Viridian City! \"I gotta have MORE!\" He said, speeding up a little, \"I'll become the biggest thing to ever exist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was quickly making his way across Route 1 to Viridian City! The trip was growing shorter with every step, because at this point, Ash had started growing even more massive! His biceps were pumping up even huger, until they were nearly the size of beach balls! He hadn't noticed as his pecs were swelling as well, each of them huge and heaving, like a gargantuan shelf over his abs! Speaking of abs, his had become a powerful eight-pack, and had put on some mass of their own! With how tall Ash was growing, his abs were like a set of bodybuilder's pecs! Ash was only slowed slightly by the surging size of his thighs, which had started to rub together as he ran! It was like a pair of muscular scissors that could snap a telephone pole like it was a matchstick! His calves were growing and were like two massive pillars that supported all the bulging, massive muscles above! Ash's ass was growing larger, and were like two little moons to everyone who saw them from down below! Finally, Ash's cock was also growing in his pants, pressing tightly up against his waist! It was a little uncomfortable, but the satisfaction of having such a gigantic tool way more satisfying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh soon arrived in Viridian City, causing a bit of a stir as he arrived! After all, who wouldn't notice a sixteen foot teen with muscles that could crush a tree? Ash was quickly making his way to the Pok\u00e9Mart, eager to get all the vitamins he could!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash carelessly wrapped a towel around his waist, his still slightly wet body glistening in the early morning light. He flexed for himself one more time in front of the mirror, unable to resist the call to admire his own muscles. It was all so new and amazing! He was loving every second of not only having this pumped up bod, but actually feeling it growing bigger from all the Protein! The feeling of growing was almost better than having the huge body...almost~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just about to head upstairs to try and find some clothes to fit him when there was suddenly an impatient knock at the door. Ash, eager to show off his body to anyone who might be out there, rushed over to the door, making the house shake as his big heavy feet slapped against the floor. He held his hand up to Mr. Mime who had stepped back and made way for Ash to get to the door. Adjusting his towel slightly, Ash leaned against the wall a bit and opened the door, looking as casual as he could. Standing at the door was none other than his rival since childhood, Gary Oak! He was wearing his normal outfit, the only extra addition being a lab coat. He had obviously come here straight from the lab. He was staring off to the side, his eyebrows drawn down in a fierce expression. Something was clearly on his mind. Without looking he said, \"I need to look through your pantry Mrs. Ketchum, there might be some experimental...Pokemon...food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary's eyes widened as he finally looked at who he was talking to. He took half a step back before he saw the familiar face smirking down at him. \"A-Ash?! Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grinned and stood up straight, the tips of his raven colored hair playfully brushing across the ceiling. \"Of course it's me! Who else would it be?\" He bounced his pecs cockily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary's expression of shock quickly was replaced with one of annoyance. \"So I take it you've found some of the experimental Pokemon food then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rolled his eyes and said, \"I have no idea what you're talking about. I haven't heard anything about any experimental food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary let out a harsh chuckle, crossing his arms. \"Yeah, so you're trying to tell me that this freakish growth of yours is all natural?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't like that insolent tone Gary was using with him. All his life Gary had looked down on him, believing himself to be superior in every way. It wasn't until recently that he had even acknowledged Ash's skill as a trainer! Even though he viewed him as an equal in battle, he still was treating him like some little kid! He slammed his hand against the wall and leaned down closer to Gary. \"Yeah, that's what I'm saying! Got a problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary flinched slightly, surprised by Ash's suddenly aggressive attitude. He quickly recovered and said, \"You've got to come down to the lab with me! We need to run tests on you! And bring whatever it is that made you this big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary turned and was about to leave when he felt a vice like grip snatch his arm. He glared up at Ash who was holding him tight and said, \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smirked and said, \"I don't feel like going to the lab today. That place is always so boring. Why don't you stay here with me for awhile visit? We can catch up~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary tried to jerk himself free of Ash's grasp but was completely unable. \"We don't have time for that! This stuff could be dangerous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh laughed and yanked Gary inside his house, slamming the door shut behind him. \"Yeah right! I've never felt better! Look at me and tell me I might be in danger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flexed his biceps, the muscles big as soccer balls now! Gary couldn't help but feel intimidated by this display. Ash smirked and said, \"Thought so. Now come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed Gary by the arm again and dragged him upstairs, Mr. Mime looking on in shock, but staying out of the way. Gary kicked, punched, and struggled the whole way, but Ash was not to be denied. Once they were safely in his room, the door locked, Ash tossed Gary onto his bed and said, \"Pull up your sleeve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary, not wanting to piss off his now towering muscle bound rival, irritably yanked his sleeve up. Ash nodded and crouched down next to him. \"Now flex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary, already knowing where this was going, did as he was told. A pretty impressive bicep for his age popped up, easily able to dwarf Ash's own...at his old size. Ash chuckled and slowly flexed, his enormous bicep bulging up and up and up, making Gary's pathetic arm look like a toothpick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I don't know how you can even lift a Pokeball with wimpy arms like those!\" Ash said, gripping Gary's collar in his thick hand. With a slight tug he ripped it right down the middle, revealing Gary's toned, athletic body. The slightly older teen gasped and crossed his arms, glaring at Ash. Ash merely pulled his arms apart, pinning them down at Gary's sides. Ash loomed in closer, his own enormous chest pressing against Gary's far more modest one. \"Maybe you should start doing some more push ups so you can get a body like a REAL man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me!\" Gary shouted, pushing fruitlessly against Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even have to take these off to know I'm way bigger down there than you'll ever be!\" Ash said, flicking Gary's zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary, despite himself, looked down and noticed that Ash's towel had slipped, showing just a hint of the monster that lied in wait. He felt his cheeks flush slightly, gulping a bit as he forced himself to look back up at Ash's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it Gary! You're just jealous~\" Ash said, grinning cockily down at his rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I am!\" Gary spat back, refusing to admit that Ash was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been collecting that experimental food haven't you? At the lab? Anyone there right now?\" Ash asked casually, an idea hitting him out of the blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do! And no, no one else is there! It's just me and Gramps there and he's traveling around looking for...wait...why do you want to know?\" Gary asked, suddenly suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smirked and slowly stood back up. \"Well, it's just that I've almost run out.\" He reached over and shook his Protein bottle, the rattling sound indicating there wasn't much left. \"I could always use a refill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary's face went pale as he realized what Ash was suggesting. \"No way! That's a VERY bad idea! Don't even think about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh chuckled and said, \"But didn't you say you wanted me back at the lab? Yeah, you definitely said that. Just give me a second to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary watched helplessly as Ash squeezed into a pair of jeans, the bottoms ripping apart until he was wearing what appeared to be a very tight pair of short shorts, his ass and crotch bulging obscenely from both ends of his body. He pulled on one of his spare jackets, the material stretched tight along his back, revealing his sculpted torso to the world. Ash noticed, with a little thrill, that his head was now pressing tightly against he ceiling. \"This place is getting a bit small for me anyway~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grabbed Gary by the arm again and dragged him back downstairs and out the door, heading for the lab which was just down the street.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Ash forcibly took Gary back to his grandfather's lab, Ash couldn't help but notice that there wasn't a single person the whole way there. Talk about strange... Not to mention a disappointment! Ash would have been more than willing to stop and show off his new musculature to anyone who even looked his way! Ash just scoffed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feh, they're going to see me eventually! I'll be the biggest man in all of Kanto! Bigger than Lieutenant Surge and Bruno combined!\" Ash thought as he dragged Gary along. He rose his arm and flexed it repeatedly, forcing the muscle to bounce. It seemed to grow just a few inches thicker each time! Ash just chuckled to himself. \"Yeah... Just like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary, on the other hand, wasn't having such a great time. He had a bad feeling about all of this in the pit of his stomach. Not to mention he could barely keep up with Ash! The hulking teenager had the strength of ten men, but Gary still found himself stumbling and having his feet dragged along in the dirt. If only Ash was a few inches taller, he could at LEAST have been carried there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two soon arrived at the front gates of the Pokemon Lab. Ash looked up the flight of stairs leading to the front door. There was no way his huge feet were going to fit on those teeny, tiny, little stairs. Ash manuvered in the gate, and moved onto the grass next to the stairs. It would take a little more effort, but Ash didn't mind showing off his body! Anxious as ever, he started walking up the hill at an impressive speed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary looked up at his rival. He could hear the seams of the clothes that desperately hung to his body slowly tearing and popping. He gulped as he realized that Ash was still getting bigger! His pecs shoved out even further, bouncing and shaking with every step he took! His beefy, juicy arms shot up in size, along with his shoulders and back! Gary gulped as he looked up at his rival. Sure, he might be able to beat him in a Pokemon battle, but Ash could probably take out Gary's entire team by himself! Hell, Ash could probably BENCH Gary's whole team! Ash's traps pushed up higher, raising his jacket up, and forcing it to tear a little more as his broadening shoulders pushed out further. His abs continued to bulk up, each row looking like a miniature set of pecs! Gary could hear a faint sound that was like many small, metal pops. It took a while, but Gary soon realized it was Ash's manhood! It was growing too huge for his pants, and slowly, the zipper was being forced down slightly. Ash's thighs and calves were really starting to expand at this point. The already heavy limbs continued to push out, doing their best to bust free from the denim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary continued to look, his gaze was abruptly ended when he saw that they had come to a stop! Ash was looking down at the door, and did his best not to crush the door knob in his monster grip. He struggled for a moment before realized the door was locked! Ash took Gary and carelessly tossed him at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open it.\" Ash commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, watch what you're doing!\" Gary replied angrily as he got back to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said <b><u>open it</u></b>.\" Ash repeated with more emphasis. That deep tone shook something within Gary as he then scrambled to get his keys. After a few seconds, Gary opened the door. He was then shoved aside as Ash made sure that he was the first one through, not letting Gary pull any tricks. Gary closed the door behind him, still feeling a little sore from that toss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Ash's eyes lit up as he looked around the room. There were piles upon piles of recalled vitamins! The only thing that kept him from every delicious pill was a thin plastic wrapping and a little plastic lid. Ash smacked his lips, feeling hungry already!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary could see the expression on Ash's face. He knew exactly what kind of expression it was. He had seen it on his face hundreds of times before. A look of determination. A look that said Ash was going to put his whole body and mind into a task until he accomplished it, no matter what the cost! A look that meant that Gary was absolutely screwed. But perhaps most frightening of all, was the fact that it was tempered with another look. A far more primal look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of pure hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh made his way forward and looked through the boxes, shifting some of them aside so he could see what he was dealing with. The boxes of Protein immediately caught his attention, but he also noticed boxes full of Calcium and Iron, Carbos and Zinc. He wasn't sure what these particular vitamins would do to him, but he didn't care! If they worked as well as the Protein it could only be good! He tore open the boxes, one of each kind, and pulled out the bottles, ripping the lids off with his thick mitt like they were made of paper! Gary watched helplessly as Ash stuffed his face with hand full after hand full of the vitamins, scarfing them down with a single minded desire to grow and make himself bigger, stronger, until no one and nothing could stand up to him! Since his journey had started he had become embroiled in the conflicts of the Pokemon gods, tossed about by their whims and desires. Now it was time for change. Now he was going to replace the old ways and create a new future!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of the vitamins were almost instantaneous. Ash felt his muscles twitch and then bulge out impressively, his chest gaining inches every few seconds, his biceps bulging to beach ball size and then past! His shoulders broadened as his back flared out, shredding his jacket entirely, the ragged bits of material falling to the ground at his feet which were quickly swelling and stretching out across the floor. His pants suffered a similar fate, his cock bursting free from the denim prison, the button bursting off, ricocheting off a wall while the zipper blew open, his boxers unable to contain it. He was now standing completely naked, his muscular ass facing Gary, making him blush slightly at the spectacle. Ash's thighs obliterated any other shred of denim that had managed to cling to his legs, his calves tensed and bulging, filled with unquestionable power. His forearms bulked up similarly, his hands growing longer and thicker, able to rip through solid concrete! Ash's abs popped out further from his stomach, creating an unstoppable wall of muscle, his traps forming as similar impenetrable wall around his thick neck. Even his height was increasing at a faster speed, his legs lengthening, his head getting closer and closer to the ceiling while his enormous shoulders were quickly approaching either wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary, looking down right tiny next to Ash's enormous figure, knew he had to do <i>something</i> to stop this behemoth that had once been his rival. If he didn't, there was no telling what would happen! He looked around and grabbed a nearby metal pole Ash had snapped off during his growth. It felt heavy in his grip, something that could easily do damage to an average man. With no other choice, Gary held it over his head and brought it down as hard as he could on Ash's back! The pole snapped clean in half, flying into the opposite wall, not so much as a scratch on Ash's broad back. Slowly, the gargantuan trainer turned and grinned down at Gary. The pole he had been holding fell to the ground with a clatter as Gary felt his body grow weaker, his legs shaking slightly. There really was nothing he could do to stop Ash!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you wait.\" Ash said, his voice low and rumbling. \"I'll get to you in a minute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his back on Gary and began popping the lids off the bottles with his thumb, pouring their entire contents into his mouth before swallowing them down. The supply of vitamins was swiftly dwindling, nothing but crumpled plastic and savaged boxes remaining. Gary's only saving grace was that it would take awhile for the vitamins to be fully processed by Ash's body. A very, very, <i>very</i> small comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gary had an idea. There was nothing in this lab that could stop Ash at his current and still growing size. But there was still a chance he could at least put up a fight against him! Being as quiet as possible, Gary made his way to one of the open boxes, partially hidden behind another stack. He pulled out one of the jars, a Protein one as fate would have it, and slowly screwed the top off. He gulped as he looked at the seemingly innocuous pills inside. If he did this, there would be no going back. As he pondered, Ash let out a thunderous burp, a low chuckle escaping from him as well. The arrogance of Ash's smirk reawakened a fire inside him he hadn't felt in awhile. It was like back in the days of their old rivalry! There was no way that little Ashy boy was going to get ahead of him! Not when he could fight back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another thought, he began to stuff pills into his mouth, swallowing them as quickly as he could, moving from jar to jar to make sure he got as much out of his growth as Ash was getting, his mind focused entirely on this task!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA race was beginning, one that would change the world of Pokemon as we know it!</span></div></div>",

It wasn't as easy for someone his size since the pills were bigger to him than they were to Ash. As if to encourage him, Gary suddenly felt a bump from behind! A quick glance back revealed it to be Ash's hip which had bumped into him! Ash's growth had really started to take effect, the young man quickly filling up the room. Gary immediately chugged the bottle in hand, before reaching for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an intense race. Ash was downing three bottles at a time, while Gary could only manage one! But luck was on the rival's side today, as his body had already started to process the nutrients he was forcing into his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary could feel his temperature rising. His arms starting to grow from a decent baseball size, now popping up, and swelling until it reached a thick, full softball size. Gary wasn't about to be satisfied with just this. He continued to devour as many pills as he could, his pecs pushing out further from his chest, looking like two overinflated basketballs, his abs quickly tightened, gaining definition an mass in the process. His forearms had filled out, giving him a stronger grip, and his back flared out, becoming a powerful wall of size. He continued to chug the pills as his thighs filled out the once comfortable jeans that he wore, rubbing against each other and growing wide and powerful. His calves welled up with new size, becoming two powerful pillars, which was followed by his feet which grew wide and thick. Each toe was given their due, growing large, and quickly surpassing the size of tomatoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary may have been doing his best, but Ash was far surpassing him in both size AND mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Gary was able to enjoy his own small splendor, Ash was becoming too much, and not even Gary would be enough to stop him! Ash's body started expanding at an unreal rate. His muscles were all swelling to an immense, heavy size. His pecs jutting out and over his abs, his shoulders broadening, his abs deepening even further... Ash's arrogant smile remained in place as he felt his thighs rubbing up against a few tiny packages that remained. Gary was nearly forced and squished against a wall as Ash's bulging ass pushed out even further. A little chill traveled up Ash's back he felt his cock sliding across the cold ground as it increased in size. With his calves ever expanding, his foot was like a wall that pushed everything aside. Ash was reveling in the feeling of his pecs pushing against his chin as he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was in shock. As if things weren't bad enough, Ash finished off the last of the bottles! Every bottle in this room was completely empty! Gary's heart started to race as he realized what this meant.</span></div></div>",

It didn't help that Ash appeared to be coming to the same conclusion! He was knocking boxes aside with careless swipes of his massive hands, grunting as he noticed there was no more pills. He looked disappointed, but then smiled and shrugged, an evil grin rising to his face. He started searching the ground, clearly looking for Gary! Thinking fast, the growing teen quickly ducked down and made his way to the next room. Hopefully wouldn't catch on to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was so focused on getting into the room without Ash seeing him, he nearly toppled a stack of boxes that filled the room. He quickly caught them, open popping open from the force of his arms...revealing more jars of vitamins! Gary's eyes widened as he remembered that they had recalled enough vitamins to fill two rooms! He felt like laughing from pure joy! This was it! This was his chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready Ashy boy~\" Gary said with a wicked grin as he ripped open the bottle. \"Cause I'm about to show you some REAL size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tilted his head back and began to pour the pills into his awaiting maw, swallowing them down more easily than before as his growth began to pick up, his shirt rising up higher and higher, showing off two more rows of his rock hard eight pack, the collar tearing down the front, while his widening back ripped from the bottom up! His jeans were swiftly reduced to tatters as his thighs bulged and swelled out from them, his calves blasting through the weak material like they were made of air! His feet, growing wider and stronger, ripped apart the last of his shoes, while his chest bulged out bigger than medicine balls! His biceps weren't about to be left behind, growing to the size of soccer balls, thick veins supplying them with a steady flow of blood, keeping them fueled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary chuckled, his voice sounding lower as he tore through the boxes like a madman, the pills disappearing into the darkness of his mouth, traveling down his throat, visible as thick bulges moving down into his chest, landing with soft plops in his stomach, the casings dissolving almost immediately, sending untold power to course through Gary's veins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the growing teen worked his way through the boxes, Ash was finding it difficult to move around and search for Gary. His bulky and still growing body was quickly filling the room the pills had been stored in, his head denting the roof while his shoulders smashed through the metal beams in the ceiling like they were made of Styrofoam. He couldn't help but grin as he flexed his arms, his biceps swelling to unreal sizes as he grunted, forcing more blood into them, to really pump them up! He would have kept exploring his body right then and there, but he still had work that needed to be done! A certain former rival of his needed to be taught a lesson in humility!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Gaaaaary~ Come out, come out wherever you are!\" He said in a mock playful tone, his footsteps echoing ominously, shaking the entire lab. He didn't expect Gary to respond. Half the fun would be in seeking him out while his body continued to swell, eventually bringing the whole structure down around him! Just the thought of that was enough to make his enormous cock stiffen slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a better idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh jerked his head towards a nearby door as he heard what was unmistakably Gary's voice, though much louder and...deeper?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come in here and find me yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the walls suddenly shook violently, denting outward toward Ash. Something strange was going on here! Ash frowned and pulled his fist back, sending it flying into the nearby wall. It couldn't take the pressure of Ash's powerful punch, crumpling like tinfoil. With a grunt, Ash dug his fingers into the steel wall and began to peel it apart, making a passageway for himself into the next room. Upon entering, the first thing that caught his eye was the floor covered in ripped boxes and the unmistakable white bottles of vitamins. The second thing he noticed was Gary, standing just shorter than him, with muscles comparable to Ash! His mouth dropped open as Gary grinned at him, flexing his gargantuan biceps. \"Not bad, huh? Oh, did I forget to mention there was more pills in here? Silly me~ Guess I should have saved you some!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flicked an empty bottle at Ash, the small bit of plastic hitting him between the eyes. Ash grit his teeth and clenched his fists, glaring at Gary! \"You think just because you're a little bigger than before you can stand up to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary got crouched down and said, \"No! I KNOW I can stand up to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word he charged forward, tackling Ash around the waist, sending him crashing through the wall of the lab and back outside. Ash, recovering quickly from the attack, flipped Gary over his head and got to his feet, jumping up and landing on Gary's abs, driving down with all his weight! Gary barely managed to tense his abs in time, absorbing most of Ash's attack. Grabbing Ash's feet, Gary tripped Ash, sending him crashing down on the remains of the lab, his body easily able to cover the entire structure. Ash got his feet and looked around. Pallet Town was starting to look less like a peaceful town and more like a playground for the young giants to do battle in. They continued to swell and grow, their bodies bulging to greater and greater heights, the pills starting to work into overdrive! Without waiting for Ash to make a move, Gary ran forward, the ground quaking under his tonnage, cracks radiating out from wherever his feet landed, throwing a punch at Ash's face! Ash quickly leaned back, the blow falling on his chest. Gary actually winced. It felt like punching steel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh smirked and said, \"What's wrong? Too much for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right!\" Gary replied, taking a few steps back. \"I'm just getting started!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary ran forward, tackling into Ash. The two of them rolled on the ground, their growing bodies shaking the ground. Gary tried to punch Ash in the face, but both times Ash managed to tilt his head out of the way, forcing Gary to punch the earth. Ash pulled the unfair move of trying to headbutt Gary in the face, but Gary immediately moved, catching Ash's head on his shoulder and slamming it to the ground! Ash gagged a little as his throat was squeezed by Gary's hulked out shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh finally managed to shove Gary off of him, before wiping his forehead. The two went at each other again, firing punches that either missed entirely or had little effect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Face it, Ashy boy! Your pathetic fists can break these abs of steel!\" Gary grinned. He put his arms behind his head and crunched his abs, every bulbous muscle popping up and showing off to his rival. Ash just smirked and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? How do you expect to damage these rock-hard pecs?\" Ash retorted. He put his hands on his hips and bounced his huge, full pecs, one after the other. Gary just scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about YOU take a look at these arms!?\" He replied. He lifted his arms up and flexed them as hard as he could, both popping up and pumping to gargantuan sizes, like two huge mountains. To emphasize the point, a vein soon pressed up against his skin, throbbing and feeding the humongous muscles. Ash growled, moving forward quite suddenly, and slamming his fist into Gary's chest! Gary was blown back a little, but wasn't hurt too bad... Still, it was more that what he got when he did the same to Ash! Gary, in turn, rammed his fist into Ash's abs, catching him by surprise! Ash was winded suddenly, gasping for air. Gary took this brief opportunity to deliver a punch to Ash's face, sending him right into the center of the town! Ash immediately got to his feet, and charged back at Gary, crushing countelsss homes under his titanic feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh managed to get the punch he wanted, right into Gary's face, which sent Gary the same way he had sent Ash: right into town! Gary hit the ground and skid what felt like a small distance, decimating more housed in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Gary felt something that made him smile! His whole body pumped up a few sizes! He felt his arms almost instantly put on some more muscles, as his pecs deepened and pushed out even further!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary reached a new size, he got right back up to his feet! To his dismay, he looked at his rival and saw that he had went through the exact same progress!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys were breathing heavily, but they were also far from tired! As they stared the other down, they both knew that nothing was going to change at this rate! Both of them were about equal size, and hurting the other was near impossible! Gary grit his teeth as Ash got a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? You give up already!?\" Ash taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! In fact, I think I'm just getting started!\" Gary snapped back at his rival. Ash prepared himself for the worst, as Gary started to charge at him once more! But just before he was in striking distance, Gary made a sudden sharp turn to the east! And he just kept on running! Ash rose an eyebrow before getting a little angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Where do you think you're going!?\" Ash barked at him. Gary didn't give a reply and just kept on running. Ash folded his arms over his thick chest, pouting a little. \"Just what is he up to...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Celadon City...\" Gary thought to himself. \"If I can get to that department store, I can get a huge charge! I just know they have a ton of vitamins in stock there!\" Gary kept thinking, \"Then after that, I'll take down Sliph Co.! The place that produced all these things in the first place!\" Gary was now the one wearing a smirk on his face. His plan was perfect! Although his destination was much further away, the yield would be immense if it all worked out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh tilted his head, before a grin slid across his lips. \"Heh, I should use this time to get even bigger!\" He mumbled to himself. \"I'll take down Viridian... Then Pewter... Then Cerulean...!\" He laughed softly, \"I'll show Gary the definition of muscle!\" With those final words, Ash turned around and started making his way to Viridian City. While it was true his way might not paved with as many pills as Gary's was, there were many more stops, and they were much closer together! It was foolproof!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys charged on, with hopes of defeating their rival with sheer strength in mind!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary was running as fast as his massive legs could carry him. He knew that if he didn't reach Celadon City as fast as possible Ash would probably find a way to outgrow him and then he might even get his hands on Celadon's supply too! If that happened, this battle between them would be over! Gary wasn't about to let something like THAT happen! His massive feet damaged Rout 17 nearly beyond repair, trainers and Pokemon alike running screaming out of his way as he charged by. If a tree was in his way, he knocked it over! If a boulder was in his path, he crushed it into dust! He ran with a single minded focus, the massive buildings of Celadon rising up in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people of Celadon City never saw it coming. One minute they were going about their daily lives like nothing was amiss, the next a massive teenager suddenly burst on the scene, a wild look in his eyes! It didn't help that he was buck naked and bigger than most buildings, only the Celadon Department Store being larger than him! The citizens were left in shock only for a few moments, pure fear winning out and causing them to run and scream, trying to get away from the massive boy as fast as possible! Gary smirked at this reaction, taking a second to enjoy the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right little people! You're looking at a true god on the rise! Gary Oak isn't satisfied just being a Pokemon Champion! Watch as he becomes a true god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrogant words fell on deaf ears, though a few took his words to heart, watching devotedly as Gary strode through the city, kicking down a building or two along the way, just to test his power further! He crossed h is arms when he arrived at the Celadon Department Store. He counted the floors and started climbing, needing to boost himself up higher to reach the fifth floor drug store. Peering in through the windows his eyes gleamed with a greedy shine as he saw rows upon rows of jars of vitamins! \"Jack pot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rammed his hand through the window and began to shovel the jars towards his gaping maw, swallowing them down, jar and all! Within a few seconds he had cleared the whole floor of pills. But it wasn't enough! He crashed back down to the ground, his face now level with the fifth floor, though he was far wider than the building itself, his gigantic pecs pressing against the glass, giving a few people who were still trapped inside the building quite a show! Gary slowly moved around the building, slamming his foot down on top of what was clearly the storeroom to the building. He grinned as he crouched down, revealing hundreds more jars of vitamins! Without stopping, he grabbed the whole storeroom in his hands and yanked it free of the ground, lifting it up to his wide open mouth. An unfortunate stock boy, around Gary's own age, watched in horror as the building tilted, hundreds of jars of stock tumbling into the dark abyss of Gary's mouth, the unforgiving giant not even aware as a human fell lightly on his thick tongue before tumbling head over heels down into his stomach. Gary let out a belch as all the pills settled in his stomach, crushing the storeroom between his hands. He dusted them off and flexed his arms, watching as his biceps began to bulge and grow once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary felt an intense pressure of energy fill his whole body! The pills were starting to work faster on him now, five times the amount he had eaten before now coursing through his body! In three quick bursts he surged up to three times his previous height, even the massive Celadon City Department Store merely reaching his chest! Gary chuckled as he watched the city shrink around him, his broad shoulders blocking the sun, throwing it into shadow as his feet grew large enough to stomp whole buildings flat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could enjoy his growth any more, he felt a strange sensation on his back. Turning, he saw dozens of Grass type Pokemon firing Razor Leaf at him, as directed by the members of the Celadon Gym. Gary chuckled and proudly displayed his chest. \"Give me your best shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pokemon obliged, sending a torrent of razor sharp leaves at Gary's chest. But each and every one struck it and bounced harmlessly off. Gary laughed, loud and cruel, as he saw the efforts of the Pokemon come to naught. \"Here, let me show you a real move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrouching down, Gary filled his lungs with air, his chest expanding like a bellows. He got down on his hands and knees, pursing his lips, aiming down at the crowd of Pokemon and trainers alike. Before they realized what he was doing, Gary unleashed the air in a torrential gust, blowing the Pokemon and trainers away. By the time he was done, none of them remained behind. Gary got back to his feet and grinned. The city looked more like a children's playground to him! \"And this is just the beginning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to face the city at large and said, \"Remember my face you worthless bugs! When I'm done growing, all of you are going to be the willing slaves of Gary Oak! Just wait and see!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary turned his back on the city and began to head toward the Silph Co. building. Once he cleared out their stores, nothing would be able to stand up to him! Not even Ash! Every step the massive teen took caused the ground to quake  violently, his muscular ass bouncing along with his pecs, a truly intimidating sight! Gary had adopted a more leisurely stroll, his thick thighs rolling against each other as he walked. After all, why rush?~ He now had such a glaring advantage over Ash it wasn't even a contest anymore! All that remained, was getting the last of the pills and showing Ash who the real titan around here was!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While Gary was on the other side of Kanto, Ash was still close to home. The poor Pokemon trainer had next to no idea of how immesurably powerful his rival had now become! It would take a lot of work for him to catch up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash entered Viridian City, his thundering footsteps sent people into a panic. As they looked up and saw the gargantuan boy standing above all of them, they scurried and fled, doing their best to not get squished by the titanic boy's feet! Ash, on the other hand, was snickering to himself. He didn't know how far along Gary was, so what was the harm in having a little fun with the helpless citizens? He sat down, creating a massive earthquake, sending bird flying from the trees! As people ran around, he slammed his foot on top of them, a dark smirk on his face as he rubbed it around. The little ones really felt good on his feet! After that, Ash moved onto another group rubbing his feet all along them and forcing them to smell his musky toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he felt a wiggle around his dick. No, he wasn't getting hard, but rather there were people trapped underneath it! Ash grinned. \"What's wrong? Can't stand up under the weight of a <b>real</b> man!?\" Ash let out a roaring laugh. \"Can't blame you! There's not a single man in the world who's bigger or stronger than I am!\" Ash rose up his arms and flexed them as hard as he could. Two giant mountains erupted from his arms, both of them like huge buildings on his massive form. All these massive muscles then reminded Ash of what he came here for! He immediately stood back up and made his way over to the PokeMart. With no time to spare, he picked up the entire building and punched a hole in the front! Several small screams were heard from within, but they fell on deaf ears. The building was quickly tilted, pouring it's contents into Ash's mouth. The shelves, boxes, packaging, even people! All of them tumbled into the cavernous mouth, and were quickly swallowed whole, falling right into the boy's stomach and giving him more energy! In one fell swoop, Ash gulped the rest of it down, and wiped his mouth. \"Alright! Now on to Pewter City!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh dropped the empty husk of a building that was the PokeMart, and stomped off, countless buildings being destroyed in the process! As he ran, he could feel those few pills taking effect! His thighs were becoming thicker, slapping against each other as he ran, and those weren't the only things slapping together! Ash's mammoth cock kept hitting his thighs, which only made him grin in arrogance. \"Heh, big man...!\" He thought to himself. His calves exploded with size, one after the other, each of them like massive boulders that shook with every step. His feet slammed into the earth, growing larger and thicker as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash was dashing, he crashed through a forest, destroying countless trees as he ran. While most of them could be stomped under his colossal feet, some took a little more effort to shove aside! Ash didn't mind though; He was looking for a reason to show off his massive physique! After bulldozing through the forest, Ash had easily made his way to Pewter City. It was looking a bit gray, but what else was expected of a city of stone? As he looked around the city, he heard the usual screams of people as they ran about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah! Shut up! Just get away from the PokeMart!\" Ash shouted at them. It was rather generous of him to give them a warning. After that, he spotted the blue roof, and ran right for the Pokemart. He dug his fingers into the earth, and uprooted the building. As before, he smashed his fist into the front. This time he put his lips to the opening and sucked out everything that was inside! The shopkeeper was horrified as he saw a dark cavern before him, as if he was looking into the gates of Hell. A harsh wind blew inside, forcing everything into that black hole, and in seconds, everything was swallowed up! Ash dropped the building and let out a noisy belch! His buffed out arms beefed up even bigger than before, bigger than Mt. Moon! He shot up at least fifty feet, a cocky grin on his face as everything got even further away from him. His abs popped up, each looking like a set of pecs as they surged forth with new found strength. Ash smirked, and flexed every muscle on his body. They swelled right up, making him look twice as big as he really was! Ash looked about the town; it was hardly destroyed! Ash wanted to stick around and mess with the citizens, but there was no telling how close Gary was to Celadon City! Ash settled for quickly stomping a random building before sprinting off tword Mt. Moon. He had actually crushed the fossil museum, little did he know. It was the largest bulding in the town, and made a very satisfying \"CRUNCH\" when it was squished under his foot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked forward at the mountain. There was no time to waste! Ash started to run faster and faster, building up as much speed as he possibly could! He showed no intention of stopping either! Faster, faster, faster, Ash ran, until Mt. Moon was only a dozen steps away, and still he ran!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side, all was silent, before there was a sudden, loud crash! Ash rammed his way right through the mountain! There was a large hole within it for a moment, before it couldn't support the weight and collapsed in on itself! Ash smiled to himself. Never before had he felt so powerful!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash soon arrived in Cerulean City, he ran around a bit, letting his huge feet slap along the ground and crush countless buildings. As he found the PokeMart, he fell right back on his ass, the gargantuan, bubbly muscle crushing everything beneath it's weight. Ash grinned as he tore off the roof of the building, and drank from it. Everything within fell over, and fell into the growing boy's mouth! As soon as he knew it was empty, Ash crushed the building in his hand, grinning at his thickening bicep as he did. He fell on his back, and let out a deep breath, before his growth started to kick on once more! His back flared outward, growing even harder and stronger than it had ever been! His pecs shook and wiggled as they burst forth with even more size than before. Ash let out a chuckle as he just barely felt them hit his chin as he laid down. To top it off, his traps completed his growth, making him the most intimidating, massive man he knew!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh sighed happily to himself, putting his arms behind his head. \"Maybe... A little break won't hurt!\" He smiled happily. He didn't even seem to notice several puny, worthless water Pokemon trying to squirt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did our destructive hero know that not too far away...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash was totally relaxed, lying in the gutted remains of Cerulean City, any attacking Pokemon's water attacks feeling like a painless trickle of water over his massive body which was oddly relaxing~ He was the biggest, strongest man in existence! Nothing and no one could stop him, so why not take it easy? There was nothing that was standing in his way~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter clearing out Celadon, Gary had thought about heading straight to Silph Co. in Saffron City and cleaning out the company that had developed these miracle vitamins but then he had a thought. Ash was probably dinking around in the other cities, completely unaware of Gary's own enormous power. Why not find him and pay him a little visit? With a malicious grin firmly in place, he changed direction from Saffron City and instead retraced his steps, heading back towards Pallet Town. \"There's no way Ashy boy was being subtle.\" Gary thought to himself as he thumped his way back down Route 17. \"He'll have left a trail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as soon as Gary arrived back on the scene in Pallet Town (his former hometown now about the size of his foot), he saw a trail of footprints heading to Viridian City. He followed the prints as they slowly swelled up in size. Gary was rather curious to see how big Ash had ended up getting. He smirked to himself as he flexed his biceps. There was no way he was even close to Gary's size! Of that he was confident~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPewter City was nothing more than a smoking heap of destroyed rubble. The few survivors of Ash's attack looked up in hopelessness as an even greater titan smashed them underfoot, not even noticing as his eyes were trained forward. Puny cities like this that had nothing to offer him were beneath the notice of Gary. Even the proud Mount Moon was nothing but a pile of rocks, the habitat completely destroyed. Gary chuckled as he kicked it over, like a malicious kid playing with an anthill. \"He's still small enough to fit in there? Talk about pathetic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trooped on, Cerulean City appearing on the horizon. Gary cracked his knuckles, grinning widely. Time for some payback!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had noticed Gary's presence ten minutes before he arrived. It had started out subtly. A low rhythmic rumbling in the distance, like thunder. Ash had cracked one eye open to look at the sky, wondering if rain was approaching. The clear blue sky indicated that this was not the case. He shrugged and had gone back to relaxing. Then a loud *BOOM!* had rocked the city, causing Ash to jump up, smashing another building under his enormous junk. He whipped his head around and saw massive boulders crashing around him. The remains of Mount Moon that Gary had kicked up, so much dust to him. Ash slowly got to his feet, the rumbling sound now much more pronounced, more of a constant *Boom, boom, boom*, one after the other. The ground began to shake ominously as a shadow was cast over the city. Ash slowly turned around and gaped up at the grinning face of his rival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Ashy boy! You're looking puny as ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh could only stare up in fear at Gary's hulking form. He stood only as high as the giant's shin, his body stretching hugely above him, his pecs jutting so far out from his body he had to lean over to even begin to see Ash, his mighty biceps bigger and harder than any mountain in existence, covered in thick veins. His abs looked like plates of steel, all arranged perfectly under his paper thin skin, the muscles bulging out so fiercely it was almost like they were trying to break free! His pillar like legs weren't lacking either. Each thigh was bloated to extreme proportions, rubbing against each other even though Gary's legs were apart, his calves were balled up from the exertion of walking and supporting this monumental figure, his feet wide and powerful, capable of reducing any structure in the world, man made or natural, to nothingness! What really made Ash wilt with inadequacy, was Gary's pendulous dick and balls, swaying overhead, thicker, longer, and more virile than Ash's could ever hope to be. His thick, perfectly shaped ass was the icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary put his hands on his hips, his shoulders broadening even further, cutting off all light from reaching Ash, his back flaring out while his traps rose around his neck. Ash was facing a force he had never imagined could exist...A force that should have been him! He clenched his fists and glared up at Gary. \"How did you get so huge?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary chuckled condescendingly and merely moved his foot, pinning Ash underneath it, squeezing his face with his big and second toe. \"What was that?~ I couldn't hear you all the way down there! You're going to have to speak up if you want the great Gary Oak to hear you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh tried to push the toes off his body, but they were too powerful! Everything about Gary was too powerful! Ash wasn't about to give up! He punched the massive digits as hard as he could, his hand throbbing after every hit. Gary laughed harder, his powerful chest jiggling with every breath. \"Oh man! That tickles! Are you trying to hurt me or give me a massage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary lifted his foot off Ash and reached down, wrapping his thick fingers around Ash's body, crushing it slightly in a vice tight grip! Gary raised the doll sized Ash up to his face and grinned at him. \"You made a huge mistake when you tried to outdo me! You're not big, strong, or smart enough to be my equal! But I guess I could always keep you around as my personal slave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! There's no way I'm letting you do that!\" Ash shouted defiantly, struggling in Gary's grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary snickered and said, \"That's cute that you think you can stop me~ Maybe I should give you a front row seat to my ascension! ...Nah, that's too good for you. Besides, no matter where you go, you'll be able to see me grow, bigger and bigger and BIGGER, until I'm towering over this whole country! And after that I'll keep growing! Nothing is going to stand in my way, least of all you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Gary threw Ash against the ground, kicking him once he bounced. Ash went flying away, smashing against the ground, creating a gigantic dent in the ground before sliding to a stop. Gary chuckled and walked over to his rival. \"See? That's just a fraction of my power! Give it up Ashy boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh shakily got to his feet, wincing at how sore his body felt. \"N-Never! Just you wait! I'll...I'll find a way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and ran, heading towards Vermillion City. He had to keep going, had to get bigger than Gary! Gary watched him go with an amused expression. He was confident there was no way Ash could ever outgrow him at this rate. But why take the chances? Besides, a little more fun wouldn't hurt!</span></div></div>",

Gary just shook his head. \"Just you wait, Ashy-boy...\" He said to himself. He flexed his massive arm, watching with a sly smirk as the muscle pumped up bigger. \"Eat all you want, 'coz next time you see me, you're going to be looking at your new god!\" He said with a cocky tone. He then started to take large, earth shaking steps twords Saffron City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Saffron City, everyone had gathered up a defense on the west side of town. After hearing what happened in Celedon, security had really beefed up! But nothing could stop the titanic doom that was heading their way. Just as everything seemed calm, there was a dull \"boom\" in the distance! In a few seconds, there was another! And another! They grew increasingly louder, and soon enough, everone could hear a soft crunch along with it! Just as the footsteps stopped, a dark shadow loomed over even some of the tallest buildings in the city. Everyone looked up and saw the towering teen known as Gary Oak. The man the size of a skyscraper, with muscles easily five time the size that even the biggest bodybuilder would have proportionally! And as he moved through the city, it was like an unstoppable, divine force! Police would shoot their guns up at the teen, Pokemon would unleash their fiercest attacks, but all were like the mere, pathetic attempts of ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary stopped to look down at them, a wicked grin on his face. \"You weak little specks think you can even hurt a god like me!?\" Gary said threateningly. \"I'm going to have to teach you all your place!\" And with that, Gary rose one of his gargantuan feet over a crowd of people. \"Feel my divine wrath!\" He bellowed, before bringing his foot down with unfathomable force! Not only did his foot crush everything beneath it, but it even went a step further and created a large crater in it's place! Gary snickered to himself. \"What's that? You haven't learned your lesson?\" He asked, raising his foot up again. He couldn't even hear the people's fearful cries, as his foot was brought down again with equal force! The giant boy ground his foot into the earth, before pivoting and turning back tword the crown jewel of the city: Sliph Co.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary grinned and cracked his knuckles together. \"Now where to start...?\" He asked himself. Without warning, he suddenly punched a hole in the building, closing his fist in time to catch all the contents! Without a second thought, he shoved it in his mouth, and swallowed! \"Heh... I better eat this entire thing, just to be sure!\" Gary went in for another fistfull, and another! One by one, holes were punched into the building, and one by one, it was slowly disappearing down the man's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout halfway through, as Gary was getting closer to the bottom, he noticed a few delivery trucks! Gary just smirked. \"Better safe than sorry!\" He said to himself. He picked them up between two fingers, and held it like a pill. With minimal effort, he squeezed the little vehicle and popped everything inside into his mouth! Gary swallowed it whole, before going back to the building!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary did all of this, his body had only become more and more massive! His pecs seemed to pulse as they filled with greater power, each of them practically the size of Pallet Town! Gary's entire body seemed to shoot up, his biceps quickly growing until they were the size of mountains! His abs were a long path of rippling abs, each of them easily the size of Ash's pecs, and only growing stronger! Gary's back had flared out, and became a great wall making any and all attacks the miniscule people of Saffron used even more worthless! His traps bumped up, coming closer to engulfing his head! Gary laughed as he filled his growing mouth with more and more of the pills! \"Nngfh... Yeah...! Bigger!\" He grunted with his mouth full. His ass was sticking out, with all it's glorious size, almost looking like a set of pecs themselves! On the other side, Gary's manhood had grown so large, it was almost like he has sprouted a third leg! It was practically as beefy and thick as his thighs were! As for Gary's thighs, they were rippling with muscle, and every breath seemed to help pump them even bigger! Gary's had grown so tall now, at least ten times his former size, that his calves reached up as high as the skyscrapers! As Gary finished up the last of the building, his feet crushed what little surrounding businesses were left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary looked as far down as he could and grinned. The city that had once made him feel like a Godzilla was now like a puddle beneath his feet! And that was saying something, considering that Saffron City was the largest city in all of Kanto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, you pathetic bugs! You've just made your god even stronger!\" Gary bent forward and flexed all his muscles at once! Every little muscle practically doubled in size, bulging out over the town. \"You can't even imagina how good it feels to be this fucking powerful!\" Gark said in a low, gutteral grunt. \"Thanks for everything, losers! Smell 'ya later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose were Gary's final words to the town, before he stomped it out with his foot, making sure that only a big hole was left! \"Heh... Feels so damn good...\" He said to himself, rubbing his hand over his pecs. \"I'm so powerful... And just look at this beautiful body...\" He muttered, flexing his immesurably arms. \"Ash would be like an ANT on this GODLY physique!\" He mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there was one thing left to do...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As thoughts of Ash drifted through his mind, Gary thought briefly of seeking his rival out and showing him just who was really boss...but then he flexed his enormous biceps again and realized that Ash would be a pathetic little bug on his muscle. He could flick him off the top of his bicep and catch him on his forearm and with a single flex, smash his puny body to mush! Where was the challenge? Where was the challenge? Where was the fun? Ash was merely a single step above these worthless germs that were known as the human race. The word \"Rival\" assumed a kind of equality between the two people who were competing against each other. Ash was no equal and therefore no longer a rival to the mountainous teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...Yeah...Ash is nothing to me now! I could crush him just by walking!\" He said out loud, his voice bellowing for miles like thunder. \"This whole place is fucking useless to me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached up his foot and stomped again and again on the remains of Saffron, creating a massive crater, the shockwaves of the stomps radiating out from his gigantic foot, knocking buildings down that were dozens of miles away, enormous cracks appearing in the earth around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn! It's so easy to destroy this place!\" Gary said, laughing as he bounced his mammoth pecs. \"Hey! You tiny little shits want a close up view of these huge pecs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe groped his chest, hefting his swollen chest with a self pleasing groan, taking a deep breath so that his pecs expanded in his big hands. \"Aw yeah~ Get a load of these!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Gary slowly let himself fall forward, his gigantic chest making contact with the ground first, practically creating a sonic boom as the thick muscles collided with the dirt, trees, and villages, his titanic nipple crushing a small village flat! With an evil laugh, the cruel god stuck out his enormous hands and started smashing cities like he was playing a game, his enormous digits digging deep rivulets in the ground, turning the once proud metropolises into muddy craters!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Gary noticed that he had landed with his face hovering above a single, terrified looking Trainer. The barely distinguishable speck had survived the earth shattering fall of Gary and was now too afraid to even move! Gary grinned wickedly down at him and stuck his tongue out, lapping the tiny human up like he was a crumb on the merciless god's table! Gary slowly got to his feet again, carelessly brushing the detritus from his otherwise immaculate body, glancing out to the ocean. \"Don't think I \"visited\" Cinnibar yet. Better fix that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began walking to the coast, making sure to step down as hard as he could, untold destruction and devastation the only things remaining in his wake! When he reached the coast, he walked easily into the ocean, the water barely able to conceal any part of his body. By the time the tiny island, his chest was still above water! He grinned down at the miniscule people scurrying about in panic on the island and lifted his hand up, his gigantic fingers rising out of the water all around the island, water cascading down them, flooding areas of the island. With no effort whatsoever, Gary picked the island up in his palm and brought it up to his face, licking his lips as he did so. \"Sorry bugs! But I'm a growing boy~ And growing boys nee to EAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that word, he lifted the island above his head and dropped it into his open maw, saliva pooling on his tongue, helping the island to float on what was their new god's personal ocean. Gary moaned a little, the sound erupting from the back of his throat like the cries of the damned from the gates of Hell! With a look of pure bliss on his face, Gary swallowed the island whole, tracking the bulge in his throat until it disappeared behind his chest. Gary slapped his chest with a grin, a small burp popping out of his mouth. \"I don't know, there wasn't anything really cinnamon tasting about you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and rubbed his abs, turning to head back to Kanto proper. When the water was around his waist, he got an idea. He bent over and began to take water into his mouth, sucking up countless water Pokemon, fisherman, and swimmers, his cheeks puffing out hugely. When his mouth was as full as it could get, he continued his trek back to Kanto. He put his hands on his hips and gazed out over the destruction he had caused. With a careless slap of both hands against his cheeks, a veritable tsunami of water blasted over the land, flooding more than half of it,the craters filling up where Gary had stomped particularly aggressively. The sight amused Gary to no end, laughter echoing over the plights of the tortured citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't feel too bad Kanto.\" Gary said, walking carelessly over the ravaged land. \"You ARE the birthplace of Gary Oak, your new god! Just think! What I'm going to do to the OTHER regions will be even worse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a dark chuckle,  Gary began to make his way to the neighboring Hoenn region, the poor citizens completely unaware of the hell that was swiftly approaching them!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash was running as fast as he could, trying to make his way to Vermilion City. Gary followed him, strolling along like it was nothing! Ash grit his teeth at Gary's sheer arrogance. How he wasn't even trying to keep up with him! That should have been him! That should have been what HE was doing! The anger within him spurred him onward in his goal to surpass his rival!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh arrived in Vermillion City in just a few seconds. The port town laid out before him, the sun just beginning to set on this day. Ash stood there for a moment, looking all around the town for the Pokemart as soon as he could. There was no time to be messing around and showing off to citizens! As soon as Ash spotted the blue roof, he made a dash for it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, just as the building was in reach, there was a loud crash! Gary tackled Ash to the ground, squashing him under his magnificent body. \"Look what I found! Ashy boy just laying down on the job!\" He laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Get off of me you enormous freak!\" Ash called out from under him, pushing away at Gary's thick pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enormous... And don't you forget it!\" Gary grinned, putting all his weight on top of Ash. Ash winced in pain, before Gary sat up and straddled the boy. He flexed down at him, grinning all the while, but Ash couldn't see that; Gary's handsome face was blocked off by his bulging pecs! \"You see all this size?! All this hugeness!? You could only DREAM of having muscles like mine!\" Gary taunted. He bent forward and pressed his pecs into Ash's puny face. \"You feel those?\" Gary asked, before giving them a hard bounce, which whacked Ash right in his face! \"This is what a REAL man looks like!\" He smirked. \"You're just a worthless little bug compared to me! In fact, how about you call me god from now on!?\" Gary said with an arrogant smile. \"If you do, I promise I won't squish you under my foot when I get even BIGGER!\" He then let out a long laugh. Ash just whined under Gary's immense weight on top of him. Nothing compared to having such unquestionable power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary's laughter continued, he could feel Ash starting to wiggle beneath him. As he bent over to look, he saw Ash reaching out, his fingers juuuuust coming short of touching the PokeMart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? And what do you think you're doing?\" Gary asked with a smile. Just then, he grabbed up the PokeMart which was easily within in reach and held it high above Ash, who was still on the ground. \"You want this? Heh, well too bad!\" Gary grinned. Ash's heart sank as he was now forced to watch Gary toss the entire building into his mouth and chew it up to pieces. There was a thick lump in his throat that seemed to travel slowly down, past his chest and into his stomach. Gary started to laugh once more, but soon stopped as he let out a soft grunt. Ash's nightmares had been realized, as Gary now started to expand even BIGGER on top of him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh could see Gary's thighs, which were easily three times the size of the S.S. Anne, getting even larger around him! His hips could feel Gary's immense calves bulking up, and stretching out even further, as he was sure Gary's monsterous feet were getting in on this increase! He looked up and saw the wall of abs getting even higher and higher above him, each one like steel bars that taunted him with their boundless strength! Gary's arms started to fill out even larger, the mountainous arms growing even beefier and thicker as Ash was forced to watch! Gary's face quickly vanished behind his pecs, which jutt out even further from his chest, inflating and looking even bigger with every breath he took! Ash's view of the action was quickly cut out, as Gary's lengthening cock soon stretched out over Ash's face, giving the tiny trainer a full smell of Gary's musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary lifted one of his heavy arms and gave it a slow flex. He treasured the slow motion of it swelling up, bigger and bigger, as a thick vein emerged on the top. He reached over, and gave it a slooooow self-absorbed lick. \"Heh... So fucking massive...\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"G-Gary!\" Ash shouted up from under Gary's dick. Gary just smirked and bounced his pecs proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh grow up, Ashy boy! What are you, five years old?! Who's gonna stop me from talking how I damn well please!?\" He replied to his rival. Ash just gulped. It's not like it had never crossed his mind, but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gary was busy admiring himself, Ash realized there was only one thing he could really do at this point. If he were to... <i>Please</i> his rival, there was no doubt he'd be left weak for a few moments, and Ash could escape! Or at least all the liquid would help his squeeze right out from under his colossal rival! Then he could make it to Saffron City and swipe a few pills there! It was a big town, there had to be a lot there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few short seconds...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash knew he had no other choice. The best chance of escape, possibly his only salvation, lay in front of him, thick, veiny, and bigger than life. Gary's cock twitched just above his face. Gary seemed to be getting turned on by his latest growth spurt and who wouldn't be? His body was a masterpiece, each muscle pumped to the extreme, and yet looking perfectly proportionate on the teen's body. Ash could feel his jealousy burning deep within. That should be his body! He wanted Gary's body for himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he decided to swallow his pride and stick out his tongue, running it over Gary's smooth dick head. The skin was surprisingly soft and supple, while the taste wasn't half bad. Ash had been expecting a putrid taste to invade his mouth and make him nearly gag, making the experience that much worse. There was a definite taste of musk and sweat but it wasn't overwhelming. It seemed to complement the natural taste of Gary's body. The only thing hard about this was the fact that he was condescending to his rival. But Ash would give an ounce of worship now if it meant a pound of worshiping for himself later!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary let out a deep, rumbling moan as he felt Ash suddenly start licking his monstrous cock. Gary almost fell backwards, shocked that Ash would suddenly, without any warning, start to do something like this! He leaned forward and licked his lips, watching Ash wrap his arms around the flaccid, but hardening, organ and lick it all over, really going to town on it! Gary wiggled his toes, snickering as his rival submitted to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right Ashy boy~ Show your god how devoted you are~ Good to see you're finally coming to your-A-Ah!-senses~\" He said, his voice lilting slightly as pleasure shot through his body in waves and pulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh growled to himself, wanting to give the soft skin in front of him a good bite, but he knew that would certainly mean punishment, if not outright death! Ash could feel himself lifting off the ground, a thrill of hope suddenly running through him. He could escape now! Gary's dick had hardened to the point that it was starting to stick straight out! This hope was quickly extinguished as Gary slammed his organ back down on top of Ash, pinning him in the dirt. \"Ah, ah, ah! Don't think you're going to get away that easily! Get back to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn! This really was his only way out! Ash grit his teeth and kept at it, his tongue bathing Gary's dick with his saliva. Gary groaned in pleasure, rubbing his thick pecs, tweaking his nipple slightly as Ash worked. He had never experienced anything quite like this before! Like any boy his age he had experimented with himself, but having another person doing it for him was a pleasure he didn't know had existed! He pressed his dick down harder on Ash, wanting more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster!\" He urged, panting slightly, his beast now engorged to the max, thick veins supplying a steady flow of blood, his balls pulsing and churning as they began to produce cum. Ash was disgusted as a glob of precum landed on his face. He licked it off and was once again surprised by the taste. It wasn't as bad as he thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the hold up?\" Gary growled, glaring down at Ash. \"Keep going! I need more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had managed to get his arms free when Gary's dick had first started hardening, allowing him to wrap his arms around the hot organ, moving them up and down the shaft, stimulating his rival further. Gary let out an even bigger moan, his body swaying slightly as Ash worked. His breathing was starting to become heavier, his magnificent chest heaving as Ash stuck his face in the slit, licking all over the urethra, pushing Gary over the edge! With a primal grunt, his whole body tensing up, Gary unleashed a flood of cum all over Ash, a pool of the thick, ropy substance forming around his body, partially hiding him from view. Gary fell back onto his ass, his face clearly showing how much he had enjoyed Ash's little performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad...for a first time~\" Gary said, smirking down at Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't answer. Gary rolled his eyes and bent over, searching through his cum. \"Where is he...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few minutes to discover that Ash wasn't there at all! He quickly got to his feet, only to suffer a head rush, falling back down onto his ass and causing the ground to split and warp, Vermillion City's remains falling into a particularly big crevice, never to be seen again. Gary cursed in frustration, getting to his feet more slowly this time. After a brief bit of searching, he noticed a trail of his cum heading away into the distance...right towards Saffron City!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit! That little...he tricked me!\" Gary growled to himself, anger etched into every inch of his expression and posture. He took a few unsteady steps, his legs still feeling a bit numb after Ash's ministrations. \"Damn...he is really good at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary felt himself blush a little in spite of himself. He hadn't been expecting Ash of all people to be the first person to make him feel that way...and yet...it didn't bother him that much either. It had felt \"right\" somehow that Ash do that for him. Gary quickly shook his head and started walking towards Saffron City. The only reason he felt that way was because he was a god and Ash was a puny little slave! Of <i>course</i> he should do that kind of stuff to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you wait Ash...\" Gary muttered to himself. \"I'm not about to let you get away with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nAsh was running as fast as his huge legs would allow, trampling routes, trees, rocks, and anything else that got in his way as he ran towards Saffron City. This was his big chance! He wasn't going to waste it! Gary would only be incapacitated for a minute or so at best. He would move at least three times as fast as Ash could as well! Ash glanced behind him and half expected to see Gary's intimidating figure looming behind him. He shook his head and charged onward, Saffron City appearing on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was taking his sweet time getting to Saffron. He had the distinct feeling that Ash would head straight for the Poke Mart, take the pills there, and move on to the next town. There was no way that Ash would think of looking in the Silph Co. building. Why should he? He didn't know they had developed the vitamins! Gary admired his newly grown body as he walked after Ash, loving how strong and heavy he felt! The whole ground trembled as he walked over it, as though fearful of his massive feet! He wanted to just keep growing and growing, until the whole world acknowledged him as their god! And who was to say he'd be satisfied even then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary could soon see Saffron City in the distance. He grinned and picked up his pace a little bit. The only question was, would Ash still be there?</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Gary finally arrived in Saffron City, there was no Ash to be found! The first thing that Gary <i>did</i> notice, however, was that there was no longer a PokeMart in town! Gary snickered as he looked onward. The tiny little Sliph Co. building remained untouched by giant hands, and that was more than enough to satisfy Gary. His eyes forward, he began his first onimous step forward, shaking the entire city as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Ash had fled to Lavender Town. Out of all the cities left in Kanto, there were only three towns that remained: Lavender Town, Fushia City, and finally, Cinnabar Island. If Ash could managed to take all three of those, then, as far as he knew, he just might stand a chance against Gary!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash arrived in the quiet town, not much of a commotion was made. Lavender Town was one of the most quiet and underpopulated locations in all of Kanto. Ash got a few screams here and there, but even so, it wasn't much. He just smiled. This was going to be an easy job! He strolled right over to the PokeMart, easily finding it within seconds, and picked it right up as if it was a can of soda. He then gave the building a squeezed it tight until the top popped right off! He then brought it to his lips, and drank the contetns right out! Afterward, he crushed the building in his hand, and grinned as he felt his body shoot up a few fifty feet, and felt his muscles bulge out, pushing even harder against himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash finished, he felt something sharp at his shoulder. Looking over, there was nothing there. Then, as he looked forward again, he saw a tiny speck in front of him. He squinted a little, trying to see just what it was! It took a moment, but Ash soon identified it as a Haunter! Ash just got a cocky smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want!? Come to see this chiseled body?\" Ash asked arrogantly. Just then, the Haunter did something that seemed oddly familiar. From it's mouth, it pulled out a bomb! And in a few short seconds, that bomb exploded! Ash was left confused for a moment, befor eit finally hit him! \"O-Oh! Hey! You're not just some Haunter, you're MY Haunter!\" He said, a smile on his face. \"But what are you doing here?\" Ash asked the little guy. Haunter was motioning something, but at his size, Ash couldn't really make it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a dark cloud loomed in. Ash flinched a little, looking up at the clouds. \"H-Hey! What are you doing!?\" He demanded to know. But Haunter didn't answer. It just kept doing it's strange little dance. A bolt of lighting rained down, just missing Ash! \"Hey! Watch it!\" He warned. Another bolt came crashing down, but this time, it hit Lavender Tower! The entire building seemed to glow yellow for a second, before then turning an eerie blue. Suddenly, one by one, countless spirits of various Pokemon started to emerge from the tower, all of them forming a huge cloud! Ash clenched his fist, preparing for the worst! Just then, a bolt struck Ash, and at that very instant, all the ghosts charged right at him! But they weren't attacking... No, in fact, Ash was feeling even more power beginning to course through his veins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's frown immediately became a smile. As the countless spirits entered him, he felt unquestionable power filling him. His pecs shout out from his chest, the sudden growth nearly pushing him back on his ass! Ash's arms started swelling up to an immesurable size, much like his rival's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-More!\" Ash begged, \"Don't stop! Make me even bigger!\" He demanded. The spirits weren't one's to disappoint! As more charged into him, his traps pumped up even bigger, slowly looking like they might engulf his head! His abs pushed out even further, becoming a deep, cut washboard that was stronger than diamonds! Ash's thighs exploded with boundless power, to which his calves quickly followed. His feet pushed everything aside, all of Lavender Town easily able to be crushed by his foot! Ash cackled in sheer pleasure as he kept getting filled bigger and stronger and beefier! His manhood grew longer and thicker, looking a little more like a third leg in the process!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it slowed to a stop, Ash slammed his foot to the ground, leaving a huge crater the whole area!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" He laughed, \"I'm at least twice as big as Gary was!\" He grinned, looking at his pecs. He started to bounce them laughing at how heavy they now felt. Ash saw a tiny dot in front of one of his eyes. He assumed it to be Haunter. \"Thanks a ton, little guy!\" He laughed, \"I really owe you for this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ash could say any more, even Haunter entered his body, giving Ash one last little shot of power. Ash laughed triumphantly. \"Just you wait Gary! I'm gonna pay you back for what happened in Vermillion City!\" The young man then cracked his knuckles. \"But first... Why not take out the other few towns too?\" Ash let out a dark chuckle. \"You won't have a prayer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Ash began making his way to Fushia City.</span></div></div>",

He didn't want to miss Fuchsia City, especially since the building would be around pill size at this point. Any part of Kanto could be easily reached by the colossus Ash had become in just a few steps! His strides covered miles in a single step! His feet alone could crush entire cities! He hadn't felt this confident in awhile and it REALLY felt good! Of course those good feelings came to a screeching halt when he noticed a rather enormous foot standing in the midst of Fuchsia City. His eyes traveled up the well muscled legs, past the gigantic cock that put all others (except his own) to shame, over the deep road of eight pack abs and up above the massive chest to finally rest on the face of Gary, grinning at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! How did you get so huge so fast?!\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary walked over and tapped his finger against Ash's forehead. \"Think about it Ashy boy~ Where do you think those vitamins were manufactured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh had a blank look on his face for a few seconds before he managed to put two and two together. He groaned and slapped his cheek. \"Silph Co.! How could I have been so stupid?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary chuckled and clapped his hand on Ash's shoulder. \"Don't sweat it, we a make mistakes! You made another one by walking too slow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe popped a small object into his mouth, clearly the Fuchsia Poke Mart, and swallowed it,  his body surging higher until he was a head taller than Ash, approximately the same heights they normally were in comparison to each other. Ash moaned and said, \"So that leaves just Cinnabar Island then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly!\" Gary said, grabbing Ash by the shoulder, stopping him from running off. \"There are other places that have vitamins! Silph Co. ships to more than just the Kanto region you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh blinked before grinning a rather evil grin. He half turned and looked at Gary suspiciously. \"Why would you tell me something like that? Is this some kind of trap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary shook his head, chuckling as he did. \"Still the same old Ash! Why would I do something like that? I'm merely extending the hand of good will. I mean...look at us! We're gods to these puny mortals! Why should we fight amongst ourselves when we can be ruling over them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh scratched his cheek and said, \"Yeah, I get what you mean, but come on! If one of us eats all the vitamins he'll get a LOT bigger than if we both grow! I know you want that for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I did.\" Gary said. \"At the beginning. But things are different now! Don't you think it'd be lonely at the top?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh hadn't really thought about it before. He had been so focused on getting bigger and beating Gary he hadn't though of what would happen when it would all be over. Maybe it would be more fun to have an equal, someone to talk to and joke around with, to help play with and torture the humans below them. They may have been rivals, but they had had their moments together. Ash had a feeling that Gary was being sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, if you don't trust me than take Cinnabar Island for yourself! I won't even stop you!\" Gary said, crossing his arms and staring down at Ash. \"That should bring us up to equal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh, still feeling suspicious, said, \"Okay...but you go first! I don't want you walking behind me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary sighed but did as Ash asked, leading the way to the small island off the coast. Just as they reached the shores of Kanto, Gary threw his arm out, stopping Ash from stepping into the ocean. \"Don't do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Ash asked, gripping Gary's arm tightly, ready for a fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're so huge going into the water will make tidal waves that'll sink the island!\" Gary said. \"Just reach out and grab it! It's not that far off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Right.\" Ash said, getting down on his hands and knees and reaching out into the ocean, grabbing the whole island in his hand. Shrugging, he pushed it into his mouth, swallowing it whole. When he stood back up, he was staring at Gary straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! Now do you trust me?\" Gary asked, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look at me like that!\" Ash said, pointing at Gary. \"Would you be so trusting of me if I came out of the blue and said these things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Guess not.\" Gary admitted, sighing. \"Well what's it going to take for you to trust me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh rubbed his chin as the thought about it. What exactly COULD Gary do to prove he was sincere? He had already given up a Poke Mart to Ash with absolutely no fuss or fight. That in and of itself was pretty impressive! Gary was starting to look impatient, shifting from foot to foot. He had been thinking of Ash, their situation, and dwelling on those feelings he had felt when Ash had serviced him. The more he thought about it, the more guilty he felt about subjugating Ash. It somehow didn't feel right. He was offering Ash this one chance to stop the fighting but if the trainer refused, he was going to go all out and make Ash regret he had ever turned down his offer! But he kept these thoughts to himself, trying to keep a neutral expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ash said, \"Okay, I've done a lot of thinking and I'll trust you on one condition, take it or leave it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary rolled his eyes but said, \"That depends. What's the condition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh grinned a little sheepishly and said</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In mere seconds, Ash arrived in Fushia City! The entire city was drowned by the titanic kid's shadow! He grinned, looking down. \"Hah! I can't even see this puny town past these monsters!\" Ash said flexing his pecs, loving how the hit up against his chin with every flex! The colossus of a boy reached down, digging his fingers down into the sides of the ground! Ash began to grunt, as he slowly uprooted the entire city out of the ground! He rose it high above his head, and without remose, crushed it into his mouth! All the buldings, all the people, everything quickly disappeared down the power-hungry Ash's gullet! Ash licked his lips once it was all gone, his fingers trailing down his throat as he swallowed it all! \"Mmm... Not bad!\" He said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Ash's dismay, he had grown so huge, so powerful, that such a small dose of vitamins didn't make him much bigger! His chest only pushed out a few feet, which wasn't much on his gargantuan form. Ash's abs were a little more tight, his biceps were a little more bulky, but overall, there wasn't a huge difference... This made Ash frown. He would just have to go to the last remaining town in Kanto and finish it off before ruling over the land!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his head to the sea, Ash began to swim out to Cinnabar Island. There wasn't much there, so Ash went in with low hopes. If it wasn't for his dumb rival Gary getting in the way, he would be twice, no, THREE times bigger than he already was! The thought alone was giving Ash a little twitch in his pants. He swam just a little bit faster, anxious to get to Cinnabar! He'd finish them off, then finish off Gary, and then nothing would stand in his way! Why settle for being the Pokemon master when you could be the master of the entire world!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh came in, charging at the island like a Sharpedo! The only people who could spot the boy in time were those at the docks, and even then, they couldn't do anything to stop him! Ash, as he swam on, opened his mouth wide! Water poured in, and it became clear that he planned on gulping down Cinnabar in one fell swoop! Panic shortly ensued, but it was not to last. In mere seconds, the skies were covered by the roof of Ash's mouth! In seconds, his bottom set of teeth were carving away at the base of the island, breaking it off so it could slide right into his mouth! As Ash reached the end, his mouth closed shut with a \"click!\" He stood upright in the water, and his teeth began to mash the city up into a mush that was easy for him to swallow. It all slowly eased into his throat, even the lava which felt no hotter than soup to him! He kept swallowing the entire island until he gulped down the last bit, which was just a little bit crunchy from all the rocks. As Ash had a cocky little smirk on his face, his body took in the last of the nutrients, adding just a little bit more size onto his already beyond massive size! Ash smiled, and made the short trip back to Pallet Town, which was no bigger than a speck of dirt to the young god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash arrived back at Pallet...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash's god like body loomed over the countryside, reaching almost every corner of the region, the fruits of his labors evident. The entire region of Kanto had been stomped, crushed, dug up, smashed, reshaped, and touched in some significant way by either Ash or Gary in their quest to ascend from mere humans into the god like beings they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...as I am anyway!\" Ash thought to himself, cockily flexing a bicep that would put Mt. Moon to utter and total shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh leaned forward slightly and chuckled darkly to himself, noticing the pathetic little dirt splat that was Pallet Town situated next to his gigantic big toe. With a simple shift that colossal toe was hovering over the miniscule village. Just by relaxing his body and letting the toe fall to the ground, without exerting any force at all, Ash could wipe out his hometown in an instant. It amused him to think that the place where he had lived, grown up, and dreamed his dreams was now less than a speck of dust to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always knew I'd outgrow this place,\" he said with a childish grin. \"I just never dreamed it would be THIS much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to crush Pallet Town without another thought (all the pills had long since been consumed there rendering it pointless to the god teen) when he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. What he had taken to be nothing more than some random ditches, no doubt made during one of his many struggles with Gary, Ash now saw for what they were: letters! Someone had left some kind of message here! Standing back, Pallet Town now unintentionally saved, Ash could easily read the message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gary was here, Ash is a loser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh immediately clenched his fists when he realized what he had just read. \"That stupid Gary! He's still treating me like I'm some stupid kid! Well I'll show him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had taken about ten steps to the north when he realized that he had no idea where Gary was or where he had gone. He backtracked to the message, hoping to get a clue. Looking around the initial message, Ash could see a much smaller, more carefully hidden message among the much bigger, more noticeable one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the bugs who are still alive, be thankful! I'm heading to Johto to get even bigger and stronger! Looks like you lucked out! Don't get too comfortable though! Keep your eyes on the skies! Gary Oak is a rising star and soon he'll be visible from every point on the planet! Get ready to bow down to your new god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh growled as he read this message. Obviously Gary had wanted to strike fear into the populace of the world without giving away his position and plans to Ash. He no doubt had expected Ash to read the big message, get angry, and immediately leave to search Kanto for him. It was pure luck that Ash had now found out Gary's true plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he thinks he's going to be god of this place than he's got another thing coming!\" Ash announced out loud, mostly to himself, but also transmitting his own message to the insignificant humans down below. \"Ash Ketchum is the one who's going to be god of this world! You'd better get ready Gary! When I find you, I'm not holding back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ash's thunderous foot steps began to grow faint in the distance, the titanic teenager heading for Johto, the remaining citizens all over Kanto shakily came out from hiding. They didn't dare believe they were safe, so long as Gary and Ash were roaming the world, growing ever larger and stronger. They knew that something had to be done and yet nothing COULD be done. These boys were capable of reducing their world to rubble, capable of devouring entire islands and stomping out cities in a single step! While a good portion of the remaining population turned to despair, simply looking up and waiting for the inevitable end, others created two new \"religions\" around Ash and Gary, each group seeking to support one or the other, praying that when the time of ascension came for one of the boys, they would be shown mercy. It was a futile hope, as Ash and Gary were now both only concerned with growing and subjugating the other, their former equals in the human race now as far beneath their notice as ants. Still, there wasn't much else they could do. Time would soon decide their fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kanto struggled to find purpose in this new world, Ash continued trekking to Johto, carelessly crushing human and Pokemon alike, cities and lakes, rivers and forests and mountains under his massive feet, his eyes trained grimly ahead of him, seeking only Johto and Gary. It didn't take long for him to reach the border between the two regions. The building that had once marked the border was now nothing more than a pile of rubble in a massive foot print, the print just slightly smaller than Ash's own. Ash felt a slight ripple of fear, a feeling he quickly suppressed. Judging by this footprint, Gary was at least nearly of equal size to him. Depending on how long he had been in Johto, he could still be around that size or have gotten even bigger. Ash was truly traveling into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the monumental Pokemon trainer approached Cherrygrove City...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cilan let out a sigh as he entered the kitchen at the end of the day. He had been rushing back and forth in the Gym all day, alternating serving and battling trainers. Today had been particularly busy it seemed like! Not to mention all the trainers that had challenged him had been less than skillful. All of them with big egos and not a single scrap of talent. He was starting to regret this little vacation he was taking from his journey with Ash and Iris. His brothers had practically begged him to come back and he was starting to see why...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew! Another day done!\" Chili said happily, kicking the door to the kitchen open. \"Man, it's days like this that make me love my job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan laughed uneasily, a drop of sweat running down his cheek. \"Are you serious? I can't remember such a busy day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili ruffled Cilan's hair playfully and said, \"That's just because you've been gone for so long! When you're only cooking for three people without any kind of pressure you start getting soft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCress walked in at this moment, tossing his hair lightly with one hand. \"Is our dear brother having trouble readjusting to the restaurant slash Gym business?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili let out a little groan and said, \"Please don't actually say \"slash\" out loud like that. It's really weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCress chuckled and ruffled Chili's hair playfully. \"Don't get so overexcited. Save that energy for tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan sighed and said, \"It's going to be just as bad tomorrow isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fraid so bro!\" Chili said, pumping his fist into the air. \"So you'd better get some sleep and make sure you're back here pronto tomorrow morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this Chili ran off, heading to his room. Cress shook his head and walked to the door, stopping briefly at it and turning to look back at Cilan. \"Don't feel too bad Cilan. There's a reason we called you back here. It's the busy season and things are going to be hectic until at least Friday. Think you can hold out until then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan saluted wearily and said, \"Well, I'll do my best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCress opened the door slightly before freezing in place, an idea forming in his head. \"Actually...I think I might be able to help you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his way over to a cupboard and opened it, pulling out a small brown packet. He tossed it to Cilan who clumsily caught it. \"What's this?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCress shrugged and said, \"One of our customers left it behind. I think it's supposed to be some kind of energy supplement or a stimulant of some kind. Try mixing it in some water tomorrow and see if doesn't give you a boost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan tucked the packet into his shirt pocket and said, \"I might as well! I'm willing to try anything at this point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCress patted Cilan gently on the shoulder and said, \"Get some sleep. I'm sure you'll do fine tomorrow~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he left, leaving Cilan alone in the kitchen. He wearily turned off a light and headed to his room. He wasted no time in stripping out of his clothes, catching a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He looked so...thin! He put his hands on his hips, wearing nothing but a pair of briefs, and looked himself over. His arms were twiggy and you could practically see his ribs! The only thing that looked fit at all was his legs, no doubt from the constant walking. \"You'd think my arms would be a little thicker from all the lifting and carrying I do!\" Cilan said indignantly, tilting his head. \"Maybe I wouldn't get tired so fast if I had some more muscle! Hmm...Maybe I should start training?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again and finished changing into his pajamas. A small smile turned up the corner of his lips as he crawled into bed. If there was one thing that Cilan loved about being home, it was being able to sleep in a comfortable, soft bed! He fell asleep almost as soon as his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn what seemed like seconds, Chili was kicking the door open, standing in the door frame of Cilan's room, shirtless, having only half dressed himself before coming to wake Cilan up. \"Hey! Get your butt up Cilan! We've got a long day ahead of us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan groaned and sat up, blinking blearily at Chili. Cilan's mouth fell open slightly as he saw Chili standing there. His body was practically the exact opposite of Cilan's! His chest was full, his pecs slightly rounded while there was the faintest hint of abs on his stomach. His arms were slightly thick as well, his biceps pretty well developed. Since when was Chili in such good shape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili grinned and said, \"Hey, I know I look good bro, but if you keep staring at me like that I'm going to think you're interested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan immediately blushed and said, \"S-Sorry! I'll be down in...f-five minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili nodded and immediately left. Cilan sighed yet again, feeling even more dejected about his body and his performance. His eyes landed on the little packet on his desk...Without a second thought he got up, ripped open the packet and dumped it into a glass. He filled up the glass with cold water and mixed it up with a spoon. \"Well...here's to hoping!\" Cilan said gulping down the water in three big chugs! Almost immediately he felt a surge of energy! \"Wow! This stuff works fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new spring in his step he began to dress himself, ready for the day ahead!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cilan was like a new man! Moving from table to table, he served everyone in record time! Cress looked a little shocked at how well Cilan was doing before smiling slightly. \"Guess that stimulant is really working after all.\" He went back into the kitchen to keep cooking. Chili was a lot less surprised. He had a big grin on his face as he kept to his own side of the restaurant. The boys usually split the shift into three parts. One in the kitchen, one in the first half of the restaurant and one in the back half. Cress was currently in the kitchen while Chili was in the front and Cilan was in the back. After a few hours they would all switch, continuing on until they closed up. While he was heading back to the kitchen, Chili slapped Cilan on the back and said, \"Keep it up bro! You're doing amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan blushed a little and rubbed the back of his head. \"Thanks a lot Chili!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rubbed the back of his head he couldn't help but notice that his sleeve felt strangely tight...He looked curiously at his arm, turning it over slightly. It didn't SEEM to be any different...Before he could investigate any further, people were calling out to him. Cilan quickly went back to work, now able to be his usually smiling, positive self now that he was back to his normal operating speed. Everything seemed to be completely normal until Cilan was setting down two plates at a table. Over the last few hours his clothes had been feeling increasingly tight, making it harder and harder for him to move around properly. He had been so busy, Cilan hadn't really been able to do anything about it. However, when he had set down the plates, there was a dull popping sound, followed by a PING as the top button on his shirt suddenly popped off, smacking one of the customers in the face! Cilan gasped and said, \"Oh! I'm so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man rubbed his head with a groan, looking Cilan up and down with an angry expression. He looked like he was about to chew him out before thinking better of it for some reason. \"It's...fine. Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan bowed a little and said, \"I'll bring you something to make up for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan rushed into the back of the kitchen, turning to Cress. \"Cress? Can you plate a dessert please? I accidentally hurt one of the customers...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How did you...woah!\" Cress said, sounding and looking completely shocked. \"Cilan...what happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Cilan said, looking down at himself. His eyes widened in shock as he saw his arms, once thin little sticks, now bulging with muscle, straining the sleeves to the breaking point! He looked down and saw his chest extending out in front of him, blocking out most of the view of the rest of his body, ovals of flesh visible between the straining buttons. He loosened the bow tie around his thick neck, now noticing that it was getting harder to breathe. His hands ran down his body, touching his once flat stomach, now cobbled with a tight six pack, his shirt now untucked from his pants. Speaking of which, his thighs were threatening to break through the material of the pants, his calves causing similar damage lower on his legs. His shoes felt quite tight as well, his bigger feet stuffed inside shoes now too small for him. Even his ass had grown, filling out the back of his pants, showing of just a little bit of his ass. His bulge had increased in size as well, the waistband of the pants cutting into his skin. \"I...I don't know what happened to me!\" Cilan said honestly. \"I hadn't even noticed that I had changed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...\" Cress sighed and said, \"Alright, that's not important. Just...I'm not sure if you can still work looking like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can still work!\" Cilan said, not wanting to let his brothers down. \"Just...let me keep going for awhile! I'll show you I can still work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCress looked nervous about letting Cilan back out there but eventually sighed and said, \"Alright. I wouldn't let you do this if we weren't so busy but we don't really have much of a choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly plated a dessert and handed it to Cilan. The green haired waiter suddenly realized that he had gotten taller too, his head rising above Cress' own. He smiled a little at this, though he wasn't really sure why he was pleased. It just felt...nice that he was bigger than Cress. He quickly rushed out into the restaurant proper and and handed the plate to the still slightly annoyed customer. \"Here you are! Sorry for the trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man blushed slightly and said, \"T-Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cilan continued working he was starting to notice the looks he was getting from man and woman alike. It helped that his clothes were practically painted on, showing off every curve and bulge of his muscular body. He blushed slightly but his smile never left his face. He was enjoying the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more hours into the shift, however, something changed...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the breakfast wave merged into the lunch wave, the boys kept hard at work! Every now and again, Cress had to return to the kitchen to help out the chefs, while Cilan and Chili were on constant host duty. Cilan was finding his job getting slowly easier as time went on! His arms bulked up just a little more, making his sleeves feel tight! A few more buttons of his shirt had popped off, and gave everyone a little peek at his pecs. He couldn't tuck in his shirt anymore since had shot up like bamboo! It left people with a little extra peek at his abs! Cilan continued on his business, getting food to customers much faster, and when they had challenges from trainers, the sight of the muscled Cilan sent the newbie trainers running! At least it gave the guys a little more time to attest to the customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things went on though, there was one person who was a little less than pleased with Cilan's changes. Chili, who had always been the entertainer, was now practically shoved aside as Cilan had become the center of attention! Everyone who came into the resturant was paying attention to Cilan instead of him! At first, Chili didn't seem to mind too much, but as things had progressed through the day, Chili was quickly growing upset that even the regulars that enjoyed watching him were now watching Cilan instead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final straw that broke the camel's back was when one of the customers had the gall to ask Cilan to strip his clothes off! \"He won't do it...\" Chili thought to himself. \"This isn't THAT kind of gym, it's a Pokemon gym!\" But sure enough, to Chili's dismay, Cilan took his shirt right off, leaving him in just a dickie! The green haired hunk bent forward in a crab flex, showing off every single muscle of his upper body! His biceps bulged outward, as his pecs tightened and undulated. There was a roar from the crowd filled with cheers and squees! Cilan chuckled, blushing just slightly, but it always felt great to have tons of people cheering for him! Cilan straightened back up and flexed both of his arms, trying to puff his chest out as he did! His perfect physique was complete with a sculpted chest and massive arms that could crush an apple with ease! That was it for Chili! He felt nothing but the uptmost rage and jealousy as he looked at Cilan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chili looked away, he noticed the table he was hosting had left! They had left a nice Pokedollar tip, as well as another strange brown packet with Cilan's name on it! Chili had no idea what it was, nor did he know this is what Cilan had drank this morning! Chili glanced at Cilan, who was still garnering attention from pretty much everyone in the resturant. Chili gripped it in his fist, and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cilan continued to flex, showing off his triceps to the crowd in a side pose! He had a big smile on his face, when suddenly a brown packet seemed to fly out from the crowd and smack him square in the face! Everyone immediately turned around, but saw that no one was there! Chili must have either dashed or was blending in by waiting on other tables. Everyone then turned back on Cilan, who was looking down at the packet. He smiled a little to himself as he immediately recognized what it was! Cilan stroked his chin for a moment, before deciding on taking this one as soon as he could! Cilan picked up his shirt off the floor and tossed it over his shoulder. he turned and gave everyone a wink before disappearing back into the kitchen!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, the lunch rush had ended, and the boys had a break until the dinner shift later on that evening! As soon as it had ended, Cilan had taken a glass of water and wandered off to his room where he could have a little private time! Cilan had stripped down to his briefs once again, and looked in the mirror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili's body had looked good yesterday, but now that Cilan was looking at his new self, what was he thinking!? His thick pecs, and his pumped biceps, rippling abs and sculpted back... Huge thighs and bulging calves... And it looks like his muscles weren't the only thing under development! His package was nice and heavy in his briefs, making them sag slightly, while his ass was pushed out nicely behind him! It was like two canteloupes back there! Cilan smiled as he looked over his hunky body, before looking at the packet. He tore off the top, poured it into the water, and stirred it until al lthe powder vanished into nothingness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you energy packet...\" Cilan held the glass up to the light to make sure it was all dissolved. \"Time to do your thing!\" Cilan brought the glass down to his lips and started chugging it down, gulping it down to the last drop! \"Ahhh...\" Cilan sighed, setting the glass down on his table. Cilan looked back at the mirror and smiled as he held his hands on his hips. He waited for a second... Then frowned as he saw nothing was happening! However the mixture just needed a few seconds, because as a frown stretched over Cilan's face he started to grow bigger! His pecs pushed out further from his chest! His abs tightened up further, each looking like a full brick of muscle! Cilan was quickly losing that buff model look and becoming more and more like a bodybuilder; massive and strong! His back flared outward, becoming a wall of pure muscle, making his frame look much heavier! His biceps balled up and pulsed as more blood ran through them, forcing the already tight muscles up against his skin, forcing them bigger and bigger! His forearms grew to match, giving the young man an unparalleled grip! Clian's grin returned once he saw just how huge and strong he was! His thighs grew to support his body, until they pressed up against each other, rubbing with every little movement his legs made. His calves had to keep up, each like lightning as they grew. His bare feet stretched across the floor, large toes tapping on the wood paneling as they became larger and larger. In his briefs, the already endowed teen became even bigger! His package not only became thicker and longer, but it was getting larger overall, pushing out further in front of him! Just behind him, Cilan's ass would not be outdone! It too was pushing further outward, until it was like two oversized bowling balls stuffed in a tiny pair of briefs, which were now starting to tear, unable to hold back the connoisseur's hulking physique!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! This is more like it!\" Cilan said confidently. He rose his arm up and have it a hard flex. The muscle bulged up, and up, and UP! He closed his thumb in, and a hard peak popped up on top, with a throbbing vein running just along the breadth. \"Heh, I'm really gonna turn heads tomorrow!\" Cilan said with a cocky grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Cilan's door was cracked open. Someone had saw the whole thing! Chili stood there, his mouth gaping! He had to do his best not to make a quivering gasp! Never had he felt such a mixture of amazement and fear, especially over his own little brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it was that packet...!\" Chili thought to himself. Now he felt foolish for having thrown it at Cilan in the first place! To think he could be looking just as hot as Cilan was right now if he had just-- \"Wait... Did I just think my own brother was hot!?\" Chili said, a little freaked out by his own brain. At this moment, Chili decided to step away from the door and head to his own room...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Chili started heading back to his own room, which was quite close to Cilan's as it were, a bit dazed and confused by this whole strange situation, he stepped on a slightly protruding floorboard which let out a loud creak. Chili froze, not wanting to move. Slowly, he tried to lift his foot away but the more he moved the more the floorboard shrieked and protested. Chili was about to just make a break for it when he heard his brother's gentle voice come from behind him. \"Chili? Is that you?\" Cilan asked, peering into the dark hallway, his brother half hidden by shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Yeah! It's..me.\" Chili admitted, stepping into the light. Cilan had put on a pair of incredibly tight pants to see what was going on in the hallway, the black material hugging his thighs and hips tightly, the waistband lowered from the incredible weight of his package, showing off the v of his hips. No matter where Chili looked, from his brother's big bare feet up to his massive torso, Cilan was a wonder to behold. He could feel his cheeks flushing as he stared at Cilan's chest. His pecs just looked so...big and heavy. He half wondered what it would feel like to touch one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay?\" Cilan asked, noticing how red Chili looked. He walked over to him, the floor shaking slightly with his every step, and pressed his large hand against Chili's forehead. The older, smaller brother felt almost nervous having that big powerful hand pressing up against is head. \"You feel kind of warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine!\" Chili shouted, pushing against Cilan's chest. Cilan didn't budge an inch though he did look a little hurt at his brother's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...okay.\" Cilan said, straightening back up. He still had a concerned look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili crossed his arms and said, \"So...ready for the dinner shift later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan smiled confidently and flexed his arms, his massive biceps swelling up again. \"Definitely! I just hope I can fit into my old clothes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" Chili said, his eyes trailing up and down Cilan's body again. \"Damn...\" Chili thought to himself. \"Why can't I have a body like that? Big...strong...getting all the attention...it's not fair!\" The more Chili looked, the more he admired Cilan's powerful muscles, his thick chest, his rock hard abs, his monster thighs, his bulging calves, his tight ass, his enormous bulge...wait...what?! Chili mentally slapped himself and stumbled back a few steps, steadying himself by placing a hand on the wall. Where were these thoughts coming from? And about is brother no less! Suddenly, his heel smacked against the loose floorboard, sending him falling backward...only to be caught by Cilan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chili! Are you sure you're okay?\" the green haired trainer asked, his concerned eyes trained on his brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili's face flushed as he stared up at Cilan, his little brother's biceps pressed tightly against his back. Heat baked off of Cilan's body, his chest inches from Chili's own. He had instinctively hugged Chili close to his body to protect him. \"I'm...yeah, I just tripped a little.\" Chili said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan helped Chili stand up and said, \"I can cover for you tonight if you want. You're starting to look a little pale...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili smiled a little and said, \"No, really, I can do it. I'm the one who was telling you to step up your game yesterday, remember?\" His familiar grin rose to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan smiled back and said, \"Right! I'm going to go get dressed then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan turned and walked back into his room. Chili let out a sigh, his heart hammering in his chest. This was starting to get weird...Just as he was about to turn and head to his room, Cilan poked his head back out and said, \"Oh! Chili! Wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What's wrong?\" Chili said, his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...um...need some help getting dressed.\" He admitted, blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What? What do you mean?\" Chili said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't get my buttons done right on my shirt.\" Cilan said, waving his hand. \"My fingers are too big...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili sighed and said, \"Fine, I guess I can help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan smiled happily and stood to the side, letting Chili pass into the room. Cilan had his button down shirt on, but the bottom of it barely touched the waistband of his pants and the sides of it were pushed wide open by Cilan's huge chest. He grunted a little as he brought them close together and said, \"See? I can't...fit...the buttons in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili stepped forward and began to do up the buttons, starting at the bottom. His fingers brushed lightly against every brick of Cilan's abs as he slowly did up the buttons. By the time he got up to the bottom of Cilan's chest the shirt was buttoned, but straining. Small bits of his abs were clearly visible between the buttons and the buttons themselves looked like they would pop off at the slightest movement! Cilan winced, looking quite uncomfortable. \"I don't think this is going to work...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...it's the best we can do.\" Chili said, wiping his forehead off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan tried to force the shirt together over his chest, but no matter how he tugged and pulled, it refused to come together. \"Eh, just leave the top part unbuttoned.\" Chili said with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan blushed a little, but smiled all the same as he looked himself over. He felt...kind of sexy~ He had never felt like that before! The sleeves of his shirt covered barely managed to pull down over half of his biceps, the legs of his pants were pulled tight over his calves, and his pecs were fully on display. He was quite a sight to behold, as Chili was quickly noticing. The clothes added a bit of mystery to his physique, making it harder for Chili to look away. He hastily grabbed a bow tie and looped it around Cilan's neck, yanking him down slightly before he began tying it. Cilan went down easily enough, surprised by the sudden tug, and waited patiently for Chili to finish. When Chili was done, Cilan straightened back up, his chest bumping Chili, nearly knocking him over. \"Ooops! Sorry Chili!\" He said, wincing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Chili said gruffly, picking up a pair of Cilan's shoes. He glanced at his brother's feet before looking back at the shoes. \"I think you're just going to have to go barefoot tonight. We'll shop for some new clothes for you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan nodded and grabbed his vest, pulling it on. \"Chili?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili did up the buttons as best he could, once again leaving Cilan's chest on full display, though his abs were better covered now. His clothes were clinging so tightly to him every curve and swell of muscle was on display. Cilan put his hands on his hips and grinned. \"Thanks Chili! I'm ready now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili couldn't help but smile back at his brother. He had always gotten along with Cilan better than Cress. Cilan always looked up to him and even now that attitude didn't seem to have changed. Chili clapped Cilan on the back and said, \"Alright! Then let's get back down there and really show these people what we're made of!\"</span></div></div>",

We're here!\" Chili told his brother, looking at him as he enetered the kitchen. Unlike Chili though, Cilan had to bend down just to fit through the door!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we doing tonight?\" Cilan asked. But to the others, his voice sounded a lot deeper! Kind of manlier too! This prompted Cress to turn around and look at the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Cilan! What's happened to you!?\" Cress asked, \"You're... Huge!\" Cilan just blushed, rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah, I guess something just... Happened.\" Cilan replied, not quite willing to reveal his secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? What... Ah, we don't have time for this!\" Cress said, \"You guys are waiting tables. Cilan's pretty huge, so make sure he's bringing most of the food to the customers.\" Cress ordered. \"Ready?\" He clapped his hands, \"Get going!\" He said with a confident smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was officially underway! During the night, there a mix of cute couples, groups of friends, and even a few families heading out for dinner as well! It all pointed to big orders, and that meant more work to be done!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili and Cilan had their hands full the whole time. Sometimes it was hard for them to remember which table ordered what! But somehow, they managed to pull it through... And as they did, Cilan seemed to keep encountering more and more of the strange little brown packets! He pocketed each and every little one, barely able to fit them into his tight little pockets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Look! It's that sexy waiter!\" One of the nearby patrons called out. \"Hey! Come over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan walked right on over to them. \"Y-Yes?\" He said, \"Did you need a refill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no...\" He replied with a small grin. Instead, he stuck a 500 PokeDollar bill in the waist of his pants. \"Just keep doing what you're doing.\" He finished with a smile, patting the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan blushed a little. That was a nice little tip... It deserved a little reward! Cilan took a deep breath, a big, deep breath and puffed out his chest! With minimal effort, the gold little button popped right off and shot off somewhere into the resturant! The top of Cilan's pecs were peaking out from atop of the shirt, barely showing them off. They reached up about halfway to his chin! Cilan gave them a little flex for his audience before turning around to leave. As he did, he felt a slap on his ass! His head turned around instantly, but all four of them at the table were smiling like Chesire cats. There was no telling who it was! Cilan just smiled and walked off, shaking his ass side to side as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, Cilan was alone in his room once again, with a large jar of water. He stood there over his desk, looking down at the packets he had collected throughout the evening. They were all his little secret! He thought for a moment, before finally deciding...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were about five packets of the strange \"energy boost\" packets scattered on the desk in front of Cilan. It would be so easy to just rip them all open and dump them into the water jug and just get REALLY huge but he kept thinking back to Chili. His brother had been so nice and supportive even though he could sense a hint of jealousy in his eyes. He reached out and started separating the packets. \"I've already had two...\" he said quietly to himself, moving two of the packets away from the remaining three. \"So if Chili took two he'd be as big as me. And that would leave one of us being bigger than the other.\" He picked up the third packet, leaving two piles of two. \"Hmm...I wonder if I should keep this one for myself...or give it to Chili? Oh wait...then I would still have two extra packets, since I've already taken two, and still have one packet over Chili.\" Cilan scratched his head and then just shrugged. \"Well,I'll let him think he's the big brother again for awhile~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan chuckled as he scooped three of the packets into his hand, opening them up one by one and pouring them into a glass. Once all three packets were inside he poured water into the glass and stirred it all up, picking the glass up and carrying it into the hallway. Cilan smiled as he turned to leave his room, his massive chest still scraping along the door frame, a button popping loose. This caused his chest to surge forward, no longer contained by the tight material of his shirt, his pecs now fully on display. He let out a little sigh of relief, one hand reaching up to grope the thick muscle. He looked longingly at the glass in his hand, almost drinking it down right there just to feel his pec swelling in his hand. But he had made a promise to himself to be nice to Chili so he forced his hand down and continued on to his brother's room. He raised his fist and knocked on the door, nearly forcing it from its hinges. Chili quickly opened the door and said, \"Yeah Cilan? What's up?\" He seemed surprised to see his brother there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just thought I'd stop by and give you something to drink.\" He said with a smile, thrusting the glass out in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili raised an eyebrow but still took the glass. \"Thanks...Do you want to come in or something?\" He blushed slightly as he looked his brother up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan, noticing the look, bounced his pecs, popping another button on his shirt, revealing the top row of his abs. \"Sure, I can stop in for a bit~\" He wanted to see Chili's growth first hand anyway! He walked into the room, once more needing to turn to the side, his pecs denting the wooden door frame slightly as he did so. He walked straight over to the bed and sat down, the bed springs creaking in protest of his heavy body. He leaned back on his elbows and spread his legs slightly, a pose he had seen in a fashion magazine before. Now that he actually had a body he felt proud to show off, he wanted to give it a try. Unbeknownst to him, this totally innocent display was having a profound effect on Chili. His eyes widened slightly as he stared at his younger brother, the blush intensifying. His hand shook slightly, nearly upsetting the glass in his hand. Absentmindedly, Chili raised the glass to his lips and guzzled it, taking huge gulps, undoing the first button of his collar to let out some steam. Cilan watched as his brother's Adams apple bobbed with every gulp. Soon, the glass was empty. Chili set it down and winced, clutching his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...Hey Cilan? What was in that water?\" Chili asked, bending over slightly. It felt like his whole body was heating up even more, and this time not from seeing his brother!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see~\" Cilan said with a slightly mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chili could question Cilan's statement, he let out a mighty belch, covering his mouth almost as soon as it got out, looking embarrassed. Cilan just giggled however as the show really began. Chili felt the heat concentrate in his chest. As soon as he looked down, his chest pumped up bigger and bigger, straining the buttons on his uniform! He let out a little yelp of shock, leaning forward slightly as his pecs just kept growing! The buttons popped off, one by one, until the swelling orbs of pure muscle were fully on display, nearly forcing him to bend over double due to their enormous weight! With a groan Chili hefted them under his arms forcing himself into a standing position again. Before he could catch his breath, his arms suddenly started inflating, his biceps going from lean to meaty in less than a minute! Baseball sized, softball sized, basketball sized! His sleeves went from being strained to splitting open like rotten husks, the buttons on his wrist snapping off due to his thickening forearms! The sudden weight in his arms made Chili fall to his knees, his arms much longer as well, his chest resting on his thighs! \"W-What the...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another fantastic tearing sound, his shoulders suddenly broadened, the tattered material of his shirt and parts of his vest folding down in half, fully revealing his chest and upper back. He managed to get his legs stretched out from under him, supporting his enormous upper body with his arms, his back flaring out to help support the weight of his chest. Panting, Chili tried to catch his breath before stomach suddenly exploded in abs, each row smashing through the puny buttons trying to contain his growing bulk, six rock hard bricks of muscular force, unassailable to any normal man's fist! His legs were next, his thighs bulging and bulging until they ripped apart at the knee, his calves swelling with such force as to obliterate the material of his dress pants, leaving him in a pair of tight fitting shorts, the waistline cutting into his waist. With a wince, Chili tried to sit up, though he stopped as a deep moan escaped his lips. His dick grew longer and thicker in his briefs, forcing the button on his pants open before the last pathetic material finally gave up and ripped from his body, his briefs clinging tenaciously to his gigantic junk. The material stretched obscenely in the front, outlining his thick cock perfectly, his balls threatening to burst free from below, the waistband sagging due to the sheer weight in front! His ass wasn't left out either, each cheek becoming thicker and bouncier, giving him a butt that begged for spanking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all this growth finally came to a stop, Chili slowly rose to his feet, his head smacking into the ceiling before he was even fully erect! He grinned and started flexing his muscles, starting with his arms. He grunted as he flexed them harder and harder, the mounds rising up from his arms, almost making it difficult for him to bend his arms! \"Yeah...now THIS is what I'm talking about! So.....nngh...HUGE!\" He yelled this last word, shaking the room slightly with the sheer power of his voice. \"See this Cilan? Now THIS is what a REAL man looks like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan chuckled as he watched Chili bounce his pecs, the massive muscles dancing at his slightest flex. \"Yeah, I guess you really are the big brother~\" It was nice seeing him so happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...Why don't you come over here and feel what a big brother I am?~\" He grinned somewhat lustily, falling to his knees next to the bed, bracing his hands on either side of Cilan. Cilan looked a little nervous as those gigantic pecs were nearly pushed against his face.</span></div></div>",

Chili smiled once more as he heard nothing but his brother's muffed yelps beneath his powerful chest! \"Yeaaah, just like that!\" Chili groaned, rubbing his body up so his pecs slid up Cilan's face, before moving them slowly back down. Cilan tried to struggle his way out, but another part of him was loving every second of Chili's pumped up pecs slowly grinding his face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili's smile returned once more when he heard Cilan groaning slightly! Chili just chuckled to himself, pushing himself back up so Cilan could get some air! It was almost cute how Cilan's face was now all pink! It could have just been because he was out of breath and his cheeks were flushed, but Chili knew it was really because Cilan was loving this just as much as he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now touch 'em!\" Chili ordered, \"Or do I have to give you more encouragement?\" Cilan, who looked up at his brother for a moment then reached up and gently ran his hands against Chili's great, burly pecs. His skin was irresistably soft, like silk. It was hard to believe that just under the surface were two overgrown, massively powerful muscles! As Cilan's finger traveled between them, Chili suddenly flexed, getting the little guy's finger stuck in between!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you get stuck? Come on, pull!\" Chili ordered! Cilan started to tug his finger, but he was finding it rather difficult! With one firm jerk, however, he managed to get it out! \"Heh, took you long enough! Maybe you should work out those noodles you call arms!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan got a nervous smile. Sure, he wasn't as strong as Chili now, but there was no questioning that he was no small fry himself! Chili's biceps were maybe five, ten inches tops, bigger than his! But to that fire-headed egomaniac, that was all he needed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan looked back up at Chili, who was still looking back at him. Looks like Cilan had more work to do! His hands reached up, and kept rubbing his bulbous pecs, from top to bottom! It all went smoothly, until Cilan rubbed over the nipple!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...\" Chili moaned, doing his best to keep it under wraps! Cilan looked back up at Chili, before getting a little smile on his face. Without a word, he sat up and gently laid his mouth on Chili's soft, tender nipple. This only made Chili moan again, even louder this time! Cilan had a little smile on his face, and started to lick the little circle, his gentle tongue washing back and forth, making it perk up at attention! Cilan reached over with his other hand, and started to do the same to the other with his finger! Gently, he ran around it in a circle, before giving it a tiny squeeze! Chili groaned out in protest, but Cilan was relentless! He kept suckling on his brother's chest, teasing him with every little chance he got! Chili felt his arms getting a little bit weak as Cilan kept going. He wouldn't be able to hold himself up for much longer!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like hours, Cilan stopped, loooking back up at Chili, who was trying to keep his dominant smirk on his face! It was at this point that...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cilan smiled innocently as he stared up into his older brother's face. He opened his mouth to say something when he felt something rather hard and insistent poking at his thigh. He tilted his head slightly at the feeling, his mouth closing, before looking down. His eyes widened as he saw Chili's dick, bulging out his briefs to the point that they were slowly starting to tear, the head poking against Cilan's thigh again and again as Chili's body slowly swayed, still recovering from all the attention Cilan had paid to his brother's nipple. Cilan's smile soon returned, his hand reaching down to gently cup the bulbous head in his hand, his thumb stroking it through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah! C-Cilan, w-what are you doing to me?\" Chili asked, his face flushing, his dick hardening more and more, slowly snaking out, his underwear creaking in protest, the material riding up his crack, revealing those firm, bouncy cheeks. In a few seconds, the underwear would be no more! Cilan giggled and said, \"You're so big Chili! Even if I was as tall as you I don't think I'd be this big. And I'm bigger than Cress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, really?!\" Chili said with a grin, his body steeling slightly as his ego was stroked even more. \"I always knew I was the biggest brother even if I wasn't the oldest!\" He puffed his chest out with pride, only to gasp again as Cilan started stroking again, his other hand running up and down the shaft. With a sharp SNAP Chili's underwear finally gave up the ghost, his dick suddenly pressing hard against Cilan's leg, the slit slowly oozing pre cum onto Cilan's leg. Cilan blushed a little, but didn't let go of Chili's cock. His hands were almost glued to it, still slowly playing with it. Chili moaned, bracing his arms harder against the bed. \"C-Come on Cilan! Don't leave me hanging!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan glanced up at Chili's lustful expression and shrugged, continuing his stroking. This wasn't anything new to Cilan and Chili. They had always been really close when they were young, bathing together, sleeping in the same bed, running around naked, innocent things. Cress had joined them in the beginning but he had matured faster than the other two, finding the behavior unacceptable. Chili and Cilan kept at it even through puberty, forging a close bond between the two of them. When they hit puberty they had played another game: see who could last the longest while giving each other a hand job. This game hadn't lasted many years. Cilan grew too shy and embarrassed and eventually they both stopped indulging in their innocent childhood games. They were still closer to each other than to Cress. Seeing each other naked was no big deal. Touching each other like this was no big deal. Or so it seemed. Thanks to those packets certain, deeper feelings were beginning to spring up between the two brothers, though neither would admit it. Cilan was too innocent and Chili was too proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan slowly lifted Chili's dick up closer to his face, watching the slit gush warm liquid all down the shaft, coating Cilan's hands, drops of it falling onto his abs and chest, pooling there, oddly comforting in its warmth. Without really thinking about it he brought his hand to his lips and gave his finger a lick, a salty taste filling his mouth. His eyes widened, surprised by the taste. Chili's own eyes widened a bit, his breathing getting harder, his head swimming, not sure he was actually seeing what he was seeing. Before he could question Cilan, the younger brother leaned forward, licking the shaft and head, swallowing down the pre like it was water, enjoying the taste. Chili's knees buckled, sending him crashing to the floor, his knees gouging enormous holes in the floor, the whole room shaking. Cilan felt the dick get pulled away from him. With a little whimper he laid out on his stomach, Chili's bed getting covered in pre, and grabbed onto the cock again, taking as much of the head into his mouth as he could, sucking on it, drawing even more pre out of it. Chili moaned deeply, his chest vibrating as his head tilted back. The pleasure he was feeling was indescribable. He hadn't had anyone touch his cock since Cilan and played the last game with him and he had never had anyone use their mouth on him before. He was seeing spots it was so intense!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like even more hours, Chili's balls heaved, sending a massive load rocketing out of his dick and directly into Cilan's mouth. Cilan managed to gulp down a few mouthfuls of the salty, warm liquid before he had to take his mouth away, getting a face full of cum before moving the slit away from his body, emptying even more cum onto the bed, soaking it completely! Chili let out a shuddering sight and leaned back, landing on his ass on the floor. His dick slowly softened, resting between his legs, his body covered in sweat. Cilan wiped his face and grinned at Chili. He stood up, his underwear soaking wet from the cum, streams of it running down his legs and neck. \"That was amazing! I've never seen so much before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili chuckled and wiped his forehead. \"W-Well...I've never felt like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCilan giggled and sat down between Chili's legs, gently touching the massive meat lying there. \"It was fun. I didn't think that stuff would taste so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChili blushed and didn't say anything. Cilan's warm, soft hand was reigniting the fire inside him. He stood up, slowly moving back and stretched. \"Huh...Guess I can't sleep in my bed tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I need to wash up!\" Cilan said, looking over his body. \"Why don't you sleep in my room tonight? I'll go to the bathroom and get cleaned up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Chili could protest, Cilan was gone, rushing to the bathroom. \"Aw man...what am I getting myself into?\" Chili thought to himself. He slowly made his way to Cilan's room, leaving behind the overpowering musk of his essence. His head cleared as he entered Cilan's room. It was much cleaner than his own, the jug of water still resting on Cilan's desk. Chili gratefully took the jug and took a few long gulps, stopping when half the jug was empty. He sighed and set it back down, heading over to the bed. As soon as he sat down he felt an odd burning sensation running through his body. He winced before noticing all the open packets littering Cilan's desk. Chili's eyes widened as he realized what the burning was. \"Uh oh...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary Oak had grown to be a fine young man, following in his grandfather's footsteps to become a Pokemon Professor! Gary Oak was already out and about, and had began taking notes on various Pokemon throughout the land! It was this very journey that had led him to the Rocky Cave mountains of Kanto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary was squatted down, hiding behind some rocks as he took notes on an Elekid interacting with a Geodude! Rocky Cave was, after all, located near the powerplant, so it wasn't unheard of to see an electric type coexisting with the ground types of the mountains! From what Gary could tell, they were just making idle chatter, that is, until the Elekid handed over a few berries to Geodude! The Geodude seemed quite happy, and gave Elekid some well-polished rocks in return! Fascinated, Gary began to jot down this behaviour, and was able to learn from it! It went on for a while, Gary watching the two in private, studying their every move! It was strange how something some people could find boring, Gary was so enthralled by! So enthralled, in fact, that he hadn't even noticed a shadow creeping up behind him! Gary had just finished a sentance on his paper, before he was suddenly snatched up by a pair of hands! He dropped his pencil and pad, and most importantly, his Pokeballs too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What the!?\" Gary said, looking around as he was suddenly hefted off the ground!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Machooo...\" A wild Machoke uttered, as it turned back around!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Put me down! Please!\" Gary said, at least showing respect to the Pokemon. However, he soon learned that his plea fell on deaf ears. The Machoke continued to carry Gary off to who-knew-where! Gary didn't stop struggling, but it was all proving useless against he might of the Machoke! Eventually Gary just stopped fighting, and hoped for the best...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machoke took Gary through the entrance to a cave, but it was not to last. Gary could see the light at the exit not to far away! Clueless where he was, he noticed two largy Hariyama standing near the exit! Once there, Machoke looked up at the two Hariyama. They, in return, looked at Gary for a moment before looking back at the Machoke and moved aside, granting entry. Gary started to wiggle once more, feeling a little uneasy about it all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were a little further in, Gary could hear the roar of a crowd! Not a crowd of humans though, Gary recognized them as the cries of Pokemon! At this point, the Machoke slung Gary over his shoulder. Gary saw a village all around him, populated with Pokemon! Before he could get a good look though, they began to go through another tunnel, this one much shorter! The Machoke kept walking, and soon Gary was able to see an entire stadium of Pokemon, all of them cheering and looking at something that was in the center stage! Gary tried to look over the Machoke's shoulder, but it was just too burly to see past!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Gary was caught up in the amazement of it all, he was thrown down onto the dirt, in a circle of sorts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Watch it!\" Gary groaned, rubbing the back of his head! He looked up at the Machoke, who then pointed a finger straight ahead! Gary turned around, and he immediately saw a Golem standing across from him. It glared right into his eyes, before squatting down. Gary pulled back a little, before the Golem rose one leg high in the air and stomping it hard into the ground! Still squatting, the Golem lifted it's other leg and did the same! Gary was a bit confused, so he looked around a little more and soon found out that he was right in the center of a sumo ring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... M-Me?\" Gary said, pointing at himself. The Golem's stare didn't break, as he just nodded once. Gary chuckled a bit, but the Machoke suddenly picking him up and setting him on his feet made him stop instantly! Gary looked back at he Machoke, raising an eyebrow. \"Uhhh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machoke looked at Gary, and was about to raise a foot, doing his best to tell Gary he had to stomp back! Gary turned back to the Golem, gulping a little! He squatted down, and did just as the Golem had done. A slightly plump Infernape arrived on the scene, his hand down, equidistant between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infern... APE!\" It shouted! Right on cue, the Golem began to charge right at Gary! Gary was nervous beyond words, as he braced himself for impact! The Golem soon hit him like a ton of bricks! He was pushed all the way to the edge of the ring, before his feet managed to stop him from falling out! Gary took the hit, holding on for as long as he could! He managed to hang in there for only about three seconds, before the Golem thrusted it's hips, pushing it's weight right into Gary and knocking him right out of the ring! As Gary fell on his back, he looked back up at the Golem, who held his somewhat stumpy arms high, proud of his feat! The crowds of Pokemon cheered, the Infernape claiming Golem the victor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like this was the final bout of the day, because shortly after, the Pokemon started to file out of the home-crafted stadium! Gary still looked around, amazed the Pokemon were capable of producing such a landmark! Not to mention they held their own sport! As Gary gazed around, he was tapped on the shoulder. As he looked behind him, he recognized the same Golem which had knocked him down just minutes ago! It offered it's hand, which Gary gladly took. It lifted Gary back to his feet, smiling at Gary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Gary said with a smile. The Golem nodded back, before turning halfway, and pointing over at a few Pokemon. Gary looked over, and near the exit, he saw two groups of Pokemon waiting there! There was a small group of Makuhita and Hariyama together in one, and in the other was an entire Machoke family, complete with two Machops, three Machokes, and even a Machamp! A bit confused, Gary looked back down at Golem. Golem looked up at Gary from the corner of it's eyes, and kept pointing between the Makuhita family and the Machop family, as if waiting for Gary's decision...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at Golem one more time, Gary began walking over to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gary was slightly intimidated by the fierce eyes of the Machop family group, each Pokemon, even the smallest among them, flexing their rather huge muscles and grinning at him. He wasn't a coward by any means but he had also been studying Pokemon long enough to know that they could be very dangerous in the right conditions. Looking over at the Makuhita group, however, looked far friendlier, with only the Hariyama looking intimidating. The soft, round looking Pokemon felt like a safer choice. Golem was growing impatient and began to push Gary closer to the two groups, urging him to pick one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! You don't have to push! Geez...\" Gary said in annoyance, walking over to the Makuhita. \"There! I pick these guys. So now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machop family looked sullen and disappointed, swiftly heading out of the makeshift arena, down a different tunnel than the one that Gary had been brought in through. The Makuhita all cheered happily, the Hariyama crossing his arms and nodding approvingly. The Golem also took his leave, waving once to Gary before leaving the human alone in the group of Pokemon. Gary smiled a little uncertainly and said, \"Uh..hey. So...what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no idea what to do or say, this whole situation completely unprecedented! Wait...Gary thought about that for a moment. In all his years of traveling, training, and studying Pokemon he had never once heard of a group of disparate Pokemon banding together to create some kind of arena separate from any humans. Wild Pokemon, fighting, together, living, together! It helped prove the thesis that wild Pokemon enjoyed battling just as much as caught Pokemon. Perhaps this whole thing was a way for Wild Pokemon to train and get better at fighting to more easily draw in humans to try and catch them. If so, why was he, a human brought into this secret world? There were too many questions but there was one thing Gary was certain of: this was a once in a lifetime opportunity and he wasn't about to waste it! Luckily, when the Golem had carried him off he hadn't lost the notebook and pen he had been using to take notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could pull them out, however, the Makuhitas both took one of Gary's hands, dragging him down yet another tunnel, the human trainer stumbling slightly as he was pulled into the dark once again. \"H-hey! Can't you guys at least TRY to explain what this is all about?\" Gary fruitlessly begged, his only answer being a firm smack on the back from the Hariyama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before light returned, the strange group of human and Pokemon entering a massive cave chamber, filled with primitive looking gym equipment, all made from stone, various rather rotund Pokemon, a strange pile of grey looking marshmallow or something of that nature, and a long table sagging under the weight of a massive amount of food! There was several various types of berries that Gary could identify along with human food, including huge shanks of beef, whole roasted chickens, mountains of potatoes, piles of various vegetables, entire loaves of bread, tureens of soup, dishes of butter, anything and everything a person or Pokemon could ever want! Gary felt his mouth water just looking at it, wiping his lips as he stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was jerked out of his staring by the Makuhita once again, pulling him over to the corner of the cave where the massive mound of gray marshmallow was stored. When they were within ten feet of the mound it began to stir, much to Gary's surprise, a truly enormous Snorlax coming into view as he rolled over, scratching his gigantic belly and unleashing a maelstrom of a \"SNOOOOOOOOOOOOORlaaaaaaaaaax...\" that nearly knocked Gary over from the wind! His eyes were wide with amazement as he stared up at the biggest Snorlax he had ever seen! It had to be at least twenty feet tall, if not bigger! He could pick Gary up and swallow him down in one bite if he wanted! \"Maybe this wasn't such a great choice after all...\" Gary thought, gulping slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maku! Maku! Hita, makuhita!\" One of the Makuhita said, pointing at Gary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax stared vacantly at the Makuhita before slowly turning to look at Gary. \"Snooooooor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi?\" Gary said, waving a little, not sure what was expected of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax stared at him before pointing at the Hariyama. \"Snor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hariyama! Hari, hari, hari! Yamaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax nodded and turned back over with a tired, \"Laaaaaaax....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Makuhitas and Hariyama all nodded and led Gary away again, this time over to the table. Gary kept looking over his shoulder, wanting to study that monumental Snorlax, but his \"hosts\" were having none of that. They sat him down in front of the table, setting out three stone plates. Gary looked them over, noticing that each one had a picture of a different Pokemon on it. The one furthest to the left showed a Makuhita, happily slapping his belly. The one in the middle showed a fierce Hariyama, though the perspective seemed to be from below, making him look imposing and powerful. The one on the right depicted a Snorlax, easily filling the frame, a satisfied smile on his face. \"Are you asking which one I'm interested in?\" Gary asked, looking between the two Makuhita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maku!\" They both said, nodding happily, glad he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Okay, I'm interested in that Snorlax!\" He said, eagerly pointing at the right plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAAAAAAAR!\" The Hariyama said, looking shocked, both Makuhita holding a hand to their open mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Was that not the right choice?\" Gary asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three Pokemon laughed, slapping him on the back, as though they were congratulating him on something. Gary just chuckled nervously and said, \"Uh...yeah...this is great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he knew, a Gulpin was set down next to him, waving a stubby arm at him slightly. Gary pet the Pokemon, causing it to blush before pointing at a plate of food. Gary set it down next to the Pokemon, which opened its mouth wide, swallowing the food in one go. \"Gulp.\" The Pokemon said, waving his arms slightly, indicating the now empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay?\" Gary said, tilting his head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGulpin indicated another plate and the process repeated itself. Gulp, swallow, indicate the empty plate. It took Gary about three renditions of this before he realized what was going on. \"You want me to eat, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gulpin nodded. Gary shrugged and filled up one of the plates with various food, eating it happily. He had no idea who was making the food but it tasted amazing! The meat was tender and juicy, the vegetables crisp and flavorful, the potatoes actually stuffed with bacon, cheese, and ranch, the bread crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside, the soup creamy and sweet! Gary eagerly finished his plate and filled up another, eating even more! The Pokemon nodded in satisfaction, one Makuhita rubbing his shoulders, the other moving food closer to Gary. After about five plates of food Gary was stuffed, his belly sticking out slightly, raising his shirt up a little. \"Woo...that was awesome!\" He said happily, grinning at the Pokemon. \"You guys sure know how to treat someone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hariyama merely pushed another plate of food forward, pointing at it. \"Hari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...no thanks, I'm full. Really.\" Gary said, patting his stomach, feeling slightly worried again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hariyama shook his head, pointing at the plate. \"Hari!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary looked despondently down at the food and said, \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HARI!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWincing slightly, Gary did as he was told, eating more of the food, forcing it down his throat, his already painfully bulging stomach bulging even more! Every time he tried to stop, the Hariyama ordered him to eat more, one of the Makuhita now rubbing his belly, trying to calm him down. Gary kept mechanically eating, not wanting to get on the bad side of this powerhouse Pokemon. As he ate however...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Damn that Salamander!\" Gajeel stomped down the roads of Magnolia, a dark aura of anger surrounding the furious Dragon Slayer. Needless to say, everyone preferred to avoid him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result of his ire was Natsu. It was early in the morning - still is, actually - and Gajeel was enjoying his breakfast. Then Natsu had burst into the guild, feeling bored. And being Natsu, his way of relieving his boredom was to start a fight with the first person he could. And that was Gajeel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe iron slayer was eating bacon and eggs when Natsu socked him in the mouth. A battle ensued between the two Dragon Slayers, their guild mates watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, however, Gajeel was defeated. If that wasn't enough, the fire-breathing twat began to brag about being stronger than Gajeel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sulked off, being where he is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fire-spitting bastard...!\" Gajeel growled. \"I'm way stronger than he is - I'm supposed to be way stronger than he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel paid no mind to where he walked, he just trudged along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to get stronger.\" Gajeel said, flexing one of his arms, grabbing the bicep with the hand of the other arm. \"I need to be so strong that Salamander - no, everyone - will be nothing against me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel finally stopped and looked around where he was. He was standing in front of a potion shop - a seedy-looking one at that. Gajeel couldn't help but grin. This was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel slammed the door open. Even though the sun was still out in a cloudless sky, it was dark inside to potion shop. However, Gajeel could still see the many potions stacked on shelves. And the elderly-looking man behind the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dressed in simple robes with a green wizard hat, his saggy skin hanging on his skinny, old body. His gray beard was long, leaning over the counter. He opened one eye, \"What have you came here for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want a potion that can make me stronger.\" Gajeel said, walking to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" The old man said, widening his one open eye. \"But you're already pretty strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well pretty strong ain't enough.\" Gajeel replied. \"I want a potion that will make me strong enough to easily beat that annoying Salamander. I will pay any price.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? Any price, you say?\" The old man grinning, running his fingers through his beard. \"Such a potion cannot be cheap. You will have to pay me one million Jewel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel let out a 'Tsk' before walking away. \"I'll be back in five minutes.\" He said, disappearing behind the door as he closed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he was certain that the Dragon Slayer could no longer hear him, the old man let out a burst of snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a fool! A potion that makes people stronger? Yeah right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth about the old man is that he doesn't really own or work at the store; he's a scammer. It just so happened to be his luck that the old hag that owned the store had left to visit relatives in another town. And with her store unprotected, the old man used it to his advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the first customer to walk in is an idiot who would pay a giant one million for a potion that doesn't exist. It was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even he knew who Gajeel is. If the iron mage doesn't come back and kick his ass for a terrible potion, his guild mates will!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just run away when he leaves with the potion.\" The old man said to himself. \"I should be safe in the next country or two. Black Steel will never find me once I'm gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was flung open. Gajeel pulled a large sack through the door, presenting it to the scam artist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, here's the Jewel.\" Gajeel said, unaware of the old man's trap. \"Now I'll be takin' my potion, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on right there!\" The old man said, raising a honey finger to Gajeel's face. \"First I need to make the potion. I cannot risk such a powerful potion just sitting on the shelves where anyone can take. Give me five minutes, and it'll be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Gajeel grumbled, propping his hand head on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man hopped off his stool and ran into the backroom. Inside the room was a large cauldron and many other potions; some were simple potions that would change the colour of your hair, others were obviously rare - they're probably made by ingredients that only S Class mages can receive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't care - they're not his problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geezer poured random bottles, ranging from the aforementioned simple and rare potions, stirring them around that make them mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I don't have all day!\" Gajeel barked impatiently. \"Get with the damn potion already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just a minute~!\" The old man sang back. He looked down at the concoction he made; a large, light blue-coloured liquid sitting in the cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man snicker as he took an empty glass bottle and filled it with the liquid. It was small, so small that even the old man could hold it in a single hand, so most of the liquid remained in the cauldron. He didn't care, wouldn't be his mess to clean up soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man, however, was unaware that his reckless creation would not only work as a power-augmenting potion, but that it would be far more powerful than anyone could imagine. Nor did he know that the remaining potion in the cauldron would also be used later in this day that would change everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSealing the bottle with a cork, the old man made his way back to Gajeel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is, just as ordered~!\" The old man sang, handing the potion over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Gajeel grinned as he looked at the elixir in his hand. \"I can't wait to see the look on Salanander's face I drink this and kick his ass all the way to the moon. Gihihihihi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGajeel left and vanished. With him gone, the old man grabbed the Jewel-filled sack and ran out of Magnolia as fast as his old, boney legs could take him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So long, suckers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I'm bored.\" Natsu grumbled, resting his head on his fist. \"I wish something fun could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salamander!\" Gajeel roared as he kicked the guild doors open, elixir in hand. Natsu grinned; finally something fun to do! Gajeel stomped over to the pink-haired slayer. \"You better beg for mercy, 'cause you won't be a match for me soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! In your dreams!\" Natsu laughed. The fire mage noticed a glass bottle in his hands. \"What's with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\" Gajeel responded. \"Just a lil' somethin' to help me kick your ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to see that.\" Natsu said. \"Go on, drink that, I'll be kicking your ass anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be eating those words soon...!\" Gajeel said. Ripping the cork off, Gajeel chugged down the blue potion entirely, to even the last, tiniest drop. Throwing the empty elixir away, Gajeel licked away the remaining drops on his lips. \"Mmm, minty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot warmth flowed through Gajeel, coursing throughout his bloodstream. The warmth felt better than anything Gajeel had ever known; he let out a small, pleasured moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, here it comes!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"BRO! NOOOOOO!\" Simon shouted, sitting bolt upright in bed, his small, frail body covered in a sheen of sweat. He gasped as he looked around. White walls...that strange box that he put his clothes in...that door leading to the little room where he hung his jackets...and underneath him, a bed. Clean sheets, warm blankets...He sighed, slowly coming down from the adrenaline rush he had gotten from his nightmare. He flopped back down onto his pillow, turning on his side and looking out the window. It was raining again. Just a few days ago they would have all been stuck outside, trying to find shelter under rocks or in valleys. Now, thanks to his bro, they didn't need to worry about the weather no matter how bad it got!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's heart started to beat a little faster again as he remembered the battle they had fought to earn Dai-Gunzan. Kamina had been very badly wounded and had only woken up sporadically in the last day. Usually he would wake up enough to drink some water before falling back asleep. He was lying in one of the bigger bedrooms now, his body wrapped up in bandages. Simon had spent the first two days by his bro's side, never leaving, never eating, never sleeping. Yoko had finally forced him to eat, drink, and get some sleep for his own health.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Killing yourself isn't going to help him heal any faster!\" He could still hear her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sighed and sat up, rubbing the heels of his hands against his eyes. He had known when he had laid down the previous night that he was heading for a nightmare. He just never expected one so vivid and disturbing. He had dreamed that his bro had actually been killed! Run through by half a dozen spears, dying as soon as his body was removed from the cockpit of his Gurren. Simon shook his head and slapped his cheeks. Stop thinking about it! It didn't happen! Kamina was alive and recovering! He would be awake soon! The small boy kicked his covers aside and got up, quickly getting dressed. The battle last night had opened his eyes. He wasn't going to let something like that happen ever again! He was going to do whatever it took to get stronger so that he could protect his bro! So he could protect everyone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this unwavering determination in mind, Simon ran down the hall of Dai-Gunzan, heading for Kamina's room. Before he got there, he ran head first into Kittan who was walking in the opposite direction. \"Hey! Watch where you're going small fry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry Kittan! I'm just in a bit of a hurry!\" Simon quickly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Checking on Kamina again right?\" He said, shaking his head. \"I swear, you're obsessed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon chuckled, sticking his tongue out at Kittan. \"Jealous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right! Like I'd want some little kid constantly hanging around me!\" Kittan shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon just grinned and kept moving. Kittan, suddenly remembering something, ran after him and grabbed his shoulder. \"Hold up, hold up! I got something I need you to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Simon said, his tone impatient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only going to take a second! The guys went out to scout the area last night and they found this weird box thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" Simon asked. \"What does this have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were three locks on it.\" Kittan said, pointing at Simon's drill bit. \"And this thing is probably the key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Simon's attention. \"Really? Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan grinned and said, \"Follow me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller teen led Simon back into the kitchen. There was a large metal box on top of it, lines etched across it's surface, each one leading to one of three small holes. Simon examined each hole. \"Yeah, they do look like the same key hole on Lagann.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Told ya!\" Kittan said. \"So, what are you waiting for? Open it up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nodded and stuck the drill bit into the first hole and turned. Green light raced down the lines leading to the first hole. Simon pulled the bit out and stuck it into the second hole, turning it again. This time, he had to turn it the other way. Red light appeared down the lines leading to this hole. Finally, he stuck the bit into the last hole. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't turn it left or right. So he just shoved it in harder. That did it! Blue lines crisscrossed with the other two and the box slowly opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Awesome!\" Kittan said with a grin. \"There's gotta be something amazing in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon jumped up onto a chair and peered into the box. It was incredibly dusty inside. He reached in and brushed off the worst of it, a cloud rising up around him as he did so. \"I...think there's something in here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan tried to look inside too, but Simon was blocking his view. \"Well? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer, Simon pulled something out of the box, setting it down on top of the table as he did so. Kittan scratched his head and said, \"What...is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked it over and said, \"I think it's a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"... gun or something...\" Simon replied. In the box, which was lined in velvet, yet still very dusty, was a chrome gun with some kind of six pointed star with a switch on the center on the side. Before Simon could get a closer look at it, Kittan swooped in from behind and snatched it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A gun!? Whoa!\" Kittan held it closer to his face, shaking it a little. \"That's so cool! One of these could really come in handy!\" Kittan thought for a moment. \"You don't really see a lot of guns around here... Hey! What's this switch...?\" Kittan spoke to himself. Simon abruptly snatched the gun right back from Kittan so he could get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I opened it! I should get to see it too...\" Simon replied. Looking at the gun, he began to inspect the switch. At the top, there was a outline of a man who was stretched out, it seemed. At the bottom, there was a squished down one. To the left, a hefty person, to the right, a muscular. In the upper left there was a bulky, tall male, while in the lower, there was a male who was still rather hefty, just shorter. On the right side, there was a silhoutte of a man, just as there was on the left. Only this time, the man was much more burly and strong. The upper one was taller, while the lower one was shorter. It didn't take a genius to figure out just what the heck it meant, but then again if it did what Simon thought it did, well... That was just nuts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You done yet? Sure you are.\" Kittan replied. He yanked the gun back from Simon and started aiming it around. \"Chk-chk, pow!\" He said to himself, much like a child. He spun it on his finger like a cowboy, and put the tip in his pocket. \"Whatcha think? Pretty cool, right?\" Kittan asked with a big grin as he looked at Simon. The boy at least smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now here, give it back.\" Simon told Kittan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, hang on! I'm not done yet!\" Kittan replied at he took it back out. He pulled on the switch, pretending to cock it, not even realizing what he just did! \"Pew! Pew pew!\" Kittan chuckled as he pretened to fire a few shots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kittan, give it back! We don't even know if that's dangerous!\" Simon said, making his move tword Kittan. Kittan, lost in his own little world, pretended to fire a shot at Simon. The only problem was this time, his finger accidentally pulled the trigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA glowing beam of light shot out, and hit Simon square in the chest! Simom immediately fell back on his bottom, grasping at his chest frantically as he made a whining sound. Kittan tossed the gun aside and moved in to Simon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Are you alright!?\" Kittan demanded to know, \"I'm sorry! I didn't mean to fire it at you! I didn't even think that thing even worked!\" No matter what excuse Kittan made in his head, none of them could justify hurting his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon winced, but didn't answer. Kittan's eyes then began to widen as he noticed that Simon...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon felt a bit dizzy as he grabbed his chest in the spot that Kittan had shot. He slowly got to his feet, his whole body feeling numb. Otherwise...he felt okay! Maybe the gun's only effects were for stunning after all and the decals and the switch were both just decoys. He glanced up and noticed Kittan staring at him funnily. Simon blinked and said, \"What? Why are you looking at me like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan just pointed and said, \"It could just be my imagination...but I think...something's happening to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked down at his body, his eyes widening. \"W-Wait! This is...what's happening?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\" Kittan said, clenching his fist. \"You're growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon, feeling a bit nervous, looked on helplessly as his body began to grow larger! His once scrawny chest was slowly pumping up and out, each muscle pushing out against his skin, becoming thicker and rounder. Simon ran his hands down his once flat stomach as a six pack of abs suddenly appeared, so faint as to hardly be noticeable, before they began to pop out, row by row, like cobbles placed in the road. The sounds of bones cracking and stretching filled the room as Simon grew taller, his head inching up much to Kittan's shock. Simon gulped as he felt the sleeves of his coat tighten around his arms, the shoulders feeling equally snug. His hands shaking slightly, the once tiny digger began to undo his belt, the material of his shorts digging uncomfortably into his waist. He let out a little sigh which quickly turned to a gasp as his thighs bulged out next, stretching his short legs so tight it looked like they were painted on. His calves were not left out, thickening and bulging out. Even Simon's hands and feet stretched out, his toes rubbing against the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the numbness from being shot subsided, Simon felt a new sensation rise up and over take him. It was a feeling of pure...pleasure~ He let out a little moan as he ran his hands over his body, feeling every muscle bulge out with every breath he took. His jacket let out a similar moaning sound, unable to contain the expanding youngster inside it. Simon lifted his arms up, examining his biceps. They were hidden from his sight and the sleeves of his jacket refused to be pushed up passed them. Simon, annoyed, flexed his biceps as hard as he could, the sleeves splitting like rotted husks, unleashing Simon's newly grown biceps, a thick vein running over the top of each mound! Kittan's jaw dropped as he saw how easily Simon had torn through his clothes. Simon smiled, admiring his new muscles. Finally, he felt big! He felt strong! He felt like he could fight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis growth came to a halt when he was about a head shorter than Kittan, his muscles bulked up to the size of an Olympic swimmer. His new height and musculature made his clothes look comically small on his body. His jacket was stretched so tightly over his back Simon could have probably ripped it just by bringing his arms together. The hem only reached a little over halfway down his back. It was a good thing he always wore it open since there was no way it was going to close now! His shorts were equally silly looking, covering much less of Simon's legs. Tears were clearly visible all over them, Simon's thighs too much for them to handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was while he was examining his thighs, Simon noticed another change. His once average boyhood had stretched out quite a few more inches, giving him a rather sizable pouch in the front of his shorts. Likewise, his ass felt thicker and fuller behind him, his underwear riding up slightly. He felt a bit of discomfort, but this new body was completely worth it. Simon suddenly remembered that Kittan was still there and grinned at him a little sheepishly. \"Um...guess we know what it does now huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan grabbed up the gun again and saw that the switch was pressed up to the taller, buffer man setting. Kittan nodded and he looked it over. \"So if we turn the switch this way...we can turn you back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon instantly charged forward and snatched the gun from Kittan's hands. \"Normal? Are you nuts? I don't want to go back to being normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Simon! We don't know if this thing is dangerous! If anything happened to you Kamina would kill me!\" Kittan argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at me! Do I look like I'm sick or in pain?\" Simon said, flexing his biceps. He pulled his jacket open more, showing off his thick chest and rock hard abs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...but...ah, I don't know! This is all too weird! Who made this thing anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shrugged and said, \"Maybe it's a weapon from a long time ago...before everyone was forced underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that thing is the <i>reason</i> everyone is underground!\" Kittan said ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smiled and said, \"I'll make sure no one abuses it.\" He stuck it in his pants pocket and crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I'm going to let you keep that thing to yourself?\" Kittan said, cracking his knuckles. \"This is something that should be shared with the whole crew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon scratched his cheek and picked the gun back up. \"Maybe you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fiddled with the switch and aimed at Kittan, a bit of a mischievous smile on his face. \"Here, let me share it with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled the trigger, a beam of energy striking Kittan on the chest, knocking him back into the wall! What setting had Simon left it on?</span></div></div>",

He looked up at Simon, with a smile on his face. At least, he did until he saw that Simon was getting higher and higher up! Simon had a wicked grin on his face as he watched Kittan get lower and lower to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What the hell... Why aren't I growing like you did!?\" Kittan said, his voice sounding a pitch squeaky to Simon. Simon chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it obvious? I turned it to shrink you!\" Simon replied, \"Only me and you know about this right now, and I can't have you telling everyone about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kittan continued to shrink, Simon reached down and made a grab at him. Kittan lunged back, narrowly avoiding the large kid's hand. He immediately got to his feet and began to run away. Simon scowled, and started to walk tword him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan ran as fast as he could, stumbling over the bits of carpet as he tried to get away. Simon, on the other hand, started to smile. He knew Kittan couldn't get away. And each step he took felt that much heavier than it used to! Kittan found it harder to move when there was a miniature earthquake every few seconds! Thud... Thud... THUD! Simon chuckled darkly to himself as he watched Kittan stumble with every few steps he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was soon able to bend down and snatch Kittan right up! He held the tiny, six inch man up to his face. \"Sorry! Looks like I win this time!\" Simon said to Kittan. \"Don't worry! I'll make sure to take good care of you...\" Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! What are you going to do to me!?\" Kittan demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\" Simon replied. He then stuck Kittan down his shorts! Kittan was immediately forced into a warm cave, straddling Simon's huge boyhood! Simon headed out of the room, making sure to tuck the gun into his pocket the best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked back, Simon had a smile on his face. He could feel Kittan wiggling around in his pants, and it was starting to get him a little stiff! At times, Simon had to stop to regain control lest he break out moaning. Kittan, in the meantime, was having less fun. He tried working around, trying to get free. In doing so, he ended up stroking and rubbing up against Simon's dick, leaving the boy a hot mess. The space in Simon's pants continued to lessen, as his cock began to engorge with blood and fill out what little room was left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Simon just managed to get back to his room! He sighed, before letting out a little giggle. Walking over, he set his gun down on the nightstand, before reaching in and plucking Kittan right out of his pants!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan sputtered as he was pulled out, and started to take deep breaths, letting cool, fresh air into his lungs. \"Alright... Now how am I going to keep you quiet...?\" Simon said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya mean!? I wasn't going to tell anyone anyway!\" Kittan barked back. Simon gave the blonde a light shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know that! Now then...\" Simon began, \"I think I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kittan picked his ears. Did he just hear Simon right? Was he going to make himself even bigger!? The disbelief was only confirmed as he looked up at Simon's smiling face. It was clear the boy had intentions that would only benefit himself! Kittan let out a gulp, backing up a little...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon looked over himself. \"I look pretty good...\" He started to say, \"But I could always get a whole lot bigger!\" Simon took the gun out of his pocket and looked at it. He twirled it around on his finger, before looking back at the dial. \"Lets see...\" He mumbled. With a little effort, he pushed it down to the muscular outline! Not wasting another moment, he turned the gun back on himself, and fired!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon took the blast, moving back a few footsteps, but taking it like a man! He grinned as he could feel new power coursing through him. Kittan fell backwards, only able to look up at the boy as he grew even bigger... Simon shoulders suddenly tore throught what remained of his jacket! His back expanded outward even more, forcing the remains of the jacket to flutter down to the floor. It was now that his pecs started swelling up even further, going from a toned swimmer size to a thick bodybuilder size! It was like a basketball had been cut in half and put on his chest! Simon flexed his pecs, making them bounce, not even noticing as his lithe arms quickly began to increase in size, biceps reaching baseball, then softball size, and going on even further! It accidentally forced the boy to drop the gun to the ground! Simon's waistline became thinner, but his hips grew larger! A long line of steel-hard abs sprouted and deeped on the boy's once flat core, before his young, bouncy ass quicky began putting on some mass! His boyhood grew even bigger, slowly undoing his zipper, and barely held back by a pair of skin-tight briefs that even highlighted his inflated balls, churning with juices. They were pressed tight against his large, beefy thighs which had become so massive they began to rub up against each other! Simon's calves had also been bulking up, nearly the size of softballs themselves at this point! Just then, his feet exploded from his boots, leaving them two tattered pieces leather at his massive feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon laughed, putting his hands on his hips and bouncing his huge, heavy pecs in front of Kittan. \"What do you think of me now!?\" He barked at him, watching as the puny man only watched in horror. His arms rose up, and he flexed his two enormous biceps, Kittan forced to watch as the muscles rose up higher and higher, even higher than he was tall! Simon chuckled. \"Yeah... These are the arms of a REAL man! They're even bigger than you!\" Simon got down close, and held his arms right by Kittan. The blonde gulped as he could see a vein pulsing right along the engorged muscles. His eyes must have been playing tricks on him, because he could have swore Simon was getting even bigger! Simon just laughed. \"Ha, a runt like you can't even comprehend a man as massive as me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon was experiencing something he had never felt before! Pure, unquestionable power! People had always made jokes about him, whether they were serious or not! \"Not as manly as Kamina, still just a boy, the weakest person in the group...\" Simon just grinned. Now he had the power to prove every single one of them otherwise! He would be the manliest man of them all! HE would be the one they tell tales of manliness about! Simon turned to the mirror, and started to flex, showing off every one of his massive, powerful muscles off. Nothing, or no one, could compare to the hulking man he was now! He continued to grin, feeling confident and cocky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Kittan shook his head, breaking himself from the newfound fear he had for Simon! He looked around, trying to find that little chrome gun! It was his only hope! He immediately spotted it, not too far from Simon's feet! He gulped... Could he really do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the best possible scenario, he could make it, fire a few blasts at Simon's mirror which would hopefully bounce off and hit him! At least then he could grab the gun and make a run for the door! In the worst case scenario... He'd end up crushed under Simon's titanic feet. Kittan gulped. He wasn't one to be afraid!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan looked over to Simon's bed, and made a jump for it! He manage to land right on the pillow! He made his way as fast as he could, down the bed before clinging to the blanket and riding down it to the floor. Kittan now tiptoed closer... Closer to the gun. He could have swore he heard Simon grunting as he mumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Bigger! Stronger! I'm the manliest man of them all... No one could compare to this beautiful body...\" The young boy said to himself. Kittan just shook his head. He made it right to the gun, thankfully without being noticed! Simon must have been too in love with his own massive body to see him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan used his whole body to switch the knob to the taller setting! ... He then stopped and thought. \"Why not taller AND stronger?\" He smiled to himself. Being just a little greedy, he turned it to the taller, stronger man instead! He then angled the gun so it would hit the mirror and fire back at him! Taking one last gulp, he used all the strength in his arms to pull back the trigger...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, Kittan had kicked the barrel of the gun as he was trying to pull the trigger, changing the trajectory of the blast. As it hit the mirror, it ricocheted at an awkward angle, hitting Simon! Kittan slapped himself in the forehead. Talk about the worst possible outcome!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon got a quizzical look on his face as he felt energy surge through his body. His expression quickly turned to one of pure bliss as he felt his body pushing out in all directions, swelling larger as he grew taller! Simon's shorts, the only piece of clothing left on his body beyond his briefs, started to tear, big rips appearing all over the legs and the ass of his pants, his ass bursting through it like it was made of paper! His thighs exploded out of the legs of his pants, the belt that loosely held them up unraveling and falling to the floor, leaving Simon in nothing but a pair of skin tight briefs, the back riding up his cheeks, showing off half of each slab while his cock and balls grew so heavy they pulled down the waistband of his briefs, revealing the thick base of his dick along with a small bush of blue hair. His upper body went through more changes, his chest bulging from basketball size to medicine ball size, his shoulders broadening while his abs popped out, row by row, another row sprouting up under the first six, his back flaring out, his head rising closer and closer to the ceiling. His massive toes wiggled as his feet moved along the carpet. Simon's eyes were closed in pure bliss until he felt his head lightly strike the ceiling. He opened them up and grinned, his hands running over his body. \"Holy crap! And I thought I was huge before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to flex again, bending down slightly, his ass bulging out towards Kittan as the titanic boy began exploring his body all over again. Kittan cursed and tried to re aim the gun before seeing that Simon's huge back was blocking the mirror completely! \"Well...I can still shrink him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving fast, he started turning the dial, each push taxing his already tired arms. By the time he had highlighted the shrinking silhouette, his arms were shaking too badly to pull the trigger! \"D-Dammit! How did I get myself into this mess...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon chuckled and turned, slowly walking over to Kittan. Every step made the floor shake menacingly, Kittan's body vibrating as he looked up...and up...and up at Simon! The massive boy grinned and reached down, grabbing the gun in one hand and Kittan in the other. \"Did you do this to me little man? You like seeing a big guy like me get even bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan froze, thinking carefully about his response. Should he lie? If he got on Simon's good side he might be able to get out of this more easily! Unfortunately, before he could even begin to lie, Simon looked at the gun and saw that the gun was turned on shrink. \"What's this? ...Oh, I see! You were trying to get big again and ended up making ME bigger! What an idiot!\" He laughed loudly, his chest shaking attractively as he laughed. Kittan grit his teeth and shouted, \"Shut up you little bastard! I'll make you pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon chuckled and shook his head. \"Nah, you're not going to make me pay for anything! You on the other hand have to answer for trying to make me little again! Hmm...what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought, he tapped the gun against the side of his head. His face lit up as an idea came to  him. \"I know! Why don't I just make YOU even smaller?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe aimed the barrel at Kittan, grinning evilly. Kittan shook his head and shouted, \"NONONONONONO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis couldn't be happening! Not again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Simon was about to pull the trigger...</span></div></div>",

It was like a flea bite to Simon, but it was still enough to make him flinch! Flinch just enough to loosen his grip for a brief second, and allow Kittan to slip through! Kittan fell down, falling into the blanket that was draped over the bed, and sliding down onto the carpet down below! The man groaned a little before getting to his feet! He immediately began to sprint at Simon examined his finger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Simon looked at his finger. There was a red mark, but it didn't look like Kittan drew any blood. Simon shook it off and looked down at the ground to find out just where Kittan was! Kittan himself had just dived under the bed, taking cover before he was spotted! Simon got down on all fours to start scanning the carpet, shaking the ground beneath Kittan!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan snuck around a book beneath Simon's bed, and crouched down, trying to remain hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you Kittan!?\" Simon said angrily. His hand reached under the bed and started sweeping around for Kittan! Kittan, who had his back up against the spine of the book, watched as Simon's thick fingers swept around... Just as they came near, Kittan made a run for it! ... But it was to no avail. Simon's hand easily caught Kittan, and the blonde was pulled out from under the bed! Kittan could only struggle fruitlessly as Simon's hand squeezed just a little bit tighter around Kittan...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan was soon brought right up to Simon's face, an angry look on the giant as there was a frightened look on the tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna bite me? Maybe I'll just bite you!\" Simon said, tossing Kittan into his mouth! Kittan's world instantly went black as he was tossed into his wet prison. He curled up on the tongue just in time to dodge Simon's deadly teeth clamping his foot off! Kittan felt as the tongue tossed him onto Simon's molars! Just before they came down, Kittan rolled aside against Simon's cheek, barely making his escape once more from certain doom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this Simon! What's it gonna accomplish if you kill me!?\" Kittan shouted from within the mouth. In response, Simon just tilted his head so that Kittan fell from his hiding spot back onto the tongue. This time, Simon pushed Kittan against the roof of his mouth, and gave him a good licking! Kittan felt a bit confused for a moment before he had the thought: \"Is he... Tasting me?\" Kittan soon fell back onto the tongue, where Simon tried to push him on his molars again to crush him. Kittan was agile and lucky enough to avoid another crunching!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! What would Kamina think if he saw you doing this!?\" Kittan said, trying to get to Simon any way he could. \"Would Kamina kill his friends!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon stopped for a moment, and thought.

He was soon plucked from between Simon's lips, and held out in front of the younger man. He smiled at Kittan, making the older male shiver a little, if not from the fact he was still coated with Simon's saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know! How about you tell me something...\" Simon told Kittan, that cocky little smile still on his face. He walked over and took a seat on his bed. Setting Kamina down, center of him between his open legs! \"I heard there's a special thing that adults do. I want you to tell me what it is!\" Simon insisted, folding his arms over his thick chest. Kittan gulped as he looked up at the massive kid that was towering over him like a mighty tree! That deep nervousness was still there, and it was only made worse by the absurdity of the command he was given! Kittan gulped, before he was finally able to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-A thing?\" He stammered, looking aside briefly, \"You mean... Sex?\" Kittan knew that he had to get to the point. Simon would probably get annoyed and eat him up if he wasn't satisfied with the response!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Is that what they call it?\" Simon asked, \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is... Sex?\" Kittan choked out, still unable to overcome the slight awkwardness of the situation. \"W-Well... When two people... Y-You know... They decide to do... A thing with each other.\" Kittan rambled. Simon was getting impatient, and picked Kittan up! It elicited a little \"meep!\" from the smaller man!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do they do?\" Simon asked, his eyes narrowing as he stared Kittan down. \"No, wait, I have a better idea! You're gonna show me!\" Simon ordered! He laid down on his bed, and set Kittan down on top of him, leaving the miniature man on top of a canyon of deep, warm, bulging muscles! \"Come on! And it better be cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan gulped, looking down at Simon's body. He could see the young man's bulge, still barely clad in a pair of brown shorts. He couldn't help but wonder if what he was about to do was good or not... But if it didn't please Simon, he wouldn't be one Simon's body anymore... He would be IN it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on!\" Simon whined impatiently, wanting Kittan to get on with it! Kittan shook his head, and let out a deep breath. He started making the short trek down Simon's body to his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe called over to Simon, \"Take off your pants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why?!\" Simon shouted necessarily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to show you or not?!\" Kittan said, finding his balls as he shouted right back at the kid! Simon grumbled a little, before undoing his button and unzipping his pants. Kittan braced himself against his abs before he slowly slid his pants right off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I'm doing!\" Simon told Kittan, a blush apparent on his face as he laid there. Kittan sighed, and got into the waistband of Simon's underwear! He squirmed inside, making Simon shiver a little with his first feeling of being touched down there! Kittan only had to make his way through a short little forest of pubes, each of them tickling and pricking in equal measures as he made his way to Simon's cock. He was soon at the base, and sighed. He closed his eyes and slowly laid down on top of it, and started to lick. The gun had enhanced it, making it so thick that Kittan couldn't get his arms around it! He kept licking and licking, his mind trying to flutter elsewhere as he did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just pretend it's Kamina... Just pretend it's Kamina...\" He chanted in his mind, lapping over and over! Simon couldn't stop himself from gasping, and soon, moaning!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh god... I-It feels so good!\" He groaned, his hands reached around and squeezing at his bedsheets! \"Don't stop! Keep going!\" He ordered, \"Do more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKitta could feel himself rising up already, Simon getting aroused easily by his first time! Kittan squeezed his arms around it as tight as he could, and kept grinding his hips into Simon's throbbing erection as he kissed it. Simon couldn't resist, pushing his hands down on top of it, only to have it rise up against! Simon moaned even louder now, his touching only making it feel even better! \"Mmmm...! Oh man, I want more! Kittan, do more!\" Simon ordered, \"O-Or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan whimpered~ He started inching himself up higher, getting closer to that pink fleshy head of Simon's cock, licking his lips and steeling himself to finish the job! Simon kept pushing down over and over, making Kittan rub up against his dick with every touch! Kittan soon reached the breadth of his manhood, and gently started licking, his tongue making Simon go weak in his knees!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh man! Ki-Kittan, I'm gonna pee!\" He shouted, unfamiliar with the feeling in his dick. His balls seemed to swell for a moment before then letting loose a flood of cum throughout him, a flurry of pleasure tingling through his body as he came in his underwear, getting everything soaked, not to mention Kittan! The little blonde man soon doused in a torrent of the white, sticky liquid all over him! Simon was moaning, almost as if he was in pain, before he finally took a deep breath, his head turned to the side as he was finally able to relax!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... That... Felt amazing...!\" Simon mumbled, looking down past his pecs and into his underwear! \"I wanna do that again, but... I'm not sure if I can...!\" Kittan kept quiet. He'd jerked off plenty of times, and he was struck with a sense of calming when he knew what came after!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmph... Kittan... Where are you...?\" He called out, before he slowly closed his eyes, \"I... I want... You to do that again... Mmmm...\" Simon tilted his head, his whole body completely relaxed! Kittan only had to wait a few minutes more before everything went quiet! Simon had fallen fast asleep!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kittan, covered in Simon's cum, exhausted, and pissed off at this absurd situation, one in which he had almost been swallowed whole like a damn piece of food, had only one goal in his mind: make Simon pay! And the only way he was going to be able to do THAT was to get the gun! At first he imagined growing even bigger than Simon, towering over him, pinning him under one of his massive, manly feet or dangle him over his open mouth, tease him like he was going to swallow him up! But what better revenge would there be than merely restoring them both to their proper sizes and forcing Simon to pleasure him in the same way he had just pleasured the young man? Kittan grinned, blushing slightly as he imagined forcing Simon to suck his cock, his big hands holding the back of the smaller male's head, releasing a hot load directly down Simon's throat! That would teach him a lesson about who was the top man around here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kittan slowly shimmied his way out of Simon's incredibly tight underwear, his thoughts turned to using the gun for other purposes, giving himself a bit of a boost and finally dominating Kamina in bed, making the proud man submit to his will! Or maybe even letting Kamina get to be big, his giant mouth sucking and stimulating his smaller body. The gun had a plethora of possibilities, each more enticing than being a sex toy to a kid. He managed to drag himself out of Simon's underwear, sprawling out on the boy's cobblestone path of abs, his buffed chest slowly rising and falling as he slumbered, worn out after his first assisted sexual experience. Kittan slowly got to his feet, looking at his surroundings. Off in the distance, he saw to his dismay, was the gun, sitting innocently on Simon's desk. \"Dammit! He must have set it down when he started messing with me!\" Kittan muttered to himself, glaring at how far away the gun was. \"But it doesn't matter! No way in hell am I going to give up at this point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to make his way down Simon's body and onto the bed when the doorknob suddenly started moving violently, someone trying to get in! Simon had locked the door but it sounded as though whoever was trying to get in had a key! Not wanting to be caught in such a compromising position (covered in dry cum on top of Simon's sleeping body, the boy himself bigger than even the biggest man on the crew) Kittan groaned and dove back at Simon's waistband, hiding in the one place near enough that was sure to discourage most people from looking. He peeked his head out slightly as the door was flung open, an energetic young red haired boy running in, a grin on his face. He was dressed in his usual outfit, his skinny arms visible through the shirt/cape combo he wore, his skinny legs equally on display from out of his shorts. His normal pair of brown shoes had been discarded since he was inside, his bare feet sinking slightly into the carpet. He slammed the door and locked it, snickering. A small, female voice suddenly called out, \"No fair Gimmy! You can't hide in rooms when we're playing tag remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGimmy stayed silent, his hands covering his mouth as he tried to stifle his laughter. Darry knocked a few more times before giving off a plaintive sigh, her soft footsteps disappearing as she gave up. Gimmy flopped down onto the floor, rolling on his back, holding his stomach as he laughed loudly. \"That'll teach her for being so quiet all the time! How am I supposed to find her and win when she never says anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a childish reason for basically cheating at a game he couldn't otherwise win but Gimmy was a kid after all. His laughter eventually subsided as he laid there, tears springing to his eyes. He wiped them away as he got to his feet, a little unsteadily at first. \"Good thing Simon gave me the key to his room.\" He said, hiccuping a little, a small giggle escaping from his lips. He suddenly got a good whiff of the air inside the room, his nose wrinkling at the unfamiliar and slightly unpleasant smell. \"What is that?\" He said, waving a hand in front of his face. He turned around and jumped, his eyes widening as he saw the nine foot tall Simon stretched out on his bed, nearly naked, his long legs easily clearing the end of the bed, his feet flat on the ground, one massive arm hanging off the side. He was dead asleep, snoring slightly, his hugely muscular body on full display. \"Wooooooow~!\" Gimmy said happily, his eyes sparkling. \"Simon is HUGE~! How did this happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to rush over to explore Simon when he saw a glint of metal out of the corner of his eye. Moving mostly on intuition, he walked over to the desk, picking the gun up off the table. He examined it, noticing the silhouettes and slowly piecing together what the little machine was capable of. \"Ooooh, so THIS is how he did it! And if he could do it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKittan watched the young man  fiddle with the gun, his heart beating wildly in his chest. \"Just what I need, another damn brat getting his hands on that stupid gun!\" He thought bitterly to himself. He was at a crossroads. Should he reveal himself to Gimmy and hope he'll help him? Or continue hiding and see what the red head would do?</span></div></div>",

I'll worry about you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuffed Kittan into his underwear drawer and closed it tight, leaving the tiny man in total darkness, surrounded by cotton briefs. \"Hey! You can't just leave me in here! HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Simon had already left, the device still stowed in his pocket. He ran down the halls until he came to Kamina's room. He carefully opened the door and peeked in. \"Bro? Are you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina's boisterous voice greeted Simon, shouting out, \"Of course I'm awake! I'm not some weak invalid! I should be up and we should be moving on! We've got Beastmen ass to kick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon chuckled and slipped inside, closing the door behind him. \"Take it easy bro! We'll have plenty of time to do that when you're healed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina grinned and thumped his chest. \"I'm fine! Picture of perfect health!\" He suddenly winced as the pain from hitting the wound on his chest finally sunk in. \"G-Gah! Dammit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon hurried to Kamina's bedside and said, \"Seriously bro, don't do stuff like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina sighed and laid back down. \"Yeah, yeah, Yoko said the same thing while she was changing my bandages. I guess I should be grateful you two are looking out for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon blushed a little and smiled. Kamina grinned and said, \"So, what's my little bro been up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon got a slightly shifty look in his eye as he said, \"Doing? What have I been doing? Uh...Not much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah? Then why are you so twitchy?\" Kamina asked, a suspicious gleam in his eye. \"Hey...wait a minute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up and grabbed Simon's wrist, pulling him in closer. His big, slightly rough hand rubbed all over Simon's chest and abs. \"B-Bro! What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha! I knew it! You're buffer! You've been working out on the sly haven't you? I gotta say Simon I'm impressed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really? You are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Looks like my little bro is starting to grow up! I'm proud of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon felt a little guilty now. It would have been fine if he had actually worked out and earned this body of his, but he had gotten it through cheating means. \"Actually...I kind of had some help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina raised his eyebrow at that. \"Oh yeah? What kind of help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon pulled the device out of his pocket and said, \"This did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina grabbed it and shook it up, holding it to his ear. \"What, this gun thing? It doesn't even sound like it's loaded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful bro! You'll set it off!\" Simon said, trying to grab it back from Kamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is some kind of joke, isn't it Simon?\" Kamina said, grinning, his thumb playing with the switch without him actually looking at what he was switching it to. \"You're trying to pull one over on me! This is some kind of water gun isn't it? You come in here and tell me I can get bigger with this thing and then BAM! I'm all wet! That's pretty good, but not quite good enough to get me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon just stared incredulously at Kamina. \"T-That's insane! Why would I go through that much trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Simon, looks like I'm just too clever for ya!\" Kamina said, snickering. \"Now...time for you to get drenched!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving Simon so much as a second to even think, Kamina pulled the trigger, blasting Simon in the chest for the second time today. The gun dropped from Kamina's hand as Simon yelped, grabbing his chest. \"Oh man! Simon! I'm sorry! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Don't worry! I'm fine!\" Simon said weakly, smiling at Kamina as he straightened back up. He could already feel his body changing again, but what setting had Kamina switched it to unknowingly?</span></div></div>",

His legs stretched just a little further across the floor, as his head starting moved upward along the wall. His musculature seemed to diminish a bit as it was stretched across his growing body. Kamina didn't seem to notice as his bro's growth as he sat on the floor, but that didn't stop him from worrying about what he just did!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Simon!\" Kamina shouted, sitting up. He immediately laid back down. His body was still worse for wear. Simon slowly but surely got back to his feet, holding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm okay!\" He announced, feeling a little bit dizzy. With a shake of his head, he walked over to Kamina and snatched the gun right up from his hands! Moreso for safety reasons than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Kamina shouted aggressively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro, you shouldn't play with this! It's serious business!\" Simon replied. He then stopped as he looked down at Kamina and noticed how much further down the bed was than it was before! Simon cracked a smile in the corner of his lips that went unnoticed by Kamina. Simon made sure to get Kamina back into bed properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two brother-like boys talked with each other. Kamina kept insisting that Simon tell him more about the gun, but Simon would just turn it around on Kamina by worrying for his health. Even as Simon wasn't looking, Kamina kept trying to grab at the chrome colored toy, wanting to experiment with it for himself, but Simon would always just happen to move a few inches away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed, Simon finally got up, stretching tword the ceiling as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, bro, I gotta get going. You have to rest.\" Simon said, smiling at Kamina. If he was seeing things right, he was even taller than Kamina and just a little bit more beefy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Kamina sighed. He still had questions, but he did feel like a little nap would do him good. Kamina laid down in the bed, getting comfortable with his pillow before closing his eyes. He let out a loud yawn before saying, \"See you later, bro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon got up and gave Kamina a tiny kiss on the forehead. Kamina smiled as he opened an eye and looked at Simon for a moment before closing it once more. He was just lucky no one else was in the room. Otherwise Simon would never had dared to do such an act!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night bro.\" Simon said as he began walking to the door. As he stood there with the door open, he glanced back at Kamina. Maybe... A little shot from the gun couldn't hurt... Maybe give him a little bit of a thicker phsyique! Then again, there was no telling if the gun would hurt or help Kamina! Simon began to think for a moment. He slid the ray gun and out of his pocket and set it to the strongman. As he did, the gun suddenly sparked! As if it had a malfunction! Simon actually broke a sweat as he tried to keep quiet. As he looked over at the hospital bed, Kamina was already peacefully sleeping. He must have really been tired!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon gulped... He finally decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon steeled himself and aimed the gun at Kamina. Growing as he had over the last few minutes had given him a boost of confidence he had never known before. So the gun had sparked a little! Big deal! It wasn't like it was making noise or smoking or anything. Kamina would really benefit from a little boost while he was still injured. A bigger body was a healthier body! Simon had personally never felt better in his life! Having come to this decision, Simon pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately he knew that something was different. The gun took long to charge up and when it fired out a bolt of energy, the bolt was bigger and lasted longer than when Simon had gotten hit. The gun seemed to spark again, more fiercely this time! Simon hastily shoved it in his pocket, his shorts even tighter than they had been before. The muzzle of the gun was still warm against his thigh. He would look it over later in his room. For now, his attention was focused on Kamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simon watched, Kamina's chest seemed to push out more and more with every breath, his pecs growing thicker and wider and fuller, stretching the bandages placed along the once modest mounds. His abs followed suit, each row popping out like cobblestones on a road. His shoulders popped and broadened while his biceps inflated like an air hose was attached to them, veins slowly rising to the surface. Kamina's breathing seemed to increase as his entire torso pulsed, growing bigger and bigger and bigger! The bandages began to rip and tear, Kamina's lightly tanned skin showing between the strips of cloth. Simon's eyes widened as his bro's snoring suddenly grew louder as his neck thickened, his traps rising up like a wall around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina's legs were not left out of the growth. His thighs thickened and bulged outward, his calves following suit, each mound bunching up into a rock hard diamond of power! Simon blushed as he saw Kamina's package push out, his pants straining as a new burden was added to it. Kamina's ass pumped up behind him as well, his back flaring out. There seemed to be no end in sight! Every few seconds Simon noticed a new muscle growing bigger, taking up more and more space on Kamina's body! By the time his growth slowed to a halt his chest looked like someone had cut a medicine ball in two and shoved both halves under his skin, his biceps looking like overinflated basketballs while each individual ab were the size of an average man's chest! His thighs were rubbing together, even as he just laid there, his package and ass both looking overinflated. His whole body looked pumped to the max! Simon wasn't even sure if Kamina would be able to move...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon pulled the gun out of his pocket. He needed to fix this! Changing the setting to the giant man he pointed the gun at Kamina once again and fired. To Simon's dismay the energy bolt was even bigger, the gun sparking even more violently. Simon felt himself get a shock, nearly forcing him to drop the gun. He shoved it in his pocket and anxiously watched Kamina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina quickly began to swell and grow, his feet inching towards the edge of the bed before they moved passed it, his arms dangling down either side while his head and back began to move up the wall. The bed creaked and groaned before the legs finally gave out, sending Kamina to the ground with a crash! The last remnants of his bandages were soon ripped off, his pants reduced to nothing more than a pair of shorts. Kamina let out a grunt, but remained sleeping as his body began to fill the room! Simon whimpered slightly as his bro's foot was getting dangerously close to him, nearly reaching his size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth came to a stop when Kamina half filled the room, his head nearly pressed to the ceiling while his shoulders were nearly touching either wall. His legs were bent, his toes nearly brushing Simon's knees. The young digger sighed as he looked at the mess he had created. Then again...even though Kamina was ridiculously huge, his wounds seemed to have miraculously healed, his breathing stronger. Simon smiled as he patted the gun in his pocket. He was glad he had found this thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

Just then there was a loud crack! Before either of them knew what was going on, the tiny bed that was fighting to hold up the massive Kamina snapped, and shatterd onto the floor underneath Kamina's magnificent ass. Kamina shouted, \"Whoa!\" As he looked down. A grin slid across his face as he realized how massive he was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina's arm rose up, and he flexed his arm as hard as he could. It erupted in size, engorging with blood as it did! Kamina chuckled as he then turned and gave his pecs a flex. He then looked down and got an even bigger smile once he saw just how mind-bendingly huge the symbol of his manhood was! Kamina laughed, his hands running all over his gigantic body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be in a dream...!\" Kamina said to himself. He got a little frown. \"That really sucks... I wish this wasn't a dream...\" Kamina moped. \"... Oh well! Why waste it?\" He said, smiling once more. It was at this exact moment he noticed Simon standing there in the doorway. \"Simon! Buddy!\" Kamina said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Simon could make a move, Kamina's hand reached down and picked Simon right up! He brought the smaller male up to his face and gave him a kiss, which covered Simon's entire head! Kamina still had that dumb smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're here! Check me out!\" Kamina said, setting Simon down on the ground right in front of his package. He put his hands on his hips and flexed his entire upper body, from bulging biceps to bouncing pecs. \"Pretty damn sexy, huh? Just when I though I couldn't get any manlier...!\" Kamina chuckled. \"I could crush Lagann under my huge feet!\" Kamina grinned, flexing his toes. \"I just might have to try that before I wake up...!\" Kamina mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But bro, you're--\" Simon tried to interrupt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet Simon! You don't interrupt a beast like me when he's checking himself out!\" Kamina snapped. One of his hands rose up and rubbed along his flexed bicep. It pulsed softly under his touch, which made Kamina smile. He ran both hands down his bulging pecs, and rippling abs. \"Fuck yeah...\" Kamina said under his breath. His hands wandered from his abs to his thighs, which he started to rub up and down. \"Aw yeah...\" Kamina repeated, almost lustfully. \"Hey Simon! You gotta feel these things!\" Kamina insisted. He plucked Simon up and set him on his thigh. Simon was hesitant at first, but he soon began rubbing his thigh. Kamina stopped and laid back, a low, gutteral moan escaping his lips as Simon rubbed his thigh. \"Y-Yeah... A little lower...\" Kamina requested. Simon slid over, and rubbed there, but Kamina wasn't satisfied. \"Lower.\" He ordered his little bro. Simon slid down off the thigh and rubbed the inner part, with Kamina's thigh pressed right up against his back! Kamina's toes began to flex, as his head leaned back. \"Ohhh yeah! Right there!\" Kamina moaned, his leg kicking a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time that...</span></div></div>",

With a swift movement that seemed impossible for a man his size, Kamina reached down and snatched Simon by the back of his jacket, lifting him up to his face. \"Now hand it over!\" he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Bro, I really don't think that's a good idea!\" Simon replied, pulling the gun out of his pocket and holding it close to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina snorted and said, \"The hell it isn't! This is my dream and I'm going to do what I want in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his hand, jiggling Simon's body like a set of keys, before continuing. \"So either you give me that gun or I'm going to...I'm going to...hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina seemed lost in thought for a second. With his new, bigger body, he could do so much to threaten a little guy like Simon with! Not that he'd ever truly hurt him, dream or otherwise! But Simon didn't need to know that and the little guy scared so easily that all Kamina had to do was pretend a bit and he'd give up the gun. He flexed his toes...Simon could fit under his foot easily. Or between his thick, beefy pecs. Or even under his magnificent balls, the weight of his penis pushing down on top of him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina shifted a little, his dick twitching. Man, why did that all sound so appealing? There was just something about the power this body had...it was intoxicating! After what felt like an eternity to Simon (who had spent it trying to desperately change the setting on the gun without Kamina noticing and shrink him back down to normal) Kamina's gaze focused back in on him and the giant said, his voice low and rumbling, \"Give me the guy...or I'll eat you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina opened his mouth as he said this, giving Simon a front row seat to his fate if he didn't comply. Rows of bright white teeth, a massive, powerful, slimy looking tongue, a slightly pulsing cavern that led down to Kamina's belly, the uvula, swaying with Kamina's breathing, the moist air rushing out over him...it was like some horrible nightmare come to life! Simon whimpered and said, \"N-No way bro! I can't! You can't! We can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina chuckled and stuck his tongue out, licking Simon's tiny body, covering him in saliva. \"Mmm~ Man, you sure taste good Simon! Five seconds or you're getting a one way trip to my gut!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon yelped as Kamina's hand lifted him higher into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina tilted his head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth opened even wider, strings of saliva visible between the upper and lower rows of teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fingers started to come uncurled as Kamina prepared to drop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Okay! You win! I'll give it to you!\" Simon said desperately, holding the gun out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina chuckled and grabbed the tiny weapon, dropping Simon back down on the ground in front of his junk. \"Hah! Thanks little bro! I knew you wouldn't keep it from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon, still slightly shaky, got to his feet and watched helplessly as Kamina began to fiddle with the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Can't really tell what this thing is...or does!\" Kamina said, slightly annoyed. He turned it so he could see the bottom, the muzzle aimed at Simon. Using his fingernail, he poked at the trigger, accidentally setting it off! A beam fired off again and struck Simon in the chest. The gun sparked again, even more fiercely, making even Kamina wince, a small firework worth of sparks erupting from the gun. Simon didn't notice this fact, however, as he was forced back onto his ass, clutching at his chest where the beam had struck. Kamina smacked himself on the head and said, \"Aw geez! That's the second time I did that to you! You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nodded and got to his feet. \"Y-Yeah! No problem! I'm fine...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could say anything more, Simon let out a low moan, leaning over slightly. Kamina raised an eyebrow, wondering what Simon was doing, when he noticed that his little bro was starting to grow! His mouth dropped open as he watched Simon inch taller and wider, his shoulders ripping through his jacket, his flaring back aiding in the destruction. His respectable chest suddenly surged forward, rounding and plumping up while his abs rose like bread baking in the oven, rock hard and unstoppable! His biceps swelled up, growing bigger and rounder, two enormous mounds of tough muscle! His forearms thickened as well, giving his increasingly manly hands a better grip. His neck thickened and his traps began to rise up around it, his youthful face looking out of place on such a hulk his body was becoming!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs were next, the thighs bloating out, the small tears on his shorts expanding until the shorts were nothing more than scraps of material fluttering to the floor. His calves followed suit, a perfect diamond shape forming while his feet thickened and widened, his toes gripping the carpet as they spread across it. His cock wasn't left out, reeling out inch after inch while his balls swelled heavily underneath it, shredding his underwear completely, his thick, bouncy ass doing the same in the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's growth came to a halt when he was able to look Kamina in the face, his head pressed up against the ceiling. His breathing was a little ragged as he stood there, looking into Kamina's eyes. Kamina was still over twice his height, though they were equal for now while Kamina was sitting down. They just stared at each other for a minute...before Kamina suddenly said</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Hey hey hey hey hey! I'm the big guy in this dream!\" Kamina barked at Simon. Simon gulped a little. Kamina began to fiddle with the tiny gun in his huge hands. It was hard to see, let along work the thing! He pointed it back at himself, and dug his nail in so it pulled the trigger back! But Kamina didn't pull just once, no, he pulled it a good four times before waiting for it to fire! The machine fizzled and sparked, before firing a huge blast right at Kamina! The resulting beam made Kamina drop the gun on the floor, but he was about to gain so much more...!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a strange colored beam burst into his chest, Kamina could feel his entire body immediately heat up! His pecs pushed out further and further, swelling out from his chest until they slammed Simon right in the face! His shoulders pressed out, slamming into either side of the room, before crashing right through them! Kamina kept growing, getting bigger and bigger and BIGGER! Poor little Simon was being left in the dust! Kamina's biceps grew to the size of hills, then the size of a tall dune! There was no end in sight, as the engorged veins on his arms pumped blood into his growing muscles, feeding them and only forcing them up bigger! Kamina's abs pushed up, each of them like a set of pecs themselves! In fact, in just a short time, they were the size of Simon's pecs! Kamina's thighes continued to thicken up, and push agains the far walls, before they broke free, allowing the titan of a man to spread his legs! A thick, heavy musk spread throughout the room in seconds! Kamina's bulging thighs struggled to keep up, while Kamina's feet had long since broken out of the door and into the hallways before crashing into yet another room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina just seemed to grow, and grow, and grow, and GROW! There was no end to his growth in sight! Simon, at this point, was nothing more than a toy on his hulking behemoth of a brother figure! Thankfully for everyone, it seemed to be slowing to a stop. Kamina fell on his back, letting out a long, pleasured groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... Oh man, that felt awesome!\" Kamina said with a bit smile on his face. His gargantuan, muscled ass had crushed his old hospital room, while his beast of a cock was poking right where a door used to be! Kamina felt a little wiggle, before realizing just how much of a \"man\" he really was! It only made him grin even wider!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina slowly sat up, and looked down, barely even able to see past his swollen pecs at the puny little Simon that was gazing up at him from his abs. Kamina gave his pecs a little bounce, one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, whatcha think bro? You like looking at the body of a REAL man?\" Kamina slowly took a huge breath, his pecs pushing out further and further until he couldn't even see Simon anymore! \"Ohhh yeah...\" He grunted under his breath. Still keeping it in, Kamina rose his two mountainous arms up and slowly flexed them, watching as the muscles pushed up, bulging to the brim with unquestionable strength! \"Yeah... Lookit those guns...\" Kamina grunted, flexing them over and over to pump them up and make them look even bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina let out the huge puff of air, before slowly panting as he looked down at Simon. He got another smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... Bro... How about we go beat up some beastment?\" Kamina asked. Before Simon could even reply, he was picked up by Kamina and the giant, kong of a man started heading to the mountains with him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simon couldn't help but tremble in the tight grip of Kamina's fist. Whenever Simon had been at his most scared, whenever he had needed someone to rely on, Kamina was always there for him. But what could comfort him now that Kamina was CAUSING him fear? He glanced back at the ruined Dai Gurren, the massive ship Gunmen that Kamina had half destroyed outgrowing. There hadn't been any casualties as far as Simon could tell, which was probably due to most of the team flying out to patrol the area for any signs of Beastmen. \"Maybe I can fix it with my Drill Core...\" Simon thought to himself, reaching for his neck before remembering he had left it in his room. At his size, the little necklace wouldn't fit around his wrist let alone his thick neck! Simon glanced up at Kamina again, barely able to see his cocky face from over the enormous swelling of his tanned pecs. Looking over his massive body, Kamina seemed not just perfectly healed but somehow better than he had been at his healthy, normal size. He seemed to be stand straighter, his expression was even more confident than before, and even the blue tattoos adorning his torso seemed more vivid! Simon couldn't help but blush, his fear ebbing away slowly. That strange gun had been left behind in the ship, so Kamina couldn't make himself any bigger at least...but then again, he couldn't be shrunken back down either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon's thoughts were interrupted by Kamina giving him a light squeeze. The tiny boy looked up to see Kamina grinning down at him. Simon's heart started beating a little faster. Kamina lifted him up to his face and gently rubbed Simon's head with his thumb. \"Hey, don't look so freaked out little guy! I'm not about to hurt you. You may be puny, but you're still my bro! Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon couldn't help but smile. Even as huge as he was, he was still the same brother figure he had always known and loved. \"You got it bro!\" Simon said happily, all fear now gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now let's put a little more distance between us and the others so we can have some private time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure bro! That sounds...great~\" Simon said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina deposited Simon on top of his left shoulder and started walking again, his massive feet making the ground quake enormously with every step! The gigantic trail of footprints Kamina's big bare feet were leaving behind would make it easy to retrace their steps and head back to Dai Gurren when the time came. Simon wiggled around a little on top of Kamina's shoulder, the thick muscles surprisingly soft and warm under him. He looked along Kamina's shoulder and couldn't help but be impressed by how his broad shoulders led to his massive traps which rose majestically around his thick neck. Looking out in front of him, Kamina's chest was like a huge mountain, casting a shadow over his abs. Kamina's dick twitched with every step, the sheer power slowly turning the titanic man on. Simon gulped, blushing a little. He had seen Kamina naked before, on several occasions but now it just seemed so much more...primal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Kamina came upon a canyon and nodded. \"Yeah, this will work!\" He stepped down inside it, the edges barely reaching his waist. He sat down, his wide hips forcing their way between the canyon walls, widening it slightly, Kamina's massive ass landing with a resounding BOOM, effectively damming the river winding down at the bottom of the canyon. Kamina sighed and leaned back, resting his arms on the ground on either side of the canyon. \"Yeah, this is a good place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned over at Simon and said, \"Well Simon? You ready to have some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon perked up and said, \"Yeah! What did you have in mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina indicated his enormous body and said, \"You've been staring so hard at me I feel like I'm going to get holes in this gorgeous body! So, how about you just do whatever you want on it while I watch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon blushed, embarrassed that Kamina had noticed his staring. However, the offer was far too tempting to refuse! \"Okay! I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina grinned and reached up, his thick index finger poking Simon in his muscled back. \"Go on then! Start low and make your way up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, he gently flicked Simon, sending the boy careening down Kamina's left pec with a little yelp. The mountainous muscle underneath him sped by, the edge growing alarmingly close! With a desperate lunge, Simon managed to wrap his arms around Kamina's nipple, stopping his mad descent! Kamina let out a little moan, his sensitive flesh hardening, making it much more difficult for Simon to remain holding on. \"Come on Simon, that's way too high to start! You've got to earn the right to be up next to these pecs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina suddenly started flexing his chest, the thick muscle bunching and bouncing, causing Simon to lose his grip and get launched into the air! As he turned head over heels in the air, he was able to see Kamina bouncing his chest, the thick muscles moving with such force Simon swore he could hear a distant booming sound like thunder. The sight was very...alluring to Simon for some reason he couldn't (or didn't want) to place. He was filled with a determination to reach that point no matter what!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't going to be easy. Even as he thought this he saw Kamina's eight pack stretch out beneath him, each massive brick a hill he would have to climb, every valley between them capable of swallowing his body and crushing it into paste if Kamina so much as leaned forward! Past that was the thick jungle of blue hair that was Kamina's pubes, looking deep and dense, the gigantic shaft of Kamina's dick firmly nestled in the middle of them. It was so long a good portion of it was resting on the canyon floor, eclipsing the now dry river bed. Bordering that was Kamina's bulging thighs, looking as insurmountable as any mountain Simon had encountered. Beyond that was Kamina's calves, smooth and completely unclimbable, lacking even the striations that the thighs had. Lastly, at the very bottom and very far end of Kamina, were his colossal feet, each one capable of smashing apart a gunman without even trying, the thick toes slowly clenching and relaxing as though Kamina was thinking of doing just that. This is where Simon landed, luckily in a pile of brush and debris, his bigger body protecting him from even minor scratches. It was a weird reminder that, just because he was a bug to Kamina, didn't mean that Simon wasn't a giant to others. He slowly got to his feet and looked up at Kamina. From this angle, he was even more impressive. His bright eyes had not left Simon once during his descent and were still fixed on him now, eager to see what he would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon began to take stock of the situation. He looked up at Kamina's arms and was thankful that at least he wouldn't have to try and overcome his biceps, each one looking amazingly bulky even without flexing. He finally decided to start at the foot. Kamina noticed Simon's hesitation and bent his legs so that his knees cleared the edges of the canyon, his feet pressed against the ground. This WAS supposed to be fun for Simon after all. No reason to make it TOO hard~ Simon smiled and rushed over to the right foot, ready to start his ascent up Mt.Kamina!</span></div></div>",

It must have stretched up at least 30 feet, practically the size of a large hill! Simon took a breath and started climbing upwards! If he was going to scale Kamina's gargantuan body, he had to start somewhere!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina began to chuckle. \"B-Bro, your hands tickle!\" He laughed, his toes started to shake and cringe! The wiggling of his toes shook Simon, casting him back down to the ground! Soon, Kamina's big toe had soon stopped flexing and moving around. \"Sorry bro!\" Kamina said, looking down at Simon past his massive pecs! Simon couldn't even see Kamina's mouth from this angle! Were they touching his chin...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No problem, big bro...\" Simon replied casually as he rubbed his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh... <b>Big</b> bro, huh? I like that! I like that a lot! How about you just call me big bro from now on?\" Kamina asked of Simon. The only reason Kamina asked was because he knew what Simon's answer would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing bro! I-I mean big bro!\" Simon replied, quickly correcting himself! With renewed energy Simon hopped up, grabbing onto Kamina's toe! He slowly started working his way back up again, but as he did Kamina had began to laugh again! Simon braced himself on his giant brother's toe, and waited it out while Kamina's giant toe had shook, cracking the ground beneath them! Simon looked back at the ground from high up. It seemed a bit ominous, but Simon paid it no mind. He continued up Kamina's toe, and just managed to grab onto the nail! With a burst of strength, he launched himself up on top and held on tigh as Kamina's toe had begun to move one again! This time, however, Kamina's whole foot had begun to stomp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Simon, you're too much!\" Kamina said, his body curling up slightly as his foot was tickled! He stomped once, then twice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the second stomp, Kamina and Simon both heard a loud crack! The two of them froze instantly! Everything began to shake and move all around them! Kamina had sat up and began looking around, while Simon had held on tight to Kamina! As Kamina looked past his bulging pecs to the ground, cracks were forming all around them! The entire earth was shaking around them, almost like an earthquake!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as it had started, it seemed to have stopped... The two were breathing heavily as they started to regain their composure. But before they were given even a moment's respite, there was a loud CRASH! and they began to spiral downwards, deep, into a dark, gargantuan chasm! The two of them shouted in a moment of fear, unsure what to expect! Thankfully for them, their terror lasted but a moment as Kamina's round, muscular butt crushed some kind of stalagmite! If it was just a little bit more to the right, it would have been shoved right up Kamina's ass! Kamina yelped as the oddly shaped rock was crushed beneath his godly buns of steel! As they landed, dust was blown all over in this underground...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon opened his eyes first. He looked around, and immediately noticed a bunch of small adobe houses, a town square... This was an underground city! But unlike his, this one was far larger! By at least a hundred times! Simon couldn't even see the entire town from where they sat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-Big bro!\" Simon shouted, trying to get Kamina's attention. However, instead, he started making a huge commotion, which caught the attention of the citizens! Simon slowly turned around, looking down at all the tiny people that barely even came up to his knees! Simon got a nervous smile on his face as he looked back at all the people. Simon could tell that by the look on their faces that they were...</span></div></div>",

The silence, however, really did last only a moment. Angry shouts almost immediately erupted from the crowd, everyone talking at once and shaking their fists at Kamina and Simon, some of them actually throwing rocks! The little pebbles were less than an annoyance to Simon and Kamina didn't even feel them as they bounced off his thick skin. \"H-Hey! What are you doing?!\" Simon shouted, stomping his foot angrily, the ground cracking and quaking under it, causing some of the nearby townspeople to fall onto their asses. This seemed to calm the crowd down enough that Simon could actually make out what they were saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They destroyed our god! Now disaster will surely befall us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are they? Demons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this day would come! The end is here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon scratched the back of his head as he heard all of this, standing in front of Kamina's colossal junk. His giant big bro had been knocked out in the fall which explained why he was being so quiet after all that had happened. \"Wait, wait, wait!\" Simon said, raising his hands. \"One at a time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright! Everyone shut up!\" A deep voice called out. Everyone fell silent as a huge, teenaged man stepped out from the crowd. He stood head and shoulders above everyone else and had deep, tanned skin. His body was pumped up hugely. He would have been more muscular than Kamina and Kittan combined if Kamina had been at his normal size. He had short, spiky white hair and was wearing baggy white pants and no shirt, a cape hanging from his thick shoulders, fastened just under his neck by a fancy looking gold ornament. Simon crossed his arms and tried to look tough, even though this rather massive teen was quite intimidating. It probably had something to do with the fact he had intense, red eyes. \"Who are you?\" Simon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Brettner.\" He said, his voice deep and commanding. \"I'm the chief around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you kind of young to be a chief?\" Simon asked, tilting his head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrettner grinned and said, \"My old man died protecting this village. It was an honor taking over for him. As you can see, this village respects me. I'm strong and have protected this place for over two years now. I've dealt with beastmen and gunmen but this is the first time I've seen giant humans...You two are humans, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon nodded emphatically and said, \"Of course we are! We didn't even know a village existed here. Big bro just got a little over excited and we crashed through the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right on top of our guardian deity!\" A voice shouted, soon joined by numerous others. Brettner gritted his teeth and slammed his foot into the ground, the shaking getting everyone's attention again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen up! Whether you meant to or not you crushed our guardian deity! That kind of insult can't go unpunished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon waved his hands and said, \"Well, what do you want from us? It's not like we can rebuild it or anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Brettner could reply, there was a deep moaning sound from high above. Everyone looked up and saw Kamina's gigantic head swing into view, He shook it lightly before staring down at the crowd gathered at his toes. \"...What the hell are you all looking at?\" Kamina always was a little grouchy in the mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big bro, don't make this any worse!\" Simon said, his voice pleading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina looked down, his chin smashing into his chest as he did so. He grunted in annoyance and stuck his legs out, ramming through several more buildings, scattering the crowd. \"Damn cave is too small!\" He grumbled, leaning back and crushing another dozen or so houses just so he could look at Simon. \"Now, what were you saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon sighed and covered his face with his hands briefly before shouting, \"You're causing way too much damage big bro! You're going to get us killed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina raised an eyebrow and said, \"By what? These little shrimps? My toes are bigger than any of them! Hell, most gunmen would barely be able to see over them! Why should I care if I smash up their pathetic little city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon shook his head and said, \"Come on big bro! Don't be mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKamina, still annoyed at being crammed into a cave and having just woke up, was being completely unreasonable. He looked down at the crowd and said, \"You bugs got a problem?\" He grabbed his dick and stroked it a few times, letting it get a little hard before dropping it down over them, pinning a few people under it's massive bulk! \"Tell someone who cares!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intense musk of Kamina's dick was filling the cavern, making everyone light headed. Kamina just grinned arrogantly and moaned, loving how all the little people felt squirming against his hot, sensitive flesh. \"Hey, you bugs actually are good for something! Simon, you want in on this?\" Before Simon could answer, Kamina pointed at a pair of cowering twenty year old males and said, \"You two! Get over here and help my little bro out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon blushed furiously as the two rushed over, pressing against either side of his body. \"N-No! Really! You don't h-ha-haa-have....aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah....\" Simon's protests ended in a prolonged moan as the men began to stroke his cock, their little hands working hard to service the thick rod. Kamina chuckled and bounced his pecs, looking over the rest of the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe dropping down in this place will be fun after all!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After their brief introductions, Kamina was quick to install himself as their new god! Of course, no one of the village was willing to listen. To which Kamina had to assert a little force to show them their place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you worms! Since you all don't have a god anymore, I'M going to take his place!\" Kamina announced, looking down at the tiny people below! \"And Simon here is going to be my right hand man! Anything he says goes, got it!?\" Kamina could just barely hear all the people making a commotion, clearly in disagreeance with what he had just said. This made the gigantic muscle man frown. \"Alright... How about THIS?!\" Kamina brought a closed fist down on the largest, nearby building he could find! It was instantly decimated, nothing but dust and debris blowing in the wind! Kamina smirked, glancing down at all the people. \"Anyone else want to say something?\" Every single person in the crowd immediately hushed up. Kamina's power was absolute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...\" Kamina continued on, \"As your god, I order all of you to worship me!\" Kamina demanded. He could barely see as people got to their knees and began to bow. However, rather than please Kamina, this made him frown. \"No you idiots! Not like that!\" Kamina reached down and scooped a portion of the crowd up! They began to shout as they were lifted up higher! Kamina soon stopped, and dropped them off on top of his mountainous pecs! \"Now get to rubbing you ants!\" Kamina ordered! The citizens were a bit slow to catch on, but soon they started to obey, doing exactly as Kamina asked. Kamina's pecs were beyond massive, each one bulbous and huge, to the point he could crush the entire crowd in his pecs with the smallest flex! The puny people had begun to work. Rubbing, massaging, and giving Kamina's gargantuan, powerful body the appreciation it deserved! Kamina started to moan a little as the power began to go to his head. He wore a big grin on his face as he laid there, feeling that no one could ever stand up to his power or his might! He was truly the manliest man of them all! Then again, to call him a man was almost an insult now! There was no better words to describe Kamina than a humongous, omnipotent muscle GOD!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon, in the meantime, was down on the surface. He watched as Kamina was touched, feeling just the slight bit of jealousy. At least Kamina appointed him as his demigod of sorts. He turned around and looked down at a few people that were left, Brettner included. Some of them seemed rather willing to serve Simon, while the others began to sneak off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-Uh, that's okay guys... I don't need anything...\" Simon replied, backing away from them a little. Just then, his stomach grumbled! The people seemed to quake in fear, for they saw Simon just as fearsome as Kamina! \"Well... Could you guys bring me some food?\" Simon asked, changing his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our god demands an offering!\" Someone shouted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry! Before we invoke his wrath!\" Another agreed. With that, some of them ran off to get Simon food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long. Soon a couple strongmen returned, carrying an entire birdcow in their wake! It had been lightly roasted, and there was various salts spread on it to keep it preserved. It was tossed down at Simon's feet, to which the men bowed down at they backed up. Simon just chuckled, blushing slightly at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys.\" He said, before picking up the animal. With a little sniff, he gave it a bite! As he began to taste, his eyes closed in pleasure as he felt the flavors melt in his mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wow, this is really good! Do you guys have any more?\" He asked with only one bite taken out of the one he had! The crowd clambered and rushed to get more food for Simon! \"Thanks!\" He said with a charming smile as he watched them run off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just then, Simon saw that Brettner was talking with some guy. Moving a little, he saw that it was some kind of researcher! Although it was hard to tell... He wore glasses and had a mask over his mouth... All this aside, Simon had a feeling that Brettner might be up to something...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a fresh Spring morning. The cherry blossoms had sprouted, and a new semester of school had just started for the students of Sarayashiki Junior High. It all seemed like the picture perfect first day for every single girl and boy. Except for one. Yusuke Urameshi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it wasn't entirely based on the fact hat Yusuke was stupid, but being a full-time, on call spirit detective didn't exactly give you the time of day or night to pay attention or study. Worst of all, being held back meant that Yusuke had to be seperated from Keiko! At first, the teen was bummed, but his spirits rose right back up the moment he had learned that Kuwabara would have to be held back with him for the exact same reason! The moment he had heard, he burst into tears from sheer laughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the beauty of the school aside, Yusuke was already missing out on his first day because he had to be called out to take care of tiny little demon that had been creating a ruckus in the nearby woods. Yusuke didn't really seem to mind that he had to skip out on the first day of school. Delinquency was nothing new to him, even if he HAD shaped up a <i>little</i> after the Dark Tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yusuke honed in on the location that Botan had told him, he came upon a clearing in the forest. There were flowers scattered all about, and not to mention the abundance of mushrooms and toadstools! Yusuke's face jerked back in reaction to just how... Fairy tale and corny the place looked. Cute was cute, but this place looked like a rainbow of pure happiness and sugar threw up all over the place! All that was missing was cute woodland animals hopping about!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke shook his head, and began to wait around. Out of boredom, he soon started to snoop around, lifting and looking under a few of the comically huge mushrooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Don't touch that!\" A small voice shouted out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hn?\" Yusuke's head popped up and looked around. Just as he did, a small, but rather eccentric looking fairy was fluttering right in his face! Yusuke shouted in surprise, before falling right back, squashing a garden of mushrooms behind him! \"Oooh, now look at what you've done!\" The fairy said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what I did!? You're the one who surprised me by flying right in my face!\" Yusuke said, getting up and dusting a few squashed mushrooms off his back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-Look at this! This garden took years to grow! And you've ruined it in seconds, you big lummox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Hey.. Are you this little demon I'm suppose to be after?\" Yusuke asked, taking a total shot in the dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon?! How dare you! I may be of a... Darker descent, but how could you say I'm a demon when you're gazing upon such beauty!? My iridecent wings, my slender legs, and not to mention these svelte arms!\" The now narcissitic fairy rambled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Yusuke replied. The fairy fluttered back down to his mushroom garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this work... Ruined! I could handle it when the ogre ran through, or when that grotesque ghost woman stole one from me, but this... This!\" The fairy's fist closed tight in blistering fury. \"I hope those curses get back each and every one of them tenfold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke's ears perked up. \"So you HAVE been causing trouble then?\" Yusuke asked, making a grab for the fairy. As he did, the fairy vanished into glittering dust, before reappearing on Yusuke's shoulder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that was me, what of-- Oh my... Look at you! Those eyes! And that face! You, my dear, are a real beauty!\" Yusuke made another grab for the fairy, but he vanished yet again! Yusuke looked all around, even spinning a little before he heard the fairy once more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a little treat, you know that?\" He asked, \"Who thought someone so beautiful could be so destructive? But I digress... I think I'll lay a special curse on you, my little biscuit. And even as a treat, I'll send you back where you came!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke looked up, but just as he did, a golden dust sparkled all around him. He tried fanning it away, but there was just too much of it! Yusuke soon started to feel very sleepy, and in but seconds, he collapsed on the forest floor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, around noon or s, Yusuke awoke with a groan. As he opened his eyes, his vision was blurry at first, before it all came into focus. As he sat up, he took a look around... He was back in his room, but...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"What...the hell?\" Yusuke said wearily, rubbing his head as he looked around. Everything seemed so...small! He sat up and noticed that his legs were dangling off the bed at the knee, his feet planted firmly on the ground. He nearly bumped his head as he tried to sit up fully, his right arm also hanging off the side of the bed. \"What the hell is going on here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his body and saw that he was dressed only in a pair of briefs and even those looked make shift. Everything was the same as it had been this morning, it was just all way too small! His got down on his hands and knees, and started looking around. His chair and desk both looked more like something a child would use rather than a teenager. It was almost like someone had stuffed him into a playhouse and designed it to look exactly like his own room. Though why someone would go through such a weird and elaborate prank was beyond him. \"Why is everything so freaking tiny?! This doesn't make any sense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke!\" His mother shouted, slamming his door open. \"Shut the hell up! Do you have any idea how noisy you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Get out of here! I'm in my underwear!\" Yusuke said, trying to cover himself up. \"Wait...why aren't you freaking out about how big I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you haven't been drinking Yusuke?\" She asked wearily, leaning on the door frame. \"Trust me, you've always been a big boy. I had to give birth to you after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stumbled out of the room, heading to the living room. Yusuke shook his head slightly and looked over himself again. He looked just like he always did...only he was bigger. A lot bigger! \"Is Mom just too hungover to see how huge I am?\" He thought. \"Whatever...I have to get to school anyway. Maybe I can slip in for class without anyone noticing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll memory of the fairy, the fairy circle, and his mission had been wiped out! They were, at best, vague recollections at the back of Yusuke's head, like a long forgotten dream. He scooted over to his closet and pulled open the door, nearly wrenching it out of place. \"Dammit...I'm going to have to be careful...\" He pulled out the only clothes that seemed to be in there: A green jacket and a pair of pants. They were fit to his size, but they were also the only clothes in there. Yusuke then spent the next few minutes trying to dress himself. He managed to get the jacket on just fine, but when it came time to get the pants on, he had to lay down. He ended up knocking over his dresser with his big bare foot and nearly smashing his head through the ceiling as he sat up. With a grumble, he squeezed out of his room and crawled through the halls of his home, opening the front door. \"I'm going to school mom!\" He shouted, slamming the door behind him as he pushed his way out the door. Once outside he was able to stretch to his full height, the door only coming up to his knees. \"Man! Going to school is going to be a huge pain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced over towards the school and shrugged, making his way over there. It was too warm to bother buttoning up the jacket, so he just let it open, his bare chest and abs on display as he casually walked to school. The ground shook slightly with his every step, a fact that did not escape Yusuke's notice. He smiled and started putting more pressure on his steps, his bare feet making cracked footprints in the concrete. He chuckled as he saw this, bending down and picking up a concrete chip. With a little squeeze the chip turned to dust in his fist. \"Now that's what I'm talking about!\" He dusted his hands off and stood up straight. \"Being huge has its advantages! I'll bet those damn teachers wouldn't dare mess with me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started hurrying towards school, eager to have a little fun. Just as he passed the main gates however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke! Stop right there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke skidded to a halt, overbalancing and landing on his ass, making the whole ground shake violently!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke! You have to be more careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke groaned and looked to the right. Keiko was standing there, looking at him disapprovingly. \"Keiko? What's your problem? Shouldn't you be in class? Back at the high school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For your information, I was just out getting lunch with my friends! My problem is you running around like a kid when you're big enough to crush someone underfoot! We talked about this before. You need to be more careful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked up to him and smacked him on the arm with her satchel. \"Wait...You're not weirded out either by how big I am?\" Yusuke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hit your head when you fell Yusuke?\" Keiko said, putting her hands on her hips. \"You've been this big since we started junior high! I'm kind of used to it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke rubbed his head, feeling out of sorts. Keiko sighed as she grabbed a corner of Yusuke's jacket. \"Still haven't bought a uniform for your size either. You really are a total delinquent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop hassling me already.\" Yusuke said, grabbing Keiko by the back of her skirt and lifting her up. She shrieked and tried to cover her bottom with her satchel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusuke you jerk! Put me down right now or else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke chuckled and set her down again in front of him, right between his legs. \"Or else what?\" He asked, standing over her with his arms folded across his chest. He looked down at her with a condecending glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took two steps forward and slammed her satchel down as hard as she could between his legs. Yusuke let out a shriek of his own, his hands grabbing the sensitive area as he curled up in a ball. \"That's what I'm going to do. Now if you'll excuse me, I have class.\" With a little huff she turned on her heel and marched back down the street to the high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...Same old Keiko, even when I'm a giant.\" Yusuke said, wincing slightly as he sat up. \"Feh! Forget school! I'm not wasting my time here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to his feet and walked back through the gate, feeling annoyed.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yusuke went right back into the city, unintentionally stomping with every step he took! He wasn't exactly angry, just annoyed. Then again, hitting any man in his tender areas was a sure way to get him upset! Yusuke slowly trounced his way into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yusuke was walking through the city, all sorts of people gazed back, looking at him. Yusuke saw them as their eyes met his own, but every citizen just looked away as if Yusuke was nothing new! This really struck Yusuke as odd, but he couldn't quite think  of a reason how or why everyone was acting so... Normal to him. The giant teen racked his brain, trying to think of a reason why, but he was getting nowhere fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke was soon broken out of his trance when he felt ball bounce off his back! A bit annoyed, he whipped around and looked down... Only to see a little boy looking back up at him, smiling! It only took half a second, but Yusuke recognized him as the kid he saved from a car accident about a year or so back! Yusuke's expression softened a little, frustration slipping out of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey ki--\" Before Yusuke could even finish his sentance, the boy tossed the ball up at him again, letting it bounce off his left pec! The boy caught it again on the rebound, giggling to himself as he did. Yusuke smiled, and set his hands on his hips! \"Alright, let's see you do that again!\" Yusuke said. The boy did it again, this time at Yusuke's left pectoral! As soon as it hit his chest, Yusuke bounced his pec, giving it a toss right back at the boy! The boy's face seemed to light up, and he tossed it back at Yusuke's right pec! Yusuke would bounce it again, sending the ball right back at the little boy! The two of them had big smiles on their faces as the boy kept tossing the ball, alternating pecs each time! Not only were they having fun, but a few nearby people caught wind of it, all of them impressed, smitten, and enraptured by the sight of such a large and admittably hot teen playing with a cute little boy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the ball hit Yusuke's left pec wrong and went flying off in to the street! The audience cheered happily, finding it quite impressive! The little boy turned, about to get the ball when a large hand clapped on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I go get that for you?\" Yusuke asked. The last thing he needed was for the past to be repeated! Yusuke checked the street briefly, before running out into the street to get the ball! Every step he took made large, foot shaped potholes in the road! Yusuke quickly reached the ball, and bent over to pick it up. He didn't even seem to notice the semi truck coming right out him, out of control with a sleeping man at the wheel! The trucker had been driving for days with minimal sleep! Yusuke didn't even hear it until the noisy engine was within earshot! He immediately looked up and his arms rose up to grab the sides! Yusuke was knocked back a few feet as the watching crowd gasped in shock! Yusuke quickly regained his footing, and after a brief skid, halted the truck! The air bag went off inside, catching the man. Yusuke sighed, and managed to make it with little more than a scrape here and there. He smiled, laughing a little. Off to the side, the crowd roared with applause and shouts of excitement! Yusuke chuckled, and turned to them, flexing his massive biceps which seemed to be just a little bigger from the sudden workout! After a moment, Yusuke walked back over and picked up the ball, before returning it back to the little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing we avoided that this time, huh?\" He asked with a grin, ruffling the boy's hair. The boy smiled and nodded back at him. \"You be careful, alright?\" Yusuke said, before standing back up, and turning to walk off. Yusuke felt great after that, like nothing could dampen his spirits!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke's legs soon led him to an empty lot. As he looked around, he remembered that his was the place that Kuwabara and his gang used to hang out at back in the day! A little smirk rose to his face as he remembered all the times that Kuwabara's ass was handed to him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well! Good with kids AND a good samaritan? You really are the whole package, aren't you?\" A voice called out. As Yusuke turned his head, a little glitter flashed past him! It all mustered together and the fairy reappaeared before his very eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! It's you!\" Yusuke growled. As soon as he saw the fairy's face, everything came flooding back to him! The woods, the mushrooms, and not to mention the curse! \"You're the one who did this to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right you are!\" He said with a smile, claping his hands in applause. \"Oh I'm delighted that such a tall, handsome man like you remembers me!\" He flutted onto his back in the air, gazing at Yusuke. \"I suppose this is the part where you tell me your life is terrible and you want me to change you back, yes?\" He said with smug little smile.</span></div></div>",

Got a problem with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...you...and...huh?\" For once the smooth talking fairy seemed at a loss for words. \"I have to say...in the last century of my work no one has ever found my curses...appealing.\" He smiled a little and said, \"You really are something special~ I keep finding new things about you I like~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke put his arms behind his head and said, \"Yeah, I have that effect on people.\" He grinned and crouched down, moving closer to the tiny creature. \"So? How about it? Can you make me bigger? And how about giving me some more muscle this time? I mean, I know I'm pretty sexy already, but a little more never hurt, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy looked Yusuke over. True, his chest bulged slightly and he had a six pack to be proud of, not to mention toned arms and legs, but he would look even more impressive with some more...bulk~ He snapped his fingers and said, \"Yes, yes, I can do just that for you~ But, since this curse turned into a blessing you still haven't paid the price for trampling all over my mushrooms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke groaned and said, \"That was an accident! Maybe you shouldn't build those things right in the middle of a forest path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Heathen! My circles were there FAR before any \"path\"! Would it kill you great galumphing creatures to look down every one in awhile?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing it right now and all I see is a mouthy little fairy who's asking for a crushing!\" Yusuke said, cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please. I'm made of fairy dust. I can't be killed by such barbaric methods.\" The fairy said, studying his fingernails. \"Now, are you going to listen to my request or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What request?  You never said anything about a request!\" Yusuke shouted, getting frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For stamping on my mushrooms! I am asking you a request as payment! Try. to. keep. up!\" With every word he rapped his sharp little knuckles on top of Yusuke's head. \"Figures. All beauty and no brains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke swatted him with his hand, getting nothing but a handful of dust that quickly surged through his fingers and reformed into the fairy, grinning at Yusuke with infuriating superiority. \"You're not going to make me bigger until I accept, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope~ I won't~\" He said, sticking his tongue out at Yusuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Argh...Fine! I'll do your stupid request! What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple!\" He said, flying closer to Yusuke's face. \"My magic ring was stolen from me a few decades ago by a troll demon named Masque. He lives in a cave, not too far out of town. He's a big fellow, about so tall and wearing a bone mask on his face. If you can get my ring back, I promise I will \"curse\" you again~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I just have to beat down some punk and get back some jewelry?\" Yusuke said with a grin. \"Yeah...I think I can handle that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood back up to his full height and walked away, the fairy waving good bye to him. \"Oh, I am an absolute genius~! My precious ring will soon be mine again~! And all it took was a little promise and a little persuasion~ Now...how much bigger will he want to be I wonder? I doubled his height last time so perhaps I should triple? Or maybe quadruple? I wonder how he likes the idea of the city being small enough to crush in one step?\" The fairy started giggling to himself as he thought of the possibilities~ \"Oh...just imagine miles upon miles of that gorgeous body, pumped to enormous proportions~! I'm getting faint just thinking about it~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy fluttered about the vacant lot, dreaming of what he would do to Yusuke, no longer caring about what Yusuke might want. Such was the danger of dealing with fairies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke jogged along the sidewalk, making deeper footprints as he ran, people politely dodging out of his way. Everyone in town knew about Yusuke's towering height and were used to just moving out of his path. It was better than getting stepped on, though a few guys had purposefully stood in his way a few times just to get pressed under those enormous feet. Soon, Yusuke was at the edge of town. He started walking towards a small mountain, figuring that Masque was probably in there somewhere. It didn't take long for Yusuke to reach the mountain. He started moving about them, looking for a cave of any kind. After about ten minutes of searching, he found a rather large cave. Animal bones were littered around the entrance, a few set up in a kind of warning sign net to it. Yusuke walked right into the cave and shouted, \"Hey! Mask or whatever your name is! Get out here! We need to talk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground rumbled as something huge slowly approached Yusuke from the dark reaches of the cave. A shape slowly materialized. It was green skinned and had a gigantic round belly, a strong set of pecs balancing on top of it while a pair of burly arms framed it. His feet were crushing bones and rocks alike as he approached Yusuke, his hair short and spiky, the skull of some horned creature covering his face. He stopped when he was a few feet from Yusuke, the still giant teen barely reaching the top of the demon's stomach! Masque scratched his belly and said, \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a ring back there that doesn't belong to you?\" Yusuke asked, looking coldly at the demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of...Did Oberon send you here? Look kid, I won that ring fair and square! Besides, its magic keeps attracting such delicious food. And just having it near me helps me grow bigger and stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And fatter?\" Yusuke said, indicating the demon's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Shut up! I don't need to take this in my own house!\" He growled, lifting up a huge bone club. \"Maybe I'll just eat you too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so!\" Yusuke shouted and began to fight! He didn't want to kill the demon. He hadn't really done anything wrong...but Yusuke needed that ring if he wanted to get any bigger!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fight dragged on...</span></div></div>",

Both of them were sweating bullets!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You're not bad... For a human...\" Masque said, panting slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Thanks.\" Yusuke said, half accepting the compliment. \"And I can keep going too! So how about you just make this easy and hand over that ring already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No!\" Masque said almost immediately, \"That ring belongs to me now! I told you I got it fair and square!\" Yusuke was in a bit of a bind. He wanted to get bigger, but at the cost of robbing someone? ... Then again, it's not like this demon was completely innocent. After all, just gazing around at all the bones was evidence enough! However everyone has to eat... Yusuke just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Just give it to me!\" Yusuke demanded once more! Masque could see the determination in the teen's eyes. While he carried on with the feeling that he could still beat Yusuke, it was better to be safe than sorry! Without a word, Masque turned and dove right into his cave! \"Hey! Where are you going!?\" Yusuke said, taking a step forward. Masque didn't reply and kept running, giving Yusuke little choice other than to follow after him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yusuke ran into the dark cave, he nearly tripped over a rib that was littered on the ground! Not far off, Yusuke could hear something moving. There was no question in his mind that it was Masque, but before he could get any deeper, something large, heavy, and just a little bit musky dashed right past him! As Yusuke turned, he could see Masque running back the the entrance of the cave, both of his hands shut tight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Get back here!\" Yusuke ordered, turning around and heading back to the light! It didn't take long with someone as big as him! Yusuke was soon bathed in sunlight once more, where he saw Masque standing not too far away!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking for this?\" He asked with a smug little grin, holding the ring out in two fingers. Yusuke immediately dashed forward and tried to snatch it, but Masque was fast enough to pull it back! \"Ah ah ah!\" He said mockingly. He looked at the ring, then back at Yusuke. He got an even bigger smile on his face now! With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the ring right into his mouth! Yusuke's face was shocked! The next thing the teen heard was a noisy \"shlurp\" as the ring went down the beast's throat! Yusuke could only watch as that tiny bulge seemed to travel so slowly down his throat...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh...\" Masque pat his belly, which jiggled slightly with each slap! \"That was probably the most satisfying meal I've had in months! Tell you what, you can have it now! Once my stomach is done with it! BWAHAHAHAHA!\" Masque laughed loudly, scaring off a few nearby birds as he did! He walked closer, and bent down, letting loose a noisy burp right in Yusuke's face! Yusuke, of course, turned his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gross! It smells like rotting flesh in there!\" Yusuke said, falling on his ass. Masque just laughed again, before retreating into the cave for a nap. He figured the ring was safe for the time being, and thusly, thought himself the victor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, now what...?\" Yusuke said. \"Do I really have to wait until that ring comes out...\" Before Yusuke could even finish his sentance, he shuddered. That was the last thing he wanted to do! Instead he took a deep breath and tried to think things through a little more clearly. \"Okay... So if he really hasn't done anything wrong, I... Could try to go inside him and find the ring in his stomach... If I do that, I'd better hurry and get out before he digests me!\" Yusuke thought, sitting cross-legged as he brainstormed. \"Or... I could just kill him and open up his stomach.\" Yusuke said, thinking of the simpler path. As easy as it might of been, it would be cruel to just kill him when he hadn't done anything wrong. That was against Yusuke's nature!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke went on to think for about ten minutes before coming to his decision! He saw no other choice than to...</span></div></div>",

Guess I'll just have to fish it out myself! No way I'm waiting around for it to come out naturally!\" Yusuke said, slowly moving back into the cave. Masque's snores were already filling the cave. He really was confident that there was no way Yusuke could get the ring from him. He was either incredibly trusting...or incredibly stupid. Either way, Yusuke soon made it back into Masque's inner sanctum. It was as littered with bones as the outside, the giant demon reclining on a pile of rocks, his mouth wide open as he slept. In the corner there was a small niche in the rock where a fire was burning, casting the interior of the cave in an eerie orange glow. Yusuke calmly approached the demon and leaned in, holding his nose as he stared into the creature's gaping maw. \"Aw man...this is disgusting!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took a deep breath and slowly plunged his hand in. His hand fit rather easily down Masque's throat, the demon gagging slightly, his sharp fangs nearly slicing Yusuke's buff arm off before he relaxed again, the snoring resuming. Clearly he had experience swallowing creatures whole. The completely intact skeletons of smaller to mid sized animals laying in the cave were a testament to that. The demon's throat was hot and slimy, contracting and expanding around Yusuke's hand and arm as he dug in deeper and deeper, eventually reaching the monster's stomach. He gently began feeling around inside, nearly gagging himself as he touched what felt like half digested meat and bones, not to mention the various gastric juices. Finally, his finger touched something small, round, and cold. With a grin Yusuke snatched it and tugged his arm out, the appendage covered in a slimy purple liquid of some kind. \"Yuck! This is the last time I ever go demon stomach diving!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his arm off as best he could before holding the ring up to the light. It was an average gold ring with a series of designs that were probably words in the Fairy language. A small blue jewel was ensconced long the band, along with a green jewel, a red jewel, a yellow jewel, and a violet jewel. Yusuke tilted his head and was a bit surprised by how big it was. It would easily slip onto his finger! He shrugged and was about to slip it in his pocket when a particularly loud snore from Masque made him flinch, the ring flying from his hand and onto the floor, rolling over into a pile of bones. Cursing softly, Yusuke reached down and grabbed the ring, the small band accidentally slipping onto his finger as he did so. There was an immediate, intense flash of light, all the jewels glowing brightly, a loud whistle erupting from it as well. Masque jumped as though he had been shocked, his head turning blearily from side to side. Yusuke quickly began to run, trying to tug the ring off which refused to be removed! He had made it only a few steps before Masque realized what had happened. With a mighty bellow of rage he gave chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Yusuke burst out of the cave, Masque's arm slammed into his back, sending him flying forward. Yusuke crashed into the ground and skidded a few feet, barely managing to turn over before Masque grabbed him by the wrist and held him up. \"You little thief! how dare you try and get away with my ring!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh get it over it tubby!\" Yusuke shouted, kneeing the demon in the gut. \"You weren't even doing anything with it anyway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still mine! And I'm going to take it back even if I have to rip your arm off to do it!\" Masque growled, gripping Yusuke's wrist tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke made a fist with his other hand, powered it with spirit energy, and slammed it into Masque's gut, making him let out a little \"oomph!\" of air and drop Yusuke. The demon quickly recovered, however, and grabbed Yusuke's wrist again, his other hand grabbing the ring. A struggle ensued, both demon and teen trying to get the ring. Yusuke had an advantage, thanks to the ring being practically grafted on his finger. Unfortunately, Masque quickly figured out that the ring was not going to come off by normal means. He opened his mouth and brought Yusuke's hand closer to it, his tongue slipping out and licking the hand expectantly. Yusuke, not about to let his hand get bitten off, powered his hand up with spirit energy, intending to launch a spirit gun straight through Masque's mouth. It was no longer a question of stealing, but of self defense. Before he could launch the bullet, however, the ring flashed brightly, the whistling stopping as Yusuke felt his spirit energy meant for the spirit gun drain into the ring, the jewels glowing faintly. Masque had stopped in his tracks, curious what was happening with the ring. Yusuke tried to fire another spirit gun, but once again the energy merely drained into the ring, the jewels glowing even brighter! With a sudden flash, the ring let off a little burst of energy, blasting both human and demon away from each other. Masque slammed into the side of the mountain while Yusuke flipped head over heels and landed hard on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both groaned, feeling like they had been hit by a train. After they had both gotten to their feet, their eyes opened wide at what they saw.</span></div></div>",

His muscles convulsed and pushed out, swelling up like balloons! He was already huge, but now he was getting ridiculous! His biceps pumped up, filling with limitless power, slowly growing bigger, thicker, heavier!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasque's surprise had slowly turned into joy! He got a sinister grin on his face, as he craned his head back and let out a monstrous roar! Birds fled in fear as Yusuke could feel his body shake a little! The large beast he had worked so hard to defeat was slowly becoming more powerful than he could comprehend! The faint abs on Masque's stomach became slightle more apparant, as his gut pushed out further, shaking slightly as it started to drape over his lap! It let out a dull rumbled, begging to be filled as it's last meal seemed to shrink within! Masque's biceps bulged with new power, invoulentarily flexed with every little bump of pure meat that seemed to course within them! Masque let out a low, lustful groan as his shoulders broaded practically as wide as the entrance to his cave! His traps rose up, threatening to swallow his head, making him look like a wall of pure muscle! Down below, his thighs were already bulking up, so massive that they started to rub up against each other! Masque had to adjust his stance just so he wouldn't look like a roided out penguin! There was a meaty \"SLAP!\" that echoed through the air, as Masque's dick slapped against his thigh, with two balls the size of Yusuke's giant fist!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasque continued to grow taller and taller, letting out soft roars that would suddenly grow loud! Birds fled in terror of the growing beast! Yusuke gulped. Before, he only came up to Masque's gut, but now he only came up to his knees! Masque had begun to rise up taller than the trees, his calves pushing and growing just to keep up! His huge feet and sharp toenails grew, inching ever closer to Yusuke's body, forcing the teen to back up slowly! And while Yusuke couldn't quite see it, Masque was getting quite the ass! Two full, round cheeks you could bounce a boulder off of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasque laughed triumphantly, his thundering bellows nearly deafening Yusuke! \"Good job, you worthless human!\" Masque taunted, \"You've done a great job... At making me the most powerful demon to ever live!\" Masque laughed again, his gut bouncing as it hung over his lap! Yusuke gulped again, looking at the gargantuan demon towering over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then... I think I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

His chair and desk, his bed, his closet, his door everything was stretching high above him. Yusuke ran over to the chair and measured himself against it. He couldn't have been more than five or so inches tall. \"Oh man...That stupid fairy has something to do with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe whipped around, intending to run over to his bed to climb up on top of it for a better vantage point, when a shower of gold dust seemed to fall from above. Yusuke looked up but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Just the regular ceiling. He turned around really fast again, this time catching the blur of an object out of the corner of his eye before the dust fell. He slowly reached behind him as he looked over his shoulder, touching a thin, delicate something at the same time he saw a pair of golden wings growing from his back. His jaw dropped as he saw it, touching his back wildly, expecting to find holes in his shirt and these frilly things stuck deep inside his body! Instead, he found nothing but intact clothing. The wings didn't seem to be attached. Rather, they were floating slightly behind him. Yet now that Yusuke was aware of them, he felt a strange connection with them, like they were part of his body. He flexed his back a little, the wings flapping slightly. Yusuke repeated the motion a few times before he was able to flap the wings themselves, his body slowly rising into the air in a shower of golden dust that disappeared the second it touched the floor. \"You've got to be kidding me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke fluttered over to the bed and landed softly on top of it, looking around. He put his hands in his pockets and jumped a little as he realized he had something in the right one. He pulled out a small, neatly folded piece of paper that definitely hadn't been in there this morning and opened it up. The words inside were written in a fancy, looping script and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Mr. Cutie~ Aren't YOU a lucky little devil? Or should I say fairy? It's not every day I grace a mere human with the gift of becoming a fairy! Consider yourself lucky and be grateful, okay?~ Enjoy your new life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That weasel! That little bastard!\" Yusuke shouted, ripping the paper to shreds. \"When I get my hands on that little punk I'm going to beat his face in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke jumped off the bed, flapping his wings, the dust now red as it fell around him, concealing him from normal human eyes. He flew out the open window and started making his way back to the school, intending to find those mushrooms and teach the fairy a lesson!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I'll beat him until he turns me back to normal! Then I'm going to step on him and grind him into the ground! Then maybe if I feel generous I won't rip his wings off!\" Yusuke muttered as he flew along the sidewalk, dodging between various people. His plans were cut short, however, as a hand suddenly reached out and snatched him! Yusuke let out a little yell as the massive fingers surrounded him, pulling him in front of the face of a curious little boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked to be about nine or ten years old with short, somewhat shaggy brown hair. he was wearing shorts and a blazer, a bow tie on his neck. It was the standard uniform for grade school boys. Yusuke began to struggle in the boy's fist, unable to even budge the huge fingers. \"Wow...Are you a tiny person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid! I'm kind of in a rush so how about you let me go already?\" Yusuke shouted, glaring up at the boy. \"Wait a second...how can you even see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that hard.\" The boy said, grinning slightly. \"You're leaving a trail of red dust everywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not...never mind.\" Yusuke said, shaking his head. This kid must have had a high enough spiritual awareness to be able to see demons and other phenomena. \"Just let me go, alright? I'm not some toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy ignored Yusuke's words completely, pulling on Yusuke's clothes as he examined the tiny teen. \"You can't be a real person, can you? Real people aren't this small.\" He turned Yusuke over and saw Yusuke's wings glittering in the light. \"Wow! You have wings! You're a fairy aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, I'm a fairy.\" Yusuke said in a deadpan voice, tapping his finger impatiently against the kid's palm. \"NOW will you let me go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! You're a fairy! You're a fairy and I caught you! That means I get a wish, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?! I'm not giving you a wish!\" Yusuke shouted. It might have been better to say he couldn't give him a wish, since his words brought a frown to the boy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught you fair and square! That means I get a wish!\" He squeezed Yusuke harder, making the black haired teen wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..don't...think so!\" Yusuke grunted, gasping as the boy squeezed tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! If you won't give me a wish then I'll just take you home until you DO grant me a wish!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe roughly shoved Yusuke into his shirt pocket, pulling the flap down over top of it and buttoning it closed, leaving Yusuke trapped in this giant boy's pocket!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...Just great! Can this day get any worse?\" He muttered to himself, upside down in the pocket.</span></div></div>",

Once he had managed to get upright, the wing popped back into shape, unharmed. \"Well, that's at least one less thing to worry about...\" Yusuke thought, flapping them experimentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the wings did flap, he couldn't seem to actually fly while in the confines of the pocket, the material close enough around him to prevent him from getting any momentum. Before he could try simply climbing out of the pocket, the kid's fingers reentered the space, closing tightly around his much smaller body, dragging him back out into the light of day. The kid had a mischievous grin on his face as he held Yusuke tightly. The shrunken teen looked around the room he was in. It was average for a kid his age, full of posters of superheroes, clothes strewn about, books and school supplies haphazardly stacked on the desk. \"What a dump!\" Yusuke said peevishly, looking around in distaste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! At least I have a room! You're just a dumb fairy who has to live outside!\" The kid said, squeezing Yusuke harder, cutting off the foul mouthed teen's reply. \"Anyway, this is MY room not yours. YOU get to stay here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoved Yusuke into a small cage that he hadn't noticed before, closing and locking the small door as soon as his hand was clear of the entrance. It was a simple bird cage, dusty with disuse, a yellowed newspaper spread along the bottom of it. There was a slight smell of mildew but the cage itself was clean of any \"gifts\" the previous occupant might have left behind. The perk hanging in the center of the cage had one of its strings cut, the wooden dowel dangling uselessly. \"You're going to stay in there until you grant me a wish! And don't think you can escape either! If you even try, I'll pull your wings out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look kid, I ain't granting you any damn wishes, so you might as well just let me go now before I lose my temper and punch you in the eye!\" Yusuke shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe schoolboy merely rattled the cage as a response, throwing Yusuke's tiny body around like a penny in a dryer, leaving him in a crumpled mess on the bottom of the cage. The boy laughed and said, \"How long do you think you'll last in there before you need food and water, huh Mr. Fairy? If you're good, I'll give you something tasty! I'll still feed you even if you're bad but it won't be as good. I still want to get my wish after all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, kid, fairies don't grant wishes!\" Yusuke insisted, getting to his feet with a bit of struggle. \"You're thinking of, uh, what the hell are they called, leprechauns! When you catch THEM they grant you wishes! If you run into a fairy you're lucky if you don't end up bitten!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid frowned, tilting his head slightly. \"Oh yeah? I've never heard of that before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, you should read some of the old fairy tales.\" Yusuke said, hands curled around the bars. His mother had always read him the old, gruesome fairy tales, never sparing the details despite his young age. \"The stuff kids get these days is sanitized crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I even believe you? You could just be lying to save yourself.\" The boy said, sitting down in a chair, resting his head on his arms as he stared into the cage at Yusuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I could DO magic don't you think I would have done something by now to get you to let me go?\" Yusuke said, rolling his eyes. \"What kind of wish could you get out of me when I can't even break out of this damn cage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I guess you're right...\" The kid said, sighing slightly, disappointed. \"So...what am I supposed to do with you then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about LETTING ME GO!\" Yusuke said, shouting the last part of the sentence. \"I've got someone I've got to find and kick the crap out of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's no fun at all!\" The boy said, pouting a little. \"How about you just be my pet instead? We can have all sorts of fun together and I'll take really good care of you! I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! You listen to me kid, I ain't ANYONE'S pet!\" Yusuke said, taking a deep breath, ready to really let him have it...before the boy got to his feet, dropping a nearby cloth down over the cage, plunging Yusuke into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it for now Mr. Fairy.\" He said, his voice getting farther away. \"I'm going to get you something to eat! I'll be right back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke smashed his fist into the bars in frustration as the sound of the boy's footsteps slowly faded away. \"NOW what the hell am I supposed to do?!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was late at night in Sarayashiki as Kazuma Kuwabara was sitting at his desk, hastily scribbling down notes. Several books were open around him, along with notebooks and sheaves of loose paper, most with messy handwriting covering every available inch. The window was wide open to let in the warm spring breeze, the scent of flowers riding in with it. The desk lamp was the only source of light in the room, everything else covered in the darkness of evening. The only sound beyond the scratching of the pencil was the soft mewing of a tiny black cat who was alternately playing with a small bit of fluff on the floor and sleeping up on Kuwabara's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired teen had just finished copying down a paragraph from one of his books when a bright voice suddenly called out, \"Hey! Kuwabara! Are you awake in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara jumped, startled, his knee slamming into the bottom of his desk. He let out a yelp of pain and scooted his chair back a bit too roughly, overbalancing it and sending himself crashing to the floor. He got to his feet and ran to the window glaring down at his friend and rival Yusuke Urameshi. \"Hey! Some of us are trying to study in here!\" He shouted down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some of us are trying to sleep you damn punks!\" A third, more feminine voice yelled from a different window. Kuwabara winced as he heard his sister shout and motioned for Yusuke to come up. Yusuke took a few steps back, ran, and jumped, easily landing on Kuwbara's window sill like a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, your sister gets crabby at night.\" Yusuke said in a quieter voice, an easy going grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, she's got to work in the morning.\" Kuwabara said, sitting back down at his desk. \"What are you doing here so late at night anyway Urameshi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke hopped down into the room and pulled his right hand out of his pocket, holding a common VHS tape. \"Got a new mission from Spirit World! Got a group of demons causing trouble in a bad part of town. Looks like they're kidnapping humans for some reason. As far as anyone can tell, no one is being hurt so Koenma assumes its some kind of ransom deal. If we go in there first thing in the morning we'll be able to take them down before anyone can get hurt. You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara sighed and slapped his hand down on top of the papers. \"No way! I'm right in the middle of studying! Do you know how much work I have to put in to make it into a decent school? Fighting demons and stuff like that is behind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke grinned and said, \"Oh, so you're chicken now, is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, that's not it!\" Kuwabara said, getting to his feet and glaring down at Yusuke. \"I could go down there and beat those punk demons to death with my bare hands! No sword needed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these guys aren't your average demons.\" Yusuke said, poking Kuwabara in the chest. \"They're S class. Real mean guys. That's why we're sneaking in and setting up an ambush!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara rubbed the back of his head and said, \"Geez! I'm not like you and the others! That's one of the reasons I stopped going on missions! I'm normal compared to you three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke chuckled and pulled his left hand out of his pocket. \"Which is why Koenma made this for you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed Kuwabara a small black box, about the size of a Rubik's Cube, pulsing with a strange glow. Kuwabara could sense something powerful deep within it. \"What the heck is this thing? It feels...weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a Spirit Energy Gathering Device.\" Yusuke said, pulling out a little slip of paper. \"Let's see...It stores Spirit Energy..blah blah blah...you press the button and the energy is released in your body...blah blah blah...side effects...whatever.\" Yusuke crumpled the paper up and tossed it aside. \"The point is, Kurama, Hiei, and I all put a portion of our spirit energy in that thing. If you press the button on the side, you'll get a big boost of power which will help put you on the same level as the S class guys we'll be going after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha..Wait a minute! You're telling me that kid had this thing the whole time and he's just giving it to us NOW?!\" Kuwabara shouted, outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I said! But it turns out they just developed the thing recently. I guess that makes you the guinea pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara held the box out at arms length and said, \"Yeesh! I don't know if I should trust this thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby! Press the button and lets see what happens!\" Yusuke said, his grin returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! Fine! I'll give it a try!\" He carefully held the box closer and pressed the button on top with his thumb. Immediately a jolt of energy passed into his body through his arm, causing it to jerk, launching the box away from him. Yusuke ducked and swore, the box making a loud CLANK as it hit the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What's the big idea...Kuwabara?\" Yusuke's angry tone changed to one of concern as he saw Kuwabara's body start shaking, sweat standing out on his forehead. Yusuke's eyes widened as he saw his friend slowly start to grow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started in his chest. With every breath he took, Kuwbara's chest inflated more and more, pressing tightly up against the fabric of his pajama shirt, the material sticking to his sweaty skin, looking like he had half a basketball stuffed under his skin! His shoulders came next, broadening, the collar on his shirt ripping slowly down the front, revealing the top swelling of his pecs. His arms followed suit, the short sleeves on his shirt being forced up as his biceps grew taller and rounder, going from baseball to softball sized! As his back flared out, each muscle standing out in stark relief against the thin material of his shirt, his height began to increase, his head getting slowly closer and closer to the ceiling! This caused his shirt to rise up, revealing his flat stomach popping out with abs, each brick tight and defined, the crevices between them so deep you could lose a quarter in them! His pants began to grow tight as his thighs expanded, the material of his pants splitting, revealing the slightly shiny skin underneath. His calves bulged out behind him, growing in order to support the new weight on top, the hems of his pants shredding like tissue paper! Even his feet grew longer and wider, slowly inching closer and closer to Yusuke, making the now much smaller teen step back. With a loud RIIIIP, Kuwabara's pants fell off of him, leaving him only in a pair of heart boxers, the front bulging out obscenely in front of him, straining the button as even his dick grew bigger, his ass filling out the material behind him, nearly giving himself a wedgie just by growing! It all came to a stop as his head bumped into the nine foot ceiling, his shirt nothing more than rags clinging to his massive arms, his whole body heaving with heavy, powerful muscle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke's mouth dropped open as he gazed up at the behemoth that was his friend. \"K-Kuwabara? Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis groaned and looked down at Yusuke before taking stock of his own body. He slowly said</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Woah... I think I like this!\" Kuwabara said as he looked down at his hands. He opened and closed them a bit, almost as if he was unable to believe that this was really his body! \"I gotta be dreaming... Yeah, I fell asleep while studying!\" Kuwabara said. He reached around and gave his ass a pinch! \"Ow!\" He shouted, his eyes going wide! \"Hey... It's not a dream! This is for real!\" He said, a smile on his face. He looked at one of his arms and rose it up, flexing it as hard as he could! The muscles coiled together and up they rose, revealing a thick, beefy bicep set perfectly in the center of Kuwabara's arm. \"Heh, yeah... Not bad at all! In fact... How about we give that button another push!?\" Kuwabara said, walking across his room to retrieve the cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hey! Kuwabara!\" Yusuke said, \"Koenma said that was only to fight the demons, not pump you up!\" Yusuke ran after Kuwabara, pulling on his forearm, but it was a fruitless effort. Kuwabara soon picked up the cube, and his thumb slowly moved for the button. \"W-Wait!\" Yusuke shouted loudly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Urameshi!?\" Kuwabara replied. His voice was a bit deeper and more commanding at his new size...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Eh... Hey! Shouldn't we do that outside!? You don't want to wake your sister, right?\" Yusuke said, trying to buy a little more time. Kuwabara stood there for a moment with a stupid look on his face, before he looked back down at Yusuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I guess you've got a good point there.\" He said, stuffing the cube down into his ultra-tight boxers. \"But first...\" Kuwabara turned and picked up the instruction paper that Yusuke had carelessly tossed aside. Kuwabara stuffed that too down his boxers. \"Alright, let's get out of here.\" He said. As he walked up to his doorway, he found that he was much too huge to fit in it! Kuwabara just sighed. \"Awright, am I gonna have to break this thing down...?\" Kuwabara mumbled with a sigh. He opened the doorway, and started to squeeze through! It seemed to work, until about halfway through when his massive muscles got in the way! Kuwabara grunted, jerking his way through until the wood began to splinter and crack, forcing the doorway open bigger for the large teen! Kuwabara soon popped out in the hallway, a proud smile on his face! \"Alright, not bad! Getting through the front door is gonna be a breeze!\" He said, walking through the tiny hallway. Yusuke quickly followed, desperate to think of a plan, but was getting nowhere fast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn but a few short minutes, Kuwabara was outside, cube in hand. Yusuke had just arrived out the front door, shutting it politely behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh... Okay, hugeness, here I come!\" Kuwabara announced, pressing the button! He waited for a moment... But nothing! There was no shock, no growth, nothing at all! \"What the...?\" Kuwabara mumbled. He then walked forward until he was under the streetlight, snagging the paper out from the side of his boxers. He unfolded it and looked over it, doing his best to read the slightly tiny print in his big hands. \"Let's see... Usage... Effects... Aha! Recharging! Aw what!? This thing has to be recharged!?\" Kuwabara grumpily looked down the paper until he found the section outlined in bold. \"Okay, to recharge, hold cube out in front of you...\" Kuwabara read, doing the action at the same time, \"And it automatically drains reiki from any living being withing a ten meter radius... Huh! Seems easy enough!\" Kuwabara said. He happened to notice that the next section said \"Warning!\" but the careless young stud chose to ignore it! Kuwabara deposited the paper back in his boxers, and noticed the cube was glowing! \"Hey! It's working! Urameshi, check it-- Urameshi!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kuwabara looked behind him, Yusuke seemed to be in a trance, his eyes glowing as a blue aura was slowly being absorbed from him! \"H-Hey! Urameshi! Snap out of it!\" Kuwabara ordered, but Yusuke still stood there! \"Wait... Oh crap!\" Kuwabara immediately lowered his arm. The cube stopped glowing, and Yusuke snapped right out of his trance! A portion of the cube was now lit up, about one half of it! Yusuke sure was an powerful source of energy... Speaking of which, the young raven-haired teen stood there, his hand on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man... What was that...?\" Yusuke said, rubbing his forehead. \"I feel kinda... Tired all of a sudden...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the little hamster wheel in Kuwabara's head to start turning. After making sure Yusuke wasn't harmed, he got an idea!</span></div></div>",

The smaller teen was already swaying slightly on his feet, looking totally worn out. He had already given a portion of his energy to power the device and Kuwabara had just drained twice as much more from him. He didn't want him to faint or keel over dead or anything so he held the cube closer to his chest and just settled for absorbing what he had. His thick thumb pressed down on the button, the jolt of energy passing through his body once more. Kuwabara grunted, keeping a tight grip on the box even as his body jerked slightly, power filling him again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke, still feeling slightly dazed, looked up in awe as Kuwabara's body stretched higher and higher, his shadow quickly overtaking Yusuke as his head neared the top of the lamp post, his body bulking up more and more! His chest pushed out in front of him, each pec looking like half a medicine ball was stuffed inside it, the massive muscles hanging heavily in front of him. His shoulders became more broad as he back flared out, his traps rising up around his thickening neck, his pecs nearly pressing up against his chin! His arms bulged out bigger, Kuwabara flexing the might mountains, making them rise up and up, a thick vein running over each peak! Yusuke looked at his own arm weakly, a pathetic stick in comparison to the gigantic pythons Kuwabara was sporting! His abs pushed out, row by row, each one bigger than Yusuke's head! He could get his hand crushed if he happened to put it between the enormous bricks! Kuwabara's boxers shredded as his dick coiled out in front of him, slapping meatily against his thigh, reaching nearly down to his knee! His ass perked up, growing rounder bouncier, and yet still covered by a layer of powerful muscle! His thighs started rubbing up against each other they were so huge, forcing Kuwabara to widen his stance, the concrete sidewalk cracking from his weight, the ground trembling. His calves followed suit, bulking up into a nice round shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done growing Yusuke barely reached Kuwabara's knee, his once human sized friend now a towering giant above him! Kuwabara moaned as his hands ran over his thick, meaty pecs, squeezing the muscle before testing its heft, pushing it up against his chin. He slowly flexed his arms again, one after the other, running his hand over the gigantic muscle, a split peak capping the top of it! He grinned down at Yusuke, slowly taking a step toward him. \"So NOW whose the strongest kid in Sarayashiki Jr. High, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was deep and rumbling, intimidating even Yusuke! Though this was partially due to his weakened state. He stumbled back and said, \"You think you're stronger than me? Just...Just because you're big? I've beaten down punks bigger than me before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara chuckled and said, \"Yeah? Well then come on! Hit me with your best shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked for it!\" Yusuke shouted, pulling his fist back, a glow surrounding it. He winced as he powered up his fist, knowing he had only one shot left after being drained. He charged forward, jumped, and slammed his fist into Kuwabara's abs! The spirit energy gathered in his fist exploded against Kuwbara's massive body, not leaving so much as a singe behind! Kuwabara laughed, his chest shaking as he did so, and reached down, grabbing Yusuke around the waist, lifting him up to his face. \"That all you got? You're not even a rival to me anymore! You're more like a pet!\" Kuwabara grinned as he thought of that. \"Yeah...Just my own little pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I'm your pet! Let me go you big ape!\" Yusuke shouted, struggling to free himself from Kuwabara's grip!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Settle down, it's not like I'm going to hurt ya!\" Kuwabara said, squeezing Yusuke slightly. \"Just don't piss me off and everything will be fine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed the cube lightly up and down in his other hand, thinking about what to do next. \"Hey, where are those demons hiding out anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A warehouse...in the bad part of town.\" Yusuke said, panting slightly, no longer bothering to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'm not going to wait until morning! I'm going to go down there and rip those demons apart with my bare hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naked?\" Yusuke said sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha? Ah! Oh geez...Yeah, I'd better do something about that...\" He walked over to his window, easily able to reach it at his new size. He dropped Yusuke off into his room and said, \"Get me a sheet or something off the bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" Yusuke said, grabbing a sheet off the bed and tossing it out to Kuwabara. \"There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" He said, wrapping it around his waist in a kind of loin cloth. \"Hehehehe! Okay, now I'm ready to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snatched Yusuke up again before the tiny teen could protest and started walking down the street. \"Hey! What do you need me for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a little fan there to cheer me on!\" Kuwabara said with a goofy grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother....\" Yusuke said, shaking his head. This was all going from bad, to worse!</span></div></div>",

Yusuke was taken for the ride against his will, as the gigantic Kuwabara strolled through town. Every step he took made the earth quake beneath him. Kuwabara got a cocky smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hear that Urameshi?\" Kuwabara said, putting a little more power into his next step! There was a loud crunch as the concrete beneath him crumbled. \"This is how real men stride through town! With a totally hulked out bod, and their big, meaty cock rolled right out!\" Kuwabara said, reveling for a moment as he felt his huge dick hit against his left thight, then his right with every step! \"Yeah... And as soon as I drain those demons for all their worth, this entire town is gonna start respecting me! Y'know, even more than they already do!\" Kuwabara said, just barely able to catch himself in what he said. Saying they would start meant they never did to begin with! And there was no way he was going show even a hint of weakness in Yusuke's presence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, whatever.\" Yusuke replied, his head resting on his hand, and his elbow resting on Kuwabara's fist. Part of him was worried about just how big Kuwabara was going to get! In the back of his mind, he hoped he'd forget about the cube for a moment when he was fighting the demons so he could snatch it away! He's big enough to defeat them as it is, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn just a few minutes, Kuwabara had arrived at the warehouse. The door was cracked open, just barely wide enough for Kuwabara to sneak in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Urameshi...\" Kuwabara said in a whisper, \"I'm gonna leave you here. I don't want a little guy like you getting hurt, or getting in the way, got it!?\" He said, poking Yusuke's chest as he sat him down on a crate. Without even letting Yusuke respond, he started walking closer to where a few lights were on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara just managed to hide behind some crates that were stacked high. He could definitely hear voices from the other side! As he peered over, he saw huge, buffed out men, all with horns on their heads, and bat wings that were comically too small for them! They had long, scaley tails, some with spikes at the end! There was at least five of them too! Besides these characteristics, they looked entirely human! From their faces down to their toes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-- And by this time tomorrow, this entire city will belong to us!\" One of them said. He must have been the leader. He bore a mark on his chest, but Kuwabara was too far away to make out what it was. It was also at this moment that Kuwabara noticed that these creatures were jacked! Pecs pumped to perfection, biceps the size of Yusuke's head twice over, and long rows of powerful, rippling abs! Their leader seemed just a little bit bigger than the rest of them, but thankfully still smaller than Kuwabara!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Time to put this thing to use!\" Kuwabara mumbled to himself. Looking over one more time, he saw that two of the demons were just in range... He held out the cube, just as instructed, and began to drain the two of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all going well for a while, until he heard one of them say, \"Hey! What's wrong with you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara still held his hand out, but kept perfectly still! He was bound to be caught, but he might as well get as much as he could while he still can! \"Hey look! Their aura! It's going... Over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go check it out!\" The leader ordered, \"And be on guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nodded, walking over to the crates at what felt like a slow pace. He rose his hand, and it suddenly morphed into a large claw! Kuwabara could feel a bead of sweat running down his forehead, as his heat beat out of his chest, making his pecs vibrate slightly!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swoop, the beast crashed his claws into the crates, knocking over and crushing several of them in the process! Kuwabara released the cube's absorption, the divine object now fully glowing! Kuwabara turned with a worried look on his face, and saw that all of the demons were glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him!\" The leader shouted! Two of them dove right for Kuwabara, while the two under the spell fell to the ground, drained out for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the enemies coming right at him, Kuwabara didn't have time to press the button! He brought back his fist and punched one of them square in the face, making a loud crack as he did! He managed to crack it's jaw in just one hit! Kuwabara got a sudden burst of confidence as he heard this. The other one suddenly grabbed his other fist, making Kuwabara drop the cube just a few feet away! A little panicked, and a little more angered, Kuwabara shook him off, slamming him right into the steel walls of the warehouse! As the first demon that charged Kuwabara swooped in for more, Kuwabara kicked as hard as he could right in the beast's chest! There was another loud crack, multiples ones all at once! The demon lackey fell to the ground, unable to fight with so many cracked bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara turned and looked to the other one which was still clinging to his arm, but still recovering from the first blow. Kuwabara grinned, and flung him down to the ground, before stomping down hard on his chest as well! This immediately killed the demon, having not only broke him, but the resulting breaks piercing his vitals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara then turned back to the leader, a cocky smile on his face. The leader looked quite surprised by all of this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You! Who are you!?\" He demanded to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, me? I'm Kuwabara Kazuma, and I'm here to kick you little ass back to the demon plane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fufu... Kuwabara... What a ridiculous name...\" The leader said, shaking his head as he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!? What's your name then, you little runt!?\" Kuwabara replied, ticked off already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Gochuru.\" He replied simply. \"Not like it matters. In fact, I <i>was</i> getting a little hungry... I guess an idiot like you will have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You? Eat me!? Look again, genius! I'm like three times as big as you!\" Kuwabara replied in a cocky tone, bouncing his huge pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGochuru just chuckled once more, before tapping the tattoo on his chest. It began to glow a firey red, and before Kuwabara's very eyes, Gochuru began growing bigger! His body seemed to shoot up with every pulse, and it was only a matter of seconds before he was even taller than Kuwabara by at least 10 feet! Not to mention his muscles were so massive, that it made Kuwabara's prodigeous arms look like matchsticks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge beast that was Gochuru laughed, his deep, thunderous voice echoing throughout the warehouse, shaking it violently! He licked his teeth, getting his chops wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you saying again, you PUNY mortal?\" He asked. Kuwabara was in a panic all over again, when he remembered the cube! He looked behind him for a split second, only to see...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cube, which had been glowing brightly just mere moments ago, was now starting to lose it's glow! Kuwabara quickly grabbed it, his senses...sensing that spirit energy was beginning to flow back OUT of the cube for some reason! Whether this was because Kuwabara had filled the cube up with so much spiritual energy it was now beginning to leak out en masse or it just naturally began to leak spiritual energy after a certain period of time, Kuwabara didn't know or care. All he DID know was that if he didn't press the button and reap this energy now he was going to get his ass beaten and then eaten! Gochuru grinned wickedly as he began to slowly advance towards Kuwabara. He was in no rush. This was the first time he had had to unlock his dragon seal in years. It was almost disappointing that the enormous human in front of him, who was far bigger than any human he had ever encountered in his long life, was still going to be no match for his true power! Still, a little snack before continuing his work would make for a nice break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile all this was going on, Yusuke watched from behind the crates, grimacing slightly as he saw how huge Gochuro had grown. \"That red headed idiot...he's going to make himself even bigger! This is getting way out of hand!\" He lifted his finger up and took aim, a spirit gun charging at the tip. \"Maybe if I can distract that damn lizard Kuwabara will be able to beat him without growing any more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited until Gochuro was reaching out to grab Kuwabara, then fired the energy bullet directly at the demon's eye! His aim was true, the bullet smashing into the creature's eye! Gochuro yelled out in pain, stumbling backwards slightly and gripping his face, a scorch mark appearing around the right eye! Kuwabara glanced over his shoulder and saw that his opponent was vulnerable! Yusuke grinned and blew a puff of air against his finger, blowing away the imaginary smoke from his finger. \"Perfect shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled over at Kuwabara only to have his happy expression be replaced by one of dismay. The cube was dark and Kuwabara was clearly growing again! He must have pressed the button before Yusuke could get the shot off! The raven haired teen could only watch as Kuwabara grew both taller and wider, his already massive chest bulging out in front of him, the canyon between them growing deeper, looking like Yusuke's whole arm could get caught between the thick slabs of muscle! His shoulders broadened as his back flared out, his abs popping up into sharper relief, one by one, row by row, a fourth row appearing near the top, adding another layer of defense to Kuwabara's already impressive armor! His biceps swelled, bulging upward almost obscenely, making Yusuke's entire body look puny and weak! His thighs bulked up as well, slowly pushing Kuwabara taller, his make shift loin cloth coming undone, revealing his impressive and still increasing cock and balls, making any normal human man look painfully inadequate in comparison! Yusuke was only able to see Kuwabara's shapely, rock hard ass grow rounder and bouncier, practically begging someone to touch it. Yusuke blushed slightly, turning away, mentally smacking himself. Because he looked away, he missed Kuwabara's calves practically bursting with size, forcing his body up even taller, his feet stretching across the cold concrete floor, his clenching toes gouging out huge chunks of concrete as they grew longer and thicker!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, just as Kuwabara pulled his gigantic arm back, his height exploded upward, propelling his body and fist upward, smashing it as hard as he could into Gochuro's chin, sending the massive demon flying backward, obliterating several crates on the opposite side of the warehouse. Kuwabara laughed obnoxiously, his thick pecs bouncing with every intake and exhale of air. \"Did you see that Urameshi?  I totally kicked that loser's ass no problem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be an idiot Kuwabara!\" Yusuke shouted, still blushing slightly, his height now barely reaching the level of Kuwabara's shin. \"Finish him off before he gets back up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I'm not kicking a guy when he's down! That goes against my code!\" Kuwabara said, frowning over his shoulder at Yusuke. \"Besides, just look at me! No way that demon is going to be able to beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGochuro, finally recovering after the punch left him in a daze, looked in shock at Kuwabara. The human, who had only just minutes before had been utterly puny, was now his equal in height! And his better in muscle mass! Gochuro couldn't help but grin. Finally, a challenge worthy of his own power! Without hesitation, while Kuwabara was talking with Yusuke, he charged forward, slamming his fist into Kuwabara's abs! The red headed punk grunted and then glared at Gochuro in annoyance, smashing his fist against the demon's face, a sickening crack heralding the breaking of one of the bones in Gochuro's face! The demon howled in pain while Kuwabara chuckled, walking up to him and punching him again in the gut, then kicking him in the chest, sending him flying backwards! Kuwabara's muscles weren't just larger than Gochuro's, they were also much denser, each muscle effectively shielding his body better than even the finest armor could! Gochuro swung his tail around, the thick appendage smashing into Kuwabara's arm, the blades burying themselves into his skin with enough force to seer it! Kuwabara merely winced, a slight bruise rising on his skin before he grabbed the tail and yanked Gochuro forward, punching him again and again in the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting, the demon hit the floor hard enough to crack the concrete, his face looking bruised and puffy from all the beatings. This was unheard of! Where he came from, in all his experiences, Gochuro was an unstoppable force, a powerful leader of a gang of blood thirsty demons, easily able to scour the human world and cause as much mayhem and destruction as he wanted! No one was a match for him! And now...now he was getting completely obliterated by ONE over sized human! The humiliation was unbearable! He clenched his fists and looked around, spying first the cube and then Yusuke shortly after. A plan quickly formed in his head and he leaped forward, towards the cube! Yusuke, seeing what the monster was doing, swiftly snatched the cube up before Gochuro did, barely managing to throw it to Kuwabara, who only just managed to catch it, before he was imprisoned in Gochuro's fist, the wicked creature slowly getting to his feet with an evil grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright human, you've had your fun, but now it's over!\" Gochuro said, squeezing Yusuke tightly. \"Hand over that cube and your little friend here won't get eaten alive!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuwabara glared fiercely at Gochuro. \"You hurt even a hair on his head and I'll beat you down so hard that nothing will be left! Not even a chunk of flesh or a drop of blood!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke shouted, \"Kuwabara, forget about me! Don't give this guy that cube for anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Urameshi! I'm not going to just sit here and let you get killed! You mean too much to me!\" Kuwabara shouted back, his voice deep, emotional, and commanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusuke blushed and made a \"tch!\" sound in his throat. \"You big idiot...\" He muttered, feeling his heart beat just a little bit faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your choice human!\" Gochuro said. \"So make it!\"</span></div></div>",

After the week of hard work he had, he was finally able to sit back and relax with a safe day of fishing. Of course, his aunt Mito was happy to have him safe and sound at home too! Yes, everything felt at complete and totaly ease now that Gon had returned home, even if just for a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon didn't get bored of fishing, surprisingly. He always enjoyed the challenge and mystery of pulling something up out of the lake, whatever it may be! As Gon sat there, bored, he felt a tug on his line! He pulled at the rod, and felt something pull back! He immediately began to reel it in, excited to see what he caught! Whatever it was, it didn't feel very heavy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon whipped his fishing rod out of the water, and saw as some rusted old rectangular case popped out! The young boy caught it in his hand and looked it over. The shape was really familiar... Gon took his sleeve, and wiped off some of the algae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! It's a Greed Island card case!\" Gon said, surprised. \"How did this get here...? Who put it here...?\" Gon mumbled, looking over the box. He tried pushing the button, but it was too rusted to move. Thankfully, Gon wasn't like other humans. Using a little nen power, he pushed a little harder and got it to pop open!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the case was just as worn as the outside. Gon stuck his tongue out in disgust, but all that asidet, three cards were stored inside! They were a bit worn out, and the descriptions were illegible. Still, what was the harm in activating them? Gon took the right-most card and held it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gain?\" Gon said, not expecting much. Just then, the card poofed, and a large bottle of clear liquid appeared in his hand! He looked carefully at the label on the bottle. \"Mad Scientist's Steroid...\" Gon read aloud. \"Oh! I remember this one! If I keep drinking these, I can get all the muscle I want!\" He said with a smile. He lifted this lithe young arm and flexed. \"I guess it couldn't hurt to be a little stronger...\" Gon said to himself. As he looked at his small bicep, he noticed the case still in his hand. \"Then again, there are a few more cards in here...\" Gon said, his curiosity peaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Gon decided...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The other cards intrigued him, but Gon was too wrapped up in the possibilities of the item already in his hands. He was incredibly strong for a kid his age, able to best opponents twice his age and size, but he was getting a little tired of people constantly underestimating him just because he didn't look powerful. A few swigs of the muscle enhancing steroid would definitely fix that problem! The only question was, just how much of the stuff should he drink? He snapped the card holder shut and hefted the bottle in his hands. It felt pretty heavy and there was a decent amount of the stuff inside. He popped the cork out of it and took a sniff. He recoiled, his nose wrinkling. \"Man! This stuff smells awful! Can't imagine how it tastes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes and took a little breath. Aunt Mito always said that things that were good for you never tasted good. If he wanted change, he was going to have to suffer a bit! He brought the bottle to his lips and started drinking. The liquid was as foul tasting as it was smelling. Gon's face screwed up in a grimace of disgust as he chugged a few mouthfuls, having to stop before a quarter of the bottle was gone. He quickly corked it again and dropped the bottle, coughing and wiping his mouth. The stuff burned as it slid down his throat and pulled in his belly. Gon groaned and leaned forward slightly, clutching his stomach. It felt like there was a nest of snakes writhing around inside! He let out a burp and covered his mouth, feeling like he might throw up. Luckily, he was able to keep it down, the burning sensation spreading all through his body, from the tips of his fingers and toes to the top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon stood up straight again, clenching his right hand, feeling a strange force welling up inside him. He let out a little yelp as his hand suddenly doubled in size! He lifted his other hand and noticed the same thing had happened to it! Before he could contemplate just what the heck was happening, his forearms thickened, matching his hands! His biceps followed suit, veins suddenly rising up along them as the once unimpressive boy sized muscle bulged up and up and up! Gon's shoulders were next, broadening and bulging, the straps of his white tank top (he always wore a simple white tank top along with his usual green shorts when he was fishing) almost getting lost between his massive shoulders and rising traps! Starting to feel a little top heavy, Gon watched in amazement as his chest suddenly ballooned out in front of him, the collar of his tank top getting forced down, the top halves of his pecs spilling out the top while his nipples peeked out the sides, the cotton material pulled tight to his body. With a low tearing sound, the tank top began to split right down the middle, in both the front and back, his once narrow back flaring out impressively. His abs followed suit, a rock hard six pack suddenly bursting into being all at once, the bottom of the tank top pulled tight around the second row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGon would have fallen over if his feet hadn't swiftly doubled in size, the bare soles spreading out across the soft grass, his toes clenching, digging into the dirt while his calves exploded outward behind him and his thighs thickened so much the legs of his shorts were suddenly filled to capacity, the material tearing open in some places. Wincing, Gon gripped the waistband of his shorts, which was cutting into his skin, and ripped the puny article of clothing right off his body, leaving him in nothing but a tight pair of briefs. He sighed and then winced again as he suddenly felt his boyhood extending and thickening, his balls swelling as well, the pouch sagging lower and lower until the waistband was pulled down a few inches, nearly showing off the base of Gon's cock. His ass filled with muscle as well, the back of his briefs pulled up so that half of each cheek was fully on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the growth came to a slow halt, Gon crashed down onto his ass, breathing heavily, his newly massive chest heaving. He felt tired but also strangely...invigorated! He lifted one arm up and slowly flexed it, grinning as he saw his bicep rise up like a little mountain, veins running over the tops, fueling the muscle. \"Heh! No one's going to underestimate me ever again!\" Gon said, struggling to his feet, getting used to his new bulk. He looked like a boy sized hulk! He began exploring his body, feeling every rock hard inch and swell, getting lost in his reveries. After a few minutes, he remembered the bottle, still mostly full and grabbed it. His grin grew wider as he shook it slightly, the liquid within sloshing about. \"Hmm...Let's see...I could drink some more of this stuff and get even bigger...Or I could check to see what the other cards are. Choices, choices~\"</span></div></div>",

He observed with his big bright eyes a box with a Nen-Fueled artifact he had purchased from the Southernpiece auction. The young, electric nen powered boy had convinced Gon to return to the city after learning from a call by the family servants. They reported his fatass of a brother Milluki was interested in an artifact that strengthened the user whether they could use Nen or not. Rumors online suggested it worked similar to an Enhancers ability, but beyond that it's power was simply said to be limitless and what it could do to them physically, as most nen had a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith their aid he had gotten the item sent to the cheap room rented out to him and Gon, who he had convinced to earn a bit of money by armwrestling some more folks in town like the last time they were here, promising him a gift he'll enjoy when he gets back. \"See you in a bit Killua!\" Gon said cheerfully as he left, though he planned on coming back much sooner than Killua wanted since he coupdn't wait to see the present Kil got him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"With that kind of power Gon would be unstoppable.\"</i> Killua blushed as he thought about it, touching the box. A part of him wanted the power himself, ensuring he could protect Gon no matter what. He knew Gon would easily bend him to doing dangerous stunts that put their lives in danger, and as much as he doesn't want to admit it he would give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouching the box, Killua wasn't sure how to activate it's ability, as despite the nen aura and symbols on each side it had no openings or parts to move. He was oping something might show up on it. <i>\"Maybe it needs some nen?\"</i> he thought, releasing some of his own Nen and had it come in contact. Nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. I was hoping that'd work.\" he fussed with as he sat down and put his hands on shoes clad feet. \"Maybe it needs some force?\" With that in mind Killua activated his electric nen- causing his hair to stand straight  up as electricity and Nen glowed around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKillua grabbed it and put both hands on the opposite side of the box, pushing force upon it as he yelled \"Now work you dumb device!\" The electricity that flowed through combined with the Nen made the symbols on the box glow, and as the box reacted to his wish three of its strange symbols vanished, appearing on Killua's back and a wave of energy sent Killua flying backwards, using his speed to precent himself from crashing into the wall and landing safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThouugh he was fine, the energy wave had destroyed his shirt, leaving his lean, toned upper body on display. \"Damn!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"But siiiiiiiis!\" Genis whined, as his sister, Raine, put a book up high on a shelf where Genis couldn't reach. The two Sage siblings were in the schoolhouse of Iselia, and Raine knew that hiding this tome in the school was safe, as long as it was kept out of Genis' hands. You see, only elves and half-elves could cast magic, and last Raine knew, her and her brother were the only ones in the entire village!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Genis.\" Raine said sternly, almost as if to strike fear into the boy. Genis, on the other hand, was used to it. Raine always took that tone to keep him out of mischief. \"The arcane arts in this book are far too dangerous for someone like you to use.\" She added on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, sis! Just one spell! I could be really useful then!\" Genis begged, trying to do whatever he could just to get a peek at the book!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Genis.\" Raine repeated, bopping her little brother on the head with a different book. Not so much that it hurt, but at least enough to repremind her little brother. Genis rubbed his head, his tongue sticking out all the while. \"Now go start getting ready for class.\" She ordered, speaking in a softer tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis sulked away, heading to his desk to get ready. It's not like his sister's lessons really taught him anything. After all, he LIVED with her. Sometimes it felt like being in school even when he wasn't in school! Talk about annoying... As time passed by, more and more students flocked to the school, the only faces Genis cared to see were his friends, Lloyd and Colette. A smile and a wave, and before any of them knew, Raine began her lectures for the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis sat there bored for the majority of the class, the thoughts of that tome never leaving his mind. Raine had brought it back recently from some large jungle not too long ago, while she was looking into some ruins. All she brought back was that single tome. Of course, the only mistake Raine made was telling Genis just what was written inside the book: various spells. Right after that, Genis had begun to beg non-stop, asking to see the book!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised she hasn't flipped out on me yet...\" Genis thought to himself. \"Then again, sis always was the calmest one out of all of us...\" Genis sat there thinking, when he suddenly hit him! He was surprised he didn't think of it sooner! Why not just snatch the book up after Raine left today!? Then again, would she really be so careless...? Genis decided it was at least worth a try...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClass seemed to drag on forever, but other than Genis, everyone always seemed to enjoy Raine's lectures. Probably because they didn't have to hear them three times a day! But all in all, class soon drew to an end, and everyone was leaving the room, including Genis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust outside the hall, Lloyd met up with Genis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Genis!\" Lloyd called out, ruffling Genis' messy white hair as he caught up with him. \"Did you want to do something today?\" Lloyd asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... I had something else to do...\" Genis replied, looking a bit nervous. Lloyd got a bit of a surprised look! Genis was always willing to head out with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he just needs a break...\" Lloyd thought to himself. He then wore a smile on his face as he turned around. \"Alright then, I'll see you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Lloyd!\" Genis said with a big smile on his face! Lloyd was always so nice and understanding to him! Genis then peeked around the corner into the classroom. Raine took her staff from the corner of the room, and used it to knock the tome off of the high shelf. With a little finesse, she caught it in her hand, and made her way back to the desk. Genis just smiled to himself. Now all he had to do was hide out until Raine left!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was already starting to set on this fine day, and Genis was getting bored from hiding behind some old crates that had been delivered earlier in the day. Just then he heard a clap, like a book closing! Genis snapped to attention, and looked around! Within a few seconds, Raine had exited the room, and was heading back home herself. By the looks of it, the book wasn't on her! Genis smiled. He had a few minutes to get in there and read the mysterious tome before his sister realized he wasn't at home, like he should have been!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Raine was out the front door of the school, Genis waited a few seconds, before then quietly making his way back into the classroom. Looking up on that high shelf, he saw the tome laying there, just begging to be read! By the looks of it though, Raine's staff was missing. She must have taken it with her... Genis then did the next best thing! He started taking desks, and stacking them on top of each other! He also got a pair of rulers, and tied them together to help him reach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis started to climb the miniature tower, and tapped at the book with the ruler. He managed to break it apart from the other books... Before knocking it off the shelf, right on top of his face! Genis let out a loud groan, as he then fell backward onto the floor. He laid there for a moment, before sitting up, the book falling from his face onto his lap. Looking around the room, he was still safe...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out his finger, and started to concentrate. After a few seconds, he whispered \"Photon!\" and a small ball of light appeared at his fingertip. He smiled to himself, and opened the book, starting with the tables of contents, like any right minded person would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... Explosion element... Forbidden spells... Ancient curses...\" Genis said in a soft voice, \"No wonder sis was hiding these! She probably wants to learn them all for herself first! ... Huh?\" Genis looked a little closer at one chapter. \"Human enhancement artes? Page 278...\" Genis mumbled. He then held his finger near the page marker, and started flipping until he reached 278. Using a little more energy, he made the photon a little brighter so he could read the whole page. He then began to read once more. \"The spells here listed do ensure... A mighty spoil for those it cure... Those once weak and of little weight... Shall find themselves extremely great...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis then flipped the page, where he found a list of several spells, but not a label to be found! He gulped to himself. \"W-Well... It said you'd extremely great...\" He gulped. Right now, he felt like it was a game of russian roulette. Hopefully he wouldn't die, but there was still no telling what any of these spells would do! Genis stood up and set the book on Raine's desk. He let out a deep breath, and began to charge his energy as he then started to read one of the spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greatest weapon, enhance theyself...!\" Genis said, focusing all his energy now... In a flash, it was released, and he soon found...</span></div></div>",

His pecs pushed out from his once flat chest, surging with strength until they were practically as huge as basketballs! His biceps tore his sleeves to shreds before massive, bowling ball sized arms took their place! His shirt was forcibly hiked up, revealing the bottom of a pair of tight, bulging six-pack abs! His height practically doubled, making him taller than all his friends, except maybe Regal! Though these muscles made Regal's look like a child! His traps rose up higher, making Genis a much more intimidating sight! His legs kept bulking up, not even stopping as his thighs came just a few centimeters from each other, still throbbing a little from the growth! His calves were bigger than softballs, twitching from sheer size! His feet tore through his boots, the straps of material falling apart easier than wet sheet of paper! His cock and balls throbbed slightly, pushing out more and more from his waist, making him even more of a man than he already was! To top him off, his ass pushed out from behind, giving him a hot bubble butt that you could bounce a quarter off of!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Whoa...\" Genis stammered, looking over himself. \"I'm... I'm huge!\" He grinned, raising his arms and flexing them hard, tearing their way out of his sleeves, leaving his arms and shoulders bare! He looked like a full-grown man in children's clothing. Genis didn't mind one bit! It all stuck so tightly to his fair skin that it looked painted on! Genis couldn't stop himself from smiling! Never had he felt so huge and powerful! \"Heh, I'm a man!\" He grinned, looking at his bicep, unable to take his eyes away from the muscle that kept swelling up in his face. A vein was throbbing along the top, rushing blood to feed the muscle! \"A BIG, STRONG man!\" He giggled, looking down at his pecs, taking a little grope of them. They filled his hand so perfectly, so soft and squishy until he finally flexed them and made them as hard as rocks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I gotta show someone!\" Genis thought suddenly, \"Yeah! What's the point of getting this big if I don't have people to look at me!?\" Genis pounded on his chest like an ape, grinning as he looked at the puny desks of the classroom! \"Heh, sorry sis, but I gotta try something out!\" Genis slowly walked over, his hand rubbing on the desk briefly. \"Yeah... Seems sturdy... HYAAH!\" Genis suddenly drove his fist through the desk, snapping it in two like a matchstick! Genis found himself grinning once more, loving how massive and powerful he was that he could break the desk to splinters! \"Heh heh! That was so cool!\" He grinned, excited that he did it so easily!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I know what I gotta do now! I gotta go find...\"</span></div></div>",

W-Whoa!\" Genis looked down in amazement! His body was still the same size it was to begin with, but with one major change! His pants were bulged out obscenely in the front, his dick pressed tight against the material of his pants, to the point the seams were stretched out! It looked like there was a huge tennis ball can attached to his hips, and speaking of balls, his had practically grown to the size of baseballs! Genis blushed a little, giving himself a little poke just to make sure it was really his! \"There's no way...!\" Genis pulled down his pants and underwear together in one quick motion! His mouth gaped open as he saw the beast in the flesh, it's whole ten-inch glory! \"I... This... Oh man, Raine is gonna kill me if she sees this!\" Genis said to himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of things Raine would kill him over, Genis looked back up and noticed the book! \"Y-You!\" He said, slamming his fists down on the book, \"This is your fault!\" He said angrily. The book... Did nothing. It was a book, it's not like it could talk back to Genis or anything. Genis just sighed. \"And even worse, Raine is sure to find out I got ahold of you one way or another...\" Genis closed the book up, not wanting to tempt fate by even trying another spell. \"Well... If I'm gonna get caught, I might as well go all the way!\" He said to himself! Genis closed the book up, and was about to put it up, when his bulge rubbed up against the desk! His eyes widened for a moment, before looking back down at it. He repeated the movement, and a little blush rose onto his cheeks! \"Hey... That feels kinda good...\" Genis thought to himself. Before he could get addicted to the feeling, Genis shook his head, before setting the book back down. \"I'd better reorganize these desks properly too...\" He said, turning to the big mess he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery desk Genis moved, every chair he pushed back in all made something rub up against his front! Sometime Genis would insist on being compulsive and making sure the desk was angled just right so it rubbed up against him a little more! Genis looked left and right, before he was absolutely positive that the room was back to the way it was before! Nodding to himself, he stashed the book under his arm and began to walk right out of the room!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the way, Genis got a little scratch in his pubic region. He reached down at gave it an itch, his silver pubes making a little \"skritch skritch\" as his nails moved along. It was then that Genis' hand gently touched the base of his dick! Genis gulped a little, before his hand started to slowly rub the top of his boyhood. \"That feels nice...\" He said softly to himself. He kept rubbing and rubbing, his open palm running along the soft, fleshy skin. Genis started to shiver a little in the hallway, as his head felt a little bit dizzy! Genis was just about to open the front door, but his hand couldn't even make it's way up to the knob without returning to his rod to rub it again! Genis whimpered softly, as his balls started to churn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ah... Ah...!\" Genis soon fell back on his rear, the book skidding off to the side! Genis' hand began to rub a little faster, and in doing so, his bulge started to pulse a little! It was starting to engorge, filling with blood that made his cock begin to harden! Genis quickly leaned on his back, and struggled to get his shorts off of his throbbing meat! It was difficult when he tried to get his underpants off of his stiff dick, which was actually growing even longer and thicker as he tempted it! In seconds, it landed with a thud on top of Genis' chest, making him grunt a little! Without waiting a second more, he grabbed his massive cock in his hands and began to pump it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis moaned as he laid there on the floor, rubbing his horse-sized cock in his hands! Every little stroke sent shocks of pleasure through his body, making him writhe on the floor, begging for more! Genis' muscles twitched, his hands a blur as he kept rubbing up and down his dick! A thick vein on the side pulsed, and every time Genis ran his hand over it, it only made him moan louder! His balls swelled just a little more, filled to the brim with hot seed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis had to use both hands, and kept pushing, working base to shaft, base to shaft, and even grabbing the reddened head at times! This made Genis cry out even louder, unable to contain all the pleasure that was building up within him! Genis may have been short, but now he was bigger where it counted! Any man would be green with envy once they got a peek at this monster Genis called a cock! The idea of finally being worshipped by others was arousing Genis even more, making his body work even harder than it already was! A little bit of pre squirted out from the slit of his junk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little time had passed, one of Genis' hands reached down and gently massaged his painful balls, which were begging for release! Genis groped and massaged them, his dick beginning to throb as he got closer and closer! His mind with flushed with thoughts of power, when he suddenly thought of Lloyd! Without a second thought, Genis' mind was cluttered with thoughts of Lloyd all over him... Loving up on him, kissing him, worshipping his mammoth of a cock...! All the rushing thoughts made Genis cum hard, shooting a seemingly endless web of hot juices all over! It sprayed all over his chest, all over his face, and not to mention the floor! Genis lay there flat, letting his cock flop off to the side. Genis was panting, his thin arms tuckered out from all the stroking...</span></div></div>",

Gone were all thoughts of what Raine might do to him, of all the trouble he was going to be in, of the mess he had made. Nothing seemed to matter in the post glow of the best orgasm he had ever had. As his dick began to slowly soften, his mind wandered back to the time just before his release, when visions of Lloyd had entered his head. Two spots of color rose to his cheeks as he remembered the things he had thought. He had never thought about Lloyd as anything other than a really good friend before but now...He slowly sat up, his cock flopping out into his lap. It twitched slightly as he thought of Lloyd. His cute, spiky hair, his winning smile, his athletic body...Genis slapped his cheeks, hard, a horrified look on his face. \"What am I doing?! This is LLOYD we're talking about! He's dumb and impulsive and kind of rude and...and...nice and caring and strong...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis trailed off, feeling more confused than ever. He had never experienced feelings quite like this before. It didn't help that his monster dick kept pulsing and twitching, begging for attention, fueled by thoughts of Lloyd. Genis sprang to his feet and, somewhat roughly, stuffed his boyhood back inside his pants. \"I know, I'll just...clean up this mess! And...and then I'll go see Lloyd! N-Not because I...want to do....things with him but...uh...um...ah! To hide! To get away from Raine until I can fix this! Yeah...good plan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe resolutely grabbed a mop and started wiping up his drying mess. \"Man...I can't believe that all came out of me!\" He said, with a small smile, rubbing his finger under his nose. He couldn't help but feel proud! He finished cleaning up the floors and looked down at himself. \"No way I'm going home like this...Guess I'll just have to hope Lloyd lets me use his bath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cleaned the mop off and ran from the school, heading out of town, following the forest path to Lloyd's house. He lived somewhat out of town, with his father Dirk and his pet Noishe. It didn't take more than a few minutes to reach the large, two story house. Genis quickly knocked on the door. The door opened, revealing Lloyd, his look of confusion turning to one of joy. \"Hey Genis! What are you doing out here so late? Aren't you going to get in trouble with Raine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well...that's kind of why I'm here.\" Genis admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! What did you do this time?\" Lloyd asked, his grin widening. \"Usually I'm the one who gets in hot water with Teach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, can I just come in for a second?\" Genis said, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...sure! Come on in. Dad went out into the forest with Noishe to inspect a mountain for mining so he'll be gone for a few weeks at least.\" Lloyd said, standing aside. \"I don't mind having the place to myself though! You can hide out here for awhile if that's what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great!\" Genis said, smiling back at Lloyd. \"Because I can't go home looking like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking like what?\" Lloyd asked, a look of concern rising to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn answer, Genis turned around, the massive bulge in his pants easily seen in the bright light of the house. Lloyd's eyes widened as big as dinner plates as soon as he laid eyes on his friend's impressive junk. \"Woah! Genis! What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed the book onto a table and said, \"I was looking up a spell to get...you know...b-bigger...and it only made my....you know...bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLloyd couldn't help but snicker, covering his mouth with his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not funny!\" Genis shouted, blushing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know...\" Lloyd said, still giggling slightly. \"Hey....can I see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! We're both boys here, right? I want to see if it's real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis looked uncertain but Lloyd WAS his best friend. There was even the chance that he had seen something like this before! Genis got to his feet and slowly pulled down his pants, revealing the beast once more. Lloyd crouched down, a look of awe on his face. \"I can't believe it...is it really real?\" He reached out and poked it, sending little shivers of pleasure through Genis' body. Lloyd gripped it lightly in his hand and started slowly pumping it, seemingly mesmerized by its size an thickness. Genis let out a little moan and sat back down, his legs feeling weak. Blood began to rush into the shaft, slowly hardening it, the dick rising up out of Lloyd's hand. As soon as Lloyd's warm fingers left Genis' area, the shorter boy snapped out of his pleasure induced stupor and jumped up, his cock head nearly smacking Lloyd in the chin! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I've got to take a bath!\" He stuttered, running from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGenis dumped a bucket of cold water over his head in the bathroom, trying to calm himself down. His erection slowly died down, but it wasn't easy making it go away! Genis sighed and started filling up the tub with warm water. When it was full, he sank in, letting out a happy sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time to relax~\" He quietly said to himself.</span></div></div>",

He closed the door to his bedroom behind him and flopped down on top of his bed. Today had been brutal on him. Practice had gone on for an extra two hours in preparation for the big game, not to mention that he had had four tests to take. \"I swear, those teachers get together to make sure they're all giving tests at the same time.\" He muttered to himself, groaning as he kicked off his shoes. His feet were killing him! He turned over and slowly dragged himself up to a sitting position, reaching down and pulling his socks off. He let out a sigh as he wiggled his toes. \"Free at last~\" He said with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai stretched as he got to his feet, already feeling more energetic now that he was at home with the weekend in front of him. He started undoing the buttons on his shirt as he booted up his computer. He had managed to take off his uniform, leaving him in a pair of briefs, before he heard a strange electrical buzzing coming from the computer. He raised an eyebrow and walked over to it, slamming his hand against the side of its casing. Izzy always gave him grief for treating computers like this, but it was the only effective method he had ever experienced. The screen stayed black and the buzzing got even louder. \"Man, that's annoying!\" He said to himself, his finger moving to press the power button to reboot the whole thing. Before he could press it the blackness disappeared, being replaced with an image of an egg. \"Woah...\" Tai said, sitting down in front of the machine. This had happened before! The egg on the screen was clearly a DigiEgg!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly brought his hands up to the keyboard and thought for a second. \"What was it Izzy told me to do?\" He thought to himself. \"Oh! I think I wrote it down somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe jumped up and started looking around his room, tossing things left and right as he searched for the code Izzy had given him. After ten minutes of searching, he gave a frustrated shout and roughly grabbed his cell phone. He flipped it open and highlighted Izzy's number, holding the phone to his ear as it started to ring. After about a minute, a voice, sounding somewhat annoyed, said, \"Yes? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Izzy, nice to hear you too.\" Tai said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really in the mood for games Tai.\" Izzy said, though his tone was softer. \"What do you need?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something really weird popped up on my computer. I think it's a DigiEgg!\" Tai explained, one hand on his hip as he stared at his computer screen. \"I can't remember what code I'm supposed to use when this happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy sighed and said, \"Didn't you write it down like I told you? I developed this code and specifically handed it out to everyone precisely so you could handle it on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I lost that.\" Tai admitted, somewhat sheepishly. \"Come on, can't you just tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit too complicated to discuss it over the phone.\" Izzy said. \"I'll just come over and check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Izzy! I owe you one!\" Tai said, flipping his phone closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his attention back to the screen, only to see the DigiEgg starting to hatch! Tai rushed over to the computer and sat down, his face moving closer to the screen. It didn't take long for the top part of the egg to pop off, releasing a sudden flash of bright light. Tai winced and moved back, covering his eyes at the same time. When the light faded, Tai moved his arm and stared at the screen. The DigiEgg was gone completely, replaced with a page of text. Tai's eyes moved back and forth as he read. He had only read about ten lines before he sighed, leaning back in his chair and rubbing his eyes. It was all completely incomprehensible to him. He could imagine Izzy's reaction already though. \"Prodigous! I can't believe that something THIS monumental could possibly be happening on this scale!\" or...something like that. He pushed his chair back and got up, heading for his closet to get changed into a more casual outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tai searched through his closet, the computer screen blinked, the wall of text disappearing, being replaced by a swirling black and white pattern. The pattern spun faster and faster until it was a blur, the screen seeming to sink in. Just as Tai turned around, clothing in hand, a burst of energy fired itself from the screen, connecting with Tai's bare chest. The young teen let out a yelp as he was knocked off his feet. With a moan, Tai rubbed his head as he sat up. His eyes widened as he realized that something was very, very wrong. His seemed to have disappeared, replaced by a strange, vast plain, alien monoliths rising around him. \"What...is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai slowly got to his feet and looked around, moving slowly over a strange, fuzzy ground. Tai was confused, but only for a moment. The more he looked, the more familiar everything appeared. The gigantic wooden pillars were the legs of his desk! The massive blue wall was the cover from his bed! And the fuzzy ground was carpet! \"No way! I'm tiny!\" Tai shouted. He then looked down. \"Oh crap! And I'm just in my underwear! Can things get any worse?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to his room opened, a looming figure stepping in. \"Tai? Are you in here? Your front door was unlocked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai gulped as  he looked up, up, up, into the face of</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tai gulped as he gazed up in slight awe of Izzy. The red haired teen was slowly looking around the room, a slight look of confusion on his face. He had a stack of books clutched under one arm, the other arm holding the door open to Tai's room. Tai had seen massive creatures before thanks to his adventures in the Digital World. Heck, he had rode on, talked with, and fought giant dinosaurs, wolves, bugs, and other indescribable creatures to the point that he didn't even bat an eye at seeing a Godzilla sized monster smashing a building. However, looking up at his friend towering above him, he felt a strange sense of fear. Maybe it was because Izzy was so familiar to him, a short kid with a big brain who he always literally (though never figuratively) looked down at was now this massive figure in front of him, god like in his proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe it was simply because he was on the ground and Izzy hadn't seen him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a thunderous step, Izzy's socked feet carried him into the room, the floor quaking under his every movement! Tai was knocked onto his butt for the second time that day, the vibrations from Izzy's footsteps growing more intense the closer he got! Tai scrambled to his feet as Izzy said in a strangely booming voice, \"Tai? Are you in here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy glanced into the closet, not putting it past Tai to be hiding or something, before moving back towards the door and calling out again. \"Tai! Are you in the bathroom or something? Flush if you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, Tai was running as fast as he could towards Izzy, his years of soccer training allowing him to easily sprint long distances for long periods of time. He waved his arms and shouted, \"Izzy! IZZY! I'M DOWN HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice was like a tiny squeak to the normal sized teen. Izzy didn't even register that Tai had spoken. He let out an annoyed breath of air and said, \"That Tai! He WOULD call me up and then just bolt. Why does he always think he can treat me like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the door to Tai's room and made his way over to the computer. Tai, shocked by Izzy's sudden change of direction, had to throw himself backward, landing on his butt for the third time that day as Izzy's enormous socked foot landed down directly in front of him. If he hadn't moved, he would have been crushed! Tai got to his feet, his limbs feeling a little shaky, and slowly made his way over to where Izzy was now sitting down. With a sigh, Izzy dropped the books on Tai's desk, opening one up before he began typing on the computer. Almost immediately Tai's normal Desktop disappeared, replaced by a blank black screen with a flashing cursor. Izzy checked something in the book before he began to type, his fingers flying across the keyboard as line after line of code appeared on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai watched as Izzy's eyes were practically glued to the screen, looking away only to check something in one of the books he had brought with him, his fingers never seeming to stop clacking across the keys. His massive body, still dressed in their high school's uniform, was otherwise utterly still. Tai increased his speed once again and ran as fast as he could towards Izzy's feet. This was his chance! Izzy could be working for hours trying to figure out what had happened on Tai's computer. \"I just hope whatever shrunk me doesn't do the same thing to Izzy!\" Tai thought, panting slightly as he arrived at his friend's feet. Tai really got a sense for how tiny he was when he realized he was no taller than his formerly shorter friend's toes. This made him pause and reevaluate his plan. The slightest wrong move and Izzy could end his life without even realizing it! \"If I tried to get his attention by scratching or biting his foot he might just think I'm a bug and crush me!\" Tai thought, shuddering as he imagined that gigantic foot landing mercilessly on top of him. \"But how else could I get his attention?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai slowly approached the feet and looked up, barely able to see Izzy's face far, far above him. \"Well, I guess I could just try and climb up there. I've climbed stuff before!\" He jumped up, gripping the top of the sock in his hands to hoist himself up on top of the foot, running over it to Izzy's ankle. He glanced up Izzy's pant leg and grabbed on to it, tugging it slightly. The material of the pants was thin, and rather slippery. \"I'd probably get about halfway up before I fell...and there's no way I'd survive a fall like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Izzy's huge hand pressed down on top of Tai, the fingers scratching the area he was standing on while simultaneously scooping him up! All of his movement had made Izzy's foot itch! Izzy slowly brought his hand back up to his face, opening his fingers and staring at his palm with a stern look on his face. His expression softened into one of amazement when he realized what he was holding. \"Tai? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai chuckled and waved up at Izzy. \"Yeah! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How...why...you're so tiny!\" Izzy said, his normally vast vocabulary failing him in his shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the DigiEgg I told you about?\" Tai said, sitting down on Izzy's palm. \"Well after I hung up with you it hatched and all this coding came out! I didn't understand any of it so I went to change out of my soccer uniform and something came out of the computer and hit me! Whatever it was, it shrunk me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy slowly got a big smile on his face. \"I don't believe it! That's amazing! I never would have thought something like this could be possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hastily dropped Tai onto the desk and went back to typing, his fingers flying across the keys even faster! Tai, feeling a little bruised by the sudden drop to the hard wood of the desk, glared up at Izzy and shouted, \"Hey! What about me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy glanced down at his miniscule friend and said, \"This is going to take awhile to figure out Tai. Especially on this outdated thing you call a computer. This would be a lot easier at my house. I can copy your hard drive and if use my own computer I could probably have this figured out in half the time it would take here. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy looked down at Tai with a neutral expression on his face. He obviously really wanted to go back home where he could experiment and figure things out more freely, but Tai wasn't sure he felt comfortable being taken out of his home into a strange, almost alien environment and in his underwear no less! On the other hand, it might mean getting back to normal size a lot faster. Izzy started tapping his finger, his neutral expression shifting to one of slight impatience. He was eager to get back to work, whether it be here or there. Tai sighed and finally came to a decision.</span></div></div>",

It's too weird being all tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy's neutral expression disappeared as he grinned, pure joy rising to his face. \"Perfect! It'll be more quiet over there too. My parents are on vacation so I've got the place to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai smiled and said, \"Yeah, Kari and my parents wouldn't exactly be silent around here. I don't think you'd get away with staying over here without me asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\" Izzy said, hooking a small black box into the computer. With a few swift keystrokes a new window popped up, showing a progress bar. All the files on Tai's computer were being copied and downloaded. \"Hopefully this won't take too long. Your computer IS rather slow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know, you've already said that.\" Tai said, crossing his arms. \"Not all of us are smart enough to build our own computers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy chuckled and leaned back, just looking at Tai.Tai blushed a little and crossed his arms, trying to cover up more of his body. Izzy had scientist eyes. It always felt like he was looking right through you, breaking you down, and analyzing you. \"Hey Tai?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Tai said, looking up at Izzy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be okay if I touched you? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'd hate for it to pass by without a proper examination.\" Izzy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai blushed even harder and said, \"Do...do you actually listen to yourself when you talk?! I'm not going to let you just start...poking and prodding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy leaned forward and said, \"Come on Tai! I'll be gentle, I promise! If I'm going to help you, you need to trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai hesitated but Izzy didn't wait for permission. He was far bigger than Tai after all. He gently, but firmly, pulled apart Tai's arms, leaving his athletic torso exposed. Izzy's index finger pushed lightly against Tai's chest, feeling the tiny pit pattering of Tai's racing heart beat. He smiled gently and pinched Tai's body between his finger and thumb, compressing his ribcage slightly. Tai was helpless to stop Izzy as his fingers touched him all over, leaving his personal areas alone. It only stopped when there was a pinging sound on the computer. Izzy turned to the screen and started typing again. Tai let out a shaking sigh, falling to the top of the desk, his legs weak. His whole body felt hot, a strange, almost erotic feeling coursing through his body. \"Get it together Tai...\" He muttered to himself, slapping his cheeks. \"You shouldn't be getting excited over something like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Are you ready to go now Tai?\" Izzy asked, getting to his feet and storing the hard drive in his bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...sure.\" Tai said, getting to his feet as well. Izzy held out his hand near the edge of the desk, allowing Tai to step onto his palm. He slowly brought his hand up to his chest and, using his other hand, pulled open his breast pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slide in.\" Izzy said simply, tilting his hand a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tai could prepare himself, Izzy's hand had tilted enough that he slid down the palm, falling into the open air of the pocket. He turned head over heels before landing softly on the bottom of the pocket. Tai looked up and saw Izzy's smiling face staring down at him before the flap of the pocket came down over the opening. Tai tried to get to his feet only to be thrown back down as soon as Izzy started walking. The pocket swayed back and forth, occasionally slamming Tai against Izzy's chest. It was a bit disorienting and soon, Tai was worn out. He let out a little groan and covered his face with his hands. \"This is all too weird.\" He said to himself. \"Izzy better be able to fix me soon. Maybe it'll turn out this is all a weird dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was barely any light that could filter down into the pocket. Tai was tired enough to fall asleep after all his adventures today, but all the noise from the outside world (honking cars, people talking, dogs barking) made it impossible to fall asleep. Every so often Izzy's massive hand would reach up and gently pat the pocket, making sure Tai was still there and safe. This all went on for about half an hour before Tai finally heard the jangling of keys, followed by the reassuring sound of a lock opening. The sounds of the outside world were all cut off within seconds, leaving an almost eerie quiet...except for the sound of Izzy's beating heart. Tai hadn't been able to hear it over the other noises. It was oddly soothing. \"Man, if I could have heard that all the way here I would have fallen asleep for sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight suddenly flooded down into the pocket, Izzy's gigantic fingers slowly lowering into it, gently wrapping around Tai and lifting him out. Izzy smiled and said, \"Well, we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai blinked, rubbing his eyes, trying to adjust to the bright light. Izzy's room was simple. There was a bed, a desk, a book case, and his computer on top of the desk. There was nothing else, not even a poster on the wall. \"I keep forgetting how bleak this place is.\" Tai said, looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I prefer the term spartan.\" Izzy said, setting Tai down on his desk before pulling the hard drive out and plugging it into his computer. \"Anyway, I'll probably be able to get this figured out soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Tai said, running over to the keyboard and staring up at the screen. Izzy's hands came down on either side of him, striking the keys in a flurry of movement. It was kind of mesmerizing watching Izzy work. It was almost poetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Izzy said</span></div></div>",

Maybe it's because the data is on a different computer now...?\" Izzy scratched his head for a moment as he laid back in his chair. \"This... Might take me a little bit longer now...\" Izzy said with a sigh. Just then, the screen blinked! It blacked out suddenly, and there was a flashing white square in the corner. Izzy got in close to look at it, and in but second it began to type all on its own! It didn't take long for it to say but two simple words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Press Enter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Enter?\" Izzy said, looking at the keyboard then back at the screen! His finger dangled over the button, but he began to hesitate...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy?

You might end up shrunk too... I might end up even smaller!\" Tai got a little shiver down his spine as he thought of the idea... Especially if Izzy were to remain the same size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat there in silence for a moment, not quite sure what to say. It took a moment for Tai to finally speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy, we have to press it!\" Tai said, looking up at his giant red-headed friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Tai...\" Izzy said, his voice expressing concern more than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Izzy, if we don't press then nothing is going to change!\" Tai said, \"If we just sit here worrying about something that might not even hurt us we won't get anywhere...\" Tai looked up at Izzy's worried face and held up his hand, his pinky extended. \"No matter what happens, you'll always be my best friend, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy smiled a little bit, before reaching and touching his pinky to Tai's. \"Right.\" He agreed, nodding as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best friends... Yeah...\" Izzy thought to himself. He reached in and pressed the enter key! It all seemed to happen so slowly, when Izzy heard a tiny \"Whoa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Izzy looked down at Tai! He blinked a few times, before looking a little closer! Tai seemed just a few inches bigger, and maybe his body just a little bit more defined?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Izzy said to himself, as his eyes gazed at Tai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that felt kinda good! Press that again!\" Tai requested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you got a little taller too...\" Izzy said. He put his finger down on the desk and notice how Tai was about as tall as his index finger. He then reached over with his other hand and tapped the key again! He looked at Tai and was amazed as he saw his little friend grow another full inch taller!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You're right!\" Tai said, putting his arms behind his head! \"Keep pressing it! Get me back to how tall I used to be!\" Tai insisted with a cute grin on his face!

The near silence was almost immediately broken as Tai let out a little moan, his body stretching taller and wider, his once skinny body actually becoming more defined as he grew. His once flat chest was slowly puffing out, rounding into pecs, his stomach gaining the outline of a six pack. His biceps bulged upward, bit by bit, his thighs and calves growing just a bit. It was all very subtle, but felt amazing to the growing digidestined. Izzy kept his eyes on the computer, checking the coding for any changes or irregularities as he tapped the key, his eyes glancing over at Tai with every moan his friend made. He could feel his face flushing slightly, Tai's voice getting slightly deeper as he passed a foot tall in height. The desk was starting to creak a bit as the growing boy continued to increase in size.

Sorry about that.\" Tai said with a little laugh, jumping down onto the floor. \"I know this is going to sound really weird, but you have no idea how awesome it is that I can make the floor shake again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai jumped up and down a few more times, stopping when Izzy got up and grabbed him, holding him up off the floor like he was a buff little toddler. \"Please don't do that!\" Izzy said with a sigh, sitting back down, his right arm wrapped around Tai's chest, holding him against his body. \"My parents may be out but I still live in an apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai sighed, pushing fruitlessly against Izzy's arm. \"Okay, okay, just keep pressing and I can get back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy nodded and pressed the button again. However, while the two friends had been arguing, the coding had changed once more. With a single press, Tai surged up a foot, bringing him to two feet, the sudden weight making Izzy gasp slightly. He let Tai go, the small teen dropping to the floor again .\"Woah! That felt...amazing! Do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy pressed the enter key. Three feet. Again. Four feet. Once more, five feet. Tai was nearly back to his original height, more or less the same size as Izzy now. He was ecstatic, grinning from ear to ear, looking at himself in the mirror. \"Hey, I'm liking the improvements here! Is there some reason I got more muscular Izzy?\" Tai asked, bouncing his respectable pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy scanned the lines of code and said, \"Interesting...it seems like the program is evolving. The shrinking appears to be a security program. It's supposed to stop unwanted users from hacking into the system. The program must have started rebooting after that, bringing up the coding for the original purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the original purpose is...what?\" Tai asked, only half paying attention to this technobabble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy slapped his forehead and said, \"Look at yourself! That's the original purpose! It manipulates data to improve efficiency. In this case, making you bigger and stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! But wait...I'm not made of data! We're not in the Digital World either.\" Tai pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty astute of you Tai.\" Izzy said with a smile. \"I didn't think you'd question that. Well, since we've spent so much time in the Digital World, our DNA has been permanently altered. There are now trace bits of data integrated into our genetic makeup, essentially making us part digital. Of course, according to the coding here, only those with two different chromosomes can be affected. So certain humans and Digimon can't be affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! So we could buff you up too if you wanted!\" Tai said, slapping Izzy on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy blushed at having the almost naked, newly buff Tai standing so close behind him. He gulped and said, \"Y-Yes, I suppose we could...But we're not quite done with you yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the enter key one more time, sending Tai surging up past his original height, stopping at six feet even, his musculature that of a high school football player. American football that was. His underwear had grown with him but it was still sagging under the weight of his improved bulge, his dick and balls clearly outlined against the fabric while the material rode up in the back, showing off his perfectly sculpted ass. \"Little bigger than normal but I'm not complaining!\" Tai said with a chuckle, grinning down at Izzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his part, the genius teen felt a little intimidated, seeing Tai so huge in front of him. Tai sat down on Izzy's bed, either not realizing he was practically naked or not caring. \"So, I guess you want me to go home now huh? So I won't be bothering you?\" Tai asked, sounding a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\" Izzy said, his heart beating just a bit faster. \"I'd like you to stay around for awhile. My parents are going to be gone for a week so I don't see why you shouldn't stick around. I, uh, have more experiments I want to run! I think this program has a lot more to it than I thought!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai smiled and said, \"Cool! It'll be like having a sleepover!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just like that.\" Izzy said, smiling at Tai's excitement. \"First things first, I want to see how much I can manipulate the coding to affect your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept talking, listing off dozens of possibilities while Tai zoned out slightly. He was more interested in effect than theory. Izzy was interrupted suddenly by a loud growling sound, emanating from Tai's stomach. Tai grinned sheepishly and held his abs. \"Whoops, guess I'm a little hungry. I haven't eaten dinner yet today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right.\" Izzy said, looking at the clock. \"I'm not much of a cook so how about we just order out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm starving! How about we order a couple pizzas?\" Tai said, getting to his feet and moving to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, you should probably get some clothes on.\" Izzy said, finally bringing attention to how much skin Tai was showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...guess so.\" He said, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about fifteen minutes the pizzas were ordered and Tai was wearing one of Izzy's shirts, the hem barely reaching the second row of his abs, the material clinging tightly to his body, a pair of pants more like capris on his manly legs. \"I look ridiculous!\" Tai said, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, before you looked ridiculous. Now you look halfway presentable.\" Izzy said, his focus back on the computer. \"Just head downstairs and wait for the pizzas, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine.\" Tai said, heading to the living room area, waiting on the couch. He sighed and stretched out, scratching his gurgling stomach. \"Maaaaaan those pizzas better get here fast!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rather large teenager was lucky. After only about fifteen minutes, but what felt like an hour to Tai, with nothing to do but wait and listen to the constant clacking of computer keys in Izzy's bedroom, the doorbell rang in a loud buzzing noise. Tai leaped up excitedly, running over to the door and throwing it open. \"Hey! Bout time you got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly older teen delivering the pizza looked at Tai in shock. It wasn't every day you saw a six foot Japanese high school student in clothes that looked three sizes too small for him after all! He held up the four boxes and said, \"Uh...that's going to be...twenty two fifty six, tip not included.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai moaned and pulled his wallet out, thumbing through the bills. \"Fine...ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty five. Keep the change!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed the money off in one hand, using the other to snatch the four boxes, balancing them on his palm, his bicep bulging slightly as he slammed the door in the pizza guy's face. He wasn't trying to be rude or anything, he was just really hungry! The smell of fresh pizza wafted up from the boxes, making the musclebound digidestined drool in anticipation. \"Man...this is going to be so good! HEY IZZY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice had a distinct bellow to it as he called out to his brainy friend. Izzy jumped, a couple of papers full of complicated looking calculations flying around a bit. \"What is it Tai?\" He called back, swiveling his chair slightly. He had been so focused on the computer program he hadn't even heard the doorbell ring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food's here! Do you want some or not?\" Tai asked, the first box already open, two slices stacked on top of each other, cheese to cheese, in his big hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just...eat however much you want Tai!\" Izzy responded, turning to face the computer again. \"I'm busy with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai shrugged and said, \"Suit yourself! Don't be mad if there's none left for you though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy didn't reply, his attention already focused back in on the computer, fingers flying across the keyboard. He was learning a great deal about this strange program, mainly what it could be used for, but still had no clue where it had come from or who might have made it. It seemed almost too good to be true; a sure fire way to drastically increase a digital being's size and strength and with absolutely no negative effects or repercussions. Surely something like this MUST have a catch! Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the living room, Tai had already finished off an entire pizza, letting out a loud burp as he crumpled the box up, his biceps and pecs flexing and jumping at even the slightest movements! Tai grinned and bounced his pecs, loving how heavy and strong they felt. \"After I'm done eating I'm going to have to get Izzy to give me another bump!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled as he opened up the next box, a supreme pizza unveiled before his eyes. As he dug into it he wondered if this was how the Digimon felt after they digivolved, this sudden surge of power and height, as though the whole world was suddenly open to them. Tai didn't only feel stronger he felt more confident and he was already an intensely confident kid to begin with! \"I wonder if that program of Izzy's has any limits on it?\" He thought to himself, imagining standing as tall as Greymon, with muscles and a package to match! He grinned again, a piece of pizza clenched between his teeth as he did a double biceps pose. \"Yeah, not just strong, the strongest! No one would be able to mess with me or my friends ever again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai had been feeling a slight sense of inadequacy lately, ever since the events with the Digimon Emperor. The second generation of digidestined had eventually prevailed and Ken had even joined their team but for the longest time there had been absolutely nothing he could do. Feeling so helpless had left him angry and frustrated, wanting to be able to do something, anything, to help! \"Well now if there's any kind of evil force that tries to mess with us, I'll be able to go in there myself and stomp it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted his big bare foot and brought it down, swiftly, making the entire apartment shake! Izzy jumped in his room again and shouted, \"Tai! Stop stomping around out there! You sound like an elephant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai slurped the pizza up into his mouth and tilted his head. \"Huh...not an elephant but maybe I can be as big as one. Or bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he finished the second pizza he was full, saving the other two boxes either for Izzy or for a later snack. He dusted his hands off and got up, walking back over to Izzy's room. \"Yo, Izzy! I have a question for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Tai?\" Izzy asked, his eyes moving swiftly back and forth as he read the code he was typing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering if you could grow me some more.\" Tai asked, rubbing the back of his head. \"You know, just a little bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzzy blushed as he imagined the already big Tai even bigger! \"U-Uh...w-well...I suppose we could. You know, for testing purposes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai grinned and said, \"Awesome! Let's do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah!\" Izzy agreed, shifting over to the main program, bringing up the original screen. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai stood tall, hands on his hips, nodding. \"Go for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Izzy began to press the Enter key again. Just how many times did he press it?</span></div></div>",

Tai could feel his heart throbbing with excitement as the sound of each \"click\" hit his ears! He could slowly feel as his muscles were starting to expand and grow! He felt it in his pecs first, every throb of his heart making the powerful muscles push out another inch! Pump, pump, pump, his heart seemed to beat in time with his muscles bulging out! His shoulders spread out even further, until Tai was getting wider than the door frame! He might not be able to get out of his room as easily as he had before, but he didn't care. Tai was currently consumed with a lust for size, in love with the feeling of his muscles getting huger and stronger! His biceps kept swelling, getting bigger and bigger as veins stretched along them. They were pulsing as he could feel blood rushing to them, making them pump up even huger! Izzy kept watch on Tai, his finger idly tapping the key a few times more! Tai's biceps must have been even bigger than his head by now and they were still getting bigger! His abs tightened up and flexed, pushing further off of his abdomen! Each of them a hard brick of muscle. Anyone who tried to punch him in the gut might find themselves quickly in pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaauugh... It feels so good...!\" Tai moaned, his fist clenching tightly as his other hand rubbed and squeezed his thick pecs. Each one so big and heavy in his hand... Izzy was watching with a small blush on his face. He gulped slightly as he watched his close friend getting even bigger before his eyes! He was starting to get a stirring below the belt, his dick starting to get hard as he kept watching!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai's hips spread out wider to accommodate his muscular, bulging ass that was getting bigger just behind his back! He could feel his thighs getting larger because they had gotten so huge that they started to press up against each other. They were utterly massive, so powerful he could crush a coconut between them! His calves were becoming like pillars to support his gargantuan frame that was still getting huger as his head started growing higher and higher to the ceiling! In mere seconds, the two of them heard a loud \"CRACK\" as his head was starting to press up into it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, whoops!\" Tai chuckled, slowly getting back down, resting his legs on either side of Izzy. This only made Izzy blush even harder as he was practically between Tai's growing legs. His eyes glanced left and right, looking at the massive bulldozers Tai called feet. Each of them was nearly the size of Izzy's torso! Slightly tanned from Tai's outside activities, each toe was bigger than Izzy's hand! The ball of his heel so firm, and yet the soles looked so soft, every little indent looking like cotton stretched so hard that lines formed... Izzy would have loved to touch them, to rub them... Perhaps... Even... To lick them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! My face is up here!\" Tai said with a chuckle, noticing that Izzy was looking at his feet. Tai could feel his pecs gently brushing against his chin from time to time as he had to gaze down to look at Izzy. Izzy looked back up at Tai, his eyes going straight forward where he could see Tai's bulge that was pressing obscenely out from his hips, his tight boxers barely able to conceal all that manhood! Izzy gulped once more, taking a second glance at it. He could have swore that it had a heartbeat of it's own, throbbing a little more as Izzy continued to look at it! He slowly looked up at Tai, who had a cocky grin on his face, his eyes half lidded as he gazed back down at Izzy. Izzy just chuckled a little as his eyes met with Tai's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Izzy heard from Tai's lips was...</span></div></div>",

The next thing Izzy heard from Tai's lips was: \"If you like it so much, rub it.\" Izzy couldn't believe what Tai said, getting flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Izzy asked confused. Tai's face went back to normal looking at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you like how my pecs look, you can rub them.\" Izzy felt relieved as he read Tai wrong, but was still nervous about torching Tai's bare chest. He walked up to Tai and rose his hand to touch them. They felt huge and warm and above all, they were real. Izzy rubbed Tai's pecs which both felt enjoyable. \"Hey Izzy. It's a little cold in here.\" Izzy remember Tai was practically naked in front of him. Izzy seemed like he remembered something and left the room. Tai continued to entertain himself by bouncing his huge pecs. When Izzy returned, he had a rather large box. \"What's in the box?\" Tai ceasing his pec bouncing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora tried making clothing for Digimon to disguise themselves. I decided to keep some here in case our Digimon friends came. Some of these were made for Digimon like WereGarurumon or Leomon. Some of these may fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like our school uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Sora and I thought the foreign exchange student scenario could work. Try it on.\" Tai picked up the pants first. He put his tree trunk legs in the tight pants. They ripped on the knees but there still wearable. The put on the long white button shirt but his massive pecs made it so he couldn't button the top of the shirt. The green jacket was surprisingly able to fit his wide torso. Lastly he put what he could in the shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it look?\" Tai stood up to show off his outfit. He had to kneel and slouch to fit in the room and show Izzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks great.\" On one hand, Izzy thought he did look great. Tai's muscles stretched the clothes making it look like a taller Leomon with larger muscles was wearing it. On the other hand, he was too big. He barely fit in Izzy's room and the clothes did look too small. Izzy didn't want to admit that. \"What are you doing Tai?\" Tai was adjusting himself. Izzy then realized what Tai was trying to do!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tai gaped up at his younger friend, the purple haired teen dressed head to toe in his soccer gear (except for his shoes of course which he took off at the front door), a soccer ball under his arm and a bag over his shoulder. He dropped the bag, shaking the floor violently, nearly sending Tai onto his ass, before looking around, a confused expression on his face. \"Tai? Are you in here? You shouldn't have your door unlocked if no one is home!\" He shouted, his voice booming to the ears of the tiny Tai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai covered his ears, wincing as he looked up at Davis. \"I better get his attention before he steps on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started making his way over to Davis' towering figure before the boy took a step forward, tossing the soccer ball into the air, bouncing it off against his forehead, keeping it in the air, slowly moving forward as he did so. Tai stopped running as he saw Davis walking forward, looking up. He quickly changed direction, running to the side, trying to get out of the way of Davis' enormous soccer clad feet. Each step sent a tremor through the floor, making it extremely difficult for Tai's tiny form to run. Davis kept making his way forward until he reached Tai's bed, slamming his knees into them, sending him sprawling out on top of the covers, his shirt riding up slightly, showing a thin layer of his tanned skin. He quickly scrambled up into a sitting position, the soccer ball coming down to conk him right on the head! He groaned, rubbing the spot as he threw the soccer ball into a corner of the room, looking around. He noticed Tai's uniform scattered around on the floor and looked left and right before he picked up the button down shirt, running his hand over the material. \"Still warm...\" He said quietly to himself, though Tai could still easily hear him. The older teen watched as Davis hugged the shirt to his body, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...is Davis doing?\" He thought, slowly making his way towards the bed. He watched in shock as Davis then began to SNIFF the shirt, smiling and blushing as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe....totally still smells like him.\" Davis said to himself, sighing happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai felt slightly embarrassed watching this. It was like intruding on a private moment! \"Wait...Davis doesn't...\" Tai thought to himself, still watching Davis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if he'd notice his shirt missing?\" Davis thought out loud, folding it up and sticking it in his bag. \"Nah, no way he'd notice one missing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai had barely managed to avoid Davis again as the young titan ran over to his bag. With how energetic Davis was acting it was almost impossible to get to him! Not to mention he was still grappling with the odd behavior he was seeing from his younger friend. Davis looked out the door of the bedroom before closing it. \"Good thing Kari's not here.\" He said. \"It gets tiring pretending to like her all the time just to get over here. Good thing Tai agreed to help me practice! Now I don't need any excuse to come over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled again, looking around the room. \"I wonder when he'll get back?\" He said, his fingers trailing over the keyboard. He sat back down on the bed, pulling his socks off, tossing them aside. One landed right on top of Tai, smothering him in the strong scent of Davis' foot. It wasn't a bad smell, just powerful. He fumbled with the sock, managing to get out from under it just in time to see Davis cuddle up with his pillow, his back to Tai. His shirt was riding up slightly in the back though Davis didn't seem to notice or care. Soon Davis' loud snores were filling the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...at least he's not moving anymore.\" Tai thought to himself. He pushed aside Davis' strange behavior for now, not having the time or energy to deal with whatever it might mean right now, and put his all towards running to the bed. Now that Davis' booming foot steps weren't constantly causing the ground to quake, Tai was able to get there fairly quickly. He grabbed onto the low hanging sheet and began to climb, hand over fist, putting his athletic body to good use. It took about ten minutes to reach the top, his body covered in a thin sheen of sweat. He flopped forward, catching his breath, the sounds of Davis' snores even louder up here. Tai looked up at the wall before him that was Davis' back, thinking about the best way to scale it. He could try to climb up Davis' shirt, getting over him that way and reaching his face or he could try to run the length of Davis' body and reach the back of his head, climbing up his collar and neck to reach his ear, or run the opposite direction and get around Davis' bare feet. He was currently right at Davis' waistline so it was about the same distance in any direction. He looked up at the expanse of Davis' back and sighed. \"No more climbing for now...\" He thought, looking left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way should he go?</span></div></div>",

He decided to put it at the back of his head to focus at the current matter. Finally reaching his chest, he attempted to wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai then screamed at the younger boy. \"Hey! Davis! It's Tai! Wake up!\" But to no avail as Davis' snoring was too loud. Davis then started to roll over in his sleep. Tai was in panic \"Davis, stop! Your going to crush me!\" Tai's computer reacted to his cry for help and shot a a light at his Digivice, and then bounced to Davis'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter blacking out from panic, Tai found his body trapped under Davis' chest while his head was right under Davis' neck. \"Just great\" Tai thought annoyed. \"First a DigiEgg appears on my computer, then I shrink, and now I'm being crushed my one of my friends! I'm just glad no one else if home.\"<br>\r\n\"Tai...\" Tai heard Davis call his name, but before he could respond he realized Davis was still asleep. \"Tai, your pretty strong huh?\" Davis seemed to be dreaming about Tai, and enjoying it quite well. Tai feeling embarrassed as what what happened earlier could be related in his dream. Tai hadn't notice, but both Digivices started to glow. He then felt warm and calm. He enjoined this feeling, and Davis did too judging by face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Tai was wondering why Davis was moving so much, but he then realized that Davis wasn't moving, he was growing! Tai was shocked by this. He just stared of what he could currently see of Davis get smaller. As Tai got bigger Davis was starting to wake up. Realizing that he was about back to normal size Tai quickly moved Davis off of him and ran to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the door to the bathroom Davis gave out a yawn. <br>\r\n\"Yawn. Man I slept great\" He said not remembering he fell asleep in Tai's bed and not his own.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Davis. Is that you?\" Tai called. Oh snap, was the first thing that came to mind before responded to Tai<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah. It's me, are ready for practice?\" Davis was nervous that Tai may have seen him take his shirt earlier.<br>\r\n\"Nah, I've got homework I need to at least get started today or I won't have enough time to finish it.\" He lied.<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay Tai. Maybe tomorrow. Bye.\" Davis then grabbed his bag and left Tai's apartment. Tai was about to come out to get dressed until he looked into the mirror. He couldn't believe it. He was more or less back to his normal height, but his muscle seemed more toned.<br>\r\n\"I didn't have visible abs before, right?\" he asked himself. He quickly remembered the DigiEgg and rushed to the computer. It was gone. His phone rang. It was Izzy.<br>\r\n\"Hey Tai, I just got my laptop back from the shop. I'll be right over.\"<br>\r\n\"No, you don't need to do that. I don't see the Egg on the computer anymore. I think I was wrong.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay. If it <i>was</i> a DigiEgg, perhaps it went back to the digital World.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, see you later.\"<br>\r\n\"Bye.\" After hanging up, Tai proceeded to get dressed . Although it didn't occur to him, after putting on his shirt, it felt snug. He then felt tired.<br>\r\n\"It still only around 3:30, and it's Friday. Why not.\" He then took a nap. What Tai and Davis didn't know was that the Egg that was on the computer hatched, and was now in their Digivices. Meanwhile in the Digital World...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\"<br>\r\n\"What are you going on about boy?\"<br>\r\n\"Well \"girl\", you know that special data for our master? It's missing!\"<br>\r\n\"What! Calm down. The data that was to help him grow stronger?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It was hear yesterday!\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, look. The data needs three things to work. One: two digital devices to hold the data. Two: Two people to release the data. And three: a bond between the two to activate it. They would also need to figure out who is the superior. One helps release the data into the superior to make the superior physically stronger, which can only happen within any physical contact and only if both devices are within close proximity to each other, and their owners.  I doubt anyone else can make it work. Besides, it can't work on girls.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but the data is still experimental! What if <b>both</b> guys get stronger? Or multiple guys! Oh, the master won't be pleased with up if we can't recover it before he finishes his slumber. Ow!\"<br>\r\n\"Stop panicking! Even if that could happen, the releaser couldn't grow until the bond was much greater, same applies to any additional boys if the data get's into their devices if they have one, and non of them can grow larger than the original superior.\"<br>\r\n\"K, k. What would happen if it <b>did</b> activate?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, first the superior would shrink, then the releaser would make him grow back to about his original height, as well as slight physical change. Then the physical change would get more noticeable with height slowly increasing. Then again there are a few factors to consider like, how strong is their bond, or how long they've been in physical contact.\"<br>\r\n\"Well what ever happens, we <b>need</b> to get it back before he wakes up.\"<br>\r\n\"Agreed. We will head out immediately. I may have something at can help us find it quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is is this boy and girl duo, and who is their master and why does he need the data that ended up in Tai and Davis' Digivises? What will happen next? Will we have Tai and Davis' next encounter over the weekend? Or will Izzy find a trace of what happened to Tai and Davis?</span></div></div>",

He was a kid who was now all alone, he and Patamon were separated two days ago and now T.K. was alone in a cave, the exit blocked by rocks, with a hurting stomach from eating a bad fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, the pain stopped and was replaced by an amazing tingling feeling all over his body. He groaned in pleasure as his muscles expanded, ripping through his clothes and leaving him nude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPecs like his head, a diamond hard ten-pack, biceps that he could break stone on, a wide back, legs like corded steel, the whole kit... except for his dick, which stayed the same... until muscles started growing on and in it, enlarging it. Where before, there was a 3 inch peepee that fit his size there was now a 3 foot long behemoth of muscle and blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he grew, a single thought ran through his head: \"How strong am I now?\", so the second it stopped, he grabbed a rock from the entrance to the cave and placed it on another rock so it was about pelvic height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought an arm back, ready to strike... when a different thought hit him. He positioned himself, feet apart, massive nuts swinging in the air, flexed his dick up and, with a primal roar, brought it down on the rock, shattering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there, a little kid with more muscle in his dick than a professional bodybuilder had in his whole body, he was struck by a new and powerful instinct...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.N.: Both options grow him into a giant and increase every muscle, including his dick, but option 2 also makes him hornier and hornier until he gives in and goes into a sex frenzy (and at that point the only thing he can fuck would be a mountain) </span></div></div>",

The moment he touched the heated flesh, he was hooked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands flying over his length, he grunted and groaned as the pleasure overwhelmed him and he fell into the void. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow unable to stop, his cock's every twitch drove him further, his need to cum getting worse and yet, he couldn't reach release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed a rock the size of his head from the entrance and drove his dick through it, some primal urge insisting that, if he could just bury his monster into something he could consider suitable, he could find release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock splintered in his hands. Desperation driving him, he grabbed rock after rock (unknowingly growing taller and more muscular by the second) until only one massive boulder remained. He grabbed it and thrusted, burying his penis in it. Cracks developed but T.K., at this point three times as big as he was in the beginning, didn't care, thrusting away at an insane pace until this rock broke as well, leaving him blue balled and free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing the new space it had, the growth started up again, but this time it was serious. The muscled shota was now multiple stories tall, and could hug a mountain with no trouble. His dick more than kept up and was now 80 feet long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe admired himself for a few brief seconds, before his boiling balls went back into action forcing him to look for something to fuck. The mountain he saw was perfect and he made a run for it. His penis was so hard it couldn't even sway at this point and he was so horny, his pheromones were almost visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe arrived at the mountain and climbed on, his dick probing for holes or caves he could fuck. At last he found one and drove himself in to the hilt. The ground shook as he pounded away, the feeling he got from being this powerful shrunk his world down to his ocean containing testicles which swelled larger as he pounded away, he himself also growing, only one thought swirled in his brain: \"Surely, a mountain is enough, surely I can cum now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he right? </span></div></div>",

His balls seemingly developed a life of their own as they flexed periodically, every flex ramping up the production of sperm while at the same time releasing more hormones into his body, causing him to get even hornier and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... it happened. A gargantuan flex from his balls. There was no warning, one second his balls were tensing up and he thought he was finally free, the next a massive surge of growth led to him crushing the mountaintop in his grip as his dick exploded out of the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.K. despaired. That was the biggest thing in the area and he still couldn't find relief from his rapidly expanding genitals. At that point, the moment his diamond dick reached 100 feet and his balls flexed again, something snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped to the ground and drove his massive monster into the ground, causing the planet to shudder. He felt good. Really good. Lava flowed around his penis as he fucked the planet itself, at his size it felt amazing and he quickened the pace of both his fucking and his growth until he got so big and horny that his balls almost had their own gravity and his dick... all of a sudden he felt something amazingly hot at the tip of his cock. He reached the center of the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had no hope. Even if he didn't want to cum yet, if he wanted to edge a bit more, it didn't really matter. His balls drew up, his penis got thicker than ever and he exploded. For him, it was a whiteout of pleasure as he finally got to release everything he had. For the rest of the world, however... it got cold. So, so cold. Everything died in seconds, if not from the cold of a coreless planet, then from the cum that erupted from every volcano in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough. Not even that could relieve enough pressure from the cum build-up. And as death's harbringer splooged, the planet fell to pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA.N.: If you want to leave it at that, pick option 1, if not, pick option 2.</span></div></div>",

Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix Wright sighed as he looked up from his desk. Stacks of paper were piled up on his desk while several loose sheets were spread out in front of him. It was getting late, a lamp the only source of light in the small office at the Wright and Co. Law Offices. He had been working all day on his current case and had specifically sent Maya and Pearl out to a movie in the hopes they would be gone long enough for him to make some headway in the peace and quiet. He set his pen down and leaned back in his chair, rubbing his eyes tiredly. \"I'm in here Maya!\" He shouted after hearing what sounded suspiciously like a vase shattering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud thumping noise as Maya charged up to the office door, throwing it open and rushing into the room. \"There you are Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where else would I be?\" Phoenix asked, looking at her with a bemused expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know.\" Maya said, taking the question to heart. \"I guess you could have been out working on the case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he was getting something to eat!\" Pearl piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I didn't see you there Pearl.\" Phoenix said, sitting up straighter, the small girl hidden behind a stack of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's so mean!\" She said, frowning, her little fists held up. \"How could you forget me Mister Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Pearl I've just...been really busy today.\" He said tiredly, smiling down at her. \"Anyway, why were you shouting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right!\" Maya said, her pensive expression changing to one of joy. \"Pearly and I got a package in the mail!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Phoenix said, looking genuinely interested for a moment. \"Who sent it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something from Kurain Village!\" Maya said, lifting a package up and dropping it onto the top of Phoenix's desk, scattering papers everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix's eye twitched as he watched the papers fly about. \"U-Uh...Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it exciting?!\" Maya said, practically jumping up and down with excitement. \"I wonder what it is! I bet it's a Steel Samurai DVD! The newest one just came out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, I seriously doubt the village would be sending you a Steel Samurai DVD.\" Phoenix said. \"Wait a minute...was there even a video store in the Village?\" Phoenix thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a party pooper Nick!\" Maya said, frowning slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open it! Open it!\" Pearl said, tugging on Maya's robe. \"Prove Mister Nick wrong Master Maya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Here I go!\" Maya said, ripping the paper off the box. Scraps of brown paper flew around them like a brown snow storm. Phoenix sat back and just watched, curious in spit of himself. Soon, a plain white box was sitting on Phoenix's desk. Without stopping for even a moment, Maya opened the box and peered inside. \"Hmm...Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Phoenix asked, standing up, looking into the box. There didn't seem to be anything inside at first glance. However, after a quick scan, Phoenix noticed a small, purple tear drop shaped stone shoved off in the corner. \"Wait...Isn't that a megatama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\" Maya said, picking it up and holding it up to the light. \"Oh, but wait...\" She studied in silence for a few minutes, turning it over in her hand. \"These markings...I've never seen anything like it before!\" She handed it over to Pearl and said, \"What about you Pearly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small girl held it up to the light like Maya did, closing one eye and tilting her head as she looked. \"I feel like I've seen something like this before...My mother showed me pictures once. It was in a book that showed a bunch of different megatama and how they react to spiritual energy. See this symbol right here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a swirl pattern and continued, \"This means infinity! The processes in the megatama are never ending in other words. This symbol, the one that looks like a rock, is for strength. And this arrow pointing up means increasing. So strength increasing forever!\" She looked proud as she explained all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what does it mean?\" Phoenix asked, a little confused by the spiritual explanations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a charm.\" Pearl said with a smile. \"The village sells them to tourists in order to make extra money on the side. This one is supposed to help you keep strength in trying times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why someone would send ME this?\" Maya said, taking it back and frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you don't...you know...work or anything.\" Phoenix said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Maya shouted, looking outraged. \"That's...well I guess it's true...\" She puffed out her cheeks as she had to admit this. \"Well, how about you take it then Nick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled a string out of her pocket and tied it through the megatama. \"Here! May you have all the strength you need to help you during your cases!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh..thanks!\" He said, hanging the megatama around his neck. It almost felt...warm against his skin. \"Probably because everyone's been holding it.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Fun's over!\" Maya said authoritatively. \"Now it's time for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Pearl said, throwing her arms up into the air happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nick! You've been working all day! Treat us to some food! It'll make you feel better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is emptying my wallet supposed to make ME feel better?\" Phoenix said with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be so stingy!\" Maya said, moving towards the door with Pearl. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix got to his feet and grabbed his suit jacket, pulling it on and buttoning it. He WAS getting hungry after all. He had a big day ahead of him in court tomorrow. Spending some time off would do him good. The megatama felt a little warmer, a faint glow that no one could see emanating from it.</span></div></div>",

There was plenty of other places to choose from, but Phoenix always tried forcing Maya to come here instead. They were much cheaper on their prices, and the quality... Well, it was satisfying to say the least. Phoenix would never force Maya to eat anything inedible, but damn it if he could get a good price and good quality he was going to take it! Especially considering how often Maya insisted on eating out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they arrived, Maya and Pearl went straight to a booth! Phoenix couldn't help but notice it wasn't too far away from the door to the play area they had. Phoenix just sighed a little on the inside, knowing that the two of them were going to insist on going inside to play once they were done eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magtama in Phoenix's pocket glowed faintly! His shoulders pushed out a little more, his biceps welled up a tiny bit, his pecs became more defined, and his abs tightened as well! In fact, not just his torso, but his entire body grew just a little bit as he felt frustration!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like forever and a half to Maya, who was laying with her head on the table, her stomach grumbling noisily. \"I can't even remember a time I was this hungry...\" She mumbled to herself. Just then, Phoenix arrived with the tray of food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya, you really shouldn't put your face on these tables. You don't know what kind of bacteria are on them.\" Phoenix told Maya. Maya immediately stood up, not because of the germs, but because the food had finally arrived! Maya immediately took one of the bugers and unwrapped it! Pearl, on the other hand, actually waited for Phoenix to set the tray down on the table. Finally, once everyone had gotten their meals, Phoenix took his own and started to dig in himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the three of them to finish. Phoenix was the last one to finish. Maya had practically inhaled her food, and once Pearl was done, she soon followed Maya who seemed insistent on entering the play area despite the height restrictions. Phoenix merely waited at the table, thinking over all the evidence they had found so far. It was another day in the courtroom again tomorrow. Just another murder case, and Phoenix was sure that he had this one pinned! It was going to be a clean sweep, especially since he was going up against Payne again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours later, Phoenix was tapping his fingers on the table! He soon stood up, and turned to go into the play area! Maya and Pearl were taking way too long, and Phoenix had to get home to go to sleep for tomorrow! The moment he entered the room, there was a raise in temperature. Everything felt a little bit warmer, and Phoenix could smell the subtle stink of the children's body odor. It wasn't enought to knock a guy out, but it would probably make Phoenix feel a little sick after a while...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya! Pearly! Let's go!\" Phoenix shouted. Just then, he saw Maya up in the tubes, waving at him from one of the windows! He motioned for Maya to come here, and she nodded! Maya then disappeared back into the tubes, leaving Phoenix to wait down at the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes, Phoenix was still waiting. He was quickly growing impatient, nearly fed up with waiting!</span></div></div>",

Gumshoe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDick Gumshoe. A detective at the local homicide precinct in Los Angeles, and a man known for being strong, yet childish. He wasn't quite the brightest bulb in the box, but his great kindness and loyalty made up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and his current boss, Miles Edgeworth, had just investigated a crime scene. The two of them had returned to Police Headquarters to go over the facts of the case so far, as well as submitting and validating evidence. Ever since Phoenix had been ejected from his career, Miles had taken the courtroom by storm. There had been talk recently of one young upstart, however, by the name of Apollo, said to be the protege of Phoenix.. That young man would be facing Edgeworth tomorrow in the courtroom, and Edgeworth had no plans to take it easy, setting many different traps for the boy already!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gumshoe! Pay attention!\" Edgeworth demanded, slamming his fist onto the table. Gumshoe snapped to, looking at Edgeworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, pal? I-I mean sir!\" He said, standing up straighter than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth sighed, before saying, \"You haven't been paying attention to me at all, have you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Maybe?\" Gumshoe replied, chuckling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\" Edgeworth just glared into Gumshoe's eyes, getting nothing but a blank, yet cheerful look back. \"... As I was saying, I can trust you with this evidence, correct?\" He asked, gesturing towards the plastic bag on the table that had a ring inside of it. \"It is of the utmost importance for tomorrow's case. We've already had it's substances tested and its fingerprints dusted. You are to keep it locked up here until tomorrow at 9AM when you will meet me in the courtroom lobby. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it pal Uh, sir!\" Gumshoe said, saluting Edgeworth as he puffed out his chest proudly. \"I won't let it out of my sight! I'll sleep here at the office just to make sure it stays safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not necessary, but I don't care what you do.\" Edgeworth replied, folding his arms over his chest. He didn't mean any rudeness by it, it was just the truth, plain and simple. Gumshoe still had the same, silly smile on his face. \"Don't expect any extra pay for this.\" Edgeworth made sure to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah...\" Gumshoe replied, rubbing the back of his head as he did. \"I gotcha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Good night.\" Edgeworth then took his leave, making his way to the door. His shoes made a distinctive click with every step. Gumshoe listened to them until they faded with a second door shutting; Edgeworth had left the building!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I'm gonna guard this thing!\" Gumshoe said, doing a little shadow boxing to psych himself up! \"No way no how is this ring gonna get taken away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe had started by taking a seat at the table, and looking at the bag with the ring in it. After a moment, he decided it might be safer if he put it in his desk. He got up and began to carry out his plan, until he realized that just about anyone could get in his desk! And he couldn't just leave it here, someone could easily break in and get the ring!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what's so special about this ring...?\" Gumshoe thought to himself. They had found it at the scene of the crime, near an opened safe that was in the CEO's office of a local building. The strangest thing was that the safe had been pried open. There were no burn marks, so no it probably wasn't explosives, there were no tools at the scene either. That didn't mean one wasn't used, just that there wasn't one there. The strangest of all was the door of the safe. The metal was mangled and warped, as if it was pulled back. The idea of someone just pulling a safe door open, however, was ridiculous! Gumshoe chuckled to himself at the very idea! After all, the man that they had in holding, Slim Pickitt, was way too thin to have done it! There must have been some special tool, or maybe it was a trick! Thinking that it could be a trick was a stroke of genius for someone like Gumshoe. There's also the possibility of an accomplice, security cameras had caught a glimpse of a gigantic man, even bigger and way stronger than Gumshoe, making his way through the halls of the building! As soon as the CEO's room was broken into, an alarm sounded! A loud noise had some from the room, like a door being slammed, was heard (according to a security officer that was patrolling the halls). The security officer rushed to the scene, and had little issues in apprehending Slim, and for the most part, that was that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, it IS pretty shiny! I don't think I've ever seen a ring this nice!\" Gumshoe said to himself. He held the baggie up, shaking it slightly and enjoying how it sparkled in the florescent lights of the office. \"... I wonder if it'd fit me...?\" Gumshoe thought. He popped the bag open. \"N-No way! I shouldn't!\" He said, turning his head away. \"But... Then again, we already did all the analysis on it... It couldn't hurt if I slipped it on, right...? Just for a second!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling edgy, Gumshoe slipped the ring out of the bag and into his palm. He smiled as he held it up to the light. From it's marvelous gold band to it large, shining ruby. Putting it between two fingers, he slipped it onto his right pointer finger...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The second that the cool gold band was in place on his finger, Gumshoe felt a strange jolt of energy course through his body! He gulped slightly, feeling a strange pulsing energy radiating out from the ring, through his arm, across his chest, and down past his belly, all the way to the tips of his toes and the top of his head! It was a feeling unlike anything he had ever felt before, his body pulsing again, harder, before he suddenly began to grow! His biceps bulged, throbbing with energy, pushing up against his sleeves as his forearms thickened, giving his already big hands the kind of gripping power necessary to bend a metal pipe into a pretzel, his shoulders broadening at the same time, the seams on his shirt tearing open while the seams on his jacket merely bulged, holding for now! With a grunt, Gumshoe leaned forward slightly, his back broadening, his shirt coming untucked at the same time, rising up slightly as his already tall frame surged up taller, his traps rising up around his thickening neck, his tie feeling like it was strangling him! With a quick movement, Gumshoe tore the flimsy material from around his neck, tossing it aside, his back arching slightly as his pecs suddenly exploded out of his shirt, a shower of buttons flying away from his hairy chest! \"W-What the...?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe's body didn't stop, the confused detective watching helplessly as his legs suddenly lengthened again, sending him higher towards the ceiling, the spiky bangs of his hair scraping against the pocked plastic of the covering of the fluorescent lights! His shirt had fully popped open now, revealing thick, heavy pecs hanging down shelf like over a thick cut six pack, the abs resting on top of a slight gut. Gumshoe winced as he felt his belt digging into his waist, his thick fingers too clumsy to undo it! With a frustrated tug, he tore the leather strap easily out of the belt loops, his pants held in place by the sheer thickness of his body, the zipper and button suddenly struggling to hold back Gumshoe's impressive bulge!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of tearing erupted all around him as his jacket finally gave out, his biceps surging up through the sleeves, his shoulders bursting through shortly after! The ragged remains of his shirt hung gamely around his massive shoulders in tatters, his calves swelling to the point of popping the seams on his pants, his thighs following suit, the tree trunk like muscles practically rubbing against each other! A loud series of pops soon rang out, each one of Gumshoe's thick toes popping out the front of his leather shoes, the tops splitting open shortly after, the cheap material laying mangled on the floor, revealing Gumshoe's big, wide feet, the ground shaking slightly as he shifted his balance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enormous detective grunted again as he felt the zipper on his pants pop, the button following suit, revealing his white boxers with the red polka dots, the material looking as though it were painted on his body, barely containing the thick python that was coiled within, threatening to burst out through the front of the boxers, a heavy pair of balls situated underneath the cock. His ass made short work of the seat of his pants, splitting it right down the middle, leaving Gumshoe, for all intents and purposes, completely naked! With one last surge, his head cracked into the ceiling, splitting the plastic in half and smashing into the light, obliterating it, leaving him in a spot of darkness. \"OUCH!\" He shouted, his voice deep and rumbling, erupting out of his barrel like chest with a powerful gusto!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGumshoe slowly looked himself over, shocked. His body was now over nine feet tall, his muscles all looking incredibly bulky and heavy, like a bodybuilder in his off season, packing on serious size! He flexed his arm experimentally, his eyes widening as the muscle looked bigger around than a melon! \"I-I'm huge!\" He said to himself, astonished, his hands rubbing his hairy pecs. Suddenly, all the clues made sense! The seeming impossibility of such a small man able to tear open a safe, the lack of any visible form of entry, the huge figure on the video cameras, everything! Somehow, this ring had the ability to greatly increase a man's size and strength! Experimentally, Gumshoe touched the ring, slowly trying to get it off. Unfortunately for him, he couldn't do it! It appeared to be stuck! In fact, trying to force it off hurt his finger in four distinct places, like something on the ring had stuck into Gumshoe's skin, holding it in place! \"Guess I'm just going to have to deal with this for now...\" Gumshoe sighed, rubbing the back of his head. \"Hopefully Mr. Edgeworth isn't TOO mad at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down in his chair, his massive ass shattering it as soon as his weight was on it, his body tumbling backwards into his desk, cleaving it messily in half, his pillar like legs flailing and going through a wall! So much destruction, and with so little effort! \"I-I've got to be more careful...\" Gumshoe mumbled to himself, sitting back up with a groan. \"I can't stay here...I'll just cause more trouble! But I AM supposed to be guarding the ring...then again, it's stuck to my finger so I can just take it with me...yeah, no big deal!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got to his feet and slowly began to weave through the desks, making his way out of the police station.</span></div></div>",

It was a long day, and he had just finished a huge meal and what better way to relax than sleeping it off! Not too far from him was Housei whose mouth was wide open as he slept soundly. He too, was tired from training. Firing a bow all the time made one of his arms pretty toned, so he had to take extra care to make sure his other arms kept up! Otherwise he'd just look like some disproportionate freak! And of course, he couldn't just work his arms, he had to work his thighs, his calves, his chest, and hey! While he was at it, why not work on his abs and get a nice six-pack?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all this just made Housei bulk up real nice. What was once only a slight muscular young man was now a muscular, buff hunk! He took every opportunity to show it off, especially if it was to embarass Taitou with a few cocky flexes or impress Laila by bench pressing a log! Taitou didn't seem to mind at first, but he started to feel pushed aside since Houosei had become so much more than an archer! He knew a little martial arts, and he was only getting better with every passing day. He was quickly becoming the team powerhouse! Taitou was doing his best to keep up, but Housei had already got much further than him and always seemed to be a step ahead!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever it was a lead he wouldn't be keeping for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that same night, the only one awake was Ryuko, he was gazing up at the sky. He had been kindling the fire, and keeping a watch over everyone in case highwaymen or wild animals came along. Though these matters were on his mind, he gulped a little as he looked up at the sky. He knew what tonight was; It was the night the planets would align. Though it only happened once every few hundred years, there was no telling what kind effect it would have on people with such a deep relation to the cosmic powers. The one Ryuko worried about most was Taitou. Out of all three of them, he had the strongest relation to the cosmos, and thus, would be the most greatly effected!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night pressed on, Ryuko was finding himself pressingly tired. Once midnight rolled around, and the fire began to reduce to embers, he found himself tired beyond compare. He settled onto his bedding, and covered with one of the blankets they had recently bought from the nearby city of Hiun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot too long after, a sleepy Taitou had rose out of bed and started to wander sleepily into the forest. Nature was calling, and his body knew to answer the call! As he began to head out, the planets had fallen into perfect alignment, and changes began to take place...</span></div></div>",

From below, it looked like it was on fire! It was letting out some strange rays down at the planet, effecting a select few people on it! Taitou, however, didn't feel anything, and just carried on. By the time he got back to camp, he was still half asleep, and didn't really seem to notice or care what was going on right before his very eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened until the next morning, when Taitou could hear commotion all around him! It made him clench his teeth in displeasure, before he suddenly sprung up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Housei, would you shut up!?\" Taitou shouted, rubbing his eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? ME?\" Housei said nosily. Taitou could feel the ground shake a little, before he was suddenly covered in shadow! As Taitou opened his eyes, all he could see were a pair of shins! He started looking upwards slowly, his mouth dropping open as he saw just how gigantic Housei had become! Gasps of shock escaped his lips as he looked all the way up Housei's tanned body, his rippling abs and pumped pecs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Holy crap!? What happened to you!?\" Taitou shouted, jumping back a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? I dunno.\" Housei said, lifting one his his arms and flexing it. Housei started to pump up his biceps by flexing them, over and over, forcing the muscle up bigger and bigger before he looked down at Taitou with a grin. \"I've been getting bigger all the time! Just look at these pecs!\" Housei started by bouncing them, one after the other. Every flex kept Taitou staring at him, unable to look away as he held nothing but pure jealousy! \"Hey! You wanna compare muscles again!?\" Housei said excitedly! He got down close, forcing Taitou to hold up his arm as he held his own flexed one right next to it! \"Hah! That thing is so puny! Can you even throw a punch!?\" Housei moved up, holding his pecs up at Taitou, practically in his face! \"Go ahead! Hit me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaitou grit his teeth, looking up at Housei and his smug little grin. Pulling back his fist, he slammed his fist square into Housei's chest! It was hard! Like hitting a rock! It didn't hurt Taitou too badly, but Housei, on the other hand, didn't even feel a thing! Housei just let out a triumphant laugh as he barely even felt Taitou's hand register upon his pecs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah! Thought so.\" Housei said, standing back up to his full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Housei, stop teasing Taitou.\" Ryuko ordered, sitting near the embers of the fire. As Taitou glanced over, his jaw dropped again as he looked at his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ryuko!? You too!?\" Taitou shouted. At Ryuko stood there tall, his body was pumped to perfection! His pecs large and swollen, his biceps large and burly... He looked to be about half the size of Housei, which was still pretty massive! \"How in the hell did YOU get bigger than me!?\" Taitou shouted, less than pleased with this turnout! Ryuko opened his mouth to begin explaining...</span></div></div>",

His friends had all wanted him to become a professional swimmer, even going to Australia with Rin to find motivation, which he had found upon seeing the professionalswimmers there. Yet he felt like part of him was doing it out of obligation of what everyone else wanted rather than his own wishes. He had only ever sought to swim free, yet his attachment to his friends were in their own way holding him down, something he didn't wish due to the half-heartedness of trying to be what others want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>''I just want to swim, embrace the water, and enjoy it with my friends.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cold November, the members of Iwatobi Swim Club unable to swim due to no indoor pool. Team Captain Makoto and his best friend Haruka were heading towards the mall dressed in thick winter clothes. The two were travelling there at Haru's request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised you went there with no one else Haru.\" Makoto cheerfully said as he put his gloved hands in his coat, hoping to keep them warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw a magazine my dad left out that said the mall was getting larger fishtanks. I was hoping one was big enough to swim in\" Haru mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That explains it. </i>Makoto thought as he gave Haruka a smile.  He'd heard Haru's parents had set it up so the bath wouldn't even unlock unless they were there due to him catching a cold a week ago from staying in the cold water too long. ''Makes me wonder what he wants to show me.'' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was Haru was keeping it to himself, letting out not a peep more as they walked there. Makoto could tell Haru was thinking about it due to the gleam in his eyes. He wouldn't have to wonder for long as the two arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's this way\" Haru mentions as he guides Makoto to a small shop that recently opened. Makoto noticed all sorts of bizarre antiques that look like they came from around the world. Though some he doubted the validity of the item such as one labeled a magic lamp and a wooden cup call the holy grail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru ignored Makoto looking around the shop and started talking to the clerk, showing a receipt. \"I'm here to pick up the statue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll bring it to the front.\" the worker said as he went to the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm wondering what it is you brought me for.\" Makoto asked puzzled about what seems to have enthralled Haru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To help me carry this to your house.\" Haru replied quietly. \"It's your birthday gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haru!\" Makoto said with both joy and surprise. He didn't expect a gift so soon since it's four days until his birthday. Makoto hadn't realized till then that Haruka hadn't complained about being called Haru at all, ikely as a early birthday gift. Both heard grunting as the clerk pushed a very large statue through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the statue of an monstrous Orca with front arm like legs and feet made of unknown materials, maybe some dark colored stones or marble painted black.  Intricate green lines that glowed in spots, though Makoto realized the lights ere actually moving across the lines. Two waves are carved at the bottom, swallowing both the lower legs and tail. Makoto didn't know why but he felt a pleasant aura come from it. Like an enthralling desire to touch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking out of his trance, Makoto turned to Haru who also seemed to be enjoying its presence. \"Haru what is this a statue of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaru stopped looking at the statue to mumble \"No idea. I just saw it as I walked by and bought it. It was too heavy on my own though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My boss said it's a statue of the god of the abyss, some ancient deity of the sea that ruled all waters and protected them with a gentle hand. Legends say the god was beaten by a godslayer so he bestowed his power to it so that one day it would bless his power on a worthy mortal.\" The clerk explained to the clueless teens. \"He makes sure I know this info to tell customers.\" Clerk apparently didn't care for such things, explaining his reasons why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the info.\" Makoto bowed while Haru looked indifferent before gazing back on the statue. The clerk left them alone and returned to his work. \"A god of the sea. I guess it does give off such a feel since you're so into it. Though if you plan on having us carry this to my house it would have been better to ask my dad to drive us here and back.\" Musing as he touched Haru's shoulder. Knowing Haru probably didn't consider it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. I tried to move it by myself but I couldn't get it far so I figured you can help me since it'll be yours anyways.\" Haruka admitted before he moved to one side of the statue to grab the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He said all he wanted. Better help Haru before he hurts himself. </i>Makoto moved towards the statue , touching it with one arm. Suddenly an intense and powerful feeling rushed throguh Makoto. He didn't know what this feeling was beyond pure bliss. The intense feelings flowing through him lead Makoto to lift the statue with one hand until it pressed against the ceiling. Haru let go, surprised at Makoto's strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I need to train more\" Haru said aloud, thinking he underestimated Makoto's strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Makoto moaned as the feeling started to fade, leaving him speechless as he returned to normal and saw the statue lifted with ease in one hand. \"Yikes! I didn't expect it to be so easy.\" Makoto didn't know what that feeling had been, but since no one around him mentioned it he figured it was simply his imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I can carry this outside by myself Haru so don't worry about it\" smiling at Haru turned and blushed nodding as they both left the store and carried it to the Tachibana residence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two would soon learn of the power of the abyss that now resided in Makoto.</span></div></div>",
