The weight and warmth of her body on his, as well as the blue electric glow of interspace was firing everyone of his neurons. Work was stressful so this vacation was well anticipated. It was off to a Cracker Jack start too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir small interstellar craft wasn\u2019t as well outfitted as other larger vessels, but it was cozy. It was perfect for their trip. Both were pleased to hear they would be routed through the Erdian system on both the outgoing and return trips. These were fairly long layovers too, which was even better. The Erdian system is beautiful and Erde looks like Earth before the climate collapse and mechanization. The other layover options were either void spaces or shipyards, so neither had this potential for a view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sam was happy with a beautiful stop over, Rachel wanted a bit more. She wanted to pick up some \u201csouvenirs.\u201d She knew landing on Erde was discouraged, but no one really cared. Measuring a beautiful woman against Sam\u2019s cock or shoving a beefcake around with her fingertips were thoughts that drove her wild. Additionally, collecting cars or other small objects would add interesting talking points to their apartment. Also, they had talked of getting married and having kids. Perhaps a dry run with a tiny Erdian child would give them confidence to go the full way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs normal space returned, Rachel plopped back into her seat. An Earth battle cruiser radioed. \u201cVessel this is the Earth ship Yorktown, please keep your distance. We are assisting Erde in rescue activities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYorktown, my companion and I are trained medical staff, his there assistance we can render?\u201d Sam radioed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNegative vessel, we have the situation contained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at Sam clearly bummed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho are you?</span></div></div>",

I know he really wasn\u2019t in to this, but little things like this was what made me love him so much. He really has a givers love language. I hope he realized how much I love him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we have some options once the Yorktown leaves,\u201d Sam reported.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned over and wrapped myself around his arm and kissed his shoulder. \u201cWhat are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo here is a character themed park cluster in a swamp. Lots of parks and a zoo in close proximity, kinda like the old Disney World back home. Lots of people, but mostly dark rides and character meet and greets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen here is a classical amusement park with coasters, tilt-a-whirls, a kiddie world and a small water park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe next one is a county fair. Claptrap rides and tons of fried things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen for some spice, here is a beach, and finally:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could place down in this ice rink in the middle of one of the biggest cities on Erde. It might be fun to play as Godzilla for a bit. The locals would love Godzilla\u2019s ass too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was giggling as I fake punched his arm. He really had picked out some good spots. \u201cThis will be so hard to chose sweetie! I love them all, but I think we'll go with...\u201d</span></div></div>",

She knew this and closed his mouth by pushing up on her chin before giving him a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust put me behind those trees in the maintenance area,\u201d she said with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam winked back. He handed Rachel a bag with a towel and water bottle. \u201cHave fun!\u201d He pressed a few buttons on his console and she disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs desired, she appeared on the maintenance path behind the water park. Looking around the area was quiet. She needed to get the water park locked down so she could have her fun. She should have had Sam do it, but she was here now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting she made her way up the path. Next to a building, there was a picnic bench and a flower pot full of sand. Clearly this was a break area. A rotund man sat in half a tiger costume sucking hard on his cigarette. He didn\u2019t notice as Rachel\u2019s shapely fingers snaked up behind him and plucked him from the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screamed and squirmed In her grasp. He almost got free owning to how slimy with sweat he was. Turning him over, a small stream of water splashed on the ground below. \u201cYuck,\u201d Rachel remarked. She quickly shucked off the rest of the costume and dried him off on the edge of her towel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen this completed, he had seemed to regain some control over himself. \u201cPut me down human woman!\u201d Human to the Erde had become to mean the same as giant to humans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel just smiled at the tiny man and then kissed his plump face. He tasted of salt and smoke. \u201cNot quite yet, cute man. You are going to help me. If you do, I\u2019ll reward you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was taken aback as she giggled. She thought it was cute that he had grabbed onto her thumb so tightly. Such a strong man reduced to a scared little kitten. \u201cWhat could I do to help you? One squeeze and you\u2019ll turn me into paste. There is nothing I can do for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel giggled again. She pinched his arm. \u201cIt\u2019s quire true these puny muscles are worthless to me but....\u201d Her finger trailed down his T-shirt wearing chest and the nail hooked his briefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began to tug, he yelled, \u201cPlease don\u2019t expose me, I am devoted to my wife.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel couldn\u2019t help saying aww to this, \u201cIt\u2019s so adorable you are devoted to your wife. I hope Sam one day is as devoted as you are to turn down a sexy creature focusing on your cock to remain true. However, I need to learn what I am working with and your cock is the only one I see. So consider this rape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked her finger and the strips that were his underwear fluttered to the ground. \u201cWhoops,\u201d She coyly teased. Lifting him to her face. She was taken back by fat middle. Using her fingernail again, she dug out his cock. With her attention it began growing. She playfully batted it around until she could sense he was close to release. Then to respect his wishes, she flicked his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With his high pitched scream he quickly deflated, \u201cOuch! Why did you do that?\u201d Tears poured like rivers from his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you toy. You taught me our genitalia are similar. However, I didn\u2019t want you to finish to maintain your commitments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted, \u201cThank you....\u201d although he had wished she let him come. \u201cSo i did what you wanted put me down.\u201d He looked down longingly at her well pedicured feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne more thing tiny man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever it is, I\u2019ll do it. Please let me go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stroked his head, \u201cI need your brains now. Tell me how to lock the water park down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLock it down?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, so no one can enter or leave. There are so many fun toys to play with, I don\u2019t want them to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grunted, \u201cPut me down and I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel laughed, \u201cNice try. I\u2019ll do it, you\u2019ll tell me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh...ok...however, I\u2019m in entertainment not security. What I know may be wrong.\u201d Rachel nodded in understanding. \u201cYou see that little shack over there?\u201d Rachel again nodded. \u201cSmash it. If you do, all the gates will close and the alarms will be disabled. Should be a perfect playground then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel jumped up and down. \u201cThank you! For your reward, I\u2019m going to give you a free flight.\u201d She tightened her fist around him and pulled her arm back. The man shuddered in fear. Then he disappeared from view as Sam teleported him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDusting her hands off, she walked over to the shack. She raised her perfectly formed foot above the building and stomped on it. Such an explosion occurred that Rachel landed on her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, destroying this building...</span></div></div>",

There was some commotion but after a moment a call came over the intercom, \u201cEveryone in the water park, please return to your prior activities. The gates have entered a lockdown mode. We are investigating.\u201d Rachel giggled - fun time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park wasn\u2019t overly crowded since it was a weekday, but that meant she has more time to play. Her eye was attracted to a tubular slide just across the \u201chedge row.\u201d Hopping it, she quickly snatched up the two attendants. Both were female and wore red swimsuits. \u201cAww you are precious!\u201d She pressed on their bodies until she found their walkietalkies and smashed them between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne was a lanky brunette with long straight hair and very tanned skin. She contrasted her appearance with bright pink finger and toenails. Bringing her in for closure inspection, she smelled faintly of flowers and has beautiful hazel eyes. She smiled wide before kissing her full chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attention caused the girl to stop screaming. \u201cHi sweetie.\u201d Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuman please let me go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww, honey, don\u2019t you like me holding you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started sobbing, \u201cPlease! My government won\u2019t stop you from taking all of us. They know we are powerless against you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey know we\u2019ll love you. You are just Sam\u2019s type too.\u201d Rachel didn\u2019t hear anything more the doll said as she was placed into her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing her attention on the second girl, she met a different sight. She was in the process of stripping in her hand. The panting blond has a bush of curly blonde hair piled on her head, pale skin with striking blue and red lips. Her face was contorted into a look of lust. Rachel pinched the partially stripped suit from the girl and plucked it free. \u201cMake me your pet, goddess!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s finger traced out the curves on this curious creature. She was fuller than the brunette but not fat. It made her more comfortable to touch and hold. \u201cWhat is your name little one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour sex slave,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSsh...there will be time for that love. Please tell me your name or I will have to put you down.\u201d Rachel fluffed her curly hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Brittany...I have wanted to meet a human forever. Please take me. My life here has been horrible. I will do anything for you. Especially there...\u201d she straightened out her right leg and pointedly roughly to her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my dear Brittany, with a zeal like that, I can\u2019t turn you down.\u201d She kissed her cheek and lowered her to the elastic band of her panties. Before she could slip her in, Brittany leapt to the other hand and slipped into her vulva. Rachel let out a moan. As she stroke the zealous girl from outside her panties, she felt a thud against her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down she saw a little black boy folded over her pink pedicured toes. Her foot was in the trough to slow down after the slide. She giggled as she knelt down and picked up the tiny boy. \u201cA little impatient I see.\u201d He looked at her with fear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry child. I don\u2019t want to keep you. But I will help you have fun. Are you ok with me putting you in the tube?\u201d His face brightened and he nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up she saw two other children \u201ctrapped\u201d at the top of the tower. Scooping them up too, she played for about half an hour shoving them into the tube and then collecting them at the bottom to repeat the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was getting thirsty so she stopped. The thee kids danced around her foot banging on the nails begging for the process to continue. She gently booped each of them on the head and chuckled. \u201cSweeties, I had so much fun with you. Let me ask you a question, I have been thinking about having a kid. Do you think I\u2019d make a good mom?\u201d All the kids cheered. \u201cAlright sweeties, go find your parents. Your Auntie Rachel needs to find something to drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids ran a short distance and were tightly hugged by stunned parents who was a short distance from her. She kneeled down in front of the parents. \u201cThank you for letting me play with your young ones. They are great kids.\u201d She noticed that two of the moms were pregnant and the last Father was virile. \u201cMaybe you could help me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parents started to back up as a hand swung and snatched them up. \u201cI\u2019m really thirsty and I think you can help me.\u201d Plucking out a Hispanic mother, she bit through her swimsuit top with her teeth exposing massive breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is for my baby!\u201d She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWaa waa,\u201d The giant mimed as she shoved the mammaries into her mouth. A sweet, thick liquid issued from her breasts into the awaiting mouth. Rachel hummed in enjoyment. The woman\u2019s head was essentially in her nostril. So she shoved her fully in, to free up a hand to similarly disrobe the black boy\u2019s mother. Shoving her in the other nostril, she had double the flow. She hummed and rubbed the toy sized living milk bottles as they cried over their lost milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of painful sucking, both women were spent. Rachel was pleased with them, but wasn\u2019t full. As the women collapsed in her open palm, she licked them from belly button to forehead, lapping up all remaining milk. Their breasts were raw and sore. \u201cYou did well women. Excellent milk, I\u2019d drink from you anytime. In fact....\u201d She debated about taking them. They would be a nice treat on their vacation, or source of cream for their coffee, but she saw the children she played with below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe promised she wouldn\u2019t take the kids, so it wouldn\u2019t be fair to take their moms from them. She was certain there\u2019s other lactating women she could take instead. So she lowered the woman to the ground and watched as they ran away with their kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne child was left, a little red haired girl. Rachel remembered that she was idly holding her father in her fingers. Lifting him up, she ran the edge of her nail over his nipples and washboard stomach. Maybe it was Brittany doing a fine job in her panties, but she was hot for this little man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe moms gave me some sugar. Now you need to give me some salt. Strip.\u201d Knowing she could just rip him in two, he hooked his thumbs in his swim trunks and started pulling them down. Because he thought she was sexy though, he was already at full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled as the tiny penis popped into view. She playful bobbed it on her fingertip. \u201cMama like. If you were my size, you might even be larger than Sam...might...\u201d Rachel hungrily shoved the inch long cock between her lips. He released almost instantly. Rachel was a bit disappointed at the speed of his cumming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his cock as a straw, Rachel began to suck. Several more ounces of fluid on his scale were issued before tubes in his body were painfully pulled closed. Her sucking even opened the valve stopping flow from the bladder and her mouth filled with an ammonia flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeeck!\u201d She wretched spitting out the foul liquid. He leaked out the rest of his piddle into her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat performance won\u2019t do. You are coming with me.\u201d Looking down he saw the red haired girl was now met by her pregnant mother. She scooped them up too and shoved them all into her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlapping a targeting sticker on the tubes, they disappeared into her shuttle above. \u201cWhat now?\u201d She wondered.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Ta\u2019rek are an advanced but secretive race. They had very strong nonintervention policies that included mandatory cloaks around all other species. They also cloaked their entire star system from view of others. The activities of humanity had become of increasing interest to them. The Ta\u2019rek directorate has commissioned a mission to collect a sample of humanity\u2019s most advanced vessels to analyze how much of a threat they were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumans were one twelfth the size of the Ta\u2019rek, so all that was needed was a simple cargo vessel to capture their sample. This ship, the Crest, was manned by a small family that has one daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had spotted the Yorktown out of normal patrols a few days back and followed it to Erde. The Ta\u2019rek had a special affinity to Erde and it\u2019s near microscopic people, and didn\u2019t really care for how humans sometimes defiled their world. However, seeing that the Yorktown was providing humanitarian aid following a catastrophic tsunami warmed their hearts. Father still decided to collect the Yorktown, as it would not be noticed by other military craft, but wait until they were finished rendering aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir daughter, Sarea, was practicing on the scopes as the Yorktown\u2019s mission neared completion. She saw the entrance of a very small human craft. \u201cDaddy, look, there is another Earth ship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father saw this and pounded the console. Their presence could spoil weeks of work. Weeks that they could not afford as they would only be paid for the capture, not the waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Daddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe will have to find another ship, the little one will tell Earth of our taking the Yorktown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould we take that ship too?\u201d Sarea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not, we are permitted to take just one ship. That isn\u2019t even a military vessel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut Daddy, I would love to have it. It says there is a boy and a girl inside. You promised me something for my birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarea, these are people, not toys.\u201d The father felt a soft, warm hand on his shoulder. His wife\u2019s smile always melted his heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessup, give Sarea the ship. Think of it, we can study it too and have a picture of their civilian tech as well as their military tech.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessup melted, \u201cAlright. Targeting beams engaged. The small craft is safely in Sarea\u2019s room and we have computer control of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily noticed alerts on her display, \u201cIt appears the Yorktown noticed us taking the shuttle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessup smiled, \u201cOk, force fields up in the cargo hold and tractor beam engaged.\u201d After just a minute the vessel was dragged inside and Jessup reported, \u201cThe Yorktown is nicely stowed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDaddy it appears they are firing their weapons at us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok baby, they can\u2019t harm us. It does not appear I will gain computer control, but I can disable their weapons.\u201d Jessup pressed a series of commands and the firing stopped. \u201cThere we go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily remarked, \u201cI see that at least twenty humans are still on Erde. We can\u2019t leave them there. They would hurt the Erdians.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood point dear, please teleport them into a sample container. You\u2019ll need to separate them from their tech too so they don\u2019t start anything funny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes dear.\u201d Emily teleported the humans into a nearby tub. \u201cI\u2019ll take them to the galley for processing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily kissed Jessup as she hefted the sample container and walked from the bridge. Jessup also noticed Sarea skip off the bridge, clearly to play with her new toys. He set in a course for Ta\u2019rek and engaged faster than light drive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sam and Rachel were caught off guard when the beautiful view of Erde was replaced by large bulkheads. It appeared as if they were in a spaceport, but there were no other ships present. Their console read as if it was in spaceport mode. Sam attempted to override spaceport mode and was unable to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two heard the clunk of landing struts being extended and watched as their ship lowered onto a platform. There were odd structures on the platform, including what appeared to be giant advertisement sized sodas and magazines, but they were brands that were unfamiliar and written in a language that they could not comprehend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam felt Rachel clutch his arm when the truly unexpected came into view - smiling at them through their front screen was a giant teenage girl with red hair and green eyes. She pushed her hair behind her ear and then tapped on the transparent aluminum screen as if they were fish in a tank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarea skipped down the corridor as she made her way to her bunk. She was really glad to still be with her parents. Most 18 year olds on Ta\u2019rek would have had to enter into civilian or military service for a three year tour. There were exceptions for children of long haul freighter families as these children serve vital roles on ship\u2019s crews and would ultimately themselves become the owners of their own freighters eventually. It wasn\u2019t that haulers were a second class of citizens, but they were a rather close knit group with a culture unto themselves. Further, after a time haulers involved themselves little with the affairs of Ta\u2019rek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver her 18 years, she had learned to stealthily operate her hatch. When everyone was asleep, she loved to sneak down to the engine compartment and feel the hum of the quantum drive in her core as she stared out at the expanse. She loved to do this even more when they were in orbit of worlds, particularly Earth and Erde. She wondered what the tiny people of these worlds were like - the idea of owning a few of them is blowing her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she silently closed the hatch, she immediately fell in love with the small shuttle hanging in front of her over her desk. It was about the size of a toy, approximately 1 meter long and half meter wide. She pulled out her personal tablet and directed the craft to extend landing struts and land on her desk. She had full control of the little vehicle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she directed the little shuttle to download its databanks into the ship\u2019s computer, she couldn\u2019t help herself. Leaning over the craft, Sarea was thrilled it had an actual window into the cockpit. It appears that she had both a man and a woman human and they were so adorable! She tapped the window to get their attention. It was so perfect that the tiny woman clutched onto the man. She was so pretty and she couldn\u2019t wait to wrap her hands around her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough a few button presses, she activated the speakers inside the ship and patched them through to microphones outside. She quietly spoke to her new pets, \u201cMy name is Sarea. I am so glad you get to live with me now.\u201d Sam and Rachel heard this but it was in a language they could not understand. When their response was piped back to Sarea, she quickly realized her mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of realization on her face - her lips drawn into a little \u201co\u201d shape, her eyes in surprise, and a large blue finger tip raised - looked adorable. Sam couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit attracted to the sexy giantess before him. His penis twitched in confusion. Whatever attraction he felt was met equality with mortal fear. This creature, at least 35 feet tall, could easily smash them without thinking. Somehow she captured them easily. He turned to Rachel, \u201cHoney, I am not sure what we should do, I think we need to go with the flow for a little bit.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugging him for comfort, she rubbed his chest. From the tent forming on his pants, she could tell he was getting aroused. That raised her ire, \u201cIs this situation making you hard? Do you think she is hot?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stammered, \u201cThis is confusing, honey. You were also just playing with me a few minutes ago - so I am feeling a bit blue balled too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel pushed back, \u201cDo you think this giant teenager is hot?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam sighed, \u201cHoney, look at her, don\u2019t you think she is beautiful too?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel placed her hand over Sam\u2019s face and shoved back, \u201cAs much as I would hate to agree, she is. You need to promise me you will think with your head and not your dick.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smirked at Rachel, \u201cI love you, Rachel. I think you are just pissed that this girl had the same idea as you and got what she wanted first.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Rachel asked indignant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam rolled his eyes, \u201cYou wanted to come to Erde in order to collect a few people to keep. You never thought you would be the toy sized person who was kept by another, right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel chuckled, \u201cI guess so. We have become the Erdians.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the ships speakers again crackled to life, \u201cHumans, can you understand me now?\u201d Both nodded. \u201cExcellent, I forgot to upload your language matrix into our translator. You humans have such a diverse suite of languages, so thank you for talking as it allowed me to lock onto your specific language quickly.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam stammered, \u201cYou heard what we said?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarea nodded, \u201cI\u2019m flattered you both think I am pretty. You two are absolutely perfect to me too. I can\u2019t wait to get to know you so much better. You two are some of the first humans the Ta\u2019rek have ever collected, so you should feel honored. I am especially blest because you are my humans. The rest of your people are going to be studied by the Ta\u2019rek Scientific Directorate. No doubt they will be distributed throughout the Ta\u2019rek worlds to be studied by the brightest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarea saw the look of worry on her dolls\u2019 faces, \u201cDon\u2019t worry pretty ones. You will be safe with me. I want us to all be happy. You will be able to live happy full lives in comfort. I\u2019ll also take care of any children you have as well. I just met you, but I love you both very much....am I rambling?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel leaned forward, \u201cWhat other people did you collect?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarea smiled, \u201cOh, we collected your battleship that was orbiting Erde. I think it is called \u2018Yorktown.\u2019 My family was commissioned to collect a sample of human military technology. My people are afraid that your people will become a threat to us. Your very ingenious creatures and your technology is advancing very quickly.\u201d Sarea stroked the shuttle. \u201cYou also are very aggressive beings. That is something that scares the Ta\u2019rek. We are also afraid you will harm other beings in the universe, like the Erdians. The Ta\u2019rek are very fond of the Erdians. Who knew intelligent beings could exist at nearly microscopic scale?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sam and Rachel sat back, they hadn\u2019t really thought about the scale of things in the universe. It never dawned on them that humans could be on the smaller end of that scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough talking, please come out here. I would like to take a much closer look at you.\u201d They watched as Sarea\u2019s blue finger-nailed fingers worked quickly on her tablet. They heard the rear hatch unlock, depressurize and open. Rachel took Sam\u2019s hand into hers and they looked intently at one another, not sure of their next action.</span></div></div>",

I want to get a much closer look at you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Rachel looked at each other and came to the same conclusion. \u201cNo Sarea, we won\u2019t be coming out. Please release our craft and let us on our way. We have waited a long time for this vacation. You don\u2019t own us.\u201d Sam stated matter of factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarea smiled, \u201cSilly doll. You come out here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two watched her ball her fist and smashed her fist onto the shuttle. Klaxons activated for micro fractures that her massive fist caused. The two clasped onto one another. \u201cPlease stop Sarea!\u201d Rachel cried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww you have such a cute voice pretty little one. Please come out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease let us go!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two saw a five fingers as large as legs enter the shuttle\u2019s hatch. The blue fingernails made the the scene even more odd. Sam grabbed a sharp piece of metal that broke free when Sarea hit the craft. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the window, they could see beautiful red hair obscuring Sarea\u2019s face, her sticking her tongue out of her red lips. As a blue tipped index finger approached Sam, he stabbed the metal shard into her finger. This elicited a monstrous wail and the arm withdrew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatch of the shuttle closed and a new alarm appeared on the screen. Sam and Rachel grabbed at their throats as the air began burning their lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou little shits, I have just changed your atmosphere to one toxic to you. If you apologize, I may let you live.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their vision turned dark, Rachel muttered, \u201cPlease let us live....\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two humans collapsed onto the deck. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Through the transparent aluminum shell, Sarea watched her dolls collapse and start twitching. She turned her attention to her finger. After a few minutes, she finally coaxed out the metal shard which Sam had embedded. She stuck her finger in her mouth to sooth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to the craft, she expected her dolls to apologize for mistreating her. They said they were looking forward to their vacation. They should be thanking her for giving them an infinite vacation. They however were no longer twitching. They had pinkish foam in their mouths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no, I may have waited too long....\u201d Sarea commanded the craft to open its door and vent the toxic atmosphere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this was done, she reached in and pulled out Rachel. She flopped about in Sarea\u2019s hand like a rag doll. It was immediately clear to Sarea that she was dead. Sarea began to cry at the loss of this tiny thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t get to mourn long as a circle of heat appeared on the ceiling of her cabin. Sarea looked on in apt curiosity as a metal plug was pulled away. A massive pointed finger entered the cabin and smashed the human shuttle into nothingness with just a fingertip. It didn\u2019t even seem this hand slowed down when it made contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand then opened like a claw and before Sarea could react, she found herself entangled in the fingers. She screamed as she was lifted from her cabin. She closed her eyes and clung to the fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she was face to face with the smiling face of a young girl. She had long brown hair that extended to her waist. Half of her hair was tied up. She had sweet blue eyes, rosy cheeks and red lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any thought, the girl straightened Sarea in her hand and brought her face to her lips. She gave her a massive kiss, her face being brought slightly into her mouth. Pulling her back, she finally spoke \u201cThe Ta\u2019rek are so adorable. You are even more pretty than most! I think I am going to call you Kait.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut my name is Sarea, not Kait!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl giggled, \u201cDollie, you are my toy, so I get to name you. Plus, I get to dress you too. I don\u2019t like this jumpsuit on you. Yuck.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarea\u2019s blue tipped fingers clawed at the giant girls fingers, but this did not stop the girl from finding the zipper on Sarea\u2019s jumpsuit. As she plucked at it, the zipper broke. This also did not deter the girl and she tore the jumpsuit from Sarea\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking Sarea\u2019s full breasts, she giggled again \u201cYour pink bra and underwear are cute. You get to keep them girlie. But I want to look at you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently, the giantess used her fingernail to pull down the front of her panties. Bringing her nose close, the giantess sniffed her new toy\u2019s bush and vulva. \u201cI\u2019ll have a lot of fun playing with this more later. I love your red bush! However, I have to do my chores.\u201d With a very tongue filled kiss, she licked the salt from Sarea\u2019s belly before shoving the redhead deep into a cargo pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pat of the pocket, she got up from her desk and went about her day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time Sarea adjusted to her new life and even learned to look forward to the attention this new friend of hers gave. Although she never liked being clawed at during nervous games of pocket pool. That didn\u2019t stop her from wondering what might have been if she let Sam and Rachel live. </span></div></div>",
