We also discover that in the world of Metropolis there are these crystals called power crystals. Power crystals are not like chaos emeralds because they have a different energy as you will discover in the later chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever we also discover that Samantha is on a quest to becaome a Shadow. Shadows are a people group that fight against the Darkites which are brutal invaders that try to take over the planet. Samantha was assigned by Dark, who is a Shadow leader, to get training from Michelle. Michelle is a boxer and a healer which is a rare type of creature found on te planet. Samantha discovered that she was a healer and wanted to become a Shadow to fight against the Darkites. How did all of this happen? Well this will be explained in later chapters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTailsana is a wind princess and a Sunshine. Sunshines are a people group that live next to the Shadows. Shadows look like Darkites because both people groups have black fur. The difference between them is that the Darkites act more like parasites. (kind of like zombies except they are not contagious and they are not slow and ugly.) Tailsana got involved with Scott and Miley when she decided to cross the Sunshine border to meet with her friend Astrid. Why she did will be explained later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScot is a black furred fox that has force powers. Miley is his teacher and he is her apprentice. Scott is very powerful but he often has trouble controling his power. Miley has more experience than him and understands how to use force powers. However Scott had gotten \"sick\" and his powers are raging about like crazy. (they are activated by other types of energy but his illness is that his powers are over reacting with his emotions, which isn't normal) Miley is taking hi to Dark because he knows how to cure this disorder. So without further ado let's continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiley: Okay we first need to get to the Cave of Wonders.<br>\r\nTailsana: That's on the way to Astrid's house.<br>\r\nSamantha: I haven't seem Michelle all day.<br>\r\nScott: Hmmm...<br>\r\nTailsana: What are you thinking...Scott?<br>\r\nScott: (stares) Chaos emeralds?<br>\r\nNazo: Chaos emeralds? Power crystals? Ultimate power.<br>\r\nMephiles: Yes ultimate power...So who are you hedgehog girl.<br>\r\nMiley: I am Miley and you are.<br>\r\nMephiles:Mephiles. Hmph you sound like a intelligent girl. So tell me about this world.<br>\r\nMiley: Metropolis? Hmm, where do I start?<br>\r\nScott:(to Nazo) So your name is Shadic.<br>\r\nNazo: Actually call me Nazo...Shadic?<br>\r\nSamantha: Scott where is Michelle?<br>\r\nScott: I don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?   </span></div></div>",
