A quiet groan escaped her lips when she saw the time, she still had 30 minutes before her alarm went off. That was just enough time for her to get comfortable again, but not enough for her to enjoy it. Normally, stuff like that did not bother her. She is usually a cheerful, early bird. Not today. Between Hawkmoth\u2019s Akuma and her physics homework, she didn\u2019t get more than three hours of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying in her bed, Marinette\u2019s mind tried to go through the day\u2019s itinerary, but it was hazy.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Welcome to the Miraculous Tales ENF interactive. If you have read or participated in any of the other ENF interactives found on this site, then you probably already know how this works and can skip on ahead to the story. If not, then read on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story, you will be guiding one of the gals from Miraculous as she tries to get through what becomes one of the most embarrassing days of her life. Through one turn of events or another, she will find herself stripped naked and try to preserve as much of her modesty and dignity as she can. How successful she may be all depends on you. You may write to your heart's content, but there are some rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nRape, scat, gore, vore, shrinking, growing, transformation and anything else of the like is not allowed. And I withhold the right to remove or edit any chapter that includes those elements. Aside from those, I'm okay with most turns of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, onto our ladies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarinette Dupain-Cheng: An outgoing, happy and helpful girl, although she is a bit clumsy and shy. She is always ready to help her friends when they're in need. And, when trouble strikes, with the help of her Kwami Tikki, she turns into the superhero Ladybug to save the day. <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://miraculous-ladybug-fanon.wikia.com/wiki/Marinette\" target=\"_blank\">http://miraculous-ladybug-fanon.wikia.com/wiki/Marinette</a> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe Bourgeois: A spoiled, bossy and superficial girl. She has an ego like no other, thinking the world revolves around her and that everyone loves her. She enjoys to crush other's dreams, if she doesn't like them, and to humiliate others. Marinette often finds herself to be Chloe's target of choice. Despite her dislike of Marinette, Chloe is a huge fan of Ladybug, to such an extent that she dresses up as her in her free time. <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://miraculousladybug.wikia.com/wiki/File:Chlo%C3%A9_pic_6.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://miraculousladybug.wikia.com/wiki/File:Chlo%C3%A9_pic_6.png</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlya Cesaire: An energetic, passionate and confident girl. She dedicated to her friends and her Ladyblog, where she captures video of and talks about all things Ladybug. She is even willing to throw herself in close to the danger for a chance of watching her hero in action. <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://miraculousladybug.wikia.com/wiki/Alya_C%C3%A9saire\" target=\"_blank\">http://miraculousladybug.wikia.com/wiki/Alya_C%C3%A9saire</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd many more side characters, too many to list out here.</td>",
