            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the outskirts of a small village is a cave. Inside this cave is a powerful dragon. This dragon has terrorized the village for years, always stealing livestock. Fearful of the day that the dragon would tire of cattle and sheep, the village leaders sent for the man who could potentially solve their problems, the well-known knight and dragon-slayer Sir Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric road up to the cave, he counted the gold coins that the village had given him, which was fifty if he agreed to do the deed, with a further hundred and fifty when the job was done and the dragon was dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These villagers get more insolent every year,\" he muttered. \"If it wern't for the fact that I swore an oath to not harm the defenseless I'd kill that Mayor for his little condition. Well, at least the pay will be well worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looked up from his counting and saw the cave and said, \"Well here is my destination. Time to kill myself another dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then got off his horse, took out his sword and walked into the cave. When he entered the cave, everything became dark. He could hear the dripping of water coming from somewhere. He could feel the temperature of the cave start to warm up the further he went in, and he could hear the dragon breathing, heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw it, the black dragon that the villagers had told him about. It seemed to be laying on something, its hoard Eric thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the villagers asked you to come here,\" said a deep voice. \"The question is what is it that they asked you to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They hired me to slay you, you foul beast,\" Eric said, raising his shield slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Foul Beast</i>! You have no idea as to who is a foul beast human,\" the dragon said, getting up on its feet. \"Your kind have slaughtered my kin for centuries, even when we do nothing to harm you. You just think that we are animals who deserve nothing more than to be killed on sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I have my reasons,\" Eric said, as he advanced towards the dragon. \"It was your kind who burned my village and killed my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So because of the actions of one dragon you think that all of them are evil,\" the dragon said, circling around. \"I wonder if you'd feel that way if you were a dragon and a human had killed your mate and murdered your unborn children, like mine were. I've killed many of your type before, especially those who seem to think that glory is found through the killing of innocent creatures, just because they are not humans. However, in spite of this, I've never seen all humans as evil creatures that need to be killed, only some of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you think that you can talk me out of this, think again,\" Eric said. \"I'm going to get good money for killing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you seek a profit, perhaps you should get to work,\" the dragon said, with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's not the profit that I do this for,\" Eric said with a laugh of his own. \"It's the pleasure of wiping your kind out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're going to find this fight to be not as pleasurable, and more costly, than you think,\" the dragon said as it charged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two of them were fighting, the dragon slashing with its claws and shooting fire from its mouth, and Eric hacking away with his sword and blocking with his shield, each seeking the weaknesses of the other. Eric had scored several good hits against the dragon, with many good cuts along its underside and limbs, but he'd taken injury as well, for his shield arm was broken, and he was clutching the side of his chest. However, Eric felt that he was the one who'd survive this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the dragon swung its tail, slamming him against the cave wall, forcing him to drop his sword. Then, the dragon pinned him against the wall with its claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is the most fun I've had in a while,\" the dragon said, panting heavily. \"However, like with all things, it must end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go ahead and kill me,\" Eric said, struggling to get out of the dragon's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm not going to kill you,\" the dragon said. \"In fact, I plan to let you live, and experience life as a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the dragon began to mutter something, and Eric felt himself being pulled out of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"You can't do this to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can and I shall,\" the dragon said, still muttering its spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eric felt himself being pulled towards ...</span></div></div>",

He was in the dragon. Something took something else from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're in my body, now,</i> a voice inside Eric's head said. <i>You belong to me.

Not physical, but it felt otherworldly and almost purely telepathic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was naught but darkness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric awoke, but only to the feeling of pressure upon his face in a way that he never experienced before. Something was different, he could sense it, and began to take in things one instance at a time as he slowly fluttered his eyes open. One detail that he noticed almost immediately was the still shining of steel above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was... Eric's sword held in front of his eyes, only smaller than how he last recalled it... and it was being held by... Eric!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, no, it was not him. It was his body, but how could Eric not be inside his own body? He started to piece it all together... and he began to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his slowly waking stasis, Eric tried to understand the situation as he watched his sword relinquish its aim from his head and as his human body seemed to walk off on its own. Eric broadened his eyes in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Have you never seen yourself before?\" he heard. It was Eric's voice! Yet, it seemed as if every syllable was thoroughly and unnaturally pressured on, giving an almost comic after-effect. His voice continued, \"No, I'm not going to slay you like you would have done to me. I have morals, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric began to understand the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to speak, saying, \"You!\" when he shocked himself. The voice that came out... it was the dragon's voice! He began to look around when all he saw were thick black scales across his body and serrated claws at the ends of his fingers. As Eric pulled his weight up, he looked at his human body only to see that it was below him and much smaller in stature. Eric bellowed, \"You did this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you cannot blame me for this. I never expected this to happen!\" he heard his voice respond from his human body, \"Besides, I never expected such an odd feeling within a human body. It feels... inadequate, as if you are constantly trying to make up for the lack of something. No wonder you desire to slay any form of intelligent life you encounter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a burning rage, Eric heaved his hand onto a chunk of rock within the wall of the cave, ripping a boulder away from the rest of the structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was about send the massive stone towards the enemy that stole his body, he was halted with a logical statement, \"Hold! Unless you wish to destroy your own body out of pure foolishness!\" his voice punctured the wall of emotions. Eric set the boulder down onto the cave floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's human body continued, \"My name is Zartax. If you still view us as enemies, then you are unfortunately mistaken. We are much more alike than ever before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched as Zartax clutched the side of his human body with his limp shield-arm. It seems as if the injuries from the battle were still present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I will go seek out what you humans call a 'healer'. Hmph. Typical that those like you seek out the aid of another instead of relying on your own experience. I guess it comes with the body.\" Zartax concluded as he began to walk towards the exit of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched Zartax walk off, Eric looked at his new dragon body. He noticed the heavy lacerations across his arms and side. Also, he noticed that a few of the more fatal-looking wounds were bandaged over with some of the wrappings and medicinal ointments that Eric remembered taking earlier in his journey to the cave. Glancing over at the exiting Zartax, he noticed his human hands were largely stained with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why?\" Eric solemnly asked after a short pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Call it a personal flaw, but I believe that everyone deserves a second chance.\" Zartax glanced at the sword he was carrying as he responded, \"Even you. A week from now, I will come back here after I correctly repurpose the spell I used that led to our body switch. Then you can make the decision. For now, I recommend that you look for the springs on the eastern side of this mountain to heal those wounds you gave yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Zartax walked out into the blinding daylight outside of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what decision? And after a whole week!?\" Eric cried out after him, but no response was received this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked behind himself. The wings were folded at his sides and his spiked tail was flicking around absent-mindedly. He saw the sword wounds again. I have to find those springs...</span></div></div>",

When he felt good enough to open his eyes, he looked around, to find his old body unconscious on the rocks below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Eric said, realizing his voice was different. \"You've made me into a dragon!\" he said, looking around for his adversary. Somehow, even though Eric didn't prefer to have a dragon voice in the first place, he still felt that the one he currently had was a bit too...something, but he couldn't place his finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice came from behind, slowly, cooly, \"Oh, I most certainly have.\" Something in the tone of the voice struck Eric as more than a bit odd, so he quickly turned around to find the dragon he had been facing before sitting right behind him. \"Gwa, get away from me,\" Eric said, pushing the dragon away and stumbling forward on unfamiliar legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon only looked at him in a sly manner. \"You know what the difference between me and you is?\" He was still using that horrible voice, as if he-- Eric froze. He knew that voice, he himself had used it many times...on women. Eric quickly did a mental check...something was <i>definitely </i>not where it was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The difference between me and you is simple: I am a healthy adult male, and you...\" the dragon said, giving Eric a onceover that gave him the creeps. \"...are a healthy adult <i>female</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Eric had already guessed it, the dragon speaking his predicament out loud gave it a chilling reality, as if he had spoken it into existence right there. The dragon continued to watch Eric critically, holding eye contact for a bit too long here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this dragon just froze Eric in place, he couldn't make himself move, or talk, or anything. The dragon began leisurely approaching, a bit TOO leisurely. Eric looked within his heart of hearts and called up his best angry outburst, hoping to give the male some pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now back off,\" Eric said, before mentally cursing himself. Back off? What kind of lame threat was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't think male arrogance will help now, EricA,\" the dragon said, enunciating Eric's new \"name.\" \"In fact, I think you'll find that no male strategy you're used to will help at all.\" He seemed to be quite pleased with himself, and that pleasure frightened Eric more than he thought it should have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-look,\" Eric began, painfully noting that his voice sounded like a feminine version of the opposite dragon's voice, \"I don't know what you think you're going to get out of me, but, I'll have no...\" The dragon moved in very close, putting his head just above Eric's own, flustering him/her. \"Part in what you're going to do...\" Erica said, her argument slipping away from her like dandelion seeds in a gale force wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, Erica, I'll take care of everything,\" the dragon said, smiling cruely. \"You need to learn to experience life as a dragon, so I thought I'd start you out at the best place...\"</span></div></div>",

He could leave and regain her strength, or stay and when he returns. Also, The dragon might be the only one to change her back to a male human. Killing him would keep her a dragon until she died.

She could have easily turned around and avoided the ambush, but the eggs were inside. Eric did his best not to kill any of the hunters. She encircled most of them in a ring of fire. She knocked them to the ground and a few started to retreat the moment they figured out Eric was toying with them. It was not long before they ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was quicker than I thought. They must be amateurs and would have gotten killed had they faced any other dragon. I hope they did not find the eggs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric entered the cave, she saw a man standing over her clutch of eggs. In panic, she quickly raced to the man and hit him from behind. The man hit the floor and went limp. He started to bleed profusely from his his back. Eric used her fire breath seal up the wound and laid him on his front side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The man is going to need some assistance until he can move again. He tried to kill my young, but I don't know anyone else who would take care of him.\"</span></div></div>",

The man sat up and looked around, fear evident in his eyes. He looked around for the eggs -- <i>Oh great</i>, Eric thought, disappointment running through her body. She had hoped that the man would somehow become a friend, a confidant, someone to talk about home with, but if this man's only desire was to take the eggs, then his presence simply would not do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man scanned the cave again, apparently sure that he was being watched. Looking nowhere specific upon an unseen assailant, a description that aptly fit Eric, the man finally spoke. \"H-hello?\" he asked, using the hesitant tone Eric had found humans to use when fearful of an unknown danger but still curious enough to check for allies. Eric did admit to himself that humans tended to be fearful creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stood, gently, and though his intention was obviously one of stealth, he did not seem to be very good at being stealthy, as his attempt at stepping silently was almost deafening.

Each day, he would feel more and more miserable, and each day, some different part of his body would be tender, or sore, or a combination of both. One day, a deer would be the nectar of the god's, the next, it would be nauseating. He simply didn't know how women (and any female for that matter) did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut somehow, his new body had known what to do, and after several traumatic hours, Eric had sat looking at a pile of watermelon-sized eggs, their leathery appearance mottled with dark spots. Though he knew that he'd only done some of the work, he still felt a sense of pride at what he'd managed to accomplish, for in his book, laying eggs successfully is a big accomplishment for one who hadn't had such anatomy for more than about a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eggs sat next to each other, the little dragons quietly developing in their shells. Eric spent his time eating, for eating helped the nausea and boredom, and it also kept his mind from any maternal bonding that his body impressed upon him. He wanted to take care of the baby dragons, not love them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when the fateful day arrived, and the tiny figures began cracking their protective shells, Eric couldn't help but love them as he watched them perform the amazing feat of hatching. Eric noticed that their eyes were closed, apparently sealed with some sort of mucus. As each one hatched, they began to squeal pitifully for their mother, which soon reminded Eric that HE was supposed to fulfill that role. As their squeals filled the air, the euphoric maternal feelings retreated, replaced with a sense of duty to protect and nurture, but what task to do first, Eric didn't know. He knew that whatever task he picked, his instincts would guide him, but he didn't know in what order to do them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made his best guess, and went for it.</span></div></div>",

Eric felt something hard pressing up against him, and he was afraid to know that what he was bumping up against was in fact an egg shell. <i>His</i> egg shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eric felt the unending urge to BREATHE, but the egg which had for these months long been his protector, turned killer, as it lacked enough air for him to breath. He began to struggle, his body finally unlocking itself from its long paralysis. He'd known that dragon hatchlings were born with an egg tooth, so he began slamming the front of his face against the egg shell for all he was worth, he couldn't breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack formed, then two. Eric felt the world begin to spin around him, and he knew that if he didn't get air soon he would -- the egg shell split, finally allowing Eric to take his first beautiful, life-giving breath. He relented in exhaustion, simply sucking in lungful after lungful of liquid gold. In the back of his mind, he felt the thought, \"Good job, <i>little one,</i> you won't die after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, no, it was HER.

Violas was he by chance a knight. He seems familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in his mind Eric felt like the male dragon, who was supposedly his father, sounded familiar. Too familiar for Eric to feel safe. Eric was about to rush at the silver dragon until the dragon rolled a stone towards him. Eric was distracted by the stone that he started playing with it. The male dragon chuckles at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was a knight dear and an ignorant one at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I hate it when knights assume all dragons are evil. Some of the knights I trained have learned that.

What dragon would train a knight to kill their own kind. It then hit him. His lord and adoptive father as a human was in fact Lord Silvercrest.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been twenty years since Eric has been reborn as a Terro Dragon. While growing up he learned that calling other dragons by their scale color instead of their breed's name is a racist practice that is normal in human society. Yet it didn't surprise him since humans tend to be racist against themselves for weird reasons. Most dragons condemn such racism saying that it is barbaric and uncivilized. Eric also learned how to create vegetation and small landmasses. Eric, however, was still ticked that he got turned into a dragon. Standing 30 feet high and weighing eight tons only made things worse. His scales have become darker in coloration and vast amounts of muscle supported his hefty frame. His wing span was even large enough to make flying a breeze. The downside to being a fat dragon is that almost every dragoness wants to mate with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric didn't have time to mate with a dragoness if he was still trying to find a way back into his old body. Yet every time he thought about it he would only get hungry. Eric was starting to fear if he did return to his old body what if he started eating everything in sight. It would be no use to return to his former body only to windup a complete slob. Eric tried shaking such thoughts out of his mind. He needed to get something to eat. All of the thinking was making him hungry. The good thing about being the largest of his breed is that he is completely respected by his fellow dragons, yet dragons don't stop growing until their late forties or fifties. After that period they grow two feet every ten years. As Eric took flight he flew over to see if his berries that he made managed to immobilize his prey. Eric scans the area and sees something struggling to move. Eric then dove straight towards the struggling prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric landed he saw what appeared to be a human. Eric sighed in disappointment. It was a good thing that humans were considered unhealthy for a dragon's diet. The thought of eating a human disgusted him. Unfortunately humans love to make up wild stories of people getting eaten by dragons. When he landed the whole area vibrated due to his impressive girth. Not only was it soft, but it was impenetrable by ordinary swords. Only swords dipped in fairy dust could scratch his scaly hide. The human was a woman clad in armor. She had a royal insignia emblazoned on her left shoulder. She had fierce red hair and stone cold black eyes. She looked at Eric with rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your name foul beast so I may slay you!\" The woman yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My peers call me Ericlison. I am what they call a Terro dragon. You have eaten bait meant for wild animals I was hoping to catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try rouge but I will destroy you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric sighed as the woman struggled to her feet. The woman tries rushing at Eric only for it to shatter upon landing a blow. Eric snorted and rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call that an attack. No knight would dare attempt to use a weak sword against a dragon. Haven't you heard that our pelts are extremely tough. Trying using something doused with fairy dust. Then maybe you would succeed in causing a scratch knave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman was boiling with anger. She wanted Eric to be dead and nothing would change her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you talk down to me! I am the captain of the royal guard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you were a captain you would know that by now. Did your father give you title just to please you? You sound like a spoiled princess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gets irritated that she starts muttering to herself. Eric stops critiquing the knight as he remembers that she getting ready to cast a spell. Eric stomps on the ground to make a pillar shoot straight up. The knight launches a fireball only for it to be blocked by the pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done yet? I have other traps to check and the head dragon of my colony will pissed if I am not back to watch over the newly hatched wrymlings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't have to worry once you are dead. Ya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman tries to charge at Eric with a dagger but fails. Eric uses his bulk to throw her off. Eric then sighs. He doesn't want to attack the woman, but dragon law states that dragons of good standing must defend themselves. Any human who fails to heed the warnings must be punished for their crimes against dragonkind. Humans are only allowed to attack dragons that are actively destroying villages. Any other occasion is a major offense, but humans are always ignorant of the laws of dragon society. Eric inspects the woman. He finds her in a bush by a tree. It happened that a bee hive has fallen next to her. Once the woman realizes the scenario she runs off cursing under her breath. I guess the knight's punishment was making a fool out of herself. Hopefully she doesn't try a foolish attack like that again. Eric manages to collect enough food to eat. After cooking it and eating it he heads off back to the colony.</span></div></div>",

Oh there were a few nice things, like the joy of flight, which always helped him out a bit, not to mention breathing fire and being capable of doing a few other things. But he longed to become human again. In his eyes he was ugly, the long horns on top of his head reminded him of the images he'd seen of the Devil. His long and narrow body was that of a Serpent, like one of those who tempted Eve in the garden of Eden. His wings were like those of a demon he'd seen in woodcuttings, and his claws and teeth were like those of a lion he'd heard about, only far larger. As for his scales, they were as black as those of the dragon who had cursed him. The only good thing about his transformation was the fact that he was still male, as Esmerda had told him that he could of been turned into a female dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the moment, he was unhappy. He and Esmerda had been in another argument, one in which he was told to watch over his <i>younger siblings</i>, who were created in one of two ways, either by Esmerda having sex with another dragon, or by a process similar to how he'd been turned into a dragon, in which the soul of a dying dragon was removed from its body and placed into an unfertilized egg to be reborn. However, he wanted nothing to do with the caring and raising of dragons, especially considering what they did to him and others. However, Esmerda had one major advantage, she had his human body. On more than one occasion she had threatened to either tear it to pieces, or roast it, or just plain eat it, unless he did as she asked. This time she had actually put it in her mouth and was about to swallow it when Eric had reluctantly given in. After that, she had spat the body out and hid it, like she always did, with a smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there were times that she was nice to him, like when he had a fever when he was starting to develop his fire lungs and he was having trouble using them or the time he'd broken one of his legs in a bad fall and torn the skin on his wings when he was just starting to fly, and a few other times. But by and large, he hated Esmerda for what she did to him. He wanted to kill her, but if he did that, his human body would remain hidden for all eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't live my life like this,\" he thought. He looked down and saw a large pointed sword-like rock. \"If I jump off this cliff and don't use my wings, that rock will spear me and I'll be dead.\" Then, he shook his head and said to himself, \"No, that's suicide, and God punishes Suicides.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Eric heard a sound. Looking in the direction he heard the sound, he saw....</span></div></div>",

A bunch of bandits were attacking a young woman. At this, he felt a great deal of anger. Back when he was human he had encountered the aftermath of such scenes, usually with the woman having been raped or murdered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time,\" he said with a growl, and took flight. He might not of been human anymore, but he knew his duty. There was no way that he was going to let these bandits have their way with this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flight would be a short one, because not only was he a strong and fast flier, the wind was with him due to a thermal he'd caught, meaning he'd get there faster. Of course, due to the way that the wind had been blowing, it was only by chance that he'd heard the woman scream. However, it was more than enough. He had to save the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer, the wind helped him in another way, as the bandits' horses started to become skittish and fearful, as they could smell him. He then saw the bandits look in his direction, and they started talking fearfully, each of them getting more and more scared to the point that a few of them fled. However, when he landed, there was still several of them so he roared, causing their horses to bolt out from under them, forcing the bandits to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he saw the men run, Eric contemplated as to whether or not he should breath a stream of fire and decided against it.

It turns out that the woman is none other than Princess Annabella the daughter of the king and his sole heir to the throne. Annabella might look like a pretty face but in reality she is a mage whose desire is to use her magic to better her kingdom and to someday be a fair and just queen. It turns out that the bandits that were hired to kill her were sent from her ex-lover Irzac the blackknight. After leaving him due to his violent nature Irzac hired the bandits to kill the princess by enchanting their them to resist magic. If it wasn't for Eric she would have been dead. After meeting Eric she studied up on dragon magic. During that time she would meet with Eric in the plains everyday. Eric was meeting Annabella to talk about her latest magical breakthrough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Eric, I just found out something very neat.\", said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it ?\", asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apparently some dragons can take on human form but in order to do so requires a vast amount of magic.\", said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric couldn't believe it.

They soar in the sky for about two hours before landing. After that both Eric and Annabella part ways until tomorrow. Somehow this made Eric feel better about being a dragon though he would prefer to be human though. When he arrived at the cave he notice that his younger <i><i>siblings</i> were playing with there food. Yet during his time with Annabella he managed to hunt wild life.

How's it going?\" his brother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Laxton. I was just on the hunt like always and happened to run into a friend.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By friend you mean a human mage who happens to be a princess. Don't worry bro. your secret's safe with me.\" said Laxton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Eric and Laxton are the same age with Eric being slightly older, yet ironically they used to serve together as knights before being transformed into dragons. Yet as human Laxton and Eric were often equals in their capabilities. Yet as dragons they had differing views. While Eric had detested being a dragon before meeting Annabella, Laxton was the complete opposite. Laxton as a dragon is carefree just like he was as a human, but also much fatter as a dragon due to his expertise in hunting. This along with his midnight blue scales made him a ladies' dragon who would often fascinate any dragoness with his large frame, remarkable strength, and keen knowledge about humans, but whenever a dragoness would ask him about bonding he would often say that he would have to think about it. He often said this so he could keep his integrity and would feel bad for manipulating a lady whether human or dragon. Ironically, Laxton was the only dragon that Eric could trust despite their differences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Laxton.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem bro. As long as mother doesn't know you should be fine. Yet you should totally introduce me to her sometime. Other than that you should come on a hunting trip sometime. One of my hunting spots has tons of wildlife just right for eating and relaxing. There's even an abandoned fortress there totally void of humans who would try to kill you.\" said Laxton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll think about it Laxton, yet you should avoid over-gorging yourself. Any bigger and you won't be able to move let alone fly despite you figuring out how to fly with all that extra weight.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please bro. I know what you're trying to do. You're saying if I got any fatter the ladies would just use me for breeding purposes. Don't worry bro. I like being huge and I can easily fend off any ladies unwanted advances. Well I'm going to eat some of my leftover carcasses. said Laxton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Laxton went off into the cave to eat his carcasses that he hunted down during his hunting trip. With that Eric just smiled knowing that his \"brother\" knew how to handle a sticky situation given if he ever got into one. Yet he couldn't help but fantasize about being human again via shape-shifting. He now knew that it would be futile to rely on Esmerda to put his soul into his original body but if he practiced he could probably shape-shift into his original body. Thanks to Esmerda threatening to destroy his body several times he knew what it looked like. But he would have to try it tomorrow since it's too late and also he didn't want Esmerda to know that he figured out a loophole that would render her threats null. With that he entered the cave and fell asleep exhausted from his long day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, deep in the Cursed Valley, a region that served as the crossroad to many of the surrounding kingdoms, was Irzac's fortress. Angered by the incompetence of the bandits he was contemplating on destroying Annabella's kingdom and taking her as hostage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cowards running away from a dragon pathetic! Do you know what happens to those that fail to obey me?\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the dragon, he was menacing and strong. Even if we could of resisted his magic we would of been torn to shreds.\"  said the bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Menacing, yeah right. I've seen that poser act like a hero. He would often save those in trouble and fly away than rampage a city. If you want to know what a menacing dragon looks like I'll just show you.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrzac then turns into a black and crimson dragon which is actually his true form. Most who see him in his true form never live to see another day, while others get a reminder of what would happen if they cross his path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please boss don't kill us!\" pleaded the bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had the chance to avoid this fate if only you did you job.\" replied Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrzac then burns the bandits to a crisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guards remove the ashes from my throne room and prepare the army to invade Firamore. Tomorrow we go to war. Maybe with the destruction of one of their cities they'll hand over the princess, but if they refuse we'll just destroy another city until the kingdoms' are wiped out. said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

On his first time he accidentally turned himself invisible, realizing that invisibility is the easiest spell for a dragon to learn. Each new attempt led to Eric accidentally firing off a new spell many of which were deflected onto a nearby bolder. A few hours later Eric finally got the shape shifting spell right. When Eric saw his reflection he noted that he looked the same before turning into a dragon except his clothing. He noticed that he was wearing black armor wings and horns having transformed into a cape and helmet respectively. He also noted the sword that was on his person assuming it to make up for the lack of claws in his human form. Excited at the turn of events he decides to tell Annabella about the turn of events. Eric enjoyed this new found freedom. He can now at will shift between his human form and his true form at will allowing him to do whatever he wished. He might even move out of Esmerda's cave and build himself a home, yet it would have to be near both the plains and cave though because it would have to be big enough to accommodate his dragon form noting that the spell would wear off if he used up all his magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then heads to the plains which are not that far from the cave. When Eric arrives he notices that Annabella is reading as usual. The books Annabella normally read besides spell books were books about the history of Sunshire and the other neighboring kingdoms. It was through this book that she found most of her knowledge about dragons and the fact that most dragons preferred to live peacefully and ignore humans while dragons of malice intent would normally try to dominate humans. Yet it has been taught that all dragons are the same a greedy intent that arrogant nobles and pompous church officials would scream from the rooftops in order to fill their pockets. She figured that this would have to be remedied as soon as possible whether becoming queen or through Eric's heroic deeds. Yet it has been noted that Eric's heroic deeds cause some to go hunt him down on occasion. She is then alerted by a familiar voice only to see a stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning your majesty what lovely whether weather we have today,\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Eric...\" She then notices a mysterious knight in black armor who apparently had the same voice as the Eric she knew. \"Eric is that you?\" questioned Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else would it be.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then shape shifts back into his dragon form and then back into his human form again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing! Out of the 20 years I've been study magic, which is from the moment I was born, I never thought I would see a dragon shape shift!\", exclaimed Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool isn't it. This means I can finally enjoy activities I could only do as a human with the benefits of being a dragon,\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabella then laughs at the idea thinking it to be rather cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want your welcome to come to the ball that I'm hosting tonight. I live in the city of Magimore which is a ways off from our nation's capital Firamore.\" Annabella replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after she broke up with Irzac that she moved away from her home in Firamore fearing that her being there would endanger her family and kingdom and also noting the power lust of Irzac. When she moved to Magimore she was warned of the dragons that lurked the land. A reason she thought that would repel Irzac. But now she's beginning to think that Irzac is completely fearless, possibly a dragon himself, or both for she had heard rumors that Irzac kept a dragon in his army. This rumor slowly leading Annabella to the theory that Irzac himself is the dragon. That would also explain the charm spell that was cast on her when she dated the black knight. But little did she know that she was actually right about her hunch for there were rumors that Irzac had declared war on the kingdoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that knight Eric goes to the ball after he finished the chores that Esmerda threatened him into for apparently not watching his younger siblings today even though his \"older sister\" Vanity was supposed to do it today. When he arrived at the ball in human form apparently in human form, but this time in a black suit with black gloves, cape and of course helmet and sword. The reason for the cape, sword, and helmet is due to that fact that in dragon form those would normally be a part of his body and ergo can't be separated from his person. When he arrived most of the guests mistook him for a noble or prince from a far off land only for Annabella to assure her guests that he is a knight that she recently hired to be her body guard. Not thinking much about the people accepted him despite not knowing that he was really a dragon. So Eric and Annabella danced the night away enjoying the ball.</span></div></div>",

Your mother may be strict but she only does so for your best interest. How about this then? Since there's not much entertainment I propose a gentleman's challenge.

I took you in as my own child.\" remarked Lord Silvermore as he clashed swords with Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you talking about this here and now? I'm also shocked that you never told me of your real persona.\" replied Eric parry Lord Silvermore's sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see my boy our fellow noblemen have drank too much wine and are in a drunken stupor of their own doing. They won't remember our conversation except for the sword fight. If I had told you my secret all these years ago you would have tried to assassinate me in my sleep. Also nobody would of believed you either way and you my dear boy would of spent the rest of your days locked in a prison cell.\" replied Lord Silvermore while charging at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so? If my memory serves me correctly I was renowned than you father. People would of clamored to find any dragon masquerading as a noble if that was the case.\" replied Eric while dodging Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I had to let you learn the hard way son. This was to merely teach you a lesson that rouge dragons are the ones who cause destruction. Yet I only revealed my identity to those whom understood the difference. Those few individuals have become well respected. However, arrogant pupils like you find out the hard way I'm afraid. Yet it seems like you have more to learn that I should have taught you a long time ago!\" exclaimed Lord Silvermore whose sword suddenly was shrouded with fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sword magic? Such a thing exists? I've heard that legendary swordsmen were able to learn it but I never expected to see it with my own eyes! exclaimed Eric who was dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's real my boy. Many a great swordsman both human and dragon have mastered such a fine art. I believe this is where you lose my boy.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Silvermore knocks Eric's sword out of his hand ending the duel. Eric was then stunned at having lost yet again to his father, but this time as a dragon. The crowd in their drunken stupor cheered for Lord Silvermore while Annabella whose was sober as can be gave a round of applause. Eric then realized his folly. Memories from his childhood as a human reminded him that his \"father\" Lord Silvermore was even more of a taskmaster than Esmerda. Except Eric knows that the dragon wouldn't threaten to do physical harm to his human body. However the young dragon didn't care because he's glad that he found a way around that issue. However, Eric feared though that his father would force him to spare against his former body even though he had no desire to return to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well son looks like you'll be staying with me for now on. Ah sweet memories. I can remember all the great times we had.\" said Lord Silvermore in a reminiscent tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget Eric that you still have your duties as my bodyguard.\" said Annabella winking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Lady Annabella. Please join us for Eric's training for it might prove some use to you.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the nobles leaves Lord Silvermore turns into his dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric! You remember where my estate is right? I'll be back. I just got to spend some time with your mother. See you in the morning son.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Lord Silvermore and his wife fly off to the cave so they can make merry of themselves. Eric then realizes that those siblings of his were definitely Lord Silvermore's if the thought never crossed his mind to the night's earlier revelation. Eric then flies off to Lord Silvermore's estate. He goes in through the secret entrance. Once inside Eric goes into his old room to find that it has been renovated to fit a full grown dragon. Eric then curls up and falls asleep. The next morning... </span></div></div>",

Yet before leaving Annabella told her men that she would go ahead with Lord Silvermore and Sir Eric and meet them at her uncle's. Little did they know that Lord Silvermore and Eric were dragons except a few that had trained under Lord Silvermore of course. Everything was going fine until a storm started to roll in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric! Prepare to find shelter immediately! If we stay airborne during this storm a strike of lightning could kill us all!\" exclaimed Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll land in that forest!

Annabella hold on tight to Eric and close your eye until we land.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabella does just that and Lord Silvermore and Eric swoop down into the forest. Upon landing Eric, Annabella and Silvermore notice that their landing broke some of the branches but other than that the forest's tree were extremely sturdy.

The forest was also unnaturally quiet and Eric kept feeling strange vibrations in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is anyone else feeling that?\" asked Eric<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling what?\" asked Annabella<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those vibrations\" replied Eric <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I feel them two, as dragons we are more sensitive to magic, the very air seems to thrum with it.

Three were male and one was female, with long hair that hanged to their shoulders the female had white blond hair and bright blue eyes, two of the Males had brown hair and had identical facial features so Eric realized that they are twins while the last elf had black hair with glowing yellow eyes like that of a Hawk . They all wore leather armor with bracers on their forearms and long leather boots with forest green leggings and a shirt under their armor and a green cloak with a white oak on it, over their shoulder was a quiver with white feathered arrows and swords were tied to their belts. The black haired elf also had a silver circlet with a glowing emerald in its center on his head, Eric realized that he must be the leader of the band. They were pale and frail looking but Eric knew it was a deception, he heard many stories of the elves and their fast reflexes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>How did they manage to sneak up on us?</i>\" thought Eric <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sprite then flied past Eric's shoulder and stopped at eye level in front of the black-haired elf, \"Well done Brenda\" Said the elf leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what do you want?\" asked Lord Silvermore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-haired elf gestured to himself \"I'm known as Hawkeyes among the Fay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Lilith\" answered the woman <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're Elvenar and Findor\" answered the two brothers at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we are here to punish you\" said Hawkeyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punish us, for what?\" asked Annabella<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are guilty of trespassing in the Forest of the Fay, The penalty has always been death\" said Hawkeyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had no intention of violating your realm, if you show us the way out we'll...\" said Lord Silvermore<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Lord Silvermore could finish his sentence Eric drew his sword and charged at Hawkeyes.

He knew the elves would be expecting him to have human level abilities so he hoped to catch them by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves quickly moved to the his left and right except for their leader who just stood his ground, what surprised Eric is that the leader didn't seem concerned about him charging at him, he didn't reach for his sword or even draw a arrow and he lowered his bow to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the elf thinking isn't he going to defend himself?\" thought Eric, he considered stopping the attack but quickly reconsidered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>If its a trick they'll kill us all, I have to finish what I started!</i>\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately Eric underestimated the elven leader's speed. As he stabbed at the elf's belly the elf twisted aside at the last possible moment and Eric's sword passed through empty air. Eric's speed carried him past the elf and before he could stop and turn to face him he received a hard kick in the back which sent him flying headfirst into a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Eric was still human the impact would have knocked him out but since he was a dragon it only stunned and disoriented him. He staggered back then went down on one knee and waited for his vision to stop spinning and the ringing in his ears to end. Once his vision cleared he looked up and saw Hawkeye standing in front of him with a arrow aimed at his head. The other elves had arrows aimed at his companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT\" called Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should we?\" asked Hawkeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just execute us\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and why not?\" asked Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm Princess Annabella, daughter of the king of Firamore and his heir.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat announcement caught the elves by suprise they stirred and murmured amoung themselves and Hawkeye raised a eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bold claim, but how can we be sure its the truth\" said Hawkeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a Firamore royal family signet ring\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me see that\" said Hawkeye. He holds out his hand and Annabella removes a gold ring from her finger and places it in his palm, he pinches it between two fingers and holds it up to the light so that he can better see the face of the ring, which has the Firamore royal family's crest carved into it. Hawkeye stares at the ring with a thoughtful expression when Lilith walks closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They could have stolen it\" Lilith pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly but if its the truth we can't just kill them, it would cause a war between Firamore and the Fey\" said Hawkeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" asked one of the brothers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take them to the King of the Fey, he will decide what to do with them. Disarm them and bind their hands we go to the Capital\" said Hawkeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRENDA!\" called Hawkeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sprite which had been hiding behind Hawkeyes since Eric charged at them flies around him before stopping at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fly ahead of us and let the king know that we're bringing visitors\" said Hawkeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sprite then flies off between the trees while the elves tie Eric and Lord Silvermore's hands and take their swords. Once they're done they form into a defensible formation around the group. Eric and Lord Silvermore stand on either side of the princess so they can defend her with their bodies if the elves turn hostile. the two elven brothers stand on either side of the group with their swords drawn and ready while Lilith takes a position further back with her bow aimed at their backs. Hawkeye hung his bow across his back and took the forward position, he kept his sword in its scabbard but placed his hand on the hilt so he can draw it quickly if he needed to. He then turns his head and looks at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you try to escape we'll kill you, MARCH!\" said Hawkeye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elves then lead Eric and his group deeper into the forest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thought of wandering through the dark forest for months without finding the way out worried Eric. Despite everything looking the same for Eric the elves never hesitated or seemed to lose there way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time Eric began to see multicolored lights hanging from the tree branches and he also began to hear voices ahead. When Lilith saw what Eric was looking at she moved closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those lights mean we are close to our capital.\" said Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the walked in between two trees Eric saw the elven city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them was a grove with three trees that were as big as mountains standing close together in the center. On the ground leading up to the trees were several open fields were elven horses were running freely. There was also many smaller fruit trees with many elves tending to them and picking the fruit growing on them. Before them was a path leading to the center with beautiful statues on either side. A wooden wall surrounded the three center trees and at the end of the path was a gate with the same oak symbol that was on Hawkeye's cloak.<br>\r\nA walkway big enough for Eric and Lord Silvermore to walk side by side in dragon form spiraled around the trunk of the biggest tree. The walkway and the buildings in the tree seemed to have been grown from the tree as if the were a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should be honored humans, you're the first of your kind to see this in over a century\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing, I've read about the architecture of the elves but I never thought I would see it for myself!\" said Annabella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked down the path towards the gate the elves and spirits stopped what they were doing to stare at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they reached the gate a guard on the top called out. \"Halt, state your name and purpose!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawkeyes and his patrol, we bring important prisoners for the king.\" answered Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king is expecting you, make your way to the great hall.\" said the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OPEN THE GATE!\" shouted the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they climbed higher up the tree Eric saw another kind of spirit. At first Eric thought it was a female elf but when she turned to them Eric saw that her skin was pale green and she had leaves instead of hair on her head. When she saw them her form blurred. When it cleared Eric saw that she was covered in bark like a tree and her arms had grown longer and her fingers ended with very sharp branchlike claws. As they walked by Eric saw nothing but hate and fury in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a dryad, the self-appointed guardians of nature.\" said Hawkeyes after he saw what Eric was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree-city was so high that they eventually climbed above the height of the other trees and Eric could see that the sun was just beginning to set below the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We were in the forest for an entire day</i>.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the top of the tree was two huge doors that lead into the trunk of the tree. Inside was a long hall that ended at a wooden throne that seemed to have grown out of the far wall. On either side of the path stood two rows of Elven guards in full armor armed with a spear and tower shield, and behind them stood several dryads in their battle-forms. To the right of the throne rested a large green scaled dragon and to the left of the throne stood one male and on female druid. The female wore a green robe and carried a staff in her right hand. The male also had a staff but he wore nothing but a pair of leggings and a wolf pelt, on his chest Eric saw strange tatoos and around his neck was a necklace of wolf's teeth. Compared to the other elves he looked wild and savage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were a few feet from the throne Hawkeyes and the twins went down on one knee and bowed their heads to the king, Lilith moved forward and forced Eric and the others to their knees before doing the same herself. The king sat up straight and looked at Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you bring these humans before me son?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found them wandering near one of the ward stones and she claims to be the princess of Firamore, she carried a Firamore signet ring so I thought it best to bring them to you.\" answered Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I'll handle our guests, you may go.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe patrol rose to their feet and turned to leave before the king called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawkeyes, I haven't finished with you yet so wait outside the hall for me to call you.\" said the king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkeyes turned his head and nodded to the king before he resumed walking back to the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you trespass on our land princess?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were fleeing Magimore for my uncle's kingdom when we were driven into the forest.\" answered Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you fleeing your home?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our enemies were getting closer and we thought it best to relocate to someplace more defensible.\" answered Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are your enemies?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irzac the black knight\" answered Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two druids reacted with surprise and a look of anger appeared on the king's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are enemies with the black knight? asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" answered Annabella.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your desire to protect the forest is admirable but your fanaticism is starting to rival the dryads. Not all humans are like the ones who wronged you. It's time you learned that.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I cause a diplomatic incident?\" asked Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I will be VERY Disappointed.\" threatened the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king then turned back to Princess Annabella.\"It's almost dark and the forest gets dangerous at night even for my people, so you will leave tomorrow at dawn. A servant will show you to your quarters and I will bring you a meal if your hungry.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning a elven servant wakes Eric and escorts him and the others to the main gates at the base of the tree-city where Hawkeyes was waiting. \"It's about time, do humans always sleep this late?\" asked Hawkeyes. He had exchanged his cloak with the oak symbol for a hooded one that he had closed around himself to hide his armor and weapons. the hood was raised to hide his face and a scarf was tied over his lower face so only his eyes were visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too. I thought elves were supposed to be good mannered.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to complete a mission.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good because with that attitude you won't make any but I have to ask, what's with the cloak and dagger look?\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My people are as welcome in your lands as humans are in mine. So I don't want to draw attention to our group.\" said Hawkeyes<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"If you don't want to draw attention then you might want to rethink that look.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you look like a bandit.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better a bandit than a lone elf wandering the country side. Let's go we have a long journey ahead of us.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" called someone. Eric turned to the sound to see the same elven druidess from their audience with the king the previous night running towards them from the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I might have been too late. My king asked me to present you with these tokens.\" said the druidess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened a pouch to reveal three large acorns with the same oak symbol that Eric saw on the gate of the city. A gold chain was tied through the acorn so that they can be hung from the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err, thanks... what is it?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acorns from the Mother of the Forest.\" said the druidess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the Mother of the Forest.\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mother of the Forest is the largest tree in the Forest. It is believed that it was once a normal tree but it continued to absorb magic until it became intelligent. Since then it has been connected to the fate of the forest. When the Mother is sickly so is the forest, when its flourishing so is the forest. We believe that if the mother ever dies so will the forest and everything in it. The acorns are only given to the greatest friends of the fay or to people touched by destiny. If you encounter elves or spirits they will know you are a friend and must not be harmed. While you wear it no mage will be able to scry your location. It will shield you from the effects of dark magic so no one will be able to influence your mind or curse you and it will also boost the power of your magic.\" explained the druidess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please thank your king for me. He honors us with such priceless gifts.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he does, you must remember that as well as the trust that he places in you. Don't disappoint him.\" said the druidess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, we have wasted enough time already.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkeyes then takes the lead and walks away from the city and deeper into the forest.</span></div></div>",

The sun was just beginning to set. Eric isn't claustrophobic but he was so glad to be out of the confining forest and in open space again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, I thought we would never get out.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most intruders don't get out alive. So count yourselves lucky. The sun is beginning to set we should spend this time trying to find shelter. We can continue with the journey tomorrow.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's group soon found shelter at an abandoned farm. The building was still in good condition but all the food had been cleared out. Whoever lived there left recently and in a big hurry. They were at the moment all sitting in front of a campfire outside the building waiting for the supper that Eric had caught to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should discuss what we're going to do tomorrow.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to discuss, we can turn into dragon form and fly to Sanctuary. We can be there in a few hours\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that wouldn't be wise. Irzac's patrols are all over the countryside. We also believe that Irzac is somewhere in the area. If we're spotted we'd soon have the entire army closing on our position. Irzac also have many mages in his army and while those acorn necklaces hides you from their scrying. It won't be able to protect you when you take dragon form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! before we decide anything. What's the condition of the kingdom?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not good. Your uncle has pulled back all his forces to Sanctuary so Irzac's men have free reign in the region. They have been burning fields and villages since then. Your uncle has evacuated all his people and had them escorted to Sanctuary so his guards can better protect them so any person we encounter could be one of Irzac's men. They also gathered up anything that they can use in wartime: food, horses and weapons. So supplies will be difficult to find.\" answered Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are our options?\" asked Annabella<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur best chance is to sneak through the area and for that reason I think we should avoid the roads.\" said Hawkeyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long would that take?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four days maybe a bit longer.\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanctuary might not have that kind of time. If we used the roads we could cut that time in half.\" said Annabella<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but it would also be more likely that we would run into Irzac's patrols.\" replied Hawkeyes.</span></div></div>",

I see your point we'll have to try but in order for the plan to work you'll have to follow these conditions fully.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What conditions?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to avoid any travelers on the road because anyone of them could be Irzac's men. And if we are discovered we'll have to kill everyone who saw us without exception. Even if someone drops his weapons and surrenders, we'll have to kill him. We can't take the risk that he would go to Irzac and tell him our location.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like that second one.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it's necessary if we are too succeed. If its too much trouble for you then we'll have to go through the countryside. Because everyone except Irzac's men has been evacuated we won't be able to talk our way out of a fight. Irzac's men will arrest or execute  anyone that they find on the roads. Because they will assume that anyone they find will be a spy, soldier or ally of the kingdom\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I agree with the conditions but I don't like it at all.\" said Eric. Annabella and Lord Silvermore also grudgingly agrees to the conditions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I believe dinner is ready. Let's finish eating then you three should get some rest. I'll keep watch.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning they take one last look through the farmhouse for anything useful. Annabella found a old and worn hooded cloak but it fit her reasonably well so she took it so that she can hide her face from any travelers that they might find on the road. As they walked they saw no sign of any travelers but everywhere was signs of the war. Many field were burned or burning, houses were torn down and ransacked and they even came across a recent battlefield. The bodies had simply been left where they fell and crows and other scavengers were already picking through the area. Hawkeyes was kneeling on the ground and inspecting the ground and the bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the looks of it your soldiers were escorting wagons full of supplies through the area when Irzac's men found them, princess.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not seeing any wagons now.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's because after Irzac's men killed the guards they took them somewhere.\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pointed to a section of the ground where Eric saw deep grooves in the ground as if something heavy dragged through them. They led away from the massacre and deeper into the countryside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could it be more of the princess's men. Maybe some survived and took it to safety.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, look at the tracks surrounding the grooves. They match the boots of Irzac's men, not the guards. If they are moving the wagons instead of destroying them then they must have a army camp nearby. We need to be extra careful as the area will be full of patrols.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should leave the area quickly.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you three go ahead. I'm going to follow the tracks back to their camp.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be foolish. Why would you want to do that?\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find out what kind of forces Irzac has in the area, How many men he has and how well equipped they are. I also want to see if I can't sabotage their army. It might buy Sanctuary a few more hours and that time could mean the difference between victory and defeat.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we should go with you.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, If I'm discovered they'll just think I'm a lone elf causing trouble, not worth pursuing in wartime but if they see you then they will have their entire army looking for us. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself and this isn't the first time I've caused mischief for humans.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will you find us again?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few miles ahead is a village called Forest Springs, wait for me there. If I haven't arrived there by noon assume that I've been captured and continue on without me.\" answered Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, we'll meet you there. Good luck.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, Annabella and Lord Silvermore continue to follow the road. They found several patrols in the area but thanks to Eric and Lord Silvermore's draconic senses they always had an early warning and was able to hide from the patrols. after another hour of walking they finally reach the village of Forest Springs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In front of them stood the village of Forest Springs, there was no sign of any people or animals and looked completely abandoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay alert, if anyone wanted to ambush us this would be the perfect place.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey advanced into the village until they reached the center square where the village hosted gatherings. Several gallows was built in front of them so this was were the village also executed the occasional criminal. Al around them were larger, better decorated manors and in front of them a very large building. Eric guessed that it was where the village elders met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spread out and look for anything we can use. Food, Bedding or horses and bring them to the center. But be careful.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized that nobles had a tendency to hoard more than they needed and that they valued the expensive but less useful items, which they always took with them when they had to evacuate. So he walked to one of the larger manors, hoping to find supplies that the resident noble would have had to abandon when he evacuated. Eric's intuition was correct and he found lots of useful supplies in the manor, which he brought out and placed in the center near the gallows where Lord Silvermore and Annabella were placing the supplies they had found as well. In the manor that Eric had chosen he found more camping supplies than food so Eric guessed that the noble took up hunting as a hobby. After a few hours of searching they had more supplies than they could carry so they abandoned the search and began sorting through the supplies so that they could decide what they were going to take with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need me for anything else?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the moment. Why?\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to explore the village a bit more before we leave.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, but don't wander too far and stay alert.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then returned to the manor that he had searched earlier but he explored the manor this time instead of looking for items to help them. Despite the fact that the resident noble took many expensive items with him, there were still many in the manor that he left behind. On the second floor Eric found a room that he hadn't explored yet. Display cases were on either side of him all along the walls and the heads of many animals and dangerous monsters were mounted on the walls. Several of the cases were empty but others had priceless weapons in them. Beside the cases were several beautiful suits of armor. Eric walked over to the mounted head of a Red scaled dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I doubt the noble had the spine to hunt any of these monsters</i>.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobles never took up monster hunting but always desired the trophies after a successful hunt. Eric actually made more money selling his trophies than he did for the hunt itself. Eric never understood why nobles would brag about a trophy that they didn't earn themselves. Eric then saw a finely crafted spear resting on a rack near the mounted head. He picked it up and examined it up close. The blade and haft of the spear was made of metal and looked like silver. Despite the fact that the entire spear was metal it was extremely light. Beautiful images of trees and animals was carved on the blade and the haft of the spear. It reminded Eric of the spears that the royal guards of the elven king wielded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This should be on the battlefield, not resting in some noble's treasure hoard</i>.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric examined the carvings up close he saw through the reflection a black armored solder stalking towards him with his sword raised. Eric twisted around and the soldier swung his sword at him. Eric dodged the blow, then stabbed the man through the chest with the spear. The man went to his knees then fell to the side and Eric withdrew the spear. At that moment Eric heard more fighting outside and rushed out of the manor. When Eric came outside he saw his 'father' standing in front of the princess fighting three soldiers at the same time while Annabella threw spells at any soldier that tried to flank him. At that moment a horseman ran into the square, turned his steed and charged at Eric with his lance lowered. Eric threw the spear at the rider and struck him in the chest knocking him from his horse. Eric then drew his sword and rushed to Lord Silvermore's aid. Together Eric and Lord Silvermore defeated the soldiers easily. but the moment the last soldier fell, four horsemen ran into the square and charged at them. Eric and Lord Silvermore readied themselves but before the horsemen reached them a arrow struck one and knocked him from his horse. Everyone turned to look and Eric saw Hawkeyes standing at the one of the entrances to the square. Even as they looked at him he loosed another arrow that struck a horseman in the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining horsemen turned to charge at Hawkeyes and Eric took advantage of their distraction. He charged at one of the horses and struck its side with his shoulder, knocking it over and causing its rider to fall on the ground. Eric then finished off the rider with a quick stab of his sword. The remaining rider tried to stab Eric with his lance but he dodged the blow, then broke the rider's lance with a slash from his sword before jumping up to the rider's level and slashing him in the chest with his sword. Eric landed on the other side of the horse and the rider fell to the ground beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment a single man in black robes walked into the square. Hawkeyes fired a arrow at him but with a flick of his wrist the arrow changed direction midair and struck a wall. The man then raised his other hand and a ball of energy left his palm and struck Hawkeyes in the chest, sending him flying back first into a wall. Eric and Silvermore charged at the sorcerer at the same time, hoping to reach him before he could cast another spell. But the sorcerer made another flicking motion with his left wrist which sent Lord Silvermore flying sideways. The sorcerer then raised his right hand and threw a energy ball at Eric. The moment the ball struck him Eric felt extreme pressure around him, as if a giant invisible hand closed around him. He couldn't move no matter how much he struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY, WHY DON\"T YOU PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE!\" yelled Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can best me, whelp.\" answered the sorcerer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two mages then advanced towards each other. The sorcerer raised a hand and a fireball flew towards Annabella. Annabella raised a hand and a blast of icy air struck the fireball, extinguishing it. She then lifted her right hand over head and a spear made of ice appeared in her hand, which she then threw at the sorcerer. He waved with his hand and the earth in front of him rose and formed a solid wall, the spear struck and shattered against the wall before the wall exploded outward, sending rocks flying towards Annabella. She raised her left arm and a magic barrier appeared in front of her, the rocks hit the barrier but left Annabella unharmed, she then pointed a finger at the sorcerer and a red beam flew from it and struck him in the chest. The man looked at his body and saw that he was disintegrating, before he turned to dust the man pointed towards the sky with a finger and launched a red orb as bright as the sun into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the sorcerer died, the pressure surrounding Eric disappeared and he was able to move again. He and the others then rushed towards Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" replied Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to leave now, more soldiers will be arriving soon.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric, Annabella and Silvermore rushed to the supplies that they had gathered while Hawkeyes ran to fetch some of the soldiers horses. After a moment's consideration Eric also retrieved the spear that he found in the manor from one of the horsemen's bodies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It served me well, it would be a shame to leave it here for Irzac's men to find.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they secured their supplies to the horses they mounted them and ran as fast as they could out of the village. They were barely a few miles from the village when they heard someone sound a war horn in the village.</span></div></div>",

The road led through a forest and on either side of them were tall trees. Eric could hear the drumming of hooves behind them and knew that more horsemen were close behind them. As Eric passed between two large trees, a javelin buried itself in the trunk on his right. Eric twisted around and saw several horsemen gaining on them. As they got closer they prepared to throw more javelins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS WAY!\" called Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Silvermore guided his horse off the road and into the forest, the others turned and followed him. Once they were in the forest Hawkeyes twisted around and began to fire arrows at the pursuing soldiers, holding on to his horse with just his legs. The trunk of a fallen tree was lying on the ground before them but their horses easily jumped over it. Eric's horse was the last to jump other and the moment he was on the other side Annabella twisted around and pointed at the fallen trunk and it caught fire and a large wall of fire appeared over it. The fire scared the soldier's horses, who reared and tossed their riders from their saddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GOOD THINKING!\" called Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey managed to avoid further patrols but the area was swarming with them. When it started getting dark Hawkeyes spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't wander around after dark, we could walk right into a patrol without noticing. I know a place where we can lay low until the patrols pass the area.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, lead on.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkeyes led them to a secluded glade in the forest. The glade was so overgrown that is would be nearly impossible for anyone to find it unless they knew exactly where it was. There was only one well hidden entrance, the rest of the glade was completely surrounded by thick growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice hiding spot, How did you know about this place?\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rangers have several such safe havens scattered all across the kingdoms. How do you think we can strike at a target then disappear before our enemy can retaliate?\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night they didn't start a fire as they were worried that the glow might reveal their location so they ate from the food supplies that they had received from the village. Since their meal consisted of only dried salted meat and some uncooked vegetables, it wasn't a very appealing meal but they ate it without complaint. After their meal Hawkeyes shared with them what he found out at the enemy camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has a army of about two thousand men at the camp but that isn't the main force.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many more are coming?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but according to the reports in the command tent. After Firamore and the surrounding villages surrendered he had his men conscript every man in the area. He keeps their families hostage and threatens to execute them if they refuse to fight or flee without orders from their commanders. These men were just given a weapon, shield and armor and told to march here. These men have almost no training but they will fight to the last man unless their commanders orders otherwise.\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's going to complicate things.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets worse, his men have told Princess Annabella's family that they captured her and that they are going to execute her if they don't surrender Sanctuary. They expect an answer once their army arrives so we must reach Sanctuary before them as I suspect that they will surrender if we don't tell them otherwise. Fortunately we have horses now so unless we're unlucky we should reach Sanctuary by midday tomorrow\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you able to delay Irzac's army?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, I sabotaged the wheels of their wagons so that they would break when they are heavily loaded and when they start moving. I also released their horses from their pens so it will take them a time to find them and even then I doubt they will find them all. It might buy Sanctuary a few more hours.\" answered Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to sleep but everyone was too nervous to sleep. Both the day's events and the reports from Hawkeyes had them troubled. After a while they got up again and began talking again in the hopes that it would calm them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawkeyes, I've been curious about something since we left the forest.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then ask.\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering why the king would send a prince to escort us through the countryside. It seems too dangerous a mission  for a prince.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Firstly I'm not a prince, The king is my foster father, he adopted me after my father was killed.\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, does the king have any children of his own?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkeyes shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I still think its dangerous to send the heir to the elven throne on such a mission.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The elven kings don't have heirs. If the king leaves the throne, the leaders of all the elven clans in the forest comes together and choose a new king from their ranks. At most I might be chosen represent my clan and maybe I might be chosen as the new king but there is no guarantee  and I don't want the position anyway.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did your father die?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's late. We should try to get some sleep. I'll keep watch.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got up before the sun had fully risen and continued their journey. They managed to avoid more of Irzac's men and their horses helped them reach the city faster. It was almost noon when Hawkeyes pointed at a hill in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanctuary should be just beyond that hill, princess.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabella increased her pace so that she could reach the hill faster and see the condition of the city.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As they reached the top of the hill they saw Sanctuary. In front of them was a large mountain range and Sanctuary was built up right against the bottom of a cliff. A fifty foot wall surrounded the city and Eric saw several towers with siege engines along the outer wall. A inner wall surrounded the citadel and some building that looked like armories and barracks. Leading up to the outer wall was flat plains where many fields and farmhouses were built. The farms were abandoned<br>\r\nbut Eric saw many soldiers patrolling the walls. Eric saw two huge doors leading into the mountain range behind the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sanctuary was once a dwarven mining outpost but they abandoned it when the minerals dried up. Humans then moved in and staked a claim. The dwarven king first treated them like squatters but gave them the deed to the outpost and sent five of his best engineers to help with the fortifications after humans rode to the dwarves aid. Those doors leads into the mountains and directly to the dwarven realms but the dwarven king had them sealed when relations between the two races began to fall apart.\" explained Hawkeyes, after he saw what Eric was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They built this place to last.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The city has never fallen to a invader. Hopefully it will keep it's record. Here's where we part princess\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mission was to escort you safely to Sanctuary. That mission is now complete, so I should return to my king and wait for more orders. Once I enter the city, the defenders won't let me leave again until the siege is over.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need all the help we can get if the city is to remain free.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't my orders.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your king ordered you to help us. Perhaps that included the siege as well. You know the odds as you saw Irzac's camp, we need everyone we can get. Your people already helped us. If the city falls to Irzac, do you think he will forgive that? Your king will understand.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkeyes thinks it through for a few minutes before he answers the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I'll stay until the siege is over. But that is all I can promise. I'll tell my king that I was stranded in the city until the siege was over.\" said Hawkyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" replied Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, we shouldn't keep your family waiting any longer.\" said Hawkeyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey carefully make their way down the hill and rode up to one of the sealed gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt! The city is closed because of the ongoing war. Only people with official business is allowed in.\" said one of the guardsmen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Annabella lowered her hood so that the guards can see her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess Annabella! How did you ... ? Nevermind, this isn't the right time to ask. Your family will want to see you immediately.\" said the guardsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards opened the gates and Eric sees two guards waiting for them on the other side. One of the men's armor was better decorated and of better quality than the other guardsmen so Eric guessed that he must be a officer of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings princess, I'm Captain Roland of the city guard. We're glad to see that you managed to escape from Irzac. The people were deeply distressed when they heard you had been captured and your family has been worried sick about you.\" said the officer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you captain but I wasn't captured. Irzac has been spreading the lie in the hopes that he can take the city unopposed.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that your back, he'll get a fight he won't forget. Come your family will want to see you. You can leave your horses with my men. One of them will take the horses to the stables.\" replied Captain Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dismounted and the captain led them through the city towards the palace. As they walked through the city Eric saw that the people were desolate and afraid but their mood brightened when they saw the princess. The princess was loved by her people and many hoped for a brighter future when she takes the throne so when they heard that she had been captured they lost hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain guided them through the palace and into the war room where a table with maps of the surrounding area was placed. Several men was standing around the table arguing. Two had crowns on their heads so Eric suspected they were Princess Annabella's father and uncle. Another was dressed as a knight and Eric recognized him as Sir Richard, one of the most bloodthirsty and fanatical of the dragon slayers while the other was a older man in blue robes with a long white beard and staff. As they entered the room the men looked up and one of the kings rushed toward Annabella and embraced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daughter, thank goodness your safe. How did you escape?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't. Irzac's men never found us.\" replied Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where have you been? We've been expecting you days ago.\" asked her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were ... delayed.\" replied Annabella. She then told her father everything that happened to them from their encounter with the elves up until their arrival at Sanctuary. Once she finished her tale her father looked at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my thanks for keeping my daughter safe. My family's fortunes has dwindled recently but if there's anything you want. Ask, and I shall grant it if its within my power.\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't require anything, Your majesty.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, let me introduce you to my brother. King Jarrod of Sanctuary.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Jerrod nodded his head at them. \"Thank you, for coming to my city's aid and for helping my family.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Sir Richard, my chief military advisor. And the man in robes is Grand master Zorthar, the headmaster of the local mages school and my magical advisor.\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we expect the elves assistance in this battle?\" asked King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly no, my people take time to muster and we're not skilled in direct battles like this siege. We're better as skirmishers and guerilla fighters.\" said Hawkeyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unfortunate. We could have used the help. This news you bring me about the mass conscription is most troubling. I'll now be forced to take up arms against my own enslaved subjects. Apart from the numbers this gives Irzac. It will also demoralize our soldiers as they will be fighting friends or family. Fortunately your sabotage of their main camp has bought us some time.\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the condition of our forces?\" asked Lord Silvermore<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough, We withdrew all our soldiers into the city and we have received many new recruits. Grand Master Zorthar has also volunteered his better trained students as battle mages. Your wife has also arrived in the city has offered her magical knowledge and she's one of the most talented sorceresses I have ever seen. We also have enough supplies to last several months as we secured as much as we could before we evacuated the countryside.\" replied King Jerrod.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're talking about the war effort. I have a matter to bring before you, your majesty\" said Captain Roland.</span></div></div>",

They solved the matter quite easily but my men encountered a mercenary that was 'less' cooperative.\" said Captain Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect  'captain', what does a bar brawl have to do with our war with Irzac?\" asked Sir Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get to that soon sir. Anyway, this mercenary didn't take part in the brawl but my men were under orders to arrest everyone until we could clear up what happened and who was responsible. They told him to come with them but he refused saying that he hadn't finished his drink yet. When they tried to force him, he fought back. He didn't use any weapons but he beat back ten men that day. Once he was done defending himself he finished his drink then dropped his weapons and said that he was ready to leave now.\" said Captain Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A single mercenary beat back ten guards? Clearly my guards need more training.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In their defense, sire. The mercenary was a 'dragon-kin' so its understandable that they had difficulties.\" said Captain Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dragon-man? Here?\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need to be surprised, they go where there is money and a war is good money for them. A few of the guards joked and said that we should hire him and point him at Irzac's men. But I think that's a good idea.\" said Captain Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Captain Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For all we know. Irzac hired him to spy on us.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he's a spy. Then he's the most incompetent spy I've ever seen. He hasn't been trying to get into any military buildings and he made quite a scene that day. I think we can trust him.\" said Captain Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Eric. You cannot trust mercenaries even in the best of times. And definitely not one of those 'demons'.\" said Sir Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, dragon-kin mercenaries are the most honorable ones you can find. Once they accept a contract, they never turn on their employer. Even if a better offer is made by their enemy they'll turn it down and finish the contract. Just don't lie to them about the nature of their enemy. If you do make him an offer, tell him about Irzac's dragon. He might refuse the contract but if you lie to him and he finds out. Then he will turn on you.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you believe we can trust him?\" asked King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, your Majesty.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then bring him to me.\" said king Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sire.\" said the captain who then rushed out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a dragon slayer Eric had heard of the dragon-kin. A few hundred years ago there was a brutal war between humans and dragons. At first the two sides were evenly matched but once the humans discovered how to create dragonslayer weapons the war started to turn in their favor. The dragons struggled to  match the human's numbers and combined with weapons that could pierce a dragon's scales made it difficult for dragonkind to keep up. Eventually a great wyrm named 'Shadow Stalker' began experimenting with captured humans, he tried to create a super soldier that could defend dragonkind from the dragonslayers. After several failed attempts he succeeded in creating a artifact that could combine his blood with the human form and the first dragon-kin was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese creatures had the features of a dragon. Like a scaly hide, sharp claws, wings, a dragon snout filled with sharp teeth and a heavy tail. But their form was humanoid so they could use weapons and wear armor. 'Shadow Stalker' found that the transformation had stripped them of all human memories except their knowledge of fighting and magic if they had the training. It also made them fanatically loyal to dragonkind. He then sent the dragon-kin against the slayers. The slayers found that their weapons were less effective against the dragon-kin as they were part human. And the dragon-kin knowledge of their enemies tactics and training made them dangerous opponents. Eventually a peace treaty was signed by the two races and the war ended. Two conditions was that human kind would destroy all dragonslayer weapons as well as the plans to make more. Despite this promise a few dragonslayer weapons were hidden and these weapons are still be used today, while the dragons would destroy the dragon-kin artifact and end the spell that kept the dragon-kin in their service. They freed the Dragon-kin but they were unable to restore their memories so the dragons  cut ties with the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough dragons and humans adapted to the peace quite easily the dragon-kin struggled as they were bred only for war and knew nothing else. They either became reaving bandits to satisfy their bloodlust or they sold themselves out as mercenaries in order to satisfy their craving for battle. The elves took pity on them and taught them basic skills like agriculture and building and soon dragon-kin villages began to appear in isolated areas like jungles, swamps and mountain ranges. Although the Dragon-kin today are more peaceful than their ancestors they continued their traditions and many young dragon-kin left their villages and became mercenaries. Dragon-kin respected both the elves and the dragons but there was a great deal of tension between humans and dragon-kin. Humans treated the Dragon-kin like beasts while the Dragon-kin refused to forgive mankind for the atrocities they did during the war and for breaking the tenets of the peace treaty. Dragon-kin would normally attack dragonslayers and as a result the slayers hated the dragon-kin almost as much as they hated dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes passed. the guards returned with the Dragon-kin. He was covered in sky blue scales and was quite a brute. He was far broader than the guards and over a foot taller. he had a dragon's head and serpentine neck and his jaws was full of daggerlike teeth. He had two long straight horns at the back of his head and a single frill that started at his neck and went all the way to about three quarters down his tail. He also had two draconic wings on his back. He walked on two dragonlike legs with three toes and had two humanlike hands with five fingers. His fingers and toes ended with sharp claws. A single thick metal plate was on the top of his head with a metallic spike  at the front of the plate near the tip of his snout. The plate had two leather straps that tied around his lower jaw. The straps were flexible enough so he could still bite or speak if needed. He wore a breastplate over the front of his chest. His back was left bare though so nothing would obstruct his wings. He had a leather belt around his waist with  large metal plate attached below the buckle that acted as a loincloth. it also had a chain mail skirt that ended just above his knees and went completely around his body. A gap was left as the back so that his tail can pass through unobstructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands was in shackles and he carried no weapons but Eric knew that even unarmed he was still a dangerous opponent. As he walked past, his 'father' got a shocked look on his face, but he concealed it so quickly that Eric didn't think anyone else saw it. His 'father' obviously recognized the dragon-kin and was startled when he saw him. When he was in front of Annabella's uncle he looked the king in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kidnapping someone and having them dragged in chains before you isn't the best way to start a negotiation, human\" said the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And attacking a possible employer's men isn't the best way to earn his trust.\" replied King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told them I just wanted to finish my drink. Are you going to kill me for that?\" said the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I have a deal for you.\" answered King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's have a 'civil' discussion.\" said the dragon-kin. He held out his shackled hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain!, please remove his shackles.\" said the king. The captain stepped forward and unlocked his shackles. Once it was free the dragon-kin rubbed at a spot where the metal chaffed his scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, I'll save you some time. I assume you want to hire me to fight against Irzac and his dragon.\" said the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Will that be a problem?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if the price is right.\" said the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can offer you 150 gold.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can hire a common thug for that money. Do I look like a common thug to you?\" replied the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"200 gold.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me when your ready to make a REAL offer.\" said the dragon-kin. He then turned around and began leaving the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"300 gold!\" called the king. The dragon-kin stopped and turned back to the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW we're getting somewhere.\" replied the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you agree?\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you still need to sweeten the deal a bit more.\" replied the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have time for games, mercenary. JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT!\" yelled the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will pay me 300 gold. half now, half once the job is complete. you will also pay me 20 gold for every enemy officer I kill.\" said the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you better be worth every coin. You can stay in the guard barracks while you work for me.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary. I have a room at the 'Harper's Rest'. It's a tavern near the gates.\" replied the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I'll expect you at the front gates once the alarm is sounded.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'm a professional.\" replied the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name? dragon-kin.\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest\" replied the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Tempest. the captain will return your weapons to you when you leave. You can go.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest bowed his head to the king, then turned and left the room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the audience with the dragon-kin, Annabella's father invited them to a meal. Before the meeting they looked for Esmerda. At first Lord Silvermore was angry that she revealed herself and that she volunteered to join the battle. But she assured him that their young was save. She had hidden Eric's 'siblings' high in the mountains above the city and told Laxton and Vanity to watch over their siblings. If the city fell then they would lead the children away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they waited for the food Annabella's father told them about what happened at his kingdom and his journey to Sanctuary. Once they finished the meal Hawkeyes left to inspect the condition of the city's archers while a guard took Lord Silvermore, Eric and Esmerda to their accommodations. It was a large house close to the city walls. Most of the townspeople found shelter closer to the inner walls. The king of Sanctuary used the empty buildings to house his soldiers so that they can reach the walls faster if the alarm is sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrzac's army arrived just as the sun was beginning to set. He said that if the royal family surrendered then he will be merciful to the townspeople but the kings refused. Irzac then ordered his men to set camp and begin building siege engines. His army was far larger than Eric had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to sleep but he wasn't able to relax with Irzac and his men so close. Eric heard a noise in the hallway so he got up and peeked out through a small gap in the door. He saw Lord Silvermore put on a hooded cloak and sneak out the house. Eric became suspicious and decided to follow him. Lord Silvermore walked through the streets avoiding anyone until he reached a tavern near the city walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know he drinks.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked at the sign above the door. It had a picture of a harp on it with the words 'Harper's Rest' written below the picture. Eric hesitated at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I go in 'father' will see me.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric looked around and saw a drunken guardsman staggering back to the barracks. Eric closed his eyes and altered the illusion that hid his dragon form so that he'll look like the guardsman. He then inspected himself in his reflection to make sure the spell worked correctly. As Eric entered the tavern he saw that there were very few people still in the tavern. It was very late so most everyone had gone home. The barman was preparing to close the tavern when he saw Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"George? I though you said you were going to go back to the barracks?\" said the barman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to clear my head for a while. I'll just sit here until you close.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish. Would you like another drink?\" asked the barman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric saw that his 'father' sitting at a table in a dark corner of the tavern and across from him sat Tempest. Eric made his way to there and sat at a table close to theirs so that he can listen to their conversation. After a few words he noticed that they were speaking in Draconic. Even though he was uninterested his 'mother' had taught him draconic so he didn't have any problem understanding them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how you can live among humans. They often don't keep their word, Their knights constantly try to kill dragons and their drinks are terrible.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kingdom isn't made great by its choice of liquor.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps not, But it does make it more bearable. You didn't come here to talk about drinks. Why did you seek me out, old friend?\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know why you're here. The REAL reason. A enforcer doesn't just show up without a good reason.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hurt. Don't you trust me?\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. So you do listen to my advise occasionally. You're right, I'm not here looking for mercenary work.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here for Irzac?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean the council has declared him a renegade?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The council doesn't know I'm here. And I would like to keep it that way.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't you get in trouble for that?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Enforcers are allowed to act independently if you find a renegade.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the deception though? Why didn't you tell the king what you really are?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because then Irzac's spies might find out. He'll call off the attack and strike elsewhere and I might not know when or where. I need to catch him in the act if I'm going to bring him to trial.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you have a plan to help us win because it isn't looking good at the moment.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a plan. But I do have something that can help, Follow me.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then stood up and walked out of the tavern. After a few seconds Eric also got up and walked to the door. Eric peeked out the door and saw Tempest and Lord Silvermore walking around the tavern and into a alley. Eric started to follow them but when he went around the corner something grabbed him by the neck and slammed him backfirst into the wall. Once his vision cleared he saw that it was Tempest that was holding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?  Why are you following us?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm George of the city....\" Eric replied but Tempest dug his claws into Eric's neck as he tightened his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sense the illusion hiding you and I've never seen George turn down a drink. I'll ask you one last time. WHO ARE YOU!\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric realized that he had to reveal himself so he ended the illusion that hid his human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest released his grip on Eric's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't eavesdrop on a enforcer, kid. It will get you killed.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a enforcer?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you have questions. But we can't talk here. Follow me.\" replied Tempest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest led them around to the back of the tavern. There was a row of doors at the back. Tempest walked the the third door and unlocked it. Once they entered Tempest lighted some candles. The room was small with only a bed, a small writing desk and a small table with two chairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know the origins of the dragon-kin?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" answered Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, After the peace treaty between dragons and humans was signed there was still a lot of tension between the races. Dragonslayers continued to hunt dragons and dragons retaliated by burning villages and cities. The High Dragon Lord at that time grew concerned as he believed that if things escalated then there would be another war. He believed a force was needed that would keep the peace by any means necessary. The problem he had was that humans would never allow dragons to watch them nor would dragons allow humans to do the same. He looked at the dragon-kin as we were still struggling to find a purpose and we were a neutral race. He found the wisest and most skilled of the dragon-kin and from them he created the enforcers. The two races wasn't happy about it but they gave their consent. The enforcers have watched since then, Hunting overzealous dragonslayers and renegade dragons. The enforcers answers to no one except the High Dragon Lord.\" explained Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the High Dragon Lord? I've never heard of that before.\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The short version is that he's the king of the dragons. He doesn't really rule over dragons though. He helps to settle disputes between rival dragon clans and in the rare case where something affects the entire dragon race then he represents the dragons or if there is war, lead them into battle.\" answered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you had something that can help us in the battle.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did.\" replied Tempest. He walked to his bed and pulled a wooden crate from under the bed. The crate had a strange symbol on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the sign of the dwarven miner's guild. Where did you get that?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A former employer. After I finished a job for him he couldn't honor our agreement so I took that as compensation.\" answered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you didn't steal it.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. He was more than happy to give it to me. Once I stopped holding him by the throat over the edge of a three story building.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest opened the crate and Eric saw three egg shaped metal objects inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Dwarven invention. They use it to open chambers and clear cave-ins. I'm not sure how it works but I know that it explodes once it comes in contact with fire. You light the fuse, throw them, then get to cover. We should be able to destroy Irzac's siege towers with these.\" answered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be useful.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two should get some rest. I suspect Irzac will attack at dawn and you should be well rested. It will be a long battle.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Silvermore then returned to their rooms.</span></div></div>",

He rushes to the main door where his 'parents' are waiting. they leave together and make their way to the main gate. Once they reach the main gate they find that Tempest and Hawkeyes are already there, trying to organize the defenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Tempest's right hand he carried a large hammer. Humans would have had to use both hands to wield the weapon but Tempest only needed one hand. In his left hand he carried a tower shield. He also had a cone shaped tail weapon strapped to the tip of his tail, it had two axe blades on its sides. This allowed him to use his tail as an axe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawkeyes! Tell the men to get those towers firing!\" called Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're already working on it, lizard!\" yelled Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them to work faster.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Eric arrived the rest of the officers joined them at the gates. Roland arrived with the city guard while Robert came with the other knights. Grand master Zorthar arrived with Princess Annabella and the rest of the mages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess? What are you doing here? You should be with the rest of the royal family at the castle.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can defend myself.\" answered Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can. But Irzac is after you. So you are in bigger danger than us. You shouldn't be on the front lines.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to cower in a castle while men fight and die to protect me. I will fight with you whether you like it or not.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then take your positions.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmerda and Princess Annabella went to the back ranks with the other mages while Eric, Lord Silvermore, Robert and Roland joined Tempest on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the situation?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irzac's spies have been busy. They sabotaged the war machines in the towers. Hawkeyes is trying to fix them now. Irzac has a big army but he didn't have a lot of time to build siege towers or ladders so if we can keep most of his men off the walls we might win.\" answered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest took one of the dwarven devices and waited, once the closest siege tower reached the walls and opened the platform at the top, Tempest ignited the fuse and threw the device into the tower. A few seconds later it exploded, sending debris flying in every direction. Their victory was short lived as a second siege tower docked to the walls on the opposite side of the gatehouse and began to release soldiers onto the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get them! Don't let them take that section of the wall!\" called Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric rushed at the section with the rest of the defenders, a shadow passed over him and Eric looked up to see a large boulder flying towards him. Eric didn't have time to dodge the boulder so he braced for the impact but before it can strike him the boulder shattered in midair as if it had struck a wall. The pieces didn't hit any of defenders and fell either on the ground or struck the enemy soldiers. Eric realized that it was the mages that just saved them from the missiles. Eric nodded his head in thanks at Annabella and she nodded in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the battle was going well for the defenders. Despite the size of Irzac's army he had difficulty getting his men on the walls. Defenders waited at the top of any ladders that the attackers placed on the walls and didn't allow his soldiers to get a foothold on the walls. The missiles from his siege weapons kept being deflected by the mages and Irzac's battering ram couldn't get through the gates as the mages were using their magic to reinforce the gates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day Eric heard a explosion in the distance and heard the sound of chains being pulled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're opening one of the side gates! We need to stop them before we're overrun. Eric come with me!\" called Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Tempest left the battle and ran to the side gates. Behind the gates was a large square with a incomplete cathedral in the center. The building was still in the early stages of construction but the front of it was in better condition. The towers and wall of the cathedral's front was high but unstable. Several heavy wooden beams was placed against the wall to keep them from falling over if there is heavy wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric saw several men wearing the armor of the city guard standing by the gates. The men turned and looked at Eric and Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KILL THEM!!\" called the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men then drew their swords and charged at them. Eric and Tempest quickly killed the men. Once the last man fell Eric charged at their leader hoping to kill him quickly. As he charged at him an invisible force took hold of Eric and immobilized him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Not again</i>.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the sorcerer could finish him off a hammer flew through the air and struck the sorcerer in the chest. As the man struggled to regain his balance a shadow passed over him and Tempest landed in front of him. He slashed the man through the face with his claws then twisted and struck the man in the chest with his tail weapon. Once the man died the force holding Eric vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric! Stop standing around and get that gate closed!\" called Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rushed to the gates and inspected it. The wooden doors had been blown of their hinges so there was no way to close them. The chains that was used to raise and lower the metal gate was also broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They sabotaged the gates!! I can't seal it!\" called Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Captain Roland arrived with a few dozen spear men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain! have your men take up defensive positions at the gates. They'll have to hold them while we seal the gates.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the men hurried to the gates Tempest took a quick look through the square and his eyes fell on the cathedral. He called the captain who then rushed to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are there wooden beams in front of the cathedral?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a accident a few months ago. A strong wind blew it over. We placed them there so that it won't happen again.\" answered Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the walls are unstable?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very.\" replied Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, Hold this.\" said Tempest. He shoved his shield into Roland's arms, who then staggered under it's weight. Tempest then took a two handed grip on his hammer and advanced on the closest beam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took a position near the front of the formation. He sheathed his sword and pulled out the spear he used at Forest Springs. He also salvaged a shield from one of the dead soldiers. A moment later several black armored knights rode through the gate. One knight tried to stab Eric with a lance but Eric dodged the blow, then stabbed the knight through the side. Before Eric could recover another knight drove his lance into Eric's shield. The shield blocked the lance but the force of the impact drove Eric back. The knight let go of his lance and began to draw a mace but Eric killed him before he could draw his weapon. Eric dropped the now useless shield which still had the lance buried in it. He knew that he wouldn't last long against knights on open ground without a shield so he withdrew behind the other defenders while he tried to find another shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest had broken two of the beams and was working on the third one. He also used magic to summon a strong wind from the mountains behind the city. The remaining beams groaned and cracked from the pressure but still held their position. As Tempest struck the beam it split in two and the remaining beams shattered from the pressure and the building then began to lean outward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUN!!!\" called Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe defenders scattered to either side of the square. Irzac's men advanced  but when they saw the cathedral they quickly ran back under the gates. The cathedral fell on the gates and a large dust cloud covered the square. Eric coughed then looked at the gate. A large pile of rubble was in front of the entrance. The pile almost touched the top of the city walls. It would take a team of men several days to clear the rubble. Eric was confident that Irzac's men won't be using this entrance anytime soon. At that moment a voice called out in Eric's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric!\" called Esmerda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother?\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Get back here now. Irzac's mages are blasting the gates. We can't ... hold them any longer.\" said Esmerda wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The main gates are about to fall!\" called Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and the others ran back to the main gates. Once they arrived at the gates they looked at the situation. The last remaining tower continued to release soldiers onto the walls. They didn't try to advance, instead they fortified the section and waited for reinforcements. Because of the confined space on the walls the defenders couldn't charge at them at the same time and were struggling to defeat the soldiers. The mages were exhausted and could barely stay on their feet. Tempest and Eric ran to the Esmerda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End the spell holding the gates, there's no use exhausting yourselves further on a spell that is going to fail anyway.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mages ended the spell Tempest looked at the siege tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't fight a battle to two fronts. Do you think you can destroy the tower?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmerda pointed her staff at the tower and fireball flew from the tip and into the siege tower. Once it made contact with the walls it exploded sending men and debris flying. The enemy soldiers close to the tower was knocked off their feet and the defenders took advantage and pressed their attack. Once the remaining enemy soldiers were defeated, Lord Silvermore sent the defenders to the courtyard before the gates, They just finished taking defensive positions when another blast struck the gate. The blast broke the wooden doors and Irzac's soldiers began to march into the city. Shouting war cries, the two armies charged at each other. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric dodged the blow from a enemy soldier before finishing him. He then took stock of the situation. The defenders were able to hold the gates at first but the numbers in Irzac's army began to push them back. Eventually they were driven out of the courtyard and into the city streets, where the defenders became scattered and disorganized. At the moment only Lord Silvermore, Tempest and a few city guard was with Eric. The rest of the officers and defenders was scattered all over the city. Eric worried about Princess Annabella's safety as she was in the most danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the fighting they all received wounds. Lord Silvermore had a cut above his right eye but the blow luckily missed his eye, He also had a stab wound in the side where a soldier stabbed him with a dagger. Eric was wounded in the shoulder where a soldier cut him with a axe, The soldier tried to strike him in the head but Eric saw the blow coming and deflected it with his sword and it struck his shoulder instead. Tempest had several stab wounds in his wings where soldiers with spears stabbed him and a crossbow bolt in his shoulder, He also had a cut on his back where a soldier slashed him with a sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ran through the streets they came across another group of defenders led by Captain Roland, busy fighting against a large group of Irzac's men. Eric and the others rushed to their aid and drove of the enemy soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the help, It's good to see a friendly face.\" said Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen any other defenders?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, You are the first.\" replied Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even Princess Annabella?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hoped she was with you.\" said Roland. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't defend the city like this. Tempest! Can you fly around the city and look for the other defenders? Tell them to meet us at the inner walls.\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try. But I'm not sure if I'll be able to with these tattered wings.\" replied Tempest<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest jumped into the air and flapped his wings to rise to a balcony of a two story house next to them. Once he grabbed the railings he leapt back and flapped twice to rise above the roofs of the houses in the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of them continued running through the streets toward the inner wall, assisting any defenders that they find along the way. A short while later they reached one of the gates leading into the inner city. Annabella's uncle and father was standing on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the situation?\" asked Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irzac's men have breached the walls. Our forces are scattered around the city, I've asked Tempest to tell them to regroup here.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Annabella?\" asked Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somewhere in the city, don't worry she was with the other mages the last time I saw her, they will protect her.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king nodded but he still seemed concerned. Eric stood close to the doors with his 'father', ready to close them if the sentries spots any of Irzac's men. Unlike the doors in the outer walls, these weren't reinforced so they wouldn't last long if they are attacked. A short while later the groups of defender began to rush into the courtyard. Robert arrived with a few wounded knights, the remaining city guard arrived with Hawkeyes. The last to arrive was princess Annabella and the remaining mages. Annabella was covered in blood and appeared dazed but Eric didn't see any wounds on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No, this isn't my blood.\" replied Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment a shadow passed over them and Tempest landed heavily on the ground beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The flying has aggravated the wounds on my wings. I won't be able to fly again until my wounds have healed.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are these men the only ones left?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're the only ones who can reach us. There are others, but they are trapped behind enemy lines and won't be able to get here safely. I told them to find someplace defensible and wait for the tide of battle to turn.\" answered Tempest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Lord Silvermore then closed the gates and waited for Irzac's men to arrive while Princess Annabella and the remaining mages  started healing the wounded. A short while later Eric heard marching in the streets and one of the sentries warned them that Irzac's army is approaching. A strong blast suddenly hits the doors, breaking them, and sending splinters flying. Out of the smoke emerges a single black armored knight. His army marches close behind but they keep their distance from the defenders. The knight walks to the center of the open ground between the armies and holds his arms out to either side as if challenging the defenders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, that's quite the welcome you gave me back there. Is that anyway to treat your former lover?\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begone fiend, you will get nothing more from me!\" replied Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? I don't think you realize that I've already won. You're defenses have fallen to me.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The defenses have fallen to 'YOU'. Ha, that's funny since you've been staring at the back-end of your army this entire time.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your tongue, abomination!\" said Irzac. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what? You'll sic your army on me? We all know your too much of a coward to fight your own battles.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of you would be able to best me!\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Then prove it. Prove that you're a man that can fight his own battles, not a hatchling that hides behind his mother.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!!! I will make you suffer for your words after this! If you are so eager to die by my sword then I shall grant your request. Which one of you would like the honor of being slain by my sword?\" said Irzac.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tempest walks forward into the center of the open ground and stands opposite of Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I accept your challenge, fiend!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy this.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sure of that.\" replied Tempest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then began circling each other, waiting for an opening in their opponent's defenses. As they circled each other Tempest stepped on a large piece of wood from the destroyed gate. It causes him to lose his balance for a split second, Irzac notices this and charges at him. As Irzac stabs at him Tempest knocks his sword out of his hand with his shield, then jabs his hammer into Irzac's belly, knocking the wind out of him and causing him to lean forward. Tempest then spins the hammer in his hands and hits Irzac under his chin, causing his to fly backwards and land on his back on the ground. Tempest advances towards Irzac and raises his hammer to strike at him, Irzac sees the blow coming and rolls away from it. The hammer hits the paving stone of the square and cracks the stone, before Tempest can strike again Irzac grabs his sword and stabs at Tempest's leg, hitting him just under his knee, Tempest hisses in pain and jumps back, pulling the sword out of his leg and Irzac uses the time to get back on his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric disliked having to watch another person duel. He wanted to help Tempest but his sense of honor wouldn't allow him to interrupt a duel and he didn't think that Tempest would have welcomed the help. Irzac's sorcerers didn't have honor though and tried to assist their master with spells or curses, but every time they tried Annabella and the other mages deflected or dispelled the magic. Eventually Irzac lost his patience and as Tempest rushes at him again, Irzac knocks him back with a blast of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, Irzac wants to play rough. Ok then.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hurricane force wind suddenly starts blowing from the mountains. The wind flies towards Tempest and starts circling around him, lifting him a few feet of the ground. Tempest then send the blast at Irzac, sending him flying backwards. Eric also feels a strange tingling sensation and the hair on the people around him starts standing on end. Lightning starts moving up Tempest's right arm towards his hammer. Once his hammer bursts into sparks, he leaps into the air and strikes at Irzac's shield, breaking it in two. Before Irzac can recover, Tempest kicks him in the chest, knocking off his feet and causing him to fall on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!! I WILL NOT BE BEATEN BY A HALF BREED!!!\" yelled Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blast of force strikes Tempest, knocking him back and forcing Eric to shield his eyes with his arm. When Eric lowers his arm, he sees that in Irzac's place stands a massive black and crimson dragon. This dragon was far larger than Eric in his dragon form, about as large as Silvermore. It lunged forward, hoping to catch it's opponent off guard but Tempest sees him coming and knocks his head back with a shield bash, then raises his hammer to strike it's head. Irzac pulls his head back and the hammer strikes the ground. Irzac raises his head and a rumbling sound came for his chest. Realizing the danger, Tempest raises his shield and a second later a large stream of fire flies from Irzac's mouth and hits Tempest. Irzac keeps the blast on him for a full minute before he closes his mouth and looks down at his opponent. Kneeling in the center of a blackened circle was Tempest. His shield was glowing red from the heat and his armor and scales was black with soot but he appeared unharmed, Tempest raised himself to his feet again and Irzac growled with annoyance when he saw his opponent was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite their differences in size and strength both combatants had trouble beating the other. Tempest's hammer was able to bypass Irzac's scales but Tempest had trouble reaching the vital areas like Irzac's head. Tempest's shield was able to take the hits from Irzac. There was deep scratches in the shield because of Irzac's claws but the shield held and where the force from the blow would break a human's arm, Tempest's arm was able to take the hit. But Eric could see that Tempest was getting weaker with each blow and Eric didn't know how long he would be able to continue before he made a fatal mistake. Irzac spat a fireball at Tempest, which he deflected with his shield but the attack was just a distraction. The moment the fireball struck the shield, Irzac lunged forward and closed his jaws on Tempest's shield. Tempest tried to keep his grip on the shield and struck at Irzac's neck but Irzac jumped back and pulled the shield out of Tempest's grip. Irzac then shook his head and tossed the shield across the courtyard, then crouched to pounce on Tempest. Tempest didn't wait for Irzac though, the moment Irzac's feet left the ground, Tempest rushed forward and rolled underneath Irzac. When Irzac landed, Tempest was close to his back legs, Tempest then jumped to the side and struck at Irzac's knee. Irzac shrieked in pain and fell on his side and the moment Tempest touched the ground again, he took a two handed grip on his hammer and jumped forward to deliver a deathblow to Irzac's head. Irzac flaps his wings as he struggles to get back on his feet and one of the wings hits Tempest in the chest, sending him flying backwards, the moment Tempest's feet touched the ground, he dug his claws into the ground to slow his backwards flight. Irzac got to his feet and flew into the air, he hovered above the courtyard giving everyone a venomous look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will suffer for the pain you have caused me and for denying me what is rightfully mine! YOU WILL ALL SUFFER!!!\" yelled Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned in the air and flew away from the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET HIM!!\" called one of Irzac's commanders. Irzac's entire army then rushed forward. Eric and the remaining defenders also charged, hoping to reach Tempest before he's overwhelmed. Tempest didn't seem concerned about the army rushing at him, he walked to his shield, picked it up, then turned to face the enemy army. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric lost count how many soldiers died by his sword that day. Without Irzac the defenders fought on with renewed hope while Irzac's army was demoralized and disorganized. Since Annabella and the other mages didn't have to worry about fortifying gates or deflecting missiles, They focused their power into offensive spells which caused chaos in Irzac's ranks. Overhead Hawkeyes and the other archers continued to rain arrows on the enemy. Later in the battle Eric heard a call of retreat. At first Eric was concerned as he believed that the defenders was overwhelmed, but then he saw that it was Irzac's men that was retreating. Beside him the other defenders raised their weapons above their heads and cheered when they saw their enemy retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can't believe it. We've won.</i>\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then raised his own sword and joined the defenders in their victory cheer.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He rises from bed and walks to the balcony connected to his room in the castle and looks out over the city. The city's reconstruction was progressing well, the rubble from the destroyed cathedral had been removed and the cathedral was being rebuilt. King Jerrod had the prisoners from the battle divided, the ones that were forced to work for Irzac was put to work repairing the damage to the city while the ones who joined him willingly was either imprisoned or executed. They had to keep the working prisoners under constant guard as Irzac still held their families hostage and they tried to escape every chance they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the battle the king payed Tempest his fee and offered him a extended contract but Tempest turned it down, saying that he already had something else planned but that he might return in a few weeks. The others thought that he had another contract but Eric and Lord Silvermore knew that he actually returned to the Dragon Council to deliver a report about Irzac's actions. The elven king also sent a druid to sign a alliance between their two races. Hawkeyes was appointed the elven representative and the king sent a few rangers to assist the human soldiers. The elves' knowledge of the wild allowed them to outmaneuver the enemy soldiers. The main elven army fought independently and continued to harass Irzac's forces. Irzac's army retreated into the countryside where they raided the weaker areas to sustain themselves. They stayed in the area for the first week, then retreated back to Irzac's fortress and Firamore. The royal family was concerned that they were rallying for another attack but the attack never came. The royal family sent out spies to find where Irzac went after the battle but they were unable to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince things were calming down the people returned to their homes, villages and farms. Eric and Lord Silvermore was given separate rooms in the castle. Esmerda left the city and flew to the mountains behind the city where she could watch over the city but still keep her children safe. They were careful since the dragon slayers always had a big presence in Sanctuary. Lord Silvermore officially began Eric's training. During the day Lord Silvermore would train Eric in physical combat and during the evening Eric would fly to his 'mother' and she would teach him magic and dragon-lore. Lord Silvermore also taught Eric how to fight better in dragon form. On those days Lord Silvermore would teach him the entire day since they had to travel far to avoid detection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Annabella also trained with Eric. They learned how to combine their strengths and Esmerda would teach Princess Annabella more magic. When Eric trained his dragon form, Princess Annabella would ride with him as Lord Silvermore said that she had to grow accustomed to fighting from his back and Eric had to get used to a rider so that he didn't throw her off his back with a complicated maneuver. A week ago, their spies reported that a large force of Irzac's soldiers left the fortress but the spies were unable to find out where they went. Not even the elves were able to find their trail. King Jerrod had watchtowers built around his borders and made a complicated signaling system so that the watchtowers could report if they saw the enemy. King Jerrod only put his most loyal men at the watchtowers and made sure that only they knew the signals as they were concerned that Irzac's spies could send false signals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Eric would already have started his training for the day but Lord Silvermore decided to give him the day off. Captain Roland offered to show Eric and Princess Annabella the wonders of the city as neither of them had been to Sanctuary before and they didn't have the time to do so before. Someone suddenly knocks on the door of Eric's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter!\" called Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Roland opened the door and stepped into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Roland? I'm not late for our outing am I?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I'm afraid we'll have to cancel our plans. King Jerrod has called an emergency council.\" replied Roland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked to the throne room Eric wondered what it could be about. Did they find Irzac's troops? Or was there something worse? As they walked into the throne room Eric saw that the entire royal family, their chief advisors, Hawkeyes and Lord Silvermore was already there waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric! I hope you slept well.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. thank you your majesty.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad. I'm sorry that I'm disrupting your plans for the day but I've received some troubling news.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did he say why he wanted to see you?\" asked Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it has to be about Irzac. I only hope he isn't here to punish us for the battle.\" replied King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punish us? but we only defended ourselves.\" said Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who know what lies Irzac has told them. I only hope this enforcer is willing to listen to reason.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he isn't, then we will 'take care' of him.\" said Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be foolish, Every king signs a agreement that if someone refuses punishment then the enforcers can conscript their aid to destroy the criminal and the city if need be. If we harm him then all the kings and dragons will turn against us. If there is a punishment then we must hope it isn't too high.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then waited for the enforcer to arrive. When he did arrive everyone except Eric and Lord Silvermore was shocked when they saw that the enforcer was actually Tempest. He wore the same armor and weapons from before but Eric saw that his shield and breastplate was modified with a crest. The crest had a human knight kneeling on the ground, his sword was planted edge first into the ground and his head was bowed. Opposite him was a dragon with his head almost on the ground, his front half was lowered in a draconic version of a bow. In the background behind the two figures was a single draconic eye watching over them. Eric suspected that this was the crest of the enforcers. Tempest walked to the throne and lowered his head, but didn't bow as people did in front of a king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest! Well met again. It sounds like you've been promoted since we last spoke, Congratulations.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I deceived you before. I've always been a enforcer.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Would you mind telling me why the deception was necessary?\" asked King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I needed to catch Irzac breaking the rules. If I told you what I was, then Irzac might have learned of it from his spies.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why reveal yourself now though?\" asked King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I bring a official message from the dragon council.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Irzac? Will he be punished for his actions?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly no, He has found a loophole. If he was acting independently then he would have been punished for breaking the peace treaty. But he is also a warlord and as a warlord he has the right to declare war on a rival.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the council will do nothing.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that. The High dragon lord understands his reasoning but he also said that it will cause difficulty for all dragons. So if he is going to use that excuse then he must remain a warlord. He is forbidden from taking dragon form unless attacked by another dragon. So at least he can't incinerate your entire army the next time you confront him.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of my kingdom? Will it be returned to me?\" asked Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a dispute between you and Irzac. The council will not get involved.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a improvement. But not as good as we hoped.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more. The dragon clans living in the area are concerned that the dragon slayers will punish them for Irzac's actions, so I've been assigned to the area to give them peace of mind and to insure that doesn't happen.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then. Is there anything else?\" asked King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one. You've been wondering where Irzac's army has disappeared to?\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, do you know where they are?\" asked King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. They have besieged Arcania.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric had heard of Arcania. The country was about 70% Jungle with the remaining part a desert. Most cities built in such uninhabitable areas would be small and poor but Arcania was one of the most prosperous cities in the kingdoms because of two reasons. One was the high skill of their wizards and learning from the Arcanian academy was the greatest honor a future wizard could hope for. As a result it was extremely expensive to enroll in the academy. The second was that the city was built upon the ruins of another great civilization. Very little is known about this civilization but their technology and magical knowledge was greater than anyone else. The Arcanians continue to study these ruins and have learn more about magic and craftsmanship than anyone else because of it. Artifacts made it Arcania is then sold to other kingdoms for a high price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has led to great rivalry between the Arcanians and the Dragon-kin and nowhere else are Dragon-kin more unwelcome than in Arcania. This civilization used a old dialect of draconic in their writing and the walls of these ruins are full of dragon sculptures and the crypts of the ruins are full of skeletons that resemble Dragon-kin. As a result the Dragon-kin believes that these people had strong ties to dragons and that the first dragon-kin was created there. As a result the Dragon-kin believe that the knowledge in these ruins belong to dragons and their descendants and that the Arcanians were stealing their inheritance. Several dragon-kin tribes lived in the Arcanian jungles and went to extreme lengths to protect the outlying ruins from raiders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arcania? Why would they attack there?\" asked Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you dealt him a stinging defeat when he last attacked here. He'll want to build up his strength again. Arcania has the best mages in the world, if he enslaves them, then they can do a lot of damage and the Arcanians also has the most powerful relics in the world stored in their vaults.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There won't be a better chance than now to retake Firamore.\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With all due respect, your majesty, You're throne can wait. The Arcanians don't have that luxury.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't about my throne! But the suffering of my people! If we can free their families then Irzac will lose his hold on them.\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irzac has planned for that possibility. If his people tell him that Firamore has fallen then he will withhold that information until the siege of Arcania has ended, then execute the surviving conscripted as they will be of no further use to him. This will make the families angry at you and could cause public order problems. If you want to save your people then we'll have to strike at both places at once. Irzac knows you don't have the forces to do that.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what do we do?\" asked Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During the dragon war, The ruins which Arcania is built on was ruled by a dragon lord. This dragon lord was quite paranoid and had a escape route built by his slaves that leads right from the vaults of the castle to the bottom of the cliffs behind it. We enforcers know of the route and how to get through. I can lead a small team through the route and then wait at the other side for your signal. On top of the castle is a large scrying mirror that the Arcanians use to broadcast events. Once you capture Firamore we can take control of the mirror and use it to send a message to Irzac's forces. This will cause them to revolt right there and it might give the Arcanians the edge they need to break the siege.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"During the revolt, many people will be killed.\" said King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt, but if we wait until after the battle, They will all be killed.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the Arcanians? Those conscripted men are their enemies. They may imprison or kill then afterwards.\" asked King Jerrod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why a member of the royal family should come with me. So that they can negotiate with the Arcanians afterwards.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither me nor my brother will be able to go, as we have to lead the army and its too dangerous to send my wife with you.\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will go.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too dangerous, daughter.\" said her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle myself. I thought I already proved that during the siege.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with them too. I'm good at stealth, so I might be able to help.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll march with the army.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Sir Eric?\" asked Annabella's father.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While Eric, Annabella, Hawkeyes and Tempest left to get supplies for the journey. When they were away from the other people they discussed how they would reach Arcania. They would leave the city on horseback as if they were going to ride to Arcania but when they were far enough from the city, Eric would take dragon form and he will carry Annabella and Hawkeyes while Tempest will fly beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey gathered the supplies and left the city shortly thereafter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour's riding Tempest told them to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's far enough, we'll strap the supplies to Eric, then we can set off.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the others packed the supplies Eric wondered what he was going to do with his spear. He wanted to bring it with him but hadn't considered how he was going transport it. He couldn't wield it while in dragon form and he can't carry it in his mouth the entire trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess? can you please carry my spear for me? I won't be able to while in dragon form and that way you can protect yourself if your magic fails you.\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" replied Annabella and took the spear from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she moved further away Eric turned to dragon form and the others tied the bags to his back with rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If secrecy wasn't necessary I would have suggested that you use a saddle, Eric. But it would have been difficult to explain to the others what the gigantic saddle was for. I only hope the supplies doesn't fall off. we'll have to check regularly.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkeyes tied a message to a hawk that he brought with him and sent it flying to the elven realms. Annabella and Hawkeyes then climbed on Eric's back and Eric raised his wings and took flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawkeyes! Loosen your grip, your crushing me.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm not used to this.\" replied Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what the spikes are for.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest! can you tell us what the political situation is in Arcania? Can we expect any trouble from the Dragon-kin Tribes?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on which tribe we run into. Some will attack on sight and try to rob us after we're dead, others will at least give us the chance to hand over our valuables, if we refuse then they'll kill us and take it anyway.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the friendliest bunch are they? at least you're with us, hopefully you can talk them down.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer we avoid them completely.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? aren't you happy to return to your homeland and your people?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I would have been happy never to return.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you want that? I don't understand.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't always an enforcer. When I was younger I ... did some thing I'm not proud of ...

As a result they had already reached the Arcanian jungles close to the end of the day. Even though Eric was used to flying and was very fit, he never flew so far with such a heavy load so when the sun was beginning to set he was completely exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric! We should land and let you rest for the night.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not eager to land in another forested area. The last time I did that it didn't go so well.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the one where you made friends with the elves and saved Sanctuary?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose when you say it like that, it doesn't sound so bad.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a village not far from here. It isn't large and it's more of a glorified logging camp but it is prosperous, we can rest there until morning.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you expecting me to land right in the middle of the village looking like this?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Land on the road and we'll remove the supplies from your back. If we all help we should be able to carry it all to the village.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't run into any trees before we get there.\" said Hawkeyes. Annabella burst out laughing after that which caused Eric to growl with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mock me again and you can walk the rest of the way to Arcania, Hawkeyes.\" said Eric. Once they landed and removed the supplies Eric turned back to human form and picked up his portion of the load. Half and hour later they saw the village, as Tempest had said, it was quite small with only a few houses, a warehouse, a sawmill and a inn. As they walked deeper into the village they didn't see a single person in the village. there was also no light shining in any of the buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said it was prosperous.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was. Something is wrong here. take a look around but be careful, I don't like this at all.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey split up and began to check the houses for people. Eric stopped in front of a house and called out for someone. When no one answered he carefully opened the door and stepped into the house. The inside looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks and was full of dust and spiderwebs. The dining table had plates of food that had long been spoiled on it as if someone had prepared the household dinner and had been interrupted before they could start. A large streak of dried blood covered the floor but Eric didn't see a body anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is very strange.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued to explore the house but didn't find anyone in the house. The door to the bedroom was broken down and Eric saw a large pool of dried blood on the floor of the room. After a while Eric left the house and met the others in the center of the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a single person living or dead. But there appears to be signs of a struggle.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could Irzac's men be behind this?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but I doubt it. They would have stolen anything useful but nothing has been touched.\" said Tempest.</span></div></div>",

The skeleton swung his club at Eric but it moved so sluggishly Eric easily dodged the blow, then knocked it's head off with his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was easier that I thought it would be.\" said Eric as he turned back to the Princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ERIC! behind you!\" called Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned around to see the now headless skeleton swing his club at him again. Eric jumped back to avoid the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the ... !!!\" yelled Eric. Even as he spoke he saw the skull fly through the air and reconnect with it's body. It raised it's head and let loose a long shriek. Eric heard a moan and saw more of the 'things' stagger into the square from all directions. Hawkeyes fired a arrow at one of them, knocking it's head off but it continued to advance towards them. Realizing that his bow is useless against them he put it away and drew his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cover me!\" called Annabella and began to mutter a spell. The others quickly joined Eric and formed a triangle around Annabella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest struck one of the skeletons with his hammer causing the entire thing to fall apart but as Tempest turned to face his next enemy Eric saw the bones slowly beginning to reattach to each other. As the first skeleton struck at Eric with his club again, he cut upward with his sword and severed it's arm. It didn't stop it though as it grabbed Eric by the throat with it's other hand and began to strangle him. Eric tried to free himself from it's grip but it was stronger than he thought so he slashed at it's spine causing the thing to fall to the ground. Eric then raised a foot and stomped on it's head, breaking the skull into small pieces  Eric knew that it would reassemble itself but that it would take some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! What ever you're doing. Hurry! We can't hold out much longer!\" yelled Eric. Eric just finished yelling when a force of bright light flew from Annabella and passed through her companions. When it struck the skeletons though they began to fall apart. Annabella started getting faint  and would have fallen to the ground if Eric didn't catch her. He eyes the bodies suspiciously, fearful that they would begin reassembling again but they remained still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can let me go now, Eric. I just needed a moment. That spell took a lot of power.\" said Annabella. Eric released her and she rose up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were those things?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Undead. I've heard of them but never actually saw one before.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can such an unnatural thing exist?\" asked Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are created with one of two ways. The first one is if someone did something truly evil, then he's soul can be cursed to never find rest. The second method is for a necromancer to force a dead body back to life and bind it to his will.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought necromancy was wiped out decades ago?\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly no. Several large cults do still exist in the more isolated lands.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why destroy and raise this village though?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they were testing their knowledge, maybe they were feeling malicious or maybe it was a trap for anyone who came to Arcania's aid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they're working with Irzac?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if they were.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd rather not rest here. Who knows what else might be lurking in the area.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree, I'll carry the supplies until we find a safer place to make camp.\" replied Eric. Eric then turned back into dragon form and once the supplies were secured they left the cursed village and traveled deeper into the jungle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric was currently sitting near the campfire struggling to stay awake. After they left the village they wander into the jungle for a few miles until they were sure they were far enough from the cursed town. Annabella placed wards around the camp so that they will be warned if any undead wandered into the area. Once the camp was secure they removed the supplies from Eric's back so that he could take human form and rest comfortably. Despite being tired from the day's events Eric struggled to relax. He just started falling asleep when a spear flew over his head and struck a tree at the edge of camp. They jumped to their feet and was just about to reach for their weapons when a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you!\" said the man. Eric slowly turned towards the voice and saw several red scaled dragon-kin standing at the edge of camp. They wore no clothing at all except for a leather loincloth and a few bone trinkets around their necks or on their wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That isn't important. What is important is that you are trespassing on my tribe's territory without paying tribute.\" said the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that anyway to treat a long lost cousin?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You smell like the outsiders. don't expect us to treat you any better 'cousin'.\" replied the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a enforcer and you WILL leave us be!\" threatened Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do nothing of the sort. The enforcers have no authority here. You look familiar. Have we met before?\" asked the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What tribe are you outsider?\" asked the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no tribe.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every dragon-kin has a tribe, even the enforcers. If you don't tell me then I'll have ... Wait ... It can't be.\" said the leader. He came closer and inspected Tempest's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draukir? Draukir Stormlord?\" asked the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid your mistaking me for someone else.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no mistake. Did you really think my tribe would forget what you did? I have to admit I thought you died on that mountain with the others of your tribe. I thought my chief was paranoid when he put a bounty on a dead man's head and yet here you are alive and well. You embarrassed me on that mountain. It would have been better for you if you finished me off that day.\" said the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not a mistake I'll make again. You know how dangerous I am. Let us go and forget you ever saw me and I won't have to kill you.\" threatened Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that. My chief agreed to name the person who found you his heir.\" replied the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about us? We found him as well!\" called one of the other dragon-kin. As the leader turned to the dragon-kin, Tempest grabbed the leader's head and twisted it, breaking his neck. The other dragon-kin cried out in alarm and tried to jab Tempest with their spears but he blocked the one with his shield and broke the other with his hammer. Eric drew his sword and attacked as they were closing in on Tempest. In a few moment they killed all but one of the dragon-kin. Annabella tried to hit him with a spell but he dodged it, then gave her a backhand blow to the face which caused her to fall to the ground. As he raised his spear to impale her Eric stabbed him through the back.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about!\" yelled Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some old enemies.\" answered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you have to say for yourself! You almost got the princess killed!\" yelled Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, I'm all right. You can relax.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, I'm sorry but I can't change what happened. I know you want answers but I don't feel comfortable talking about it. Please understand that.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you better not have anymore old enemies around!\" said Eric. They took the bodies away from camp and Annabella incinerated them before they returned to camp and tried to get some rest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next two days went without incident so Eric was able to recover from the flight. Despite his best efforts Eric was unable to find out more from Tempest about his past. At noon on the second day Eric saw Arcania. It was built on a flat part of a mountain. A large blue dome of magic surrounded the city so Eric was unable to see more of the city. The dome blocked any projectiles fired at the city but Eric saw that cracks was beginning to appear in the dome so Eric realized that it won't be able to hold much longer. Eric also saw Irzac's army and was shocked when he saw how many he still had. The only reason Arcania hadn't fallen yet was because the dome stopped anyone from entering the city. Eric quickly dropped to the ground before anyone could see him and landed on a tall hill from which they could study the siege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that dome isn't covering the secret entrance.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't. I can see where the entrance is supposed to be hidden.\" said Tempest. He pointed to the base of the mountain to the right of the city. They then removed the last of the supplies from Eric so that he can take human form again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest then removed a mirror from his bags and after muttering a incantation Annabella's father appeared in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, we have arrived at Arcania. Have you captured Firamore yet?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The walls have been breached and the hostages secured but there are still small pockets of Irzac's men fighting. We should have complete control once you reach the mirror.\" replied the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll contact you when we reach the mirror.\" said Tempest. He then ended the spell and the king disappeared again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hawkeyes, stay here and watch the supplies. We'll start moving towards the secret entrance. If the barrier breaks report it to us.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\" asked Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use this.\" said Tempest. He handed a polished stone to Hawkeyes which had a strange symbol carved into it's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a broadcast stone. Press the symbol on it's face then speak to the stone. We'll be able to hear from our side.\" said Tempest. He held up an identical stone before returning it to his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHawkeyes nodded his head while the others began to carefully walk towards the side of the mountain. They stayed close to the trees to keep them from being seen. A short while later they arrived at the base of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look for a stone with a dragon symbol carved into it.\" said Tempest. They split up and a few minutes later Eric found the stone that Tempest described. He pressed the stone and a rock wall moved sideways revealing a cave entrance. \"The cave will be filled with traps so be careful where you step.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they're not working anymore.\" said Eric. As he said that he stepped forward and felt the ground sink under him. Tempest grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back and a spear struck the wall where Eric was standing a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're still working.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey carefully went through the different trap rooms. The first one had tiles with draconic symbols on the floor. Tempest warned them to only step on the tiles with the symbol for 'knowledge' on it. The second one relied on a dragon's sight as the floor was fragile in several places but a complicated path of solid tiles led to the doors. To a normal person the tiles looked identical but a dragon could clearly see which were fragile and which were not. If someone stepped on the wrong one the floor would break and they would fall into a pit of spikes. After they were finished with the second one Tempest told them that it was the last one but as they advanced they came across a arch with glowing symbols on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. This wasn't in the records.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it say?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only by besting your fear may you pass.\" said Tempest. He carefully waved his hand past the arch but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hmm, maybe it's a trick.\" said Tempest. They passed under the arch and entered the room. Torches were placed along the wall and Eric saw large doors at the other side of the room. Eric was shocked when he saw a dragon that looks exactly like him step out of the shadows and stop a few feet in front of him. While across from Annabella a middle aged version of Annabella appeared. She had a black dress with a long black staff in her hand with a jagged crown on her head. In front of Tempest appeared a larger blue scaled dragon-kin with a sword in each hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draakesh?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello son. You didn't think you could bury me away forever did you?\" said the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am queen Annabella and you will all bow to me or I will destroy you.\" said her double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think these are illusions of whatever we fear the most.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should fight each other's fears then so that they have no power over us.\" suggested Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! we know our own fears. we might need that knowledge to beat them.\" called Annabella.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you really think you can best me in that pitiful form.\" said his double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've bested many dragons before. You will be no different.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your unappreciative of mother's gifts. You were prey once but she gave you the chance to be one of the dominant species.\" said the double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no gift but a curse.\" replied Eric.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you resist me? You know you will become like me eventually. Set down your sword and embrace me. You'll enjoy mother's gifts then. I promise.\" said his double.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NEVER!!!\" yelled Eric and charged at the dragon. Eric slashed at the dragon's foreleg but it reared up and Eric missed. Eric rolled away just in time before the dragon slammed his legs down into the ground where Eric had been standing. Eric jumped forward and cut at it's legs but his sword was unable to cut through the dragon's scales. Whatever this thing was it's scales was far harder that any dragon Eric had ever fought before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never beat me! Because unlike you, I'm not afraid of using mother's gifts.\" said the double. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to use my knowledge of a dragon's weakness if I'm to best this thing.\" thought Eric. He knew that the scales at the inner part of it's front legs was weaker that the outward facing part and that a single strike to the back of it's head, close to it's neck would pierce it's skull and kill it. As the dragon prepared to jump at Eric again. Eric rushed between it's legs and stabbed at the back part of it's right foreleg. The blow should have penetrated the scales but the moment his sword connected his arm bounced back as if he tried to stab through a stone wall. The dragon then reared up and Eric heard it inhale before a fireball exploded next to him, sending him flying. Eric rolled on the ground before he rose to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was supposed to hurt it.\" thought Eric. Suddenly Eric recalled what his double said about 'his mother's gifts'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'm supposed to fight it in dragon form.\" thought Eric. Eric then stabbed his sword into the ground and with explosive force turned into his dragon form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh. The weakling figured it out. But I'm afraid it's too late for that now.\" said his double. It tackled Eric and the two began rolling on the floor each trying to get on top and get a grip on the other's neck. Eric hoped that the others were far enough from them otherwise they might soon be crushed.  His double clawed Eric in the face leaving him with three scars close to his right eye. The double tried to claw him again but Eric dodged it then slapped his double through the face with his tail. Eric then closed his jaws around it's neck before it could recover. It roared it pain and thrashed trying to break free but Eric bit down harder then twisted it's neck until it broke. Eric released his opponent and it fell to the ground dead. The body then began to fade until it disappeared completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then thought to check how the others were doing. At that moment Annabella fired a blast of magic at the queen but it missed by miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Is that the best you can do?\" mocked the queen. What the queen didn't see though was that the blast turned around and was racing back towards her from behind. It hit her in the back and knocked her forward. The queen flailed her arms to regain her balance. Once she was within reach Annabella grabbed the queen and stabbed her under the chin with Eric's spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest seemed to be struggling though. He was bleeding from several wounds while his opponent was unharmed. Eric also saw that Tempest appeared to be holding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraakesh swung his sword at Tempest but he manages to ducks under the blow. Draakesh then kicks Tempest in the face before he could recover which caused him to flail backwards trying to regain his balance, Draakesh then strikes Tempest's hammer which knocks his arm to the side before delivering a second strike which broke Tempest's hammer apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to help him!\" thought Eric. He rushed forward and prepared to pounce on Draakesh but when he was a few feet away Eric suddenly ran into a magic barrier which knocked him back. Eric skid to a stop before shaking his head to clear his vision. Eric swung a paw at the barrier but he might as well have tried to break down a mountain with nothing but his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess!! Help me get this barrier down!!\" called Eric. Annabella joined Eric and begun throwing spells at the barrier but nothing was able to get through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric watched as Tempest tried to claw his opponent but he dodged it then struck Tempest with the pommel of his sword in the chest. As Tempest was knocked backwards Draakesh gave a roundhouse kick to his shield which knocked it out of his hand before he stabbed Tempest in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TEMPEST!!!\" called Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as weak as I remembered!\" said Draakesh. He then kicks Tempest back. Tempest rolls once before he lands on his feet again while placing his left hand on his wound to stop the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I ever considered you a worthy heir. Time to join the rest of your tribe, son.\" said Draakesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest seemed to snap at that moment. He rose to his full height then roared with rage and a large sword appeared in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is THAT?\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think you can wield that, welp?\" said Draakesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraakesh then charged at him and swung his sword but Tempest bent backwards under the blade. He then swept Draakesh's feet out from under him with his sword causing his opponent to fall on his back. Draakesh rolled to the side then quickly got to his feet. Tempest charged at him and Draakesh crossed his swords to block a blow but Tempest gave a uppercut with the sword which knocked both of Draakesh's weapons into the air. Tempest then slashed him three times before stabbing him right through the chest. As Tempest began to withdraw the sword Draakesh grabbed the blade of the sword to keep him from pulling it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's ... the son I knew ... and loved.\" said Draakesh. Tempest then tore the sword out of his opponent's body before he faded to nothing. With his opponent dead the barrier surrounding them disappeared and Eric and Annabella rushed to his side. With his battle rage subsiding Tempest gave the sword a remorseful look before he made it disappear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. My armor stopped the worst of it.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll heal it for you.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Save your strength. We might need it later.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you summon that sword and what...\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not now! I know you must have a lot of questions but I'll answer them later.\" interrupted Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hold you to that promise.\" replied Eric<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then rushed to the doors that led into the city.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric carefully opened the doors and was amazed at what he saw. Before him was a room filled with all manner of treasures. Numerous golden statues were in the room, gems the size of his head glowed in chests filled with gold and numerous magic artifacts. Eric knew more than a few dragons would be green with envy if they saw the wealth in the room. Tempest took a quick look through the room before he spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go check the doors for guards. I'll join you shortly.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the others ran ahead Tempest quickly grabbed a black tome from the treasure hold and hid it in his bags before the others could see what he did. He then placed an identical black tome in its place then ran to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks clear!\" said Eric after he peeked through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This way!\" said Tempest. He led them to a staircase and they began to climb. When they reached the top they ran through a archway and found themselves at the top of the castle on a large balcony. Behind them the scrying mirror was mounted high on the wall and before them by the railings was a middle aged man in white robes overlooking the city. Eric also saw that the cracks in the magic barrier had gotten bigger and Eric didn't think the cities defenses would last much longer. Tempest then began to advance on the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me sir, could you please ... \" began Tempest. The moment the man turned around to face him Tempest kicked him between the legs before knocking him out with a blow to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that really necessary?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but it was fun though.\" replied Tempest. At that moment a boulder from one of Irzac's catapults hit the barrier, causing it to shatter before the boulder continued on and fell somewhere in the city. Once the barrier broke Eric heard a cheer from Irzac's army before the siege towers began to move forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to hurry!\" said Tempest. He ran to the mirror and muttered the same spell as before and the king again appeared in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mirror is ours! Broadcast your message, your majesty!\" called Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PEOPLE OF FIRAMORE!!!\" called the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fighting stopped for an instant as everyone focused on the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I stand before you to tell you your oppression has ended. Firamore has been liberated and your families are free. Throw down your shackles and destroy your oppressors. FOR FIRAMORE!!!!\" called the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of complete silence on the battlefield before chaos broke out as Irzac's began fighting each other. The Arcanians however were still uncertain and resumed attacking both sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess! You need to talk the Arcanians down or they'll kill everyone. Eric! come with me. We need to save as many as we can.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest! use this!\" said Annabella. She threw Eric's spear to him and Tempest caught it out of the air. Tempest and Eric then ran to the railings and jumped over it and fell to the ground. When they were close to the ground Tempest opened his wings to reduce his speed while Eric cast a spell to do the same. Once they landed they ran as fast as they could to the walls. Tempest reached the walls first and rushed up the stairs leading to the top. Once he reached the top he pushed a startled Arcanian out of the way before he jumped off the walls and landed outside the city. Eric followed him a few seconds later. Since they were uncertain who was fighting for Irzac and who was fighting against him they avoided getting between the common soldiers but instead focused on fighting Irzac's remaining officers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric dispatched the enemy in front of him then saw Irzac standing on a hill still shouting orders to his soldiers. Irzac then looked down and a look of anger appeared on his face when he saw Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You again!! I'll make you pay for undermining my plans!!\" yelled Irzac. He took a step towards Eric but a soldier ran up to him shouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! Sir! Our forces are in disarray! We must retreat or we'll be captured!\" said the soldier. Irzac seemed to hesitate, torn between retribution and self-preservation. In the end self-preservation won out and Irzac reluctantly called a retreat. Before he left he gave one last venomous look at Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have won this battle but I will be back! I swear it!\" said Irzac before he turned around and skulked away into the jungle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric currently sat close to the campfire trying to get warm. They spent most of the day arguing with the ruler of Arcania. Despite the fact that Irzac had conscripted the soldiers into his army the Arcanians still wanted to punish them for their crimes. Negotiations was especially difficult when they discovered that the middle aged man Tempest knocked out was in fact the ruler of Arcania. After a long time an agreement was reached. The conscripted would all be released but Firamore would compensate Arcania for the damage their people caused to the kingdom. Once the agreement was reached Annabella contacted her father to arrange safe transport for their people. Her father sent a battalion to Arcania to escort the people safely back to their homes. Her father also let her know that he's about to take the army and march on Irzac's stronghold to wipe him out once and for all. Tempest convinced him to wait a few days for them to return as he was afraid that if they pushed him in a corner like that then he might ignore the high dragon lord's command and attack their army as a dragon. Tempest suspected that Irzac would wait until he's further away from Arcania, then take dragon form and fly back to his stronghold as fast as he can, leaving his army to find it's own way back. They planned to travel day and night to reach the army in time but Annabella insisted that they rest tonight as everyone except Hawkeyes was tired from the day's events. They built a small camp and Hawkeyes went hunting as everyone was tired to old provisions and wanted something fresh. Half and hour later he returned with a young buck and while the meat was cooking they told him what happened in the caves under Arcania.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a nasty experience. I'm glad I missed it.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was. But it was also quite enlightening.\" replied Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest was clearly still troubled by what he saw in the caves. He just stared at the flames and didn't say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest, I know you don't want to talk about your past but it's clearly still troubling you. Maybe you'll feel better once you talk about it.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't stop asking until I tell you, will you? I suppose you've earned the right . Do you know the origins of the dragon-kin race?\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Shadow-stalker created your race to fight humans.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you only know part of it. It is true that he created the first dragon-kin but he wasn't the only dragon to succeed. There were six powerful dragons with complete mastery over the elements: Fire, water, air, earth, light and darkness. when Shadow-stalker created the dragon-kin the others grew jealous and created dragon-kin in their own image. The first one of each bloodline was given a weapon that gave them power over their master's element. To keep others from using the weapons against them they locked it's inner powers away so that only a descendant of their bloodline could unlock it. To anyone else it's just a normal weapon. Because the dragon lords placed so much of their essence into the weapons, they gained a will of their own and since the dragon lords weren't the nicest dragons around, the weapons corrupted the ones who unlocked their full power.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the war the original bloodlines began to fade as the dragon-kin began intermingling with each other until all but one of the bloodlines were wiped out. As you may have figured out by now my real name is Draukir of the stormlord tribe and my tribe could trace our line back to one of the founders. My father was Draakesh, the chief of the tribe and he was once a good man that wanted to reunite the tribes and stop our infighting. When a dragon-kin comes of age he must leave his village and not return until he has made a name for himself or until he brought back something valuable to the tribe. Since I was his only son he put a great deal of pressure on me to excel during this rite. Only the strongest of the tribe is chosen to lead so I had no guarantee that they would choose me to lead when my father died or retired. I made my why to a Arcanian tavern to rest and consider what to do when I overheard a scholar bragging about finding the secrets of the Stormlords. He was trying to hire guards for an expedition to some ruins. I figured that if I brought back something of our history to the tribe then it would prove my worth to them. So I waited until he left then found him and 'persuaded' him to part with the information. After some difficulty I reached the vault which was protected by a blood seal that only a Stormlord could open. I broke the seal and found the sword you saw me wield hidden there and returned it to my tribe. My father was amazed at the gift and told me it's called ' The Eye of the Hurricane ' and that it was wielded by the first Stormlord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father took the sword for himself and announced that he was going to unite all tribes under Stormlord rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that when the sword corrupted him?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, The corruption started slowly. At first he gained allies through diplomacy but as he went on his methods became more extreme until his plans started including blackmail, threats, kidnapping and conquest. At first I was eager to help him and earned the nickname ' herald of the storm ' from our enemies but as time went on I began to lose faith in him. When I discovered that he planned to use the sword's power to turn all dragon-kin into Stormlords and bind them to his will with the same spell the dragon lords used to control us during the war I decided that he had gone to far. I went to the mountain where he gathered our tribe and argued with him. Eventually he grew so angry he banished me from his sight. I left the mountain and planned to get as far away from that mess as a could when I realized that I caused all that and that it was my responsibility to fix so I returned to the mountain to stop the ritual at any cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy father anticipated opposition so he had his loyalist tribes place their greatest champions at the site to keep anyone from intervening while he and my tribe cast the ritual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they help him if he planned to enslave them?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because he deceived them. He told them the ritual would turn them to their original founder status and that they would rule the others of the same bloodline alongside my father.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter battling my way past the guards I confronted my father at the summit. He told me he was disappointed with how weak I've become and that I was willing to work against my own tribe. We fought and when the battle started to turn against him he pleaded with me to stop. He told me that if the ritual is interrupted then the backlash would kill my tribe since they were connected to the ritual as well. I told him there was no other way and ran him through which killed my tribe as well. After retrieving the sword I took it back to the ruins where I found it. I planned to lock it back in the vault before killing myself so that someone can't use my blood to retrieve the sword again when your father stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Silvermore was there?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, News of my father's madness had spread and he intended to stop him. Lord Silvermore told me there might be another way to hide the sword and took me to your mother. She told me that the sword bound itself to me the same way your sword is bound to your body. She taught me how to lock it inside me. She believed that it's influence would be greatly weakened while hidden like that but to be certain she cast wards on me to protect me from any dark thoughts that might slip through. After that your father introduced me to the High dragon lord and told him my story. He agreed to take me into the enforcers and conceal my identity from the others to protect me.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did the right thing.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why does this still bother you?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that entire mess was my fault!! If I didn't bring the sword back or if I saw what it was doing to my father sooner then none of that would have happened!!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had no way of knowing what it would have done.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't make it right though. Look I know your trying to make me feel better but can we please change the subject.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know what you mean.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you put something in your bags and although I couldn't see what it was I know what I saw.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh that! Would you believe it was just a few gold and jewel trinkets? You know how much dragons like shiny things.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually since becoming a dragon I've learned that it's not the case. Although dragons like beauty they aren't nearly as greedy as the knights and priests let people know.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kid! I think that's the first time I heard you say something positive about dragons.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't expect it to become a habit though.\" said Eric. Since becoming a dragon Eric had learned that many of the old stories were completely false or exaggerated. There were exceptions but most dragons were more like people than the devils and beasts that the stories made them appear. Even with that revelation Eric was reluctant to give up his hatred as it gave him strength and purpose when he previously had none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric, I know we haven't had the most open cooperation but you must trust me. I keep my secrets for a reason. Knowledge can be very dangerous.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps but ignorance can be just as dangerous if not more.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not going to drop this?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I see no reason to keep up the deception.\" said Tempest. He dug through his bags before he pulled out a black leather tome and placed it in front of him. The book had a picture of a bull's skull engraved on the cover. There was also writing on the cover in a language that Eric didn't recognize.  Annabella gasped when she saw the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think you were a bookworm.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's no normal book, Eric.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the spell book of the first necromancer.\" answered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you take something so dangerous? What are you planning?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the reason Irzac invaded Arcania.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think its time you tell us the full story.\" said Hawkeyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few months ago I was tracking necromancer activity when I heard that their leader was about to meet someone very important. I spied on the meeting and was surprised to see that they were meeting with Irzac. I didn't think even he was crazy enough to strike a deal with the necromancers but he agreed to retrieve the tome for them. In exchange they would use the tome to raise a army of the dead for him to conquer the kingdoms with. I knew that the council wouldn't do anything without proof so I began to hatch a plan to undermine the alliance. I knew that the leaders of the enforcers desired to retrieve the tome for safekeeping but we've been unable to do so before. So I went to them and told them that Irzac planned to invade Arcania and that I would use the distraction to find the tome. I lied to them and told them that I needed your help if my plan was to work so they gave me permission to tell you about Irzac's invasion. Otherwise I would have been unable to warn you about Irzac.\" explained Tempest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would they help him and what do they want with the tome?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are not helping him. You forget that he has permission to declare war as a warlord. As a result they didn't think its any of our business to interfere. They just want to keep the tome safe. If you're concerned that they plan on using it then you have nothing to fear. The necromancers placed a curse on the tome. If any non human tries to use it the curse will draw their soul out of their body and bind it to the tome. That's why they will feel safer if the tome is with them. We can't use the tome but the Arcanians can and nothing is more dangerous to the dragon human peace treaty that that tome.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they fear it so much and why not tell us?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans don't have the energy needed to raise a dead dragon to unlife but that tome amplifies the power of anyone using it. Even a novice would be able to raise a army with the tome but the biggest danger is that they can bind dead dragons to their will. Can you imagine the damage that an army of undead dragons could do? not to mention the damage it would do to our reputation with humans. I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want to risk this information reaching the necromancers. Anyone who has this book is in grave danger but if the necromancers don't know where its disappeared to then it will be safe. They still think its in Arcania by the time they realize it isn't then it will be long gone. I was also afraid that your father might insist on keeping the tome safe in his kingdom, which the enforcers would never accept. This book must stay out of human hands. We're the only ones who can hold it without being tempted to use it.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have told us. If the Arcanians realize we stole it then they could declare war.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I placed a duplicate in its place. No one will know the difference unless they use it. The Arcanians need evidence if they want to accuse you of the crime. By the time they realize, there will be none that can link your kingdom to the theft.\" replied Tempest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like that you kept this from us but I do understand our reasons for doing so. I just hope you know what you're doing.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Now let's change this gloomy subject. We've dealt a serious blow to Irzac today. One that I doubt he'll recover from. I don't think you'll have anymore trouble from him.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric wasn't as convinced. Irzac was still at large and Eric didn't think that they've heard the last of him yet. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eric woke just as the sun was beginning to shine through his window at Lord Silvermore's manor in Firamore. He had been staying there for the last six months with his father. After Annabella decided to return to Firamore. Lord Silvermore decided to buy it so that he and Eric could stay close in case she needed their help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what disaster is going to strike us today.\" thought Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter returning from Arcania they set off with the army towards Irzac's fortress but found it completely abandoned. Annabella's father left a garrison there in case he returned but he had completely vanished. They placed wanted posters all over the kingdoms but Tempest didn't think that it would help. As a dragon Irzac was able to appear as anyone he wished so pictures of him wouldn't help and if things got too hot for him then he would simply retreat to dragon lands since he was still welcome there. With most of his army killed or captured Irzac realized that he could no longer strike as he wished and so retreated into the shadows where he undermined and sabotaged the kingdoms. The first trouble came from Arcania when a convoy of relics was attacked and ransacked. Bodies of men wearing the armor of Firamore was found at the site and the Arcanians blamed them for the massacre. Despite the king's best efforts the Arcanians cut all relations with Firamore until they returned what was stolen. The second trouble came when a longtime trade partner of Firamore suddenly increased the taxes for all goods exported to Firamore. This made it difficult for Firamore to recover economically and caused unrest among the merchant class. The next problem came when a sacred grove of the elves were cut down for timber. The workers responsible showed a document which showed that their guild was granted permission to cut there by the Firamore Royal family. The action almost pushed the elves to declare war on them. The Elven king tried to calm them since he didn't believe Firamore was responsible but he was unable to convince them and he had no choice but to end the alliance and recall Hawkeyes back to the elven realms. Trouble also arose when several prominent dragons were found murdered without provocation. Weapons and shields of several knightly orders from Firamore and Sanctuary was found at the site. Tempest figured that the orders were being framed for the crime and sent requests to the enforcer head fortress for more men and resources to investigate but all requests were ignored. He later became so desperate that he decided to travel to the fortress himself and find out what was happening. They heard nothing else from him until 2 weeks ago when Lord Silvermore received a message from him stating that he was concerned about corruption in the enforcer ranks and that he might have to go dark for a while but that he would contact them when it was safe again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was certain that Irzac's agents were responsible for these troubles and they spent most of their time trying to uncover these agents before they could do anymore damage. Eric just got up when someone knocked on the door to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" called Eric. The door opened and Lord Silvermore stepped through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning son, Did you sleep well?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you'll need your strength. Princess Annabella's father asked to see us. He said it's urgent.\" said Lord Silvermore. They left the manor and walked towards the castle. Once they arrived they went to the throne room where the king greeted his guests. Princess Annabella was already there standing beside her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming. I thought it best that we're all present for this.\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong, your majesty?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A group of enforcers have arrived at the city and their leader has requested a audience with me.\" replied the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did they say why?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but the fact that they arrived in such numbers worries me. Their leader also wasn't very diplomatic. It sounded more like a demand than a request.\" replied the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We shouldn't keep him waiting any longer then.\" said Annabella. They signaled the guard at the door to open the door and a white scaled dragon-kin with ice blue eyes entered the room. He was dressed in armor similar to what Tempest used to wear and carried a large halberd in his right hand. Once the enforcer was closer to the throne the king called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings enforcer! I am King Edward of Firamore. What brings you to my city?\" said the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings your majesty! I am called Frostbite\" replied the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you to my city, Frostbite?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you heard anything from Tempest, your majesty?\" asked Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not since he left for the enforcer fortress. Why do you ....\" replied the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you hear anything from him. You will contact me or my fellow enforcers immediately and if he comes to you then you must arrest him.\" interrupted Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. May I ask why?\" asked the king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is none of your concern!\" said Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Things might be different wherever you're from, so I'll explain it to you. I wear the crown and if you expect me to arrest someone then you WILL tell me what crime he's being accused with!!\" replied the king. Frostbite remained silent for a moment and Eric could tell that the king's response angered him and that he was trying to calm down before he resumed speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest has been declared a rogue and is wanted for murder and high treason.\" said Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! That's impossible! There has to be a mistake.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no mistake. He broke into the vault, stole a precious relic and killed two enforcers during his escape. We know of your friendship with him and will be watching you all very closely. Any attempt to hide him from us will be considered an act of war against the enforcers! Good day.\" said Frostbite. He then turned and left the throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think things got a lot more complicated for us now.\" said the king.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He snatched the letter from the boy and handed him a few coins in payment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr David Estress is a alias of Tempest. We agreed that if he was ever in trouble then he would contact me under that name.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound like a dragon-kin name.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not supposed to sound like one. Tempest has on occasion used illusions to make himself appear human. When he does that he normally buys property under a fake name which he can then use as a safe house. The letter should mention a town's name. Then we just need to search for any property owned by David Estress at that town.\" said Lord Silvermore. They opened the letter and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSorry old friend but I'm afraid we'll have to cancel our reunion because of the bad weather. Winter seems to have come early and I'm currently trapped at Forest Springs because of it. If you ever find yourself here be sure to look up the silverware. Kind Regards Mr D.

The king will have to tell the enforcers which would mean Tempest's death.

If the enforcers find out we're helping Tempest they will force the kingdoms to hunt us down as well. I can't ask you to put yourself in such danger.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm volunteering. Tempest is my friend as well and I want to help clear his name.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine get your things and tell no one where we're going.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey rode into Forest Springs 2 days later. They decided to travel by horse to avoid suspicion. After the war the people returned to the village and the town had grown since the last time Eric was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's find the local tavern and ask around.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way through town until they saw the sign for the tavern. They tied their horses to the post outside and made their into the tavern. Since it was midday there weren't many people inside yet since they were out working and mostly came in the early evenings when they finished work. The staff was preparing the tavern for the evening rush by cleaning the unoccupied tables and preparing the evening meal. The innkeeper looked up and gestured for them to come closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome sir, Might I interest you in a drink for the long road or do you and your son want to rent a room for the night?\" asked the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came for some information actually.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, A very expensive commodity that.\" said the innkeeper. Lord Silvermore placed a few gold coins on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to know?\" asked the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has a blue scaled dragon-kin been through here lately?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. There hasn't been any dragon-kin through here.\" replied the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. What of a Mr David Estress?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Haven't seen him in years.\" replied the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he do the last time he was here?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, that's a problem. It was a long time ago and my memory isn't what it used to be.\" said the innkeeper. Lord Silvermore placed a few more coins on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I remember. He bought the Forest Springs mine then left a few weeks after. said the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me about the mine?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A sad story. The mine used to be owned by the local lord and was very prosperous. But a cave-in killed a large number of miners working there. The ghosts of those miners couldn't find rest and began to haunt the mine. The lord had no choice but to shut it down. He sold it to Mister Estress at a greatly discounted price. We tried to warn him but he went through with the deal anyway. He hired a dragon-kin mercenary to clear out the mine but he must have failed because the mine never reopened.\" replied the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the mine?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A short distance out of town. Follow the dirt road through the north of town into the forest and it will lead you there. I hope you're not planning to go there. You'll find nothing but your own deaths there. replied the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us worry about that. One last question. Did the mine produce silver?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! How did you know that?\" asked the innkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guess. Thank you for your time.\" said Lord Silvermore. They got up and went outside to their horses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think he's desperate enough to hide in a haunted mine?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it hasn't been haunted in a long time.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why keep it closed then?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because no one will be stupid enough to look for him in a haunted mine.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one except us you mean?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't to late yet. You can return to Firamore if you want.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I promised to help and I meant it. I'm not comfortable fighting undead again. I still have nightmares about that cursed town in Arcania.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm sure it's been cleared out years ago.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it isn't?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I know a few tricks that should prove useful.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes later they arrive at the Forest Springs Mine. The entrance was covered in cobwebs and scattered around the area were old rusted tools. A old sign was placed near the entrance. Eric guided his horse to the sign and began reading it aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Due to the extreme risk of additional cave-ins the Lord of Forest Springs have declared the mine unfit for operation. Enter at own Risk.\" read Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we must be careful.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dismounted and carefully entered the mine. The torches had long been extinguished but as they walked into the mine the torches all burst into flame again. As the torches came to life Eric heard a evil laugh echo through the mine. Eric jumped and placed his hand on the hilt of his sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still think the mine's been cleared?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey carefully advanced and as they walked deeper into the mine Eric began to hear the sound of picks striking stone. As they came closer to a turn in the shaft the sound became louder. As Eric walked around the corner something caught on his leg and a skeleton jumped from the supports and began to move in front of him. Eric pulled out his sword and was about to strike the skeleton when he saw it was hanging on a rope connected to the supports. Eric looked down and saw a rope stretching across the shaft before moving up the support beam to the top. Eric kicked the rope and the skeleton moved again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a trick.\" said Eric. They continued on and found some gears constantly knocking a piece of metal against a stone that made the sound Eric mistook for picks earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the tunnel ended at a large cavern with a glow shining from it. As they entered the room a voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What took you so long?\" asked Tempest. As Eric advanced he saw Tempest sitting in front of a campfire. He wore a cloak with a hood that was big enough to hide his features. Eric could see that he no longer wore the armor with the enforcer emblem and was bare chested under the cloak  His great sword was resting against a pile of crates next to him while it's scabbard was in his left hand. After they returned to the army. Tempest visited the armory to find a replacement weapon. None of the warhammers could match the craftsmanship of the dwarven hammer he lost at Arcania so he settled on a finely made great sword that was similar in length to The Eye Of The Hurricane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fake haunted mine. You really out did yourself. Was it ever haunted?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, A rogue mage caused the accident and set the tricks you saw. He planned to buy it cheap then make a killing selling the silver but I beat him to it. After I found him I made him a deal. Leave town and never return then I'll let him keep his head. He found the deal more than reasonable.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he did. Can you please tell us what is going on? The enforcers say that you stole a relic and that you murdered two of them.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the way I remembered it.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then tell us what did happen.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After I arrived at the Enforcer Headquarters I began to investigate why they weren't responding to my requests for aid. I discovered that all the murdered dragons were supporters of the High dragon lord and that they fought to keep the peace between humans and dragons. I also found a list of names of several knights and in which order they belonged. I don't know knights as well as you so I'm hoping you'll take a look at it. I also overheard some enforcers talking but was unable to discover their identities. They were planning to hand the Tome of the First Necromancer to Irzac. I convinced two other enforcers of the danger and we set off to retrieve the Tome for safekeeping. After we retrieved the Tome the corrupt enforcers showed up. The other two volunteered to keep them back while I run with the tome. I've been on the run ever since.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you convince them to help you?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been friends with them for a long time. They too encountered difficulties and were suspicious of our superiors and the order.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they heard the same evil laugh echo through the tunnels as when they first entered the mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anyone waiting outside for you?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then prepare yourself. We're about to have some uninvited guests.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drew their weapons and a few minutes later Frostbite and five other enforcers entered the cavern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew following you two would bear fruit. How have you been, Tempest?\" said Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frostbite! You are being deceived by your superiors. Tempest did not commit the crimes he's being accused off!\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what it's worth. I believe you. But I'm afraid that won't save you.\" said Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Frostbite. What is an enforcer's loyalty worth these days?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I'm doing this for money? Dragons and dragon-kin are being wiped out by humans and what does the Dragon lord do? He protects human kind and keeps us from defending ourselves. Irzac is willing to fight for our survival so we follow him willingly.\" replied Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Irzac doesn't care about dragons or dragon-kin! He's killed them so he can gain more power or have you forgotten about Azurite and Granite? They gave their lives to keep this book out of his hands!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They and the murdered dragons are traitors who sold out their own race to the humans. Don't make the same mistake they did.\" said Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the only traitor here!\" answered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me the book and I'll spare you and your friends.\" said Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come and take it. If you can.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So be it! KILL THEM!!\" yelled Frostbite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other enforcers drew their weapons and charged at their group while Frostbite stayed behind and watched. Eric dodged the blow from the enforcer in front of him then struck at him with his sword. The enforcer raised his shield and blocked his strike before bashing his sword out of his hand. Eric rolled backwards then held out his hand towards his sword. It then disappeared and reappeared back in his hand. Lord Silvermore had told him that since his sword is a part of his body then it can never really be removed. So he taught Eric how to recall the sword to him if he's ever disarmed. The move caught the enforcer by surprise and Eric was able to slip past his guard and stab him through the chest. Eric then threw his sword at another enforcer who's back was turned to him. As the enforcer went down on one knee Lord Silvermore beheaded him. They then advanced toward Tempest who was dueling the other three enforcers. One was directly in front of Tempest while the other two were trying to get around him to strike at his left and right flank. Eric charged at the one to the left but he heard him and turned to face him. He swung an axe at Eric's head and Eric ducked under the blow. They dueled for a few minutes before Eric finished him by stabbing his knee then slashing his throat. As Eric finished him he saw the other two fall to Tempest and Lord Silvermore as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Must I do EVERYTHING myself!!\" yelled Frostbite. He then drew his halberd and stepped forward.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tempest steps forward and spins his sword by his side before taking a battle ready stance. The two then charge at each other. As they close on each other Frostbite swings his weapon at Tempest but he rolls under the halberd and behind Frostbite. Tempest then twist around and stabs at his opponent's exposed back but he deflects the strike with the pole of his weapon before swinging downward at Tempest who rolled backwards to avoid the strike . Tempest then rose to his full height and drew a half circle with the blade of his sword. They continued to duel for the next few minutes but neither was able to wound his opponent. Finally they charged at each other again and once they were close they both struck at each other. Frostbite underestimated Tempest's speed and his blow missed but Tempest managed to strike him across the belly and once he rushed past Tempest twisted around and slashed him across the back, between his wings. Frostbite cried out and fell forward and hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTempest then slowly walked towards him then kicked him in the side to tip him over so that he faces him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ... think you've won?\" asked Frostbite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still standing while you're lying in a pool of blood, so I think so.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sent a message to the other enforcers before coming here. In less that a day the area will be swarming with enforcers and they will hunt you and your friends down like animals. I ... still ... win.\" said Frostbite. He then closed his eyes and breathed his last. Tempest walked back to the campfire and threw his sword down on the ground before sitting with his back against the crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what you had to.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's eight enforcers who have died now because of my actions.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Irzac is responsible for this, not you. Don't blame yourself for this!\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frostbite is right, you know.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About dragons and dragon-kin being wiped out. You don't really see it since you spend so much time among humans but I do. Our two races can no longer endure the losses. If something doesn't change then in a few decades there might be no more dragons or dragon-kin left. I can't blame them for wanting to defend themselves. If I didn't know what Irzac really is then it might have been me lying there.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Waging war with humans isn't going to change their minds about us. We have to show them we're not the monsters they think we are.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think humans can change their minds. Once they have accepted something. Then nothing can change their opinions.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can. I've had success with this. You mustn't give up hope.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" 'sigh'. You're right. You should have a look at that list I found. Then we need to put as much distance between us and this place.\" said Tempest. Tempest handed the list to Lord Silvermore while Eric began to check though the supplies so that they can decide what to bring with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know most of these knights. I trained them myself. Where did they get these?\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They found the shields of the knights on that list at the attacks sites.\"  said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be right. These people would never attack an innocent dragon. I've trusted them for many years.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think someone might be trying to make you look bad. I don't think the council will be pleased with you if they find out your knights are killing dragons.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to prove them otherwise.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. I suggest we start at the Order of the Sacred Guardians. Their shields were found at the latest site.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to prove that the knights were elsewhere when the attack took place. Each order keeps a log of what assignments their members are assigned to as well as at what time so we need that log book. We also need to look into those shields. I doubt someone stole the shields as that would attract the order's attention so we need to find out who supplies their equipment. He might be able to tell us who's been ordering those shields.\" explained Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The order's chapter house is in Sanctuary. How are we going to get there? The guards will be looking for us if the enforcers were there already.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we use illusions to hide our appearance?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't work. You might be able to fool the guards but the enforcers and mages will sense you immediately.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should contact Princess Annabella. I'm sure she can help.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer if we didn't involve the royal family. If the enforcers find out they helped us then it could cause trouble for the entire kingdom. I have a contact that might be able to sneak us in and out of the city but we'll have to go to the dwarven realms to meet him.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too far. If we take too long then the evidence might be erased by the time we get too it.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, old friend?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So who's this contact of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dwarven merchant who used to sell dwarven goods to Sanctuary back when there was still trade. He also smuggled things into the city for a fee. Sometimes goods, other times people.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said that there is no more trade between dwarves and humans.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It recently started up again and I heard he's back in business. I just hope he reopened his 'ferrying' service as well.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then gathered their things and set off. Normally it wouldn't have taken them that long to bet there, but they often had to take long detours to avoid the patrols. The patrols were led by mages and more that once they saw a large group traveling with an enforcer. Once they got close to Sanctuary they abandoned the roads completely and Tempest led them into the mountains. There were no roads to follow and the path was extremely hazardous. There were also no signs of life so Eric began to wonder if they hadn't become lost. But after a few days Tempest told them that they were close to the outpost. When Eric saw the outpost he was disappointed. It was basically just a few fields and small stone houses outside a large stone door in the side of a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would be bigger. This is small even by village standards.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're only seeing the outskirts, Eric. Most of the outpost is underground. Now that we are here we need to work on our cover. I've done some mercenary work here so the guards will know me. If anyone asks. You and Silvermore are former knights who grew displeased with your superiors and decided to make a living as sell swords. We have been working together for several years and I brought you here looking for work.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded his head and they began to walk towards the gates. As they got closer Eric saw two dwarven guards in heavy plate armor standing on either side of the gate. They both wielded large battleaxes. As they approached one of the guards got a shocked look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest?! You're still alive! I thought someone killed you years ago.\" said the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! You know I'm not that easy to kill.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough! I should have known better. What brings you back here and who are your companions?\" asked the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are two are with my mercenary group. We've been working together for some time.\" replied Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you preferred to work alone.\" said the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but people don't want to hire single mercenaries anymore. They prefer to hire larger groups which they can hire for less so I had to adapt.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We live in dangerous times, friend and people have to cut costs where they can.\" said the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, do you know if Brunor Ironhammer is here?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brunor? He has a store in the Merchant Quarter. Brunor's Imports, you can't miss it. You're timing is perfect. I hear he's planning a trip to Sanctuary, so he'll be hiring guards for the trip.\" said the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'd better go see him. May we pass?\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Just make sure you're companions don't start trouble.\" said the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't.\" said Tempest. The guard opened the doors for them and Eric was surprised how many people were inside. The streets were full of both humans and dwarves wandering from one place to another. Occasionally a merchant would call out his wares to people to try to get them to browse his stock. They arrived at the store but Brunor wasn't there. The shopkeeper said that he went to his warehouse to load the wagons for his business trip. They asked him for directions to the warehouse then traveled to the western portion of the city. The warehouse was located close to the western gate. The gate led into tunnels that traveled all the way to Sanctuary. As they entered the warehouse they saw a black bearded dwarf who was busy directing a group of other dwarves how to load the crates on the wagon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brunor!! Good to see you again!\" called Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest! What are you doing here? If you want to sign on as a guard then I'm afraid you're too late. I've already hired guards for the trip.\" said the black bearded dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not necessary, I actually have a proposal for you.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look like the kind that wants to ship goods.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on the goods. We need to get into Sanctuary quietly.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what your talking about. I'm an honest business man. But favors like that would have been expensive.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would this have been enough if you did such a favor?\" asked Tempest. He held out a bag of gold coins to Brunor, which he took and began to examine. Brunor considered the offer before speaking up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get you three in and out of Sanctuary but I'm only staying for a day so you better finish your business before then or you'll have to find another way out. If you get caught then we've never met, understand?\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. When do you leave?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First thing tomorrow morning.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good that will give me some time to prepare.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eric get off my wing!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry!\" said Eric. He raised himself higher so that Tempest can pull out his wing  but bumped his head on the roof of the compartment. Once Tempest pulled his wing out from under him, they settled down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to keep quiet or the guards in Sanctuary will hear you.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You try settling into a coffin with three people for a few hours!\" yelled Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric soon felt the wagon beginning to move. Eric remained awake for some time but after a while he began to dose off. The constant rocking of the wagon and the pitch darkness didn't help either and soon Eric fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLoud voices woke Eric. He briefly forgot where he was and bumped his head on the roof again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!!\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet! or the guards will hear you.\" whispered Lord Silvermore. He quieted down and Eric soon heard guards talking outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brunor! What did you bring for us today?\" asked a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing but the finest dwarven goods and a few barrels of fine dwarven ale for the royal family.\" replied Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! The king has been asking everyday about the shipment. He's run out of stock and your ale is very popular with the foreign dignitaries.\" said the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! You know my people only makes the best.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Everything looks in order. You may proceed.\" said the guard. The wagon soon started moving again and Eric could hear the townspeople outside. Soon Eric heard two warehouse doors being opened and a short while later the wagon stopped. They heard people unloading the wagon and once they stopped and left Brunor opened the secret compartment for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about time! My wings were starting to get cramps.\" said Tempest. He stretched out and spread his wings to work out the stiffness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have we been in there?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few hours. Its a little after noon now.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't risk traveling in the city during the day. We'll wait until nightfall, then go into the city.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just be sure you're back here by morning. I'm not going to wait for you.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat and waited for nightfall. When it arrived they carefully left the warehouse and walked through the streets towards the order's chapter house. They avoided everyone else they saw in the streets. When they arrived at the chapter house they hid behind a corner of a house and examined it. Eric knew that every order had a chapter house where their members can rest and store their equipment away from the common soldiers. A tall stone wall surrounded the chapter house and Eric saw a reinforced wooden door where two knights were standing guard. They moved around the guards and ran to the wall. Once they reached it they climbed it and looked inside the compound. The chapter house had its own stables, armory, mess hall, chapel, healer's tent and training yards. Despite the late hours several knights were still walking around inside the compound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is the grand master's office?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should be that one over there.\" replied Lord Silvermore. He pointed to a small house at the back of the compound. A staircase led up the side of the house to the second floor where Eric guessed the grand master met his guests. They carefully made their way through the camp until they reached the staircase. Tempest picked the lock and they entered the small study. A desk with writing materials was placed in front of the only window in the room. two chairs were placed opposite the desk where visitors can sit and up against the one wall was several bookshelves where several logs and journals were stored. Tempest walked to the desk and lighted a single candle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made it. What now?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look for anything that might help us. Lists of assignments, equipment logs, field reports from members, suppliers. Anything that can prove the knights on the list was elsewhere when the attacks took place and how the shields could be found at the site.\" replied Tempest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric took a pile of documents and began to read through them. Tempest placed the list of names on the desk and Eric checked it regularly to see if any of the names matched the logs. Most of them were useless but occasionally they found something that could help them. The logs that might prove useful they placed on a pile on the desk while the others they returned to the shelves. After about a hour they went through all the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I think that is all we'll be able to use. We should leave before we're caught.\" said Lord Silvermore. At that moment they heard someone climbing the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! Out the window!\" whispered Tempest.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lord Silvermore grabbed the logs and they all jumped out of the window. They then rushed to the nearest wall and climbed over. Eric saw a patrol of guardsmen standing in the street talking to each other. A red scaled enforcer was nearby and seemed to be leading the patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll go one at a time. Run for that alley over there. Silvermore, you go first.\" said Tempest. He waited until the guard's backs were turned, then he rushed to the alley. After he reached it, he turned around and gestured for them to follow. Eric rushed ahead and just as he reached the alley he heard someone shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY YOU! Stop right there!\" Eric stopped and turned around but he saw the guards weren't talking to him. They had Tempest surrounded and the enforcer was standing opposite Tempest. Eric was just about to draw his sword and rush to Tempest, when his father grabbed his shoulder and pulled him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! You'll get us all captured!\" whispered Lord Silvermore. He leaned closer and began to listen to the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're making a mistake, Infernus.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save it for your trial, traitor.\" replied the enforcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There won't be a trial. Just an execution.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone gets a trial. Even scum like you, now you can either surrender and go to your trial with honor or I can beat you black and blue and drag you to it.\" said Infernus. Tempest stared at each of the guards, then held out his sword in front of him and dropped it on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very wise. Sergeant! Bind his hands and take him to the dungeon. I'll call for transport so we can take this traitor to where he belongs!\" The Sergeant shackled Tempest's hands and escorted him to the dungeons while Infernus walked towards the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do? We can't just leave him there!\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! But we'll need a plan if we're to succeed.\" replied Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a plan that could work. Follow me\" said Eric. They left the area and collected some rope, after they found it they looked through the streets before they found two guardsmen patrolling the streets. They ran ahead and Lord Silvermore ran into an alley while Eric waited for the patrol to arrive. After a while they appeared and Eric called out to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help! There's a body in there!\" yelled Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where?\" asked the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's in the alley! Follow me!\" yelled Eric. He turned around and ran into the alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" called the guards and ran after him. Eric went around a corner where Lord Silvermore was lying on the floor. The guards carefully approached him and inspected him. Lord Silvermore quickly grabbed one of the guards and hit him in the face, which knocked him out. The other guard stepped back and was about to draw his weapon when Eric grabbed him from behind and slammed his head into the wall. They removed the guard's uniforms, then bound and gagged them. Eric altered his appearance so that it looked like he wore a simple black shirt and trousers. Then he put on one of the guard's armor over the clothing. They then used a illusion to make their faces appear differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think this is going to work. Mages and enforcers will sense the illusion.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but the guards won't and if we go in there unaltered then they might recognize us anyway.\" replied Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'd better hope Infernus isn't at the dungeon.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then ran through the streets until they reached the dungeon. As they entered the dungeon they saw a lone guard sitting at a table. He was very young and Eric didn't think that he has served with the city guard for long. As he saw Lord Silvermore's sergeant uniform he jumped to his feet and stood at attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergeant! Sir!\" called the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At ease guardsman.\" said Lord Silvermore. The guardsman then began to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I do for you, sir?\" asked the guardsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here to check on the dragon-kin prisoner.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with him, sir. He's been staring at me like I'm a piece of raw meat every time I walk past.\" said the guardsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then perhaps you should feed him.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I told the warden, but he insists on keeping the prisoners half starved. He said it keeps them weak and helps during their interrogations. That might work on humans but I don't think it's wise to starve a dragon-man.\" said the guardsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he won't be a problem for long.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sleep better when he's gone. His cell is the last one on the left. Just follow the corridor.\" said the guardsman. Eric and Lord Silvermore started walking down the corridor. At the first door to the left Eric saw a armory where they stored the prisoner's belongings. Eric saw Tempest's sword leaning on a nearby wall. The corridor went straight for a few cells then stopped and continued to the right. Lord Silvermore approached the cell where Tempest was locked up with the keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing!!\" called a voice. Eric turned around and saw a man in leather armor standing behind them. He had a club in his hand and a ring of keys on his belt. Eric guessed that it must be the warden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prisoner transfer. Infernus told us we must take him to a more secure location.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the warden! Why wasn't I told about this?!\" said the warden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't say, sir. I assumed that you were already told.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warden stared at them suspiciously and Eric became concerned that he didn't believe them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They did as he asked and Tempest altered his appearance. He remained a dragon-kin but his scales turned red and his features changed until he resembled Infernus. He then stormed into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soldier! Raise the alarm! The prisoner has escaped!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir!\" said the guardsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get reinforcements. Lock this place down. No one gets in or out until I return.

Time's wasting!\" said Brunor. They walked to the wagon, which had been loaded with the goods Brunor had bought during the day. Then crawled into the compartment again. Brunor then sealed it and began the journey back home. As they traveled through the city. Eric heard the sounds of heavily armored men rushing past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they don't stop us at the gates.\" thought Eric.

You can go.\" said a guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.

Search the crates!\" said Infernus. Eric could hear guards climbing on the wagon and opening the crates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you!! I am a member of the dwarven merchants guild!!\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care! You're not leaving until we're sure your not carrying something else!\" said Infernus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything looks fine, sir!\" called a guardsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My king will hear of this insult!! Expect a strongly worded reply back from him!\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Proceed carefully!\" said Infernus. Eric soon felt the wagon moving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glorified rock lizard!!\" mumbled Brunor once he was out of earshot. After a few hours they were back at the dwarven outpost and Brunor let them out of the compartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mind telling me what that was about?!\" asked Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's safer for you if you didn't know.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, but you're in bigger trouble if you have enforcers on your tail.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'll be careful. Thank you for your help.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Take care of yourself, friend.\" said Brunor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" replied Tempest. They then parted ways with Brunor and made their way to a local inn. They rented a room and had a midday meal. After they finished eating they returned to their room, where they began to go over the evidence they found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope it was worth it.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silvermore you go first.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is as we suspected. The knights were elsewhere when the attacks took place.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have proof?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have field reports from those knights. I also have healers notes as two of the knights were off duty with injuries at the time. One also died shortly before the attack. So unless he became undead, there's no way he could be involved\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! What about you, Eric?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't as lucky. I found some inventory lists. As far as I can tell, they didn't order an abnormally large amount of shields nor did any mysteriously vanish. So those shields couldn't have come from the order. But I have no idea where any of those shield came from.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found out who supplies the order with their armor and shields. It's a dwarf named Bromril Stoneheart. He has a forge here at the outpost. He might be able to tell us where those shields came from\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can you tell us about him.\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's as greedy as they come. I'm not surprised that he's involved with this. He has no honor, He'd sell them out in a heartbeat if it's advantageous to him.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we buy the information from him?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll tell us something for a price. But he'll keep just as much a secret from us, maybe even more. Despite the name 'Stoneheart' he is a coward. If I press on him hard enough then he'll crack.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd prefer that we not rely on torture to get what we want.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't do him any permanent damage. He'll crack before that.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he doesn't?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll do what I have to.

They made their way through the streets until they reached Bromril's workshop. It was a large building, his house was attached to it but next to it was a large side building that acted as both his store and his workshop. Smoke came out of a large chimney at the back, which indicated that Bromril was in his workshop. They opened the door and walked into the shop. Several shields and armor was hanging on racks around the shop. A dwarf was standing behind a counter. a door behind the counter led into the backroom where the armor is made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Bromril's Armory. It's not often we get dragon-kin customers so I have no armor for sale that can fit you. But after a few measurements my master will be able to forge you a custom suit.\" said the dwarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to have a talk with your master.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid that's not possible. He's much too busy.\" said the dwarf. Tempest grabbed the front of the dwarf's shirt and slammed his head into the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't asking. Eric, lock the door.\" said Tempest. Eric took the keys from the dwarf and locked the front door, they then locked the dwarf in a old storage room and entered the forge. They saw a dwarf standing at the forge busy banging out a new shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Bromril.\" said Tempest. The dwarf spun around with a startled look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?! What are you doing in my workshop?!\" said Bromril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been naughty and I'm here to punish you.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean.\" said Bromril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, then let me remind you. You've sold some order's shields to someone you're not supposed to. They caused a great deal of harm with it. The priests say that confession is the first step to forgiveness so start talking. Who did you sell those shields too?!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ... I have no idea what you're talking about! Now leave before I call the guards!\" said Bromril. He tried to walk past them towards the front of the store but as he walked past Tempest he grabbed the back of Bromril's shirt and threw him back against the forge. As Bromril got too his feet again Tempest grabbed him and held his face close to the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU'RE GREED HAS DRAGONS AND HUMANS ALMOST AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS AGAIN!!! TALK!! OR I\"LL ROAST YOU ALIVE!!\" yelled Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait ... please!! I'll talk! Two dragon-kin came to my store a few months ago asking for those shields. They asked me to deliver them to a warehouse in Firamore. The details are in my sales ledger over there.\" said Bromril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT WERE THEIR NAMES!!!\" yelled Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They didn't give me any names. You have to believe me!\" said Bromril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. We'll be taking that ledger. Any Objections?\" said Tempest. Bromril shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now listen well! If you tell anyone about our talk or deal with these people again, then I'll come back and tear you limb from limb! Do you understand?!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word. No one will hear of this discussion.\" said Bromril. Tempest then slammed Bromril's head into the anvil, breaking Bromril's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! What was that for!!\" asked Bromril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make sure you don't forget!\" said Tempest. Tempest then took the ledger and walked out of the store. Eric and Lord Silvermore followed close behind. After they left the store they gathered together in the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was extreme, even for you. Was that really necessary?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare judge me!! You have no idea what I've been through these past few weeks!

Tempest closed his eyes and took a few deep breaths to try and calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.

You can't go there.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What other choice to we have?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely there must be others. What about the warehouse in Firamore Bromril mentioned?\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That delivery was a long time ago. Any evidence that might have been there is long gone.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps but going to the enforcer fortress is suicide.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still know a few enforcers I can trust.

Hopefully something there can tell us who and what their next plan is.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or you might find nothing. Irzac has been careful. What makes you think anything's changed?\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. But what other choice to we have? We have no other leads. Besides, Irzac's agents won't expect us to do anything this risky.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For good reason!\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to go with me if you don't want to.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming with you. Someone has to save your tail when your crazy plan goes wrong.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then lets get our things. We have a long journey ahead.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey collected their things from their room at the inn and left the dwarven outpost. after they put enough distance between them and the outpost, Eric and Lord Silvermore changed to dragon form and they all flew to the Enforcer fortress. The journey would normally take then weeks if they traveled on foot but because flying was the fastest way they managed to reach the mountains where the fortress was constructed in 3 days. When they saw the mountains Tempest told them that the enforcers have lookout towers on the mountains to watch for flying enemies so they landed and proceeded on foot. After another day of hiking through the wilderness they saw the fortress. It was built on the top of the mountain and Eric saw no path to the top. The walls were also far larger than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope this friend of yours can help because I don't see how we're getting in without an army.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even an army can take the fortress. How would they reach the top? This location was chosen because you need wings to reach it, Eric.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how are we going to sneak in?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There might not be a path to the fortress over the mountains but there is a path through the mountains. The entrance can only be opened from the inside though.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So in order to use the entrance to sneak into the fortress, we first need to sneak into the fortress?\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally yes. But this is where my friend comes in. He's agreed to wait for us at the entrance.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can trust this friend?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He and I have been through a lot. So yes, I think we can.\" said Tempest. They make their way to the side of the cliff. Tempest picks up a stone and walks to the cliff wall. He knocks an unknown melody against the wall with the stone and a short while later the wall begins to move. Eric moves closer to see what awaits them at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dragon-kin had pitch black scales just like Eric in his dragon form. He had the same enforcer armor as Eric had seen before, but his armor was painted black. The Enforcer crest was painted purple. His pupils were purple as well. Two curved sickles were strapped to his belt. As he saw them he stepped forward and shook Tempest's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea how relieved I was when I received your message. I heard you were captured by Infernus and feared the worst.\" said the dragon-kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I managed to escape thanks to my friends here. It good to see you again Shadow-wing.\" said Tempest. They entered the tunnels and Eric and Lord Silvermore follow close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the situation here?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something going on with the grand master. There's been an abnormally large amount of kill orders of late and the ones that he sends on those missions were a step away from being declared rogues before. But now they are his inner circle, Discussions in a room ends when I enter. Whatever they're planning, its clear I'm not included.\" said Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Irzac got to him?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he did.\" said Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the grand master in the fortress?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he left a few days ago to oversee the security of the conclave.\" replied Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What conclave?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it that time again? I've forgotten.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The conclave happens once every year. The high dragon lord calls all his councilors from around the kingdoms and listens to any advise or suggestions that they might have for the coming year. He can then set new laws for the coming year. If they are unhappy with his rule then they can also call on him to step down so a new dragon lord can be chosen.\" explained Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know all the grand master's comings and goings?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a high ranking member so I'm familiar with the inner workings of the order.\" said Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should search his office as soon as possible.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. I've cleared the patrols around his office so you shouldn't run into any guards. Just leave everything tidy. If the grand master hears there was a break-in while he was gone, then I'll get in trouble.\" said Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be careful. Thank you, Shadow-wing\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of walking they reached the office. The door was left unlocked for them. They slipped in then Eric closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can trust him?\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my life.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have something on your mind, son.\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just find it strange that he knows so much. Also the door's unlocked with no guards anywhere. It seems too easy.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got a lucky break, that's all.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't get lucky breaks.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, so it's about time we get one. I've known Shadow-wing for years. Trust me.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey began to search through the office. Eric soon found a stack of papers with names written on it. The papers were stamped with a unknown symbol with some numbers underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are kill orders. Those are the names of several of the dragons that were killed. The numbers under the stamp records the time and date that it was stamped.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is the latest one. It was stamped two days ago.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valor. That's another council member and one of the dragon lord's biggest supporters.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's a letter and another list. I don't recognize the names on it.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The names that are scratched out are the dragons that have been murdered. Valor is next and I see there are more after him. The letter says 'Kill the ones on the list. Will provide men if necessary, Irzac'. This is exactly what we need. We can nail Irzac with this.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly! This is too convenient, Think about it. We couldn't find anything that links him and now its suddenly handed to us on a platter.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this again! I can't say anything to make you trust Shadow-wing. But the list does say Valor is the next target. So lets go there. If nothing happens then we know its fake but if Irzac does send someone then the list and letter is real.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Then that's what we'll do.\" said Eric. They took the orders, list and letter with them and snuck through the fortress again until they reached the exit where Shadow-wing was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You found what you needed?\" asked Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did. Thank you for your help.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must ask. Do you still have the First Necromancer's tome?\" asked Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't you think it's dangerous to keep it with you? If they capture you then Irzac gets the tome. Give it to me. I can hide it where no one will find it.\" said Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that, I'm sorry.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you trust me?\" asked Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a matter of trust. I'll only relax if I keep it. Consider it one of my flaws but I can't expect another to protect it.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Take care of yourself, old friend.\" said Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" replied Tempest. They then left the area and started traveling to Valor's lair.</span></div></div>",

They stopped at a small town. Tempest believed that it's size would mean that there won't be many guards or enforcers. They wanted to find out the latest news of what was happening in the kingdom so they made their way to the tavern. After they entered the tavern they walked to tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sir.\" asked Tempest. The tavern keeper then turned to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you?\" asked the tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haven't been in the kingdom for quite sometime. Is there anything we should be aware of?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, a great deal has happened lately. Firstly, a large amount of dragon-kin are wandering around the kingdoms. There focus seems to be on the knights though and they have been causing trouble for the royal family. I hope it doesn't lead to another war. It's bad for business.\" said the tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought war was good for merchants.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For merchants, yes. but not for tavern owners. Fewer travelers on the road during wartime and although soldiers drink they also cause damage while drunk.\" said the tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sympathies then, Anything else?\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's been a breakout at the Sanctuary dungeons. The guards are on high alert there but there's been no news of who escaped. I hope it isn't some bandit leader. Princess Annabella also disappeared around that time.\" said the tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Was she kidnapped!?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought at first, but then she showed up here 2 days ago traveling with an older woman. She told me her name but I can't recall what it is. It starts with an 'E'.\" said the tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Esmerda?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, That's it. How did you know?\" asked the tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky guess. Did they say why they are here?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something about finding two knights. I wouldn't want to be them. She looked furious.\" said the tavern keeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your time.\" said Tempest. They turned to leave the tavern but at that moment they saw Annabella and Esmerda enter the tavern. As the inn keeper walked towards them Tempest leaned closer and whispered to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to leave, NOW.\" whispered Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Through the back, quick!\" said Tempest. While the inn keeper talked with Annabella. They walked through the door behind the bar and into the kitchen. They avoided the serving people and left through the backdoor that led to an alley next to the tavern. They started walking to the entrance of the alley when Annabella and Esmerda stepped in front of them, blocking their way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your high...\" started Eric. Before he could finish, an strong force pulled him to a wall and pinned him against it. He saw that his companions were pinned as well. Eric tried to move but no matter how hard he struggled he couldn't pull himself away from the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess what are you...\" started Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SILENCE!!!\" yelled Annabella. Eric felt a force clamp his mouth shut, preventing him from speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea in how much trouble you two are in!!! My own bodyguard and my best knight turning rogue and helping a fugitive! I might have accepted that had you come to me and asked for my help! But instead you chose to embarrass me! Have I not proven to you that I can be trusted! What do you have to say for yourself!\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tried to speak but the magic was still holding his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have no excuses for yourself?! And what were you thinking breaking into a knight's chapter house and stealing evidence that could clear their names! Do you want the enforcers to declare war? Explain yourself!\" yelled Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmhhhmmm.\" mumbled Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, sorry.\" said Annabella. She ended the unintentional spell that kept Eric from speaking but before he could begin, Tempest spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric wanted to involve you but I told him not to. so if you must be angry then be angry with me, your highness.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you scared to contact me? Have I not earned your trust?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't about trust. If we told you then you would have come with us. When the enforcers find out they would try to force your father to hand you over, which he would never do. The enforcers could then declare that your kingdom have betrayed the peace treaty and order the other kingdoms to rise up against you. This is exactly what the enforcers would want you to do. I couldn't let you take such a risk. Especially since I wasn't sure if our investigation would find evidence to clear our names.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am aware of my responsibilities to the kingdom. I wouldn't endanger my people without thinking it through first.\" replied Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you really ignore such an challenge?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps not, but it wasn't your choice to make.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right. I'm sorry that we kept the details of the threat from you.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough. We're going to help you with the investigation from now on.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't think its wise, princess.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The way I see it, the enforcers declared war the moment they framed our knights. If I want to clear their names then I have to be out there investigating with you.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make a good point, princess. Very well, you may accompany us.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now that it's settled. Tell us what you found out so far.\" said Esmerda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they told them everything that's happened to them so far. When they finished Annabella and Esmerda thought it through before they spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're planning to rescue Valor from these hunters?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. He's a well respected member of the conclave. I'll have a hard time convincing the others, but if he speaks for us then we might stand a chance.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good plan but there is great risk. If Valor is already dead then we'll not only lose his support but they can also frame us for his murder.\" said Esmerda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am aware of the risk but we can't approach the conclave by ourselves. There is another reason I want to get to him. I'm concerned about the fact that the grand master is handling the security of the conclave. If Irzac corrupted him then who knows what he's planning.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we'd better hope Valor is still alive when we get there.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After they met up with Annabella they left the town and Eric, Esmerda and Lord Silvermore took dragon form and flew to the lair while Annabella rode on Eric's back. After a short flight they arrived at the mountains that Tempest said hid Valor's secret lair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's it.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange that he would stay at a place like this. I thought that most influential dragons lived in the cities as humans.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do. But most keep such hidden lairs where they can get away from pretending to be human for a time. You should know. Despite training Annabella's knights and the fact that I'm a rich and powerful lord, Your mother and I still keep a cave lair occupied. It's also a good place to retreat to if they are ever discovered.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Are you sure he's in there though?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enforcers wouldn't send a force here if they weren't certain. Valor also goes on holiday around this time so I'm sure he's there.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment Eric sees a cloud of dust in the distance. Eric tried to see what it was but it was still to far for him to make out clearly. Tempest pulled out a looking glass and looked through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you see?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Horsemen. And some dragon-kin.\" replied Tempest. He handed the spyglass to Eric and he looked through it. Eric saw about 15 black armored knights riding towards the cave. 5 enforcers were running beside the horses. Despite being on foot, the enforcers easily kept up with the animals. Eric also saw far more weapons and shields strapped to the horses than needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"15 men and 5 dragon-kin.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many? Are you sure we can beat them?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not that worried about the knights. Especially since I'm sure Valor will be helping us. But those enforcers could be trouble. Remember, They are accustomed to fighting both knights and dragons. So watch your back in there.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get going then.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way to the cave and by the time they arrived, the enforcer force had already entered the cave. As Eric and the others stepped into the cave, they saw a large gold scaled dragon talking with the enforcers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what reason do you disturb me at my lair and why in such numbers, enforcer?!\" asked Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a kill order for you and we're here to make it happen.\" replied the enforcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A kill order?! that has to be a mistake! I've never done anything to endanger our race! What crime am I being accused of?!\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For choosing the wrong friends.\" said the enforcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?!\" asked Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to explain it to you, Valor. but first we have to deal with these renegades.\" said Tempest. The kill squad turned around and the leader stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! it seems I'm quite lucky today! The renegade and the target all in the same place. Saves me from hunting you down later. You've made my life easier. My report to the dragon lord will say that we heard that you planned to kill Valor but that we arrived too late to save him.\" said the enforcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting story. Too bad you won't be alive to tell it.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as overconfident as the reports say. KILL THEM!!!\" yelled the enforcer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two groups drew their weapons and charged at each other. Eric jumped into the air and knocked one of the knights to the ground. Before he could finish him though, another knight tried to stab Eric through with a halberd. Eric dodged the blow, then stabbed the man through the chest. He left his sword in the man and grabbed the halberd. He spun around and struck another knight with the halberd. Eric then sees a enforcer charge at him and Eric lifts his weapon to defend himself. The enforcer slashed right through the shaft of the halberd though, leaving Eric with two useless pieces of wood in his hands. Eric dropped the broken weapon and rolled backwards to avoid another strike, before pulling his sword from the dead body and taking a defensive stance. Before the enforcer could reach him again though, a sword rose in the air and flew at the enforcer and struck him through the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned and saw Esmerda and Annabella fighting back to back against several knights. As Eric rushed towards them, Annabella dodged a sword strike before striking the man in the face with her staff, as the man struggled to regain his balance, she knocked his feet out from under him with her staff, Then stab him in the chest with a sword she picked up from the ground. Another knight charged at her but she raised her hand and the knight's sword glowed red and began to burn the knight's hands, causing him to drop his weapon. She then pointed her staff at the sword and it rose from the ground and impaled it's own wielder. Behind Annabella, Esmerda was dueling two knights at the same time but she quickly dispatched them. Another knight was charging at her but she threw a ice ball at him. As it struck his chest he began to slow down as his body started freezing. He was frozen solid by the time he reached Esmerda and she shattered him with a single blow from her staff. As Eric got closer, he saw a knight raise a crossbow and aim at Annabella. He bent down and picked up a shield from the ground and jumped in front of Annabella. As Eric blocked the bolt, he crouched and Annabella threw a fireball over Eric's shoulder. It struck the knight in the chest and sent him flying backwards into a wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then looked how the others were doing. Lord Silvermore was fighting two enforcers at once. Several human knights were already dead around him. Despite his skill in battle he was struggling to keep the two enforcers at bay. At the back of the cave the remaining knights and enforcers had cornered Valor. The knights were equipped with spears and crossbows so they were able to keep Valor at a distance. Every time he tried to rush them they would force him back and his fire breath was having no effect on his attackers. He was already bleeding from several wounds. Tempest was already rushing towards him but Eric wasn't sure if he would be able to defeat the entire force by himself.</span></div></div>",

As Tempest got closer, one of the soldiers turned and fired his crossbow at him. Tempest tried to dodge it but he moved too slow and the bolt hit him in the shoulder. He roared with rage then continued rushing towards them. As more soldiers turned to fire at him, he went on all fours and jumped at the nearest wall. He then jumped from the wall at one of the soldiers and tackled him. As he landed on his feet again, he grabbed the soldier and threw him at his companions. The other crossbowmen were knocked off their feet and Tempest used the opportunity to close on them. As the spear men began to turn to him, Valor used the distraction to move forward and strike at them with his claws. Eric and Annabella was about to join the fight when the enforcer leader stepped in front of them. Tempest saw the danger and tried to reach them but several knights blocked his path and kept him from coming to their aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric rushed at the enforcer and struck at him but he easily blocked the blow before counter attacking causing Eric to step back. The enforcer continued to strike at him but Eric managed to block every strike. As Eric slashed at him,  the enforcer stepped past his guard and struck at Eric's left arm, causing him to drop his shield. Eric  retreated backwards but the enforcer jumped after him. Eric tried to strike back but the enforcer twisted through the air, then hit Eric in the face with the pommel of his sword. As Eric struggled to recover the enforcer kicked him in the chest, knocking him over and causing Eric's sword to fly from his hand. As Eric was lying on the ground dazed the enforcer stepped forward to finish him off. Before he could do so though Annabella threw a lightning bolt at him. The enforcer saw it coming and bent backwards and the bolt flied over him and struck the wall. He then charged at Annabella. She tried to hit him with her staff but he caught it in midair, tore it from her grip and then picked her up by the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric got to his feet again. He grabbed his sword and rushed to the enforcer before he could kill Annabella. He struck at the enforcer's back which caused him to drop Annabella. As he turned to face Eric, Annabella picked up her staff and hit the enforcer on the head with it. While he was dazed Eric stabbed his sword under the enforcer's chin and through his head, killing him. He then took a look around the cave and saw that all the attackers had fallen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit. You were the last person I expected to come to my rescue. I think it's time for you to tell me what's going on.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be my pleasure.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was sitting on a large rock while Annabella examined the wound on his arm. Close by Tempest had just finished telling Valor all that had happened. Esmerda was busy inspecting the bolt that was still in Tempest's shoulder. Valor was thinking about all that Tempest had said while Lord Silvermore was pacing around the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky it didn't go any deeper.\" said Annabella. She cast a spell and healed his wound. \"There all done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" said Eric. Eric got up from the rock and walked towards Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Irzac is using the enforcers as his personal assassins.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it would seem.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This couldn't get any worse! Even if we stop Irzac. The damage is already done.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The enforcers might be disliked but they are also respected. Many knights and dragons are hesitant to break the rules because they fear the enforcers. If news gets out that they have been tainted, then they will lose that respect. Then more dragons like Irzac will rise up and all human kind will hunt dragons, not just the few fanatics that we have now.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's best that people don't find out. I can keep the people in my kingdom from learning of this. Can the council do the same with dragon kind?\" asked Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible. I'm sure the council wouldn't want this to become common knowledge. But first we'll have to prove to them that Irzac is responsible. Tempest! You'll have to speak to the council and convince them.\" said Valor.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME! I don't think that's wise. The grand master will claim that I'm trying to point the finger at him to save my own hide. It would be .... AHH! what did you do that for?!\" said Tempest. As Tempest spoke, Esmerda suddenly grabbed the bolt in his shoulder and yanked it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It needed to be removed before I could heal you and if you were expecting it then it would have hurt more. Stop complaining. It's over now.\" said Esmerda. She cast a spell and Tempest's wound began to seal itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't accuse Irzac since I wasn't the one who found the conspiracy. My knowledge is only second hand. I understand your concern but remember that you have evidence and he does not.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. You make a good point. What about the grand master though? He can't be left in charge of security.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go to the council and tell them that I have evidence of an conspiracy and that security needs to be changed. I'll recommend that they delay the conclave for two weeks. That will undermine Irzac's plans and give the grand master's replacement time to fix the security. Which reminds me. Who do you want to take the grand master's place as head of security? With corruption so high I can't make such an decision without your help.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow-wing. He helped me find the evidence.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I'll make the arrangements. In the mean time I suggest that you lay low until the conclave. I own a small wine plantation at the borders of Firamore. It's off the record so even the enforcers don't know that I own it. You'll be safe there and it's closer to the conclave as well.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. But be careful! The enforcers might try to kill you again.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it. If I'm suddenly murdered then everyone will begin asking questions. But I'll be careful.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He avoided sending any messages to the plantation and didn't come there himself. Valor knew that the enforcers would try to kill Eric and the others before the conclave and he didn't want to lead the enforcers to where they were hiding. Spending the time waiting was extremely boring for them so they spent the time practicing magic or swordsmanship.  A later letter arrived from Valor telling them to meet him at Dragon Spire mountain for the conclave. After a day's traveling they arrived at the meeting point where Valor was already waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! I thought you had forgotten about us.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting. There was a lot to do here.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this over with.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid you can't go with us, princess. The council would never allow a human into our secret meetings. Only Eric, Silvermore and Tempest must meet with them.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My kingdom is the one being framed! I have a right to be there and why can't Esmerda go?\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only council members are allowed at the conclave. Eric and the others are the ones who discovered the conspiracy so they need to be there to talk to the council. You and Esmerda only joined with them afterwards.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is preposterous!!\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're angry, princess. But we must respect their wishes. Think of it this way. If we get in trouble then you will be in a position to come rescue us.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! But if you're not back in an hour then I'm going in whether the council likes it or not.\" said Annabella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything will be fine, princess.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked with Valor towards the mountain while Annabella and Esmerda stayed back at the camp. After a few minutes of walking they arrived at the base of the mountain. In front of them Eric saw a mine entrance. The entrance was large enough for all but the very largest of dragons to enter. Infernus and two other enforcers were standing guarding by the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valor! We've been expecting you did you bri...\" started Infernus. The moment they saw Tempest though they fell silent and grasped their weapons. \"Watch out Valor! That's a traitor to our order! He's already killed several enforcers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Infernus! He isn't the traitor. He was framed by the real traitor. The one we are going to expose today.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have evidence?\" asked Infernus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, We do and they point right to the grand master.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be! I've know him for years! He was always an honorable leader.\" said Infernus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no doubt. He's the one responsible for the murders of both enforcers and dragons. Tempest stopped the attempt on my life.\" said Valor. Infernus was silent as he considered the information. Finally he released the grip on his weapon and gestured for the others to do the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we will follow your lead.\" said Infernus. The enforcers took up positions behind them. While Eric and the others entered the tunnels. As they walked to the chambers they saw several enforcers patrolling the tunnels. There were many different paths and the tunnels kept twisting and backtracking. Eric knew that it was for defensive reasons and if he didn't have the others guiding him then he would have gotten hopelessly lost. After a long walk the tunnel finally ended at a massive chamber. Eric couldn't see a lot of the chamber but he could hear voices from inside the chamber. Valor blocked the entrance and turned to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait here until I call for you.\" said Valor. He entered the chamber and Eric heard an unknown dragon call out to Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valor! You've arrived! We've been most curious why the changes in security have been necessary. Please explain.\" said the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Dragon-Lord, for the inconvenience it may have caused you. But our security was compromised and some very powerful traitors are about to be exposed today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then speak.\" said the dragon-lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you all are aware. Several of our own have been murdered recently. Original reports claimed that it was humans who were hunting us but my sources revealed something far darker. That one of our own is responsible and that our own resources have been used against us. I myself was nearly a victim of this conspiracy. If my sources hadn't found me, then I would not be alive today.\" said Valor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Who is responsible for this and who is your source?\" said the dragon-lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will allow them to explain further, my Lord.\" said Valor. Eric and the others then entered the chamber and walked to where Valor was standing. Eric saw dragons all around him on both the ground and on a second level. Eric saw Irzac sitting among the other councilors. Everyone was starring at them as they approached. In front of them was a large Silver dragon standing on a raised platform. Eric assumed that he was the dragon-lord. A large dragon-kin with the same colored scales was standing beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!! Dragon-Lord this dragon-kin is a murdering traitor and these two's love of humankind is well known. They make poor witnesses.\" said the grand master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about their past. Only the evidence. I will hear them.\" said the dragon-lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will begin with the murders. Evidence pointed to the knights but they were innocent in this. I have logs that proved that the knights who supposedly did the attacks were elsewhere when the attacks took place. I also have a logbook from the one who supplies the order's equipment which shows that a large amount of the order's equipment was forged and delivered to someone outside of the order.\" said Tempest. He handed the logs to a dragon-kin who brought it closer to the dragon-lord so that he can examine it himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, so this clears the order's names. Were you able to find out who was responsible for this?\" asked the dragon-lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. It was the grand master and Irzac!\" said Tempest. The entire council gasped and murmured amongst themselves until the dragon-lord was able to silence them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are very grave accusations. I hope you can back it up.\" said the dragon-lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I would never have come before you if I couldn't prove it. I have orders written by Irzac to the grand master telling him who to murder as well as kill orders authorized by the grand master. They have been going after your supporters, my lord. For what reason I haven't been able to determine yet. Valor would have been next and several more would have been killed after him.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can confirm that. The force that tried to kill me consisted of both enforcers and the black armored knights that Irzac uses.\" said Valor. The dragon-lord studied the kill orders closely before speaking again.</span></div></div>",

The kill orders was authorized several months ago except for Valor's one.\" said the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. So?\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it couldn't be the grand-master. He requested a leave of absence during that time. I approved it myself.\" said the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He requested it but did he actually go?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can answer that! He was hunting a necromancer who was terrorizing his former tribe. The necromancer was raising the dead of the tribe to build a private army. The grand master hunted him down and destroyed him. I know because the grand master was staying with me and my family during the hunt.\" said one of the councilors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears that you are half right, Tempest. There is a traitor among the enforcers but it is not the grand master. Who was placed in charge while you were gone, Grand master?\" asked the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shadow-wing, Sir!\" said the grand master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Shadow-wing now?\" asked the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here, my lord!\" called Shadow-wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned to the direction of the voice and saw Shadow-wing standing at the doorway with several enforcers and many black armored knights. They were all armed with crossbows, which puzzled Eric. Although crossbows could hurt dragons it took several shots to kill one. Crossbow bolts were no more dangerous to Eric in dragon-form that darts were to a human. It took an extremely lucky shot or a skilled marksman to fell a dragon with a single shot. As a result very few dragon slayers used crossbows as their main weapon. Eric couldn't understand why trained professionals would make such a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this!!\" asked the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can answer that. Our people are tired of having a leader who sits around while the humans are declaring war on our race.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't the way, Irzac. If this is true then challenge my rule in the old way. If they really have a problem with my rule then they will side with you.\" said the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are too cowardly to do what must be done.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps this is just that YOU want!\" said the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter. I'm leader now and I will tell them what to do.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have given your soldiers better equipment. Crossbows don't frighten me.\" said the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These ones will.\" said Irzac. He signaled Shadow-wing who raised his crossbow to his shoulder and fired a bolt at the dragon lord. The bolt struck his chest, which penetrated his scales but didn't go deep enough to cause serious damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do bet...\" said the dragon lord. Before he could finish his sentence, he shrieked in pain and fell on his side. Eric saw the dragon-lord's veins begin to expand and turn black. \"What ... have you done to me?!\" asked the dragon lord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon's bane is quite a useful little plant, don't you think? Don't worry. The poison will cause your heart to explode in a minute, so your suffering won't be for much longer.\" said Irzac. The dragon lord tried to get up but his strength gave out and he fell again and died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon lord is dead! Long live Lord Irzac!\" called Shadow-wing. Eric took a step towards Shadow-wing but he aimed his crossbow at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think your human form will save you. The poison will still kill you.\" said Shadow-wing. The enforcers and soldiers surrounded their group and aimed their weapons at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must thank you, Tempest. This wouldn't have been possible without you. I tried to convince the grand master but he was too stubborn so I found someone more sympathetic.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he get to you, Shadow-wing? Did he tell you honeyed lies about our race's future?\" asked Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! nothing so noble. He promised that I would be the leader of the new enforcers. First things first. I think it's time you returned what you stole.\" said Shadow-wing. He stepped forward and dug through Tempest's bags until he uncovered the tome of the first necromancer. He then walked back towards Irzac's side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My plan was to slowly weaken the dragon lord's influence but then you came to Shadow-wing to target the grand master. I couldn't let such an opportunity go too waste.\" said Irzac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our people will not stand for this, Irzac! They will resist you!\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With what leader? The dragon lord is dead and you and the council is at my mercy. It's a pity Annabella isn't here but I'll find her soon enough. You three have been a thorn in my side for sometime. Luckily that thorn will be removed today. Kill Them!!\" said Irzac. Shadow-wing and the others raised their crossbows and prepared to fire when Irzac stopped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! They don't deserve a quick death. Kill them slowly.\" said Irzac. Shadow-wing smiled and put his crossbow down, then drew his weapons. Irzac's soldiers drew their blades and advanced on them from all sides. Eric, Silvermore and Tempest drew their weapons and stood back to back and prepared to fight. Eric knew that there was no hope of escape or victory but he planned to kill as many as he could before he fell. Before Irzac's men could reach them. Infernus rushed into the chamber with a few enforcers and attacked Irzac's men from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GO!! We'll cover your escape!\" yelled Infernus. Eric and the others ran past towards the tunnels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Infernus!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make this right!\" yelled Infernus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After them! Don't let them escape\" yelled Irzac. Eric and the others found complete chaos in the tunnels as enforcer was fighting enforcer. A few times the enforcers would turn and fight them which forced them to fight them off first, which delayed their escape. Without Valor guiding them they also took several wrong turns in the maze like tunnels. They just reached a fork in the tunnels when they heard Irzac's men getting closer to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't outrun them!\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take the path to the left! It leads to the exit. I'll hold them off!\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't defeat them all.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I can't. But I can hold them back long enough for you to escape and it would only be fair. I caused all this. My fate is here and I will not flee from it.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tempest! You can't blame ...\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say anything. Just promise me you'll make this right. Don't let him destroy our kind.\" said Tempest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go!! RUN!! and don't look back!\" said Tempest. He turned around and transferred his sword to his left hand. Once his right hand was clear, he closed his fist and the  blade called 'The Eye of the Hurricane\" appeared in his hand. He then took a defensive stance and prepared for the enemy attack. Eric didn't want to leave him but he knew that if he stayed then they would all die. So Eric reluctantly ran to the tunnel Tempest had pointed out with Lord Silvermore. After a moment Eric heard the sound of battle echoing behind them. A short while later Eric sees a bright light shining ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! I thought we'd never get out!\" thought Eric. Just as he reached the exit he heard a load crash behind him. Eric twisted around and saw that the tunnel had collapsed behind him. Lord Silvermore was staring at the rubble. \"The fighting must have weakened the supports.\" thought Eric. He ran to his father's side and put a hand on his shoulder which drew Lord Silvermore's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about Tempest but we have to go. We don't know how long it will take Irzac's people to find an way out and if they catch us then Tempest would have died for nothing.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" He took one last look at the rubble. \"Goodbye, old friend.\" said Lord Silvermore. They both then turned around and ran back to their camp where Princess Annabella was waiting.  </span></div></div>",

After he and Lord Silvermore had returned to their camp and informed Annabella what had happened. They traveled as fast as they could back to Firamore and warned Annabella's father of the danger. He wasn't happy that they went behind his back but accepted that nothing could be done about it now. He then called upon his allies and readied them for war. He placed Lord Silvermore in charge of the resistance forces and ordered him to rally as many as he could to his banner. Dragon Lord Irzac wasn't idle either, after freeing himself from the tunnels at the conclave. He sent enforcers to Arcania and the Enforcer Headquarters. Once they arrived they quickly forced them to swear allegiance to Irzac. Those who refused were executed and soon Irzac had almost the entire dragon-kin race on his side. Next he sent a agent to the necromancers and gave them the tome as promised. The necromancers provided Irzac with some of their spell casters which increased Irzac's forces greatly. Lastly Irzac had his loyalist force the dragons into supporting his war, either with coin or by joining his armies directly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilvermore's forces consisted of the knights in Sanctuary and Firamore as well as the elves from the Forest of the Fey. The few enforcers and dragons that managed to avoid Irzac's loyalists also joined them but they were few in number when compared to Irzac's forces. So far neither side had the forces to take out the other side without heavy losses, so they spent most of their time trying to sabotage the relations of their enemy's alliances, while trying to keep a hold of their own allies. Eric went on several such missions. Sometimes alone, other times with other agents like Annabella. It was during one such mission that Eric encountered Shadow-wing again. The mission was a success but Eric failed to kill Shadow-wing and was badly wounded in the fight. The healers tended to his wounds after he returned but they still said that he would need time to recover. They recommended that he stay in bed for several weeks. Eric meanwhile wanted to return to duty immediately. In the end his father supported the healers and confined Eric to bed for the last few weeks, but now the healers finally declared that Eric was fit to return to duty. Eric left the warehouse that served as the improvised healers tent. There were too many wounded for the usual place the healers worked so Annabella's father gave them the warehouse to serve as a unofficial healer's tent. He made his way to the castle, then walked through the halls towards the meeting chambers where the allies met to discuss the war. As Eric entered he saw Lord Silvermore and Annabella's father arguing. Eric kept his distance until they finished but they were talking so loudly Eric was able to hear the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't treat her like any other agent we have! If anything happens to her then it would affect my entire kingdom!\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would also affect your kingdom if we lost this war! You know how dire the situation is! We need all the help we can get to win. She's powerful and eager to help. It would be a waste to coddle her.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a princess! Not a common foot soldier! She has other responsibilities!\" said Annabella's father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware of that. But she's also a powerful mage. We have few enough spell casters in our forces. I understand your concern though. I'll try to keep her out of the more risky assignment. Will that satisfy you?\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!! But it will have to do.\" said Annabella's father. He then looked up and saw Eric waiting. \"We'll continue this discussion later.\" He then turned around and stormed out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The king doesn't approve of me using Annabella for missions. I need everyone if we're going to win this war. Are you ready to return to duty?\" asked Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been ready weeks ago.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry,son. But I couldn't risk one of my finest because he wasn't at his best. I needed you fully healed. We could use your help now.\" said Lord Silvermore. They looked at the map of the land. The territories loyal to them had blue flags pinned to them while enemy territories had red flags. The contested territories had both a blue and a red flag pinned to them. Eric saw that 2 new contested territories had come up since the last time he checked the map. Arcania, which was once Irzac's territory and The Forest of the Fay, which was once loyal to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arcania is contested? Have the Arcanians finally joined us?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. They're as stubborn as ever. But there is a opportunity there. The dragon-kin was once almost completely united under Irzac but my spies report that a new dragon-kin Chief have begun gathering tribes against Irzac's loyalists.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would I be able to help? Diplomacy isn't my strong suit.\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dragon-kin mistrust humans more than ever now So I need a dragon or dragon-kin to go to them and you're the only one that isn't already on a mission.\" replied Lord Silvermore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we know of this chief?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just about nothing. No name, No description. I don't even know what tribe he's from. Only thing I know is that he's charismatic and that his members follow him with a almost fanatical zeal.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can tear the dragon-kin tribes away from Irzac, then it would be a big win for us. They make up a large number of Irzac's forces.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't be easy. Dragon-kin have always disliked humans. The Arcanians aren't helping. They've attacked both Irzac's loyalists and the rebels. They're trying to stop a single dragon-kin from uniting the tribes. We would be asking them to help their enemies to overthrow their dragon creators. I also don't know the motives of this mysterious leader. Does he have a grudge against Irzac or is he just doing this to amass power for himself?\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the elves?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know. There was unrest among the elves before. The elven king has tried to calm things down but it only got worse after he rejoined us in fighting Irzac. The elven king has had to recall a large number of his forces to keep the peace. I suspect a elven lord who's sympathetic with Irzac has been stirring up the elves. Even the elven capital has begun to slip out of the king's grasp. We need to find out who's responsible or we'll lose the elves.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" asked Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the most important. I'll let you choose which one you want to do.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She's good with diplomacy too so I'm hopeful that she'll be able to solve the situation.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I going to meet with this chief if we don't know anything about him?\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't go directly to him. Instead I'll send you to a tribe that's loyal to him. You'll have to convince that chief to trust you and take you to meet this dragon-kin leader.\" said Lord Silvermore.

I need to know if there is a chance that we can gain the dragon-kin as a ally. If there isn't any hope then it might still be advantageous to kick out Irzac's loyalists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing. Even though you are a dragon, I doubt the chief I'm sending you to will trust you immediately. He'll probably send you to attack his enemies to prove that you can be trusted. If you have to fight the Arcanians, please use your dragon form. If a dragon attacks their forces they'll just assume it's another rogue dragon but they'll recognize you if you attack in human form. If they find out our forces are attacking them then they'll declare war and we already have enough enemies.\" said Lord Silvermore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do as you ask but I don't like it. The Arcanians aren't on Irzac's side. They're just trying to protect themselves.\" said Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it either but the Arcanians made their choice. Their greed, fear and stubbornness is putting us in danger now. Before you go. Can you please send Princess Annabella to me. I need to discuss her assignment with her.\" said Lord Silvermore. Eric left the room and went to where Annabella was waiting. After passing the message and saying his goodbyes, he left the city. Once he was a reasonable distance away, he took his dragon form and began to fly to Arcania. Eric heard about the hate and mistrust that most humans had for dragon kind now. So Eric, Silvermore and Esmerda continued to keep their dragon origins a secret from most. They were worried that if the people heard that their greatest champions were actually dragons, then the people would begin to lose faith in them.</span></div></div>",

Other times, someone stole something from them, and they are trying to track the thief down. Other times though, you're dealing with a rogue, one who has broken the laws of dragon society, and is at risk of being killed by them anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would put them at risk of that?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eating humans,\" said Erik. \"The problem is that those rogues give other dragons a bad name, and cause knights to come and hunt them down. My mother has had to deal with people like that, including my namesake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your namesake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Among dragon society, there's no better way to honor an enemy than to name one of your offspring after them,\" Erik said. \"My mother named me Erikzon, which means 'of Erik'. He was a knight that she'd fought, shortly before I was born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of him,\" the woman said. \"It's said that he killed a hundred dragons. Do you mean that your mother killed him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was defending her nest,\" Erik said, thinking quickly. \"She wasn't going to leave my egg, or the others, to be smashed. She did what she had to do. I guess it was a fight to remember, because when I emerged from my egg, she named me Erikzon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why would a dragon name their children after their enemy?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's out of respect,\" said Erik. \"That and it keeps angry spirits from coming after those who killed them. By naming one of your offspring after them, it puts the spirit to rest, and they won't bother you, especially in the Afterlife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErik smiled. For once, those lessons that Esmerda had given him on dragon lore were proving valuable. What he'd told the woman was indeed part of most dragons' beliefs, that naming a son or daughter after a fallen enemy kept their spirit from tormenting you, especially in the Afterlife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that you can get home alright?\" Erik asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him and said.....</span></div></div>",

Yet there not completely wrong though. Ever since I was a child I had unusual powers. Yet I can never use them at will for I don't know their origin. I grew up with my father but I never knew my mother. My father said that she died right after I was born having sustained serious injuries from a witch hunter. All of my life I've been running from village to village and town to town hoping to seek someone who could help me. I was finally lucky to find the village of Dracoson. There a noble and his wife took me in and taught me who to use my powers somewhat. Before the village was burned down the noble and his wife gave me this book. The only problem though is that I can't figure out what language that it is in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me take a look.\" Eric said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman hands him the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... No wonder why you're not able to read it. It's written in the Draconian tongue. Only a dragon or someone who knows how to speak the language can understand it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draconian? I've read Elvish and Orcish along with many other human languages, but never Draconian. Yet I think the noble was well versed in just about every language and his wife as well. Yet when it comes to spell's I know several, but what use are they if I can't tap into my gift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like I could teach you how to read Draconian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At what price? If I remember correctly that if a human makes a deal with a dragon they must offer something in return\" The woman says raising her hands in the air only for Eric to notice her birthmark on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me your name and how you acquired such a birthmark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The name's Esmerelda Starling. According to my father both he and mother had it. My father dared not to let me know anything about my family history for he died six years ago on my 14th birthday. He died of natural causes from a terrible case of the flu. He was skilled at magic like my mother was but claimed that he couldn't use his powers or else risk being exposed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric then realize that woman was a Dracomancer, a magic user who is able to wield both sword and magic but usually preferring one over the other sometimes trained in both. Eric even remembers hearing legends that they have the ability to summon dragons and sometimes through the use of magic turn into dragons with free reign between both forms. Of course normal dragons could learn dracomancy in order to blend in with the human populace but it takes a long time to perfect while Dracomancers learn their craft faster. This is due to an ancient tale of dragons once breeding with humans in order to bring peace, a peace broken due to a rogue dragon and a wicked Dracomancer. Since then dragons and anyone who practices the magical arts have been hunted down either by the church, state, or sometimes both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you come with me and I'll find you a safe spot where no one will look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmerelda then nods feeling faint from her injuries. Eric puts Esmerelda on his back and he finds an abandoned fortress that hasn't been used in years. Which is just a minute away from the cave if flying however twenty minutes by foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here and I'll bring you something in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Eric takes off heading back to the cave so Esmerda doesn't decided to roast his human body if he doesn't return. Esmerelda then sighs wishing to thank her unlikely hero in some form. She then spots a sword. She unsheathes it to see it is unused. She then remembers her lessons in swordplay from her father and practices on a dead tree. Esmerelda then notices that on the sword the name \"Eric\" is engraved on it thinking it a rather strange coincidence that the knight's famous sword had the same name as her draconian rescuer. She then begins to wonder if it's possible if they one in the same only later to dismiss the idea. </span></div></div>",

It took a few minutes for them to learn to coordinate their movements together, but they soon got the hang of it, and they quickly began scrambling towards the cave's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they reached the mouth of the cave, they saw the open fields, beyond, and for a moment, they were happy to be free. \"Y'esss, wey're gonna be freee,\" Eric said, just in time to see a shadow drop in front of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShiny, obsidian scales. Large, imposing wings. Definitely the dragon who had forced him to become this form. \"Where are you two going, my little ones?\" she crooned, obviously amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aoh, no, not her,\" Eric heard his other half remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Brian, that's no way to treat your mother,\" she said patiently.

The sky was blocked out by black scales, but Eric and his body-mate ignored the towering underbelly above them and scrambled towards the greenery beyond, running right beside the massive tail. They ran as fast as they could, Esmerda still searching around her legs angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric turned his head completely around, relying on the other head to keep guiding them. He saw Esmerda look up and sweep her gaze accross the open plain. Her wild eyes settled on their retreating form. <i>Oh crap</i>, Eric thought. \"Get back here, you little brats,\" Esmerda roared, chasing after them. As Eric watched her advance, he heard the heavy bounding leaps, and he knew that within momments she would be upon them, able to pin them down, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In heey're,\" the other dragon head said, redirecting Eric's attention to a hole underneath a large tree, no more than five feet in diameter, but plenty big enough for him to fit through. The pounding feet got louder and louder as she closed the distance, her claws raking up dirt with each step. Eric didn't take a moment to reconsider, so he jumped down the whole as fast as he could, falling a good fifteen feet, to land at the bottom. Their momentum was softened by some soft, moss-covered dirt, and when they looked to their left, they saw a tunnel that led deeper underground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsmerda wasn't about to give up, though.

Yet the death of Lord Eric had sent a new wave of fear throughout the villagers, which served our hitherto unnamed dragon well. The dragon was free to hunt meat without anything else than feeble protests from the humans. In truth, the dragon found it rather regrettable to have to steal from innocent humans, but it was the life of the unborn little one or that of the humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's spirit drifted in this limbo for what had seemed like forever. How long had he been in here? He had no idea really, as there was no way to sense time. It could have been years, centuries or even millenia for all he knew. Yet for the longest time, Eric's was just content to lay there, in limbo. Over that time, he forgot about his life, what he had done, who his family had been, or any of that, and that by now, whenever now was, he had but the vaguest sense of who or what he once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, there was a feeling that his little world had suddenly become cramped for whatever reason. He tried moving about, not very successfully, but a little. Then, he moved some more, and he heard what could only be described as an audible crack. Then, there was another crack. Then another, until finally his entire world had broken apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing that Eric sensed was one of being inexplicably cold, and that his body was covered with some strange, sticky fluid. Eric, if one could still call our former human that, could not see a thing, but wherever the hatchling was, it wasn't in that comforting place anymore. There was a pain that bit at the front of the new born. There was something that he wasn't getting, but absolutely needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, the hatchling opened its tiny jaw, and let out a squeal as it took in its first breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatchling heard sounds. Sounds... sounds of what? The hatchling could not tell at all. The sounds grew closer, and there was nothing that the hatchling could possibly do to stop it from coming, as it was absolutely helpless. What eventually came was...</span></div></div>",

Somehow the hatchling remembered.... that the voice had not sounded so melodious, that it had been dreadful and menacing, yet how could that possibly be the case? Vaguely, it was aware that there had been a time it had been at odds with that particular dragon, yet for what reason it could hardly fathom. How could one possibly be at odds with mother? What it did know was that the hatchling was completely dependant upon mother, and without her the hatchling would die. More instinctively, she brought warmth, as it used her tongue to lick the egg fluid from the hatchlings body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... open your eyes little one. Open your eyes!!\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if powered by a spell, the hatchlings eyelids began to struggle. It was surprisingly painful, to perform what one would think such a simple act as opening ones eyes, but the hatchling was determined, powered by its mother's command. Then, with a sharp, almost violent jerk, the hatchlings eyes shot open. Its vision was instantly assaulted by an array of light, which drifted into several colors, before finally focusing into a tangible image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hatchling saw was a huge dragon, mother, towering over it. There was a sense of power about her; of imperviousness, but also of absolute and unrelenting love. She would give her life to protect the hatchling if need be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to name you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatchling tilted its head up.

But, he knew that mother would not like his pickiness, so he only looked up at her, hoping that she would get the message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him interrogatively, her large eyes both reassuring and concerning Emerald. \"Do you not want it, little one?\" she asked, moving in close to nuzzle his face for a moment. Her left eye rested a feet inches away from his face, and he let out a small squeek to indicate his choice, hoping that she would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" she said, withdrawing and looking appreciatively at him. \"Humans taste horrible, anyway.\" She turned to the captive, who apparently expected death by breath, as he immediately began to scream again. Emerald watched as mother, the most powerful being in the world, slipped her claw under the human's bonds and cut them loose, looking complacently at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human slowly backed up, his hands raised in front of him defensively. Mother continued to watch him, and Emerald wondered if she was going to do anything to him. When he thought that he was a good distance away, the human turned and ran pell-mell for the nearest cover, a nearby forest outcropping. Mother continued to watch him retreat, doing nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the human was out of sight, mother turned back to Emerald, who immediately chirped his approval of her behavior. Her eyes smiled, and she approached him again in the way known only to loving mothers. Emerald immediately raced towards her, placing his two front claws, still sporting a bit of encrusted embryonic fluid, on one of her massive claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, my sweet little boy,\" mother said, before moving in to nuzzle him again. Emerald complied, enjoying the contact, though something in the back of his mind rebelled, he ignored it and focused on the loving of his mother. </span></div></div>",

He'd been inside the egg for many, many years, though how long, he did not know. At first, he had rehearsed who he was and why he was here, every day, counting the days, which turned into months, then years, ten, twenty, fifty, even one hundred. He kept counting, desperate to keep his mind, as he had felt something in him desire for love, from his mother, a powerful, mighty dra--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eric shook himself, telling himself that he was human, that those thoughts placed in his mind weren't real, that the dragon who placed him here was NOT his mother. After all, he had been placed in the egg of a dragon, not turned himself into a dragon, right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Then, the doubt started. What if those thoughts weren't as foreign or artificial as he thought? What if they were real? What if--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMovement froze his thoughts. Something above his egg was shifting, he could feel the heat coming from it change, but Eric dared not guess what it was, considering the implications. Then, the heat was gone. <i>No</i>, he thought, <i>not yet!</i> He immediately silenced the unruly thoughts, telling himself that even if 100 years had passed, he was still-- the world surrounding him was growing cold, and it was starting to grow smaller. The tough egg shell contracted around his body, and for a moment, Eric feared strangulation. <i>I'm gonna die</i>, he thought sadly. He felt difficulty breathing, and it started to choke him, no air, no air, no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe egg shell wall cracked, letting in some air. Eric took in some deep, wonderous breaths of air. The egg continued to contract, and it cracked around his body, eventually cracking completely away, releasing Eric, who flopped over in exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were closed, but he could hear something stirring nearby, and the something was big. Eric knew who it was, and he wanted to move away, but he knew that he couldn't, his legs wouldn't respond. He was covered in disgusting embryonic fluid, and he couldn't see a thing. His eyes were sealed shut, and the only thing he could do was flop around, like a broken toy doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large presence moved closer, as Eric's struggles to move came closer. Something began pressing in the back of his mouth: his body was urging him to open his mouth. <i>No</i>, he thought, I won't, I won't be crying out like-- Sudden contact on the top of his head surprised him, and his body released the squeak he had been fighting to hold in. <i>Stupid body</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, there, <i>my baby</i>,\" the mother dragon said. \"You're hungry, I see.\" She snorted for a moment, something Eric realized was laughter. \"Oh wait, you {i{can't see~\" She broke out into outright laughter, a deep, rumbling sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've had my fun,\" she said before moving in very close, no,<i> too </i>close. Eric felt warm breath on the side of his head, and he tried to lean away, but his body would not cooperate, simply flopping over to the other side, as the dragon approached closer, amusement evident in her smell. She licked his eyelids, unlocking them, allowing Eric to open them gingerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he saw when he looked up made his heart both leap in joy and stop in terror. The entire world above him was taken up by the dragon, her black scales taking up his entire field of vision. A small peep emitted from his mouth, once again unwanted and unbidden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon spoke, her nose pressing against his. \"Oh, how good to see that my new baby can see well.

You don't what a drake is. A drake is a male dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric began struggling as his mother, no, his enemy leaned closer...right? As much as Eric hated to admit it, just seeing the larger dragon made him feel safe and loved, but she was his enemy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the ground began rumbling as heavy footsteps from another dragon drew near. Eric began stumbling to his feet as a male dragon with white scales entered the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home sweet home...\" The male dragon said as his eyes trailed to the confused wrymling. The dragon smirked as he looked upon Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's mind swirled as part of him wanted to run up to his father, no, the black dragon's mate and part of him wanted nothing to do with either of the dragons, yet the voice of the white dragon sounded calm, loving, and eerily familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, how was your hunt?\" The black dragoness asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't have asked for a better day,\" the white dragon said. \"I bet our son is hungry. I have just the thing for a growing drake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white dragon left to go bring Eric some food. Eric's belly growled causing him to squeak in confusion. The dragoness chuckled as Eric tried to stand on his legs and run off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patience little one. Your father will be back with you food in a minute,\" the black dragon said. \"However, we must get you cleaned up my child. I want to see color your scales are. That goop from the egg you hatched from is hiding your true color.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that dra... Mother mean?\" Eric thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally, Eric tried fighting off his new draconic instincts, but his sense of self began to slowly fade away. His core beliefs about protecting humans and slaying evil dragons remained, however he began to crave the attention of his parents. His strong mother and mighty yet gentle father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric followed his mother to a pool at the far end of the cave his father brought in the carcass of a giant bull and followed closely behind. Once near the shimmering pool Eric leaned forward and fell in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric began panicking as he struggled to reach edge, almost in danger of drowning. Luckily he grabbed onto a ledge and was assisted up by his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright. Mother and Father are here little one,\" the dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mesindra, shouldn't we give our young drake a name. Surely, his original human name would be foreign to him by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric squeaked in protest. \"I do have a name! It's ...What is my name and what's a human? Are they friends and when can I play with them?\" Eric thought as the last of human memories faded to nothing leaving only a curious young dragon with a curiosity for humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point Barthaxar,\" Mesindra said. \"We shal call him...</span></div></div>",

As the blackness of sleep withdrew from his mind, his memories of the fight with the black dragon returned.  Remembering his finial moments before blackness took him brought him fully awake.  He opened his eyes and sat up quickly, but then fell back to the ground with blinding pain ripping through his skull and the entire world spinning around his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to move a little more slowly.\"  A voice said from behind him.  \"The transference spell usually leaves one rather shaky for a while, though I admit I have no idea what happens for a human.  As far as I know its never been done before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting against the pain and dizziness, Eric turned to look behind him.  Lounging against a wall on the other side of the cave was the black dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\"  Eric spat, part of him noticing that his voice sounded off.  \"What did you do to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what I said I would.  I've given you the chance to experience life as a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric blinked at the dragon, not understanding, but then several things slowly dawned on him.  First, the the dragon didn't seem quiet so large as he had been before.  Second, that the entire cave seemed brighter than before.  And third, that he was still lying on his side with his back to the dragon, even though he was looking straight at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, Eric looked down at himself . . . and saw the massive scaly body of a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear and anger in equal measure flashed through Eric and he leaped to his feet . . . or he tried to.  First, he smashed his head into a low hanging stalactite, causing bright spots of light to flash in front of his eyes.  Then he tripped over his own tail, sending him tumbling down into a pit filled with oddly shaped objects that clattered and poked at him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove him, Eric could hear the dragon chuckling.  Anger flashed through him again, and he started trying to untangle his various limbs, but then he froze when he found himself staring into the empty eye sockets of a dragon skull.  slowly, Eric lifted his head and looked around.  The pit he had fallen into was filled with dragon bones, each one of them seeming to gleam to his newly altered sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, welcome to the Dragon's Graveyard.  You should feel honored, no human has ever set eyes on it before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you bring me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I created your new dragon body here.  You see, we dragons can create a new body from the bones of out ancestors, and then transfer our souls into it.  Its how we seem to be immortal to you humans.  I simply created a new body, and then transferred your soul into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  What do you hope to gain from this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You monkeys are obtuse, aren't you?  I want to give you the chance to live as a dragon, like I've already said twice.  As for what I hope to gain, well I've got my reasons, and they're staying mine for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should kill you now then.\"  Eric growled as he dragged himself out of the pit.  \"What to keep me from doing that, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for one, the fact that until you figure out how to move in that body you're only a danger to yourself.  And for another, the fact that I have this.\"<br>\r\nthe dragon moved his claw, revealing Eric's body lying on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\"  It said before Eric could speak.  \"Your body is still alive, and i can send you back at any time.  However, it won't live long without food and water, and even if it gets that, it will still slowly wither away from disuse.  To stop that, I've placed under a spell that will preserve it just as it is until you take up residence again.  That spell is tied to my life force.

The black dragon stepped far enough away from the cave mouth to allow Eric to exit, then he turned around, sat down, and studied Eric thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he said after a moment, \"it looks like your a</span></div></div>",

You're a human who has been turned into a dragon. Not just any human. You're Sir Eric of Moonvale. Serves you right for hunting our kind down like animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know?\" Eric asked. Eric felt uneasy around the blue dragoness. Without realising it Eric had caused the magical springs to start bubbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool it pal. Magical springs are rare to come by,\" the dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric tries to calm himself down. After a few minutes the springs stop bubbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to teach you how to control your powers. However, the water is now nice and hot. It's actually quite relaxing,\" Zartax said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and the dragoness look at each other before heading into the springs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. This feels marvelous,\" the dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that again. The name's Zartax. It it looks like you've heard about Eric or I should say Erikzon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Mavalor. I'm a Stormbringer. I can control the seas and create storms. So you're the dragon that turned this fool into one of us. Got to give you praise for that. A life in our feet should teach this ignoramus humility,\" the dragoness said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly what I was thinking. Hey Mavalor, I just got an idea. Would you mind teaching Erikzon about how we dragons live? I can only teach him so much, but the finer things may require assistance,\" Zartax said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric gulped as the two dragons grinned. Are they planning on having him do what they think they are plotting.</span></div></div>",
