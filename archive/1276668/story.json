If there's anything added to that, don't get it 'cause Klonoa likes to scribble stuff on. I want him to get some self control, for crying out loud... I mean, what's the point of going camping if you're bringing all your comforts with you?

It seemed like ages since he had had contact with anyone, well besides clank that is. It was about noonish and he had still not gotten out of bed, he really didn't see the point any more. Nothing happened anymore. Sighing he heaved out of his cot and headed downstairs where Clank would probably be waiting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSix months have passed since the dynamic duo had returned from their last quest to save the galaxy. Since then, the two hadn\u2019t needed to participate in these activities and have stayed dormant since their last excursion. In fact, most forms of physical excursion was eliminated from their lifestyles. Of course, every once in a while a bolt needed to be tightened or some other menial task needed to be fulfilled yet their lives seemed empty. Needless to say, this lack of exercise has played a small toll on ratchets physical stature. His figure looked a bit thicker than it had six months ago, he was a long way from fat and still a bit of weight from even chubby, his shape was just a bit softer. He was no longer visibly muscular but only on the fringe of being considered toned. Ratchet didn't really mind or notice as the weight was so minimal that a week of intense workouts would put him back in his old 'hero' shape. Rounding the corner to the kitchen he spotted clank.<br>\r\n\"Mornin\u2019' Clank\" <br>\r\n\u201cWell, that would be a stretch, it\u2019s past noon Ratchet.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026whatever it\u2019s not like we have anything to do.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAs a matter of fact I have some news. A new shopping center has just opened up not far from here. The ad in the paper says that it has that it has some restaurants, a Jiffy Loob, a heath and fitness store, and a Gadgetron Ship Shop.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWell, maybe we can find something to do. I guess we\u2019ll\u2026</span></div></div>",

Wait did you say it was noon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cyes ratchet, I believe that I did.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I haven\u2019t eaten since last night I\u2019m starving. Lets grab something at one of those restaurants and then we\u2019ll check out the other stores. Lemme\u2019 just get ready.\u201d Clank just stared at Ratchet as he bounded through the house looking for his clothes that he was going to wear out and the assortments of gadgets that ratchet \u2018needed\u2019 in order to leave the house. Finally, after several minutes of ratchet sprinting around the house he arrived back at clank, short of breath. With his hands on his knees he panted, \u201cHey clank, have you seen the keys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean these?\u201d Clank responded sarcastically, \u201cHe-heheheh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGimme those.\u201d Swiping the keys from Clank the two proceeded to the vehicle parked in the driveway. Ratchet had picked out his old clothes from before he started adventuring sporting his turquoise blue pants and a bare upper half. The pants were a little bit snugger than they were but again, it was only marginal. An onlooker would only notice some tautness if they were looking for it. The pair proceeded to exit the house and walk to their hover car. The day was mild yet clear giving ratchet he perfect opportunity to drive way to fast. After starting it up, the duo rocketed across the planet's surface. A trail of dust spewed from behind as the vehicle screamed across the planets arid crust. During their travel little words were shared as a fear of choking on the sand, dust and the risk of swallowing a random insect made it unwise to do so. In about five minutes the pair entered the complex. \u201cWow, Clank, look at this place. It\u2019s huge!!\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes Ratchet, my scanners indicate that this is the largest\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou bet it is!\u201d Just than another rumble, this time louder, was emitted from ratchets gut. \u201cAaghh, Clank I\u2019m starving where do you think we should go?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Ratchet I do not plan on eating so I\u2019ll leave it up to you. We can go to the Buffet restaurant, a diner and there is one more but I cannot make out the sign.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRatchet was starving and salivating. \u201cMind if we check out the\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tEach   restaurant looked delicious. Ratchets head swiveled as he looked in the windows of each of the bistros. Clank began to notice the blank stare on his face and the drool beginning to trickle out of his mouth. \u201cAhem, Ratchet I\u2019m heading over to jiffy lube, I have a coupon for a complementary oil change. I will see you when I\u2019m done and\u2026try to control yourself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cyeah uhuh, jiffy lube got it.\u201d Clank stared blankly at Ratchet and shook his head, and headed off in the opposite direction. Ratchet had made his decision, he was up for the challenge and began to walk towards the buffet. But as he went into his pocket to grab his wallet his hand found nothing. He stopped dead in his tracks. His ears drooped and a wave of sadness washed over his face. He frantically felt around in his pockets and came up with 10.43$ in coins and small bills, but no wallet. Not enough for the buffet or to get anything substantial at the diner. He almost walked over to jiffy lube to ask Clank if he had any money on him when he remembered the third concession. He did a 180 and saw the shady looking place, he contemplated on weather or not he should eat there but the idea of missing another meal or having to ask Clank was not an option. He headed  towards the restaurant and walked through the unusually wide entrance. The door chimed as he walked in as he was met with the odor of grease, grease and more grease. Again, the hunger was too much so he settled down at the counter. The stools were hard and seemed to have been covered in some sort of drink leaving them rather sticky. Ratchet chuckled to himself on the disgustingness of the \u2018new\u2019 restaurant until he was met with his sever. Ratchet was taken aback and almost fell off the stool. The waiter was, nicely put, hideous. He stared at ratchet with what Ratchet presumed to be his working eye and grunted, \u201cwuthca havn\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRatchet sat in awe at the most revolting\u2026thing, he\u2019d ever laid eyes on. \u201cUh,Uh, I\u2019ll have a cheeseburger and a soda\u2026please?\u201d The man (ratchet hoped) nodded and walked into the kitchen and returned quickly with his burger and drink. Ratchet was shocked at the rapid service and then saw his food. The burger might have been the largest burger he\u2019d ever seen. It was closer to a pizza pie than a hamburger and had ratchet swearing that it was the size of his face. However it wasn\u2019t just the sheer size of the piece of meat but the amount of artery clogging grease that oozed out from between the buns. He assumed that he could power his car on the stuff for weeks. He picked it up and stared at it. It was not appetizing. His stomach gurgled again and Ratchet began to question if this food was worth it. The bartender interrupted his thought process abruptly with his gruff voice \u201cThere a problem?\u201d Ratchet in fear of getting the bartender angry or any closer to him quickly replied, \u201cNo, No, no problem at all\u2026 umm sir.\u201d and immediately took a bite of the behemoth burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tExpecting the burger to taste more similar to sewage than a burger he was pleasantly surprised, in fact, the burger was pretty good. Ratchet took another bite and another, soon, he was munching away at the huge burger. Although on a scale of 1-10 the burgers greasiness more closely resembled a 17 Ratchet continued to enjoy thick burger anyway. As he progressed his one ravenous pace slowed as he finished just over half the burger. His chewing and swallowing became extremely heavy due to himself feeling fuller and fuller. Ratchet released a hearty burp when he had eaten about three quarters of the burger. He had put it down give himself a break. \u201cOoohh, my stomach.\u201d Slowly he began to rub his gut which was now slightly bloated and hard to the touch. Just then Ratchets favorite waiter passed by. \u201cYou dun\u2019 wit chat?\u201d He questioned with a raised brow. Ratchet responded with a small nod as he continued to massage his now taunt middle. \u201cShame it is thun, if you dun finished this un\u2019, the secon\u2019 un\u2019 wuz free.\u201d  It was when he spoke that last word that Ratchet\u2019s ears perked up, \u201cFree?\u201d He asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMhhum.\u201d The waiter responded in his usual grunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m finished than,\u201d the waiter looked at ratchet in disbelief, shrugged and left the table. There was no denying that Ratchet was full, quiet full but there was also no denying that Ratchet was very, very, cheap. Ratchet sat and stared at the piece of meat looking him in the face, almost daring him to finish it. The bread was saturated with grease and the burger sagged over the edges overflowing the contents of the bun. Although ratchet had finished about three quarters of the burger there was still a good amount of meal left, a little less than what would be considered a regular burger. His hands shaking Ratchet picked up the burger and took a huge bite out of what was remaining. He slowly chewed the bite enjoying the greasy goodness and after bracing himself, swallowed the behemoth amount of food that was in his mouth. Quickly before he could feel the pressure build inside him he grabbed the final piece of burger and shoved it in. Swallowing he could feel the hunk of meat travel down his throat and plop in his stomach. He peered down, looking at a new yellow bulge that had taken a home on his midsection. His stomach stuck out about two inches causing his pants to take a choking hold on his waist. He had never felt so full in his entire life. \u201cOohh, my stomach,\u201d he moaned as he slowly rubbed his bloated gut. But while Ratchet was rubbing his distended gut he didn\u2019t notice the movements of the waiter until Ratchet heard the clang on the table. Opening his eyes and looking were he heard the noise he saw another giant burger. \u201cMhmm, her\u2019s ur free \u2018un then.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRatchet sat and stared at the burger, took a deep breath and swallowed and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Can I have this to go...?\" The waiter raised would could have been an eyebrow, and snorted, but pulled a cardboard box from nowhere and slipped the huge burger into it. He held a hand out and stared at Rachet. Rachet stared blankly in return. He felt light-headed, and couldn't feel anything except for the ball of food in his stomach. The waiter glared impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Youse gonna pay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachet flushed slightly and fished around in his pocket for his money. He handed it to the waiter, and the waiter disappeared, leaving Rachet moaning softly, all by himself. As he gradually regained control of his legs, he heaved himself to his feet. Clank should be done by now, and he wasn't in the mood for shopping anymore. He just wanted to collapse in front of his entertainment system, and do nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClank was waiting for him outside the Jiffy Lube. He eyed Rachet's distended stomach straining against his pants, but didn't comment. Rachet spoke first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to go?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClank nodded, and together, they made their way back to Rachet's vehicle. Almost as soon as they got into the hovercar, Rachet unbuttoned his belt and pants, and his distended belly rushed out to free itself from its fabric prison. As little was said on the drive home as the drive to the mall. Rachet was driving with one hand on the wheel, and one hand caressing his bloated gut. He shouldn't have eaten so much, but it was irresistible. He got such cheap food, which tasted better than anything he could cook, and was cheaper than buying the raw food and cooking it himself anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis waistline would just have to deal with it. Rachet smirked. He was a hero; he could lose his tiny belly whenever he wanted to. His slightly softer frame was nothing: He'd be able to get his hard hero body back anything he wanted. For now, he could do whatever he wanted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Upon reentering his home Ratchet put the leftover burger in his fridge. Too tired to go upstairs, he passed out on the couch and his body began the task of digesting the hunk of meat that resided in Ratchet\u2019s stomach. Hours later, he woke up to a noise. He quickly sat up and brushed the sweat off his brow, realizing the noise was his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow can you possibly still be hungry?\u201d He initially considered ignoring it but a second grumble from his gut convinced him otherwise. Ratchet walked over to the fridge and pulled out the box that held the hamburger. After heating it up Ratchet placed a hand on his small stomach and thought, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get fat...\u201d but then convinced himself that just one more hamburger wont do too much harm. But Ratchet knew that this wasn\u2019t really just one hamburger. This burger like the one he ate for lunch was gigantic and more like four grease laden burgers instead of one. His mind, however was made up and brought the meal back to the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter his first bite he was in a trance. The burger was delicious. He continued to eat the burger without a thought for anything else. It was just Ratchet and his food. About 10 minutes later he sprawled out on the couch and came out of his food induced high. \u201cUuughh.\u201d Was all he could murmur. He felt a lead weight inside his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy did I....How did I eat that?\u201d He thought. Rubbing his stomach he noticed a defined bulge. Thoughts of an obese version of himself raced through his mind. He then came to a conclusion. Out loud he said, \u201cI\u2019m never going to eat one of those... delicious, wonderful...burgers...\u201d he trailed off. The food was too good to swear off, he was addicted. Slowly he sat up and decided to weigh himself before came to any more ultimatums. Clutching his distended stomach he slowly walked into the bathroom down the hall and stepped on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn his tip-top hero\u2019s shape Ratchet weighed about 115lbs (he was only 5 feet tall) and he assumed that he would clock in at about 120. The numbers spun around and rested at 130. Ratchet (forgetting that he lost about 5lbs of muscle since his last weigh in) decided that he could still lose all the weight and that the excess food hadn\u2019t hurt him that much. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he thought, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work for months now, the burgers couldn\u2019t have done all of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe mirror told another story. Ratchets stomach bowed out past his chest and rested atop his pants. \u201cLemme see something....\u201d he mumbled. He then sucked his stomach in and reassessed his figure. He smiled as he looked like he had before his first introduction to the hamburgers. Seeing as the problem was solved he Happily relaxed his stomach causing it to flop back into it\u2019s distended shape and waddled back to the couch, passing out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUnsurprisingly, Ratchet continued to eat at the restaurant and could now (almost) consume two of the giant hamburgers in one sitting. By the end of the first week of his new diet he had gained another 5 lbs.  However, contrary to what Ratchet previously thought he wasn\u2019t alone in the restaurant. While in the middle of another burger binge, two creatures approached Ratchet\u2019s table. Once getting Ratchet\u2019s attention the taller of the two said, \u201cMe and my buddy here have been watching you this past week and noticed that you can really put these things away.\u201d To which the shorter nodded and Ratchet cocked an eyebrow. He continued, \u201cHow would you like my partner and I to sponsor you in an upcoming eating.....tournament?\u201d</span></div></div>",

They'd need all the hands they could get...\" Ratchet pulled out his cool future-tech-phone once he got home, pressed a few buttons, selected the restaurant on a 3d-rendered map, and waited for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was expecting the the usual \"You've reached the ____ service desk, how can I help you?\" automatic response thing, but to his half-surprise there was a rough and simple \"Whaddya want, I don't got all day.\" from a coarse middle-aged female voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRatchet responded, \"Um, yeah, I'd like to wo-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna work here?\" the gruff voice interrupted. \"No idea why you'd wanna, but yeah, lemme just get your info here...\" Ratchet heard the sounds of some keys on a keyboard being pressed. \"So you're Ratchet the Lamb-Box. Okay I'll tell ya what, you can come here any time in the daylight to let us see how well you can do the stuff we do around here, like flipping burgers, putting burgers together... flipping burgers, you know all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRatchet chuckled to himself. \"So, I could just come in right now? By the way, it's prono-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure, whatever, just come in and I can probably give you 40 hours a week, maybe more if we think you're worth it. We get a lotta business cause we're cheap, you know, and we'd get more if we could just get someone to work on our damn sign and make it flashy and stuff.\" Ratchet's ears perked up as he listened to the voice carry on. \"I mean yeah, it's a robot world out there, but they're all at those fancier places and they don't even need food, those rusty cans walking around... hey wait, your specs say that you can fix stuff, would you be okay doing that too? We'd pay you more than usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll do that too!

But with space-age technology, flipping huge things is as easy as it is to flip little things in our world. Ratchet was surprised at how much grease went into the things, and all the junky bottom-of-the-barrel ingredients that went into it with some cheap flavoring to make it edible. But they sold well, and Ratchet got an appetite from watching all the food being prepared. \"Ugh, this stuff would kill me though, or at least my figure, ha ha...\" Ratchet paused a second from looking at the burgers he was flipping/arranging to glance down at his stomach, which was still large from the burger he had earlier. He hated to admit it, but it was the best burger he had ever had, and he wanted more. But he was making food for other people, not for himself, and it was better that he didn't have anything to do with consuming the junk. He thought he could serve the stuff, but the races of malformed aliens that frequented the place thought he looked weird, and would rather have a familiar, nauseating face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the manager, a hideous blob-monster thing too weird-looking for words announced to Ratchet...</span></div></div>",

Oh well, I guess the stuff's expensive then...\" He walked to the back room of the store where the employee vending machine was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Ratchet's surprise, all the snacks were HUGE, and really cheap too.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a year since the Star fox team had defeated the Aparoid invasion and saved the Lylat System once again and life was beginning to return to its previous state. Sippy had returned to his annoying habit of talking, Rob began malfunctioning again and Fox had gone back whining about losing Krystal. This left the Falco longing the excitement that he had joined the Star fox team for. Falco was forced to watch, or as he called it endure, the daily charades that went on aboard the giant space ship. Needless to say, Falco was thrilled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about a week after they had departed Fortuna after gathering the various supplies needed to keep the ship and the crew running and Falco had just woken up. The blue avian stretched out his wings and headed for the shower, shuddering at the realization that he would be forced to repeat this routine every day until Lylat was in peril again. He prayed that day would come soon because he wasn\u2019t sure how much of this normalcy he could handle. <br>\r\n After washing himself with various concoctions of cleaning products he moved on and caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. Falco, being the self centered cocky individual that he was, spent a good time of his day here, in front of a mirror that is. He was tall approximately 6ft tall and in relatively good shape. He was slender and worked out hard to keep himself at his light 140lbs. But Falco never worked too hard to overdo the slight build to his chest and shoulders and flat stomach, he preferred to stay toned over ripped. After the lengthily inspection of himself in the mirror he progressed to the gym. It was now no surprise that Falco exercised here alone seeing as fox had given this up after Krystal left the team. It was a light workout today and only consisted of a slow jog on the treadmill and some light weights. But even after such light calisthenics Falco worked up quiet an appetite. Swinging a white towel around his neck he headed up to the dining area where he met Fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin',\" Falco said to fox who returned the response with a nod over the Lylat times paper which he quickly returned to reading. He never actually moved the paper from in front of his face but Falco caught Fox\u2019s ears dip behind the paper after his greeting.  He had noticed that Fox's attitude had been slowly spiraling downward with it coming closer and closer to clinically depressed. Finding this pretty hilarious, Falco chuckled to himself about the sorry state of his friend and opened the fridge to grab something to eat. Quickly scanning the contents he grabbed some frozen waffles and threw them into the toaster. With nothing to do until they were cooked he plopped himself in the chair across from Fox and try and be nice to him. Fox lowered the paper. Falco opened his beak and was about to start up a conversation with Fox when he noticed the poor shape he was in. He had bags on his bags under his eyes and his usually straight whiskers were now frizzed out like they had been electrocuted. A robe that fox was wearing was tattered and was untied in the front exposing a more softened fox that had lost his once athletic look. Though none of this was helped by the fact that he was drinking his morning coffee out of a chipped \"I heart Lylat\" coffee mug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting what he was about to say and not wanting to look like an idiot with his mouth gaping open Falco quickly asked, \"So\u2026how\u2019s the weather today?\" Falco couldn\u2019t believe the stupidity of this question.<br>\r\n\u201cWere in space Falco. There is no weather.\u201d Fox was about to grab his paper and start reading god knows what when Falco, determined to have a conversation with someone, asked, \u201cWhat have you been doing lately?\u201d He tried to say this without making the conversation sound too forced, but Fox, having some common sense caught on and responded by raising an eyebrow and looking at Falco quizzically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...nothing?\" Here Falco officially realized that his idea at a conversation had failed miserably. But for the first time in his (?) life Sippy showed up at a good time. With a glass shattering \"HELLO\" Falco knew that he had been saved from awkward silence. The young frog skipped over to the fridge and shoved his fat green head into it and asked if anyone wanted anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grab me a donut will ya\u2019.\" fox asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and grab my waffles Slip before they burn\" Being the kind hearted frog that he was, he complied. For the first time in what felt like ages the team had a meal together. With Fox refusing to talk to anyone Falco was forced to have a conversation with Slippy. But after the year of having to deal with the annoying frog Falco was able to completely shut out the frog\u2019s voice. He zoned out. He came back when he felt his hand scraping the bottom of an empty, if not slightly greasy, plate. \"Whoa!\" he thought. I must have been hungrier than I expected. Falco debated on whether or not to grab something else to eat. \u201cWow Falco, you ate that thing fast? You still hungry?\u201d Slippy asked. <br>\r\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get up again can you grab me something else to eat\u201d Fox asked from behind his paper. Falco considered the options, he didn't want to start to let himself go like Fox but he was pretty hungry. But he could always just exercise again. He decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Chucking, he grabbed some of the donuts and sprinkled some of the clear liquid onto the donuts. \u201cHey, what\u2019s that Fox?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap\u201d Fox thought, he had completely forgotten about Slippy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d he stuttered. \u201cOh this is just something to enhance taste\u2026yeah.\u201d Fox believed that even someone as socially retarded as Slippy would see right through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool!

Slippy rubbed his chin and cocked his head, \u201cthat makes sense.\u201d he said and then continued to munch on his toast. Fox couldn\u2019t believe that this very un-smooth move on his part passed over so well and proceeded with his \u2018taste improving\u2019 of the donuts. He grabbed the box and brought them over to the table, setting them in front of where he sat. A flush of a toilet was heard down the hall followed by running of sink water and the click of a door opening. Falco was then seen rounding the corner to the kitchen. Fox could see that Falco looked pretty full from his previous meal before the\u2026detour. His stomach slightly pushed against his shirt causing a slight curve, barely noticeable, but still present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonut?\u201d Fox questioned. Falco taken aback by the fact that Fox initiated him in a conversation and his hunger for breakfast responded, \u201cDefinitely.\u201d His beak opened and he took a bite of the donut that fox had just saturated with the clear solution. After he had swallowed the first bite Falco\u2019s face grew ridged. His pupils dilated and a rumble was heard echoing from his midsection. Quickly his face loosened up again and he showed the donut into his beak. After almost no chewing and very heavy swallowing he proclaimed, \u201cAAAARHG, I\u2019m starving!!! Quick pass me the donuts!\u201d Fox shoved the box containing about two dozen donuts towards the starving avian. He grabbed the donuts from the box and proceeded to pile them into his gullet. His stomach became fuller and fuller as the box became emptier and emptier. After about 10 minutes of ravenous eating Falco had devoured over three quarters of the box and was showing no signs of slowing down. Fox sat across from Falco admiring his work; he laughed to himself and quietly muttered, \u201cLife has just gotten more interesting around here\u2026\u201d Slippy completely oblivious, continued too much on his toast. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\tFalco ate for about five more minutes and when he reached to grab another donut his hand came up empty. Distraught he shot up from his seat, in a fashion that no one after eating two dozen donuts should have, and turned towards the fridge. His shit rode up only slightly exposing some of Falco\u2019s midsection. Fox could tell that it was reaching its capacity but Falco obliviously didn\u2019t notice. His pants pleaded to be destroyed as their 28\u2019\u2019 waist was getting stretched farther and farther as Falco began to look more like a well fed 34 than a slim toned 28. The pants cut into his sides causing some of him to spill over the sides giving him the appearance of a vanilla ice cream cone with a blueberry on top, as he was wearing a now extremely tight white exercise shirt. He was not fat as he has not yet digested the cornucopia of calories that he had just indigested but was bloated. Fox couldn\u2019t believe that he could fit that much food into him. <br>\r\nFalco flung open the fridge door and stuck his head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fatter Bowser got the more the producers from Obese TV will pay him for his weight progression videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be a piece of cake.

He had been tracking the new entity for a week now, and for a strange substance in a metal canister it was proving hard to find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe signal had led him to an old abandoned, ruined artillery base in southern Cambodia, but the trail had just gone cold. Chris scratched the back of his muscular neck, before swatting a bug on his exposed beefy bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Damn mosquitoes' he muttered to himself. Despite being equipped in his usual green tactical compression shirt, and sand combat cargo pants, he felt sweat forming on his wide back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grumble from his stomach made his brow furrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it... knew I should've packed more ration packs\" he scolded to himself. Just then, a wonderful smell wafted through the hot tropical air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm... is that... burgers? pizza?\" thought Chris, confused. \"Who the hell has a barbecue in the middle of the jungle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe drew his pistol, moving carefully, following the scent. He came across a structure, still relatively intact, the door ajar. He pointed his pistol at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" he called, in case it <i>was</i> an oddly placed barbecue party.  \"BSAA, come out slowly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo reply, not even movement, just the smell of food, wafting from within. Slowly, he pushed the door, it opened with a creak. What he saw made sense, yet didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA table, played out with piles and piles of food. Burgers, hot dogs, pizza, soda...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" muttered Chris, even more confused. He picked up his bio-scanner from his belt, aiming it at the food. After a second, a beep indicated an analysis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing?\" said Chris, he holstered the scanner and scratched his brow in confusion. Something didn't add up. Another grumble from his stomach made him realise how hungry he was. Chris was a big guy, he needed to eat, and dried fruit and granola bars didn't exactly sate his appetite that morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... its normal food, doesn't look like anybody's around to eat it\" reasoned Chris, hell the nearest settlement was 60 miles in the opposite direction. \"Surely a quick snack couldn't hurt\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He felt a bit light headed due to the beer, but he began to start on the pile of burritos, stuffed with meat and cheese.

He heard his stomach gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ohhh\" he moaned stroking his belly with his hand. Then he watched as is hairy belly button, which was once an innie, popped out into an outie, with a small popping noise. Chris was confused at this, stroking his huge and firm yet soft belly, but then realised it looked better that way. He turned around in the mirror, looking at his wide bouncy ass, his boxer briefs wedged in so his big round cheeks were in full view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew I'm fat. Hope they got the biggest size, gonna need it for this ass\" he smiled to himself, slapping ha big tanned cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then picked up his equipment and waddled to the door. He was about to leave when he realised his new huge girth would be a tight fit for the door frame, never-the-less, he began to push through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nughh... c'mon...\" he grunted, pushing his huge gut through the door. He pushed and pushed, until the old wooden door frame broke around him, setting him free with a loud popping noise, his fat jiggling and rippling like a water balloon, his big boy boobs bouncing on his massive hairy belly. Chris looked at the ruined door frame behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, must have some of my old strength under all this blubber huh\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlodding over to the metal storage crate that had landed outside in the clearing, Chris opened up the crate and took out his new shirt. It looked the same as his old one, but it was definitely bigger, as a Large used to be a slim fit on Chris, but this was XXL, which might not have been enough despite the stretchy fabric, but Chris squeezed in anyway. He looked at the shirt, it didn't cover all his massive belly, falling short a good 5 inches above his belly button. The shirt also had sewn in-seams around his chest, which seemed to hold up his massive big boy boobs, the nipples poking though the fabric. On the left chest it read 'Cpt.

I am filled with a lot of fat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pulled on his XXL cargo pants, which where elasticated as well, the skin tight fabric encasing his big wobbly thighs and oversized buttocks. Putting on his belt, which just about fitted around his waist, fastening the heavy duty buckle under his belly, which was difficult to do as he couldn't see past it. He then strapped on his new XXL holsters, duty belt and knee pads, and squeezed his chubby feet into his boots. Lastly, he reloaded his pistol, and holster his rifle on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, think i'm ready to go\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Chris's scanner beeped again. Taking it out, he saw he had location on a possible location for where the food was being produced. He held down the button on his radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HQ, come in HQ. This is Captain Red -...  Fatfilled reporting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is HQ. Go ahead, Fatfilled\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found a lock on a posible BW, permission to procede\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger that, Captain. Permission granted. Proceed with caution\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rodger. Will remain in contact\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked at the path forward, the signal wasn't too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should ask for a 4X4 for transport. I could grab a quick snack while I wait, get a better look at my new uniform. Cant eat too much though, my uniform may be stretchy, but I can't afford to wreck another one\" Chris thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the other hand, I need to get on with this mission...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was filling out rapidly, his chest softening into boobs, his ass widening in is tight slacks, neck fattening in his shirt collar and tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, dude... check you out!\" said Jeremy, watching his friend bloat up.

His shirt was stretched, filled out with pounds of fat, as buttons started to pop off to make way for his cute hairless belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh... Jeremy... I..\" moaned Ben. His body had slowed down but his boobs where still going. They where the size of melons, the pudgy nubs that were his nipples visible through the tight fabric. Soon his shirt had popped all the way open, his giant soft boy boobs popping free, his tie resting between them, tied loosely around his fat neck. Ben wasn't as big as Jeremy, but he definitely had bigger tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen looked at his pudgy face in the mirror, before taking a squeeze of his tits, and moving down to his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben... you look... you look\" stammered Jeremy, amazed by his friends new sexy size. He then pulled Ben closer, placing his fat lips on his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked at first, Ben began to tenderly kiss back, feeling his boobs press up against Jeremy's, his friends hands squeezing his pudgy nipples. Ben let his hands wander down to Jeremy's belly, rubbing the warm, soft doughy expanse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris grinned at the scene before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, it suits them\" he said, watching the two fatboys make out. \"now what?\"</span></div></div>",

He had a tanned, smooth, tight, athletic body, not too bulky, and was wearing green Hawaii style board shorts, flip flops, a shark tooth necklace, surfer sunglasses,  and had a tribal tattoo running down his left shoulder and arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was a sexy Italian life guard named Antonio (or Antony for short).

He had a body builders physique, not overly muscular but definitely hunky, with a nice amount of dark hair, on rich caramel coloured skin, with dark, full nipples. He was wearing a whistle around his thick muscular neck, aviator sunglasses, flip-flops, and a pair of tight red speedos, with the word lifeguard written across the ass in white capital letters, and a white medial cross on the front left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, dudes\" greeted Jake, in a youthful Californian slang. \"looking hot, love the bikinis\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the new guests then\" said Antony, in a thick, sexy Italian accent. \"Mind if we.... join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all buddy\" said Jeremy, eyeing up the two hunky men.

The two continued to make out while Jake and Tony fondled to their hearts content.

The box was still full. Henry shrugged it off, putting it down to quick service. Then a young waiter approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, officer. Hate to say this but you do know we have a no shoes no shirt policy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, sorry\" said Henry, wobbling to his feet, before picking up his doughnut box. \"I'll be on my way then\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry waddled out to his bike in nothing but his black briefs. It was a cold evening that made the officer's nipples hard like two pink jellybeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best eat these before setting off\" He said, picking up a doughnut and stuffing it it. Then another, then another, then another. Henry grew and swelled with every bite, before he knew it he had finished the box - again. Throwing the box away, he looked at his reflection in the window. He was now a whopping 400 lbs of jiggling man blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, that'll do it. Ill hand in my notice in the morning\" he said, cupping his bouncy boobs, rubbing the nipples between his finger and thumb. \"Damn, I look good for a fat guy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry waddled back to his bike and began to put on what was left of his uniform. He pulled on his leather bike jacket, which had no hope of zipping up, then to his duty belt, which luckily could be adjusted. He then plonked his helmet on his head and awkwardly mounted the bike. The bike groaned under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he started down the street the bike could only crawl along the road due to the sure fatness of its rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, beats walking, I guess\" he shrugged with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n____<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris watched the fat cop ride home, smiling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets see who's up next\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to eye up Chris's fat blubbery body, in a way which unsettled Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John?...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly John launched his fat frame at Chris, who attempted to turn and dodge, but due to his new larger frame ended up pinned to the floor face down, the Sergeant's fat body on top of him, landing in a bouncy blubbery heap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"arghh... John... what are you.... ahh ...stop!\" barked Chris, struggling with his obese comrade laying on top. John then began to grope around Chris, squeezing his plump man boobs, rubbing the pink squidgy nipples between his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John!.... arghhh... It's me... snap out of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris kicked and thrashed as he felt his obese friend's hands wander down over his fat hairy belly, then to the waistband of his BSAA boxer briefs. With a sharp tug the stretched underwear snapped off, rendering Chris naked. John continued to grope and fondle Chris as they rolled around the floor. Chris let out a gasp as he felt a hand down his but crack, before fondling his privates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough...\" barked Chris, before both ended up rolling onto the stair landing, smashing through the railing, and dropping into the hallway below. Strangely both men bounced a little as they hit the floor, the boards breaking where they landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing from the dust, Chris got to his feet as James and Ethan appeared at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergeant Baker?\" they said, surprised, then as they noticed Captain Fatfield butt naked, they turned pink, there jaws dropping open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*cough*..  Chris?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris looked down at John who was rubbing his head. Chris knelt down beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chris.... why am i so... why are <i>you</i> so fat... and... naked\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story\" shrugged Chris. \"What's the last thing you remember\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn paused for thought, rubbing his head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I was scouting out a supply convoy... containing food... a bio weapon. I was with Corporal Francis... then we got separated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Corporal Francis? You were with Jordan?\" said Chris, remembering that was the name of the other missing man. \"Where is he now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...I tried looking for him here, there was a light on... then... that smell... the food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris's brow furrowed. Someone <i>was</i> here at some point after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea where Cpl. Francis might be now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... never checked the basement... maybe he's still here... or they took him away.... to the convoy\" coughed John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fiery ball exploided,leaving the ones green grass scorched pitch black.<br>\r\nThe sheep hurried around a large rock for protection,in case if another fireball heads his way. He craned his neck around the corner,looking for the attacker,but what he saw made him shruck back behind the rock.<br>\r\nOn top of the hill,spyro's nostrills flared,sending jets of flames out of his noise holes. He opened his maw and blew another flameball at a herd of sheep in the distanch. It exploided,sending sheep flying everywhere.<br>\r\nHe sat down on his rump,his anger slowly subsiding. 'How dare she',spyro thought,'leaving me for that hot-head flame. I'll show ember.'<br>\r\nHe letted a puff of hot smoke float out of his left nostrill. Just a a few yards away,sparx kepted his distanch,giving the purple dragon some space to cool off.<br>\r\nWhen it seemed safe to approuch him,sparx flew over and said,\"hey,buddy. Feeling better?\" Spyro didn't say anything,but kepted his face grim. Sparx sighed in dispair,but a loud grumbeling sound couht his attention.<br>\r\nSpyro placed his paw on his gut and sparx knew he had an advantage to cheer him up. \"Hey,let's grab a bite to eat,buddy\",sparx said. Spyro's face was still grim when he said,\"yeah,food would be nice. Maybe it would take my mind off this.\"<br>\r\nWith that said,him and sparx started to walk back to the avalar village.</span></div></div>",

Spyro chuckled, feeling no way insalted by Sparx's remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe celabration was thrown in Spyro and Cynder's name, to thank the two heros for freeing Warfang, along with the rest of Avalar, from Malefor's evil. Dragons and other creatures gathered to the great city. There they sang, drank, ate, and hosted a series of tornaments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro, Cynder, and Sparx where obviosly there to attend the celabration. They mostly ate and ate and ATE! Never in Spyro's life had he eaten food so tasty. There where a huge bufy of food available: pudings, muton, roast beef, cakes, and many more. The celabration finally ended after a week passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a party to be rememberd, but it was sad to say that all of that food they ate went straight to their waistlines. Spyro had a paper-thin line of fat that covered his body. Cynder's fat went mostly to her rear, making it slightly larger. But it was Sparx that had the worst of it. His gut started to form into a nice beer-belly, and his moobs rested on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpyro knew that the gaurdians would be drilling them back into shape tomorrow. \"Hey there, Spyro,\" a fimilair voice called. Spyro spotted Cynder standing outside her bedroom. Spyro greeted back, saying,\"Hey there, Cyn. It's best that we go to sleep early tonight. The gaurdians will be rushing us early out of bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder nodded. \"That they will,\" she said,\"it's good thing anyway. I need to work this butt off.\" Cynder turned around and was just about to enter her room when Sparx shouted,\"Carfull, your ass is going to get stuck in the doorway.\" Cynder whirled around, shouting back,\"Atleast mu gut doesn't way me down, fat-ass.\" Sparx snorted. \"Whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was mean,\" Spyro said entering his room. \"What? I was just joking,\" Sparx said lifting his shoulders in protest. Spyro just rolled his eyes and wentbto a pile of cushions that was his bed. He curled upon it and went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He felt like he was living thr high life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course James was realizing this sort of life also had its consequences. He was starting to notice that his shirts and jeans were getting kind snug on him now. His abs melting in his newly forming belly. But he didn't mind it for now at least, the added weight just made him look thicker. Of course he wasnt going to continue this decadent lifestyle for too long anyway he needed to make sure he was in shape in case the galaxy needed him again. But for now it was okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJames just continued to lay back in his chair looking at the ceiling of the restaurant thinking where he should go next for his next meal.</span></div></div>",

Why are you so FAT?!\" Freddy yells out in confusion. \"It's alright freddy, just try this.\" Bonnie opens a box of fresh pizza and gives a slice to Freddy. \"I know that you will like it.\" Bonnie tells Freddy.

Now Foxy bloated up so much that body couldn't be covered by the curtains of Pirate Cove. Now to mention that his arms were very pudgy and couldn't hardly move well. His ass was really wide. Lastly, his belly was huge. Here's a reference: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/15081786/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/15081786...</a> First picture to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to do something about his weight.\" Freddy said. \"We won't be able to get the night guard if we don't.\"<br>\r\n\"But what?\" It's not like we can force his not to keep eating.\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"The least we can do is keep an eye on him.\" Freddy said.<br>\r\n\"Who should do that?\" Bonnie asked.<br>\r\n\"You.\" Freddy and Chica said at the same time.<br>\r\n\"Me? Why me?\" Bonnie said in protest.<br>\r\n\"If my memory bank is right, you were the one feeding him pizza leading to him being this huge.\" Chica said.<br>\r\n\"But.......fine.\" Bonnie said agreeing to watch him.

Getting ready.\" Freddy said telling everyone to get in positions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs usual, Mike was checking the cameras and an eye on the animatronics. When he was looking at Pirate Cove, he noticed how big Foxy was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! The Foxy's even more of a fatty then he was now. Haha!\" Mike said chuckling. Mike continue to check more on the others who were moving around like they usually do. Then he checked Pirate Cove again to realized that Foxy was gone. \"Huh? Where did he go?\" He flash to all the cameras but didn't see him and he wasn't at the door. Going back to Bonnie who was supposed to watch Foxy, he was at Pirate Cove looking for his fox friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Foxy?\" Bonnie said. He looks around for a few seconds and looks at the hallway. \"Wha....what the?\" To his surprised something was covering the hallway. By that, I mean a big fat ass from a certain animatronic. \"Foxy?\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"Ay lad. Be a good first mate and help me out?\" Foxy said.<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" Bonnie said pissed. \"Of course this happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget not being able to fit the doors, now he couldn't even fit in the hallways. Since Bonnie had to watch over Dfoxy, he also had to help him. Bonnie try to put him out, but with his weight, it was a near impossible job for one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too......heavy......\" Bonnie said trying to get out.<br>\r\n\"Yaaarrr! There must be someway.\" Foxy asked.<br>\r\n\"*sign* I'll go get the others.\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie made his way to the other hallway. Freddy and Chica were close to get Mike from his office. Even with the power generator he had, it still only had so much power. Chica and Freddy were by the close door in Mike's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mike. You will have to open up sooner or later.\" Freddy said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Very soon, we will get........\" Chica said, but was later interupted by Bonnie.<br>\r\n\"Umm....guys?\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here? You should watching Foxy.\" Freddy said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah....he's kinda.....stuck.....in the other hall.\" Bonnie explained.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!?!?!?\" Saided Freddy and Chica shocked.<br>\r\n\"Damnit. Now his fat ass can't even fit pass the halls?\" Chica said.<br>\r\n\"I know. I need help pulling him out.\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"Can't it wait?\" Freddy said.<br>\r\n\"No. It can't.\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"You better go help the fatty fox.\" Said Mike from his office.<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this night guard.\" Freddy said. \"Now.....we better go help that fatty fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three left the hall to go help Foxy from the other hall. Leaving Mike alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. So Foxy is stuck in the hall?\" Mike said flashing to the camera on the hall Foxy was stuck in. \"Ah ha ha!

Foxy munched as fast he could as Freddy fed him stuffing pizza slice after delicious pizza slice into his fat mouth<br>\r\nFoxy's cheeks were as big as basketballs as his mouth was full with tasty pizza forcing him to chew as fast as he could and never stop swallowing<br>\r\nFreddy hated what he was doing but as he fed Foxy he noticed that Foxy's once pleasure filled face was now filled with discomfort as Foxy was being fed far to fast as he just couldn't keep up<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFoxy could only say throw chewing from Freddy to slow down but Freddy wasn't listening he was going to teach this fat Foxy it was a bad idea to steal his fame Freddy grinned \"you like being fat huh fat ass? well lets see how much you like it when I make you explode!<br>\r\nFoxy was afraid that Freddy mite had gone crazy and now wanted to over fed him so he exploded could that even happen? Foxy wondered<br>\r\nAll he knew was that he was becoming very stuffed as his belly was starting to over the sides of the stage the stage even make cracking sounds because of how much weight Foxy was putting on it but as the Foxy worried that the whole stage would fall suddenly the the clock struck 6:00 <br>\r\nFreddy's Bonnies and Chicas night shift was over Chica sighed \"oh thank robot god its over I have pizza sauce all over my self\"<br>\r\nBonnie said \"are we really going to be doing this ever night? I dont know if I can handle that... \"<br>\r\nFreddy was frustrated \"stupid clock you won this time Foxy but trust me when I say I will be the star again just you wait fatty! <br>\r\nBonnie and Chica looked at one another in confusion Bonnie said \"what's up with Freddy? Chica said oh dont worry about him he's still just mad he's not the star anymore trust me in a weeks time he will be over it..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 3 robots went back to there stage as Foxy could finally rest \"wow I haven't bean fed like that in ages yrrrr Freddy must be super jealous of me.. <br>\r\nThan again how could you not be jealous of me\" he said as he giggled \"oh well I'm sure he will get over it soon\"<br>\r\nFoxy couldn't help but notice that his belly was starting to go over the edge of the stage<br>\r\n\"Hmm yrrr I hope they make the stage bigger soon I think I mite be starting to get a little to big for it the stage it would be very embarrassing if i fall and squish my fans that would be very embarrassing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks later...</span></div></div>",

Not only was the place change it's title from Freddy to Foxy, but they were able to get a bigger place. The restaurant was now three times the original size to have more people in it. Not only that, but the Foxy Feeding Stage was also bigger and built to hold more weight. Which was a good thing too. After weeks of being fed day and night by the kiddies, Freddy and the others, Foxy has gotten huge beyond words. Just the three weeks of feeding has caused him to triple in size. It was a good thing that they have a bigger room now cause there would have been no way for him to fit anywhere. Seriously, he was as wide as a school bus now, his arm were pretty much lost in his fat now. Same for his feet. Now Freddy, Bonnie and Chica still did their usually thing and sang there usual songs. There were ACTUALLY starting to get fans watching them again. But Foxy still was more popular. Freddy's still had anger issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at him. Why does he still continue to eat more and get bigger than he is now?\" Freddy said.<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It's starting to get out of control.\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"Surprised that he hasn't exploded from all that pizza.\" Chica said.<br>\r\n\"If he doesn't explode, he deserves it.\" Freddy said.<br>\r\n\"Easy Freddy. I know you are still mad about things, but that massive blob is still our friend.\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"He's no longer any friend of mine.\" Freddy said and walked away.<br>\r\n\"*sign* Let's talk to Foxy tonight.\" Bonnie said.<br>\r\n\"Maybe we can talk to him about his overeating and about Freddy.\" Chica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the day was over, Freddy stayed on the stage.

'He should be with me, and not with that Terror of the Skies,' Ember thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could not understand it; how could he - the legendary Purple Dragon - love HER. While Ember's pink scales where fair, her eyes blue, and her body gorgious ; Cynder's scales where dark and raidiated darkness, her eyes green, and her body was thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled. She had half a mind to yell a insult at Cynder, but knew better not to. The last time she did that, she was scolded so harshly by Spyro, it left her crying. \"I'm back, my love,\" a voice sang from the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber rolled her eyes. 'Typicle Flame,\" she thought bitterly. Turning around, she wiped away what ever angry expression she had, and replaced it with a cute, happy smile. \"I missed you so much, dear,\" Ember lied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, she never loved the big red oaf. The met eachother atleast five years ago. The where fleeing the war against Malefor, and went to Warfang where the became good friends. But little did Ember know that a Flame began to develope a crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found out about this when she was eavesdropping on Flame while he was conversing with one of his friends. He was hoping on taking her on a date, and Ember decided to give him just that. When Flame very akwardly asked her the following day, Ember, much to his surprise, immediatly agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that day forward, Ember and Flame went to dates more often. She was on the furge of falling in love with the red dragon...until Spyro arrived. She had heard many heroic tales of the purple dragon. She swooned over him. But never could she imagen seeing him in living flesh. All of the things Flame lacked, Spyro had. He smarted, better looking, and well-built.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunitly she still had Flame who was still head-over-tail for her. She couldn't just simply break up with him. Ember knew his poor heart will never handle it. But now she was taking it more in consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing stopping her was Cynder. If Ember could get Spyro to dump her, he would be all her's. But the main question was 'how?' It was then that she rememberd about the 'specail place' there was in Warfang, but it was going to cost her. But luckely she had Flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flame,\" Ember began while she embraced him,\" do you have some gems for me? I want to go shopping a bit.\" \"Ofcourse I have, love, you can have as many as you want,\" said Flame. Ember smiled wickitly. She knew he would be foolish enough to give money to her without qeustion.</span></div></div>",

The chubby dragoness was surprised, but returned the kiss after a few moments. The released their slobbering kiss and turned around. Their large flabby rears started to sack heavely behind them, cum dripping from their hot cunts. With little hesatation, the two dragon mushed their butts against eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moaned in pleasure, rubbing the soft flesh together. Large pot bellys gurgled loudly. Cynder lickedher swollen lips, saliva drooling from them. \"I'm hungry,\" Cynder said, her belly - that almost pressed against the floor - rumbled like a thunderstorm. A smelly fart left Cynder's ass cheeks, followed by a loud belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmber curled up her snout in disguss. \"Now, Cynder, that was very rude,\" Ember said, shaking her stubby finger. Cynder only grinned. \"I see nothing wrong with it,\" Cynder said, letting another fart explode from her butt. \"Aah, that felt good!\" Cynder cooed. No longer able to handle the stench, Embee waddled towards the balcony's door and opened it, allowing the stink to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder walked towards the balcony, her hole body jiggeling, and stood outside. Her belly started to rumble very loudly, sounding almosr like it was roaring. \"O! Here it comes!\" she announced, letting the largest fart loose there ever was. It rumbled like a earthquick, shaking the world. Below a mole was walking. He took a smell of the air and began chocking, falling to the floor, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynder's tong lolled out, feeling how the night air cooled off her mounds. \"Cynder, you're turning into a slob,\" Ember pointed out, her chines shaking as she spoke. Cynder grinned. \"Come on, fatty, don't tell me you don't wanna let out some gas, do ya?\" Ember's belly growled, and she felt a presure build up from inside her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Snake was busy on a mission, scouting out an old research facility in Kazakhstan that was a possible site for metal gear production. As he crawled through a vent, the grizzled mercenary grumbled to himself, his sneaking suit apparently a little tighter then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping down from the vent, Snake stood up and examined himself in the mirror, his stubbled jawline on his rough handsome face, before moving down to his body. He had been hitting the weights recently, the suit's fabric taut across his chest and arms, the skintight outfit leaving very little to the imagination underneath his holster and webbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" he grumbled, turning to examine his backside. Shaking off the distraction, Snake continued out of the room and down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Empty?' thought Snake, confused at the lack of guards, or scientists, or anyone for that matter. Cautiously, he opened a door to the main floor of the room, a large hanger. Large manufacturing machines and equipment lay quiet in the room. Snake placed a hand on a vent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still warm... someone was here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning, something snagged Snake by the foot, sweeping him off his feet into the air. Dangling upside-down, Snake looked at what had ensnared him. A metal tendril, coiled around his ankle. He followed the tendril to see what looked like a glowing light looking at him from the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling at the large metal monstrosity in the dark, Snake reached for his weapon, but before he could draw it, another tendril whipped out of the dark and restrained his wrist, followed by two more, ensnaring his remaining limbs, and a final one wrapping around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnake thrashed about, trying to pull free from the strange metal gear's grasp, but to no avail. The robotic creature held strong, turning the mercenary the right way up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnake scowled up at the light that was the metal gear's eye, when another tendril snaked out of the darkness, but it looked different, almost like a clear plastic hose. Trying to work out what the creature was up to, Snake stared at the new tendril as it hovered in front of him like a cobra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the tendril lunged forward, straight into Snakes mouth, making him gag. He began to jerk and thrash, trying to dislodge the pipe from his throat. Then he watched in horror as a strange liquid started to flow down the pipe towards him, flowing through the nozzle in his gullet and into his stomach. Then, Snake noticed something that made his brow furrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Chocolate pudding?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid indeed tasted like chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs litres of the liquid were pumped into Snake, the mercenary felt a strange sensation. His stomach was starting to distend like a water balloon, pushing out into a noticeable bump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this thing fattening me up?' thought Snake, helplessly gulping gallons of the liquid.</span></div></div>",

He made his way to his bathroom, feeling his new weight with every step, the sensation of wobbling fat new to him. Like the rest of the apartment it was spacious, equipped with both a jet bath and a roomy walk in shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac began to undress in front of the large mirror opposite. As he pulled off his tank top, he found it hard to look away from his reflection, the plump tanned fat, his bulging belly, topped with round plump boobs. Even the nipples were bigger and puffier. Mac bounced them up and down in his hands, they felt soft, yet were firm in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, guess this isn't so bad, just means I go up a weight class... or two\" he reasoned. He then pulled off his socks, then his shorts and finally his underwear, before looking back at the mirror. Save for his armpits and groin, Mac wasn't too hairy, but what hair he had showed up due its dark colour, and, despite mac keeping his face clean shaven, he still had fine hair on his chest, which thickened as it went down his treasure trail, culminating in a thick bush around his junk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac then turned to examine his now bigger, bouncy butt, still covered in a light coating of dark hair, growing thicker between the round wobbly cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac got into the shower, feeling the warm water wash down his plump, chubby body. He then began to lather up with the soap, first washing his dark hair, then he moved down. As he washed his boobs, he found them to be much more sensitive then usual. Enjoying the feeling of the warm soapy water, mac played with his nipples, rubbing the puffy pink buds between his fingers, occasionally letting a moan escape through his now fat plump lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feels great... almost as good as eating\" he said, letting his hands move down to his big round belly, the soapy water making the warm blubbery fat shine and glisten. Then Mac saw his shaving razor on the shelf, which gave him an entertaining thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wonder how cute i'll look if I shave all my body hair'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac picked up the razor with his chubby sausage fingers, contemplating his thought.</span></div></div>",

He continued to watch the football, whilst occasionally rubbing himself to see how much he had gained. After chowing down another three pizzas, Mac began to feel strange, like the big strong footballers on the TV were turning him on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Tim Tebow looks hot\" muttered Mac, licking his lips, before suddenly realising what he said \"wait... did I say that? I must be really drunk\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac continued to work through the pizzas, growing fatter and fatter in his seat, his stretched boxers evolving into briefs. Soon, Mac was a hefty 350lbs, his big fat behind taking up half the couch. Mac grabbed his smooth, soft belly, which stuck out in front of him, as he scoffed the last slice of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew... I did it\" he said, wiping his hands. Somehow Mac felt suddenly tired, as if he'd just run a marathon. Warm, lethargic, and with a full belly, Mac laid down on the couch for a nap, the couch springs groaning under his weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn moments he was in a deep sleep, quietly snoring to himself. He dreamt he was a footballer, squeezed into a tight uniform. Then suddenly, every man on the team became a fatt-ass like him. He then dreamt he was in the ring, or more like taking up half of it, flattening any opponent under his colossal weight, the crowd cheering 'Big Mac!' over and over.... Then something weird happened... he saw a warehouse... then hundreds of tv screens, showing... well... everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac woke up, puzzled at his bizarre dream. It was dark, so he pushed himself up to a seated position to turn on the lamp next to the couch. Rubbing his eyes, he clicked on the light. But what he saw made him suddenly more confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the --- how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMac stared down at himself, as his outfit had somehow changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In appearance, the unknown individual appeared to be wearing a regal sapphire blue  dress, indicating that the individual that stood before the former human was actually a woman.

After all, she wasn't sure if the woman was merely a large Hunter in disguise, or something far more horrendous. \"WHAT *snarl* DO YOU *growl* WANT?\" Amelia growled, her capacity for human speech becoming somewhat limited due to her beastly physique and newfound feral instincts, resisting the urge to outright slaughter and devour the woman before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Amelia towered over the woman, where she pointed her head and snout downwards to look at the woman. \"Come now, Amelia. Has it been that long since you could easily recognize an old flame?\" The woman asked, slowly revealing her face to the transformed Vicar, who became shocked to see that it was none other than....</span></div></div>",

Anyway, on with the show!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to Amelia's shock and disbelief, the mysterious woman revealed to be none other than Amelia's old flame/forbidden lover, Clarissa Judeas. According to the beastly Vicar's memories, Clarissa was a well-established blood relative of House Judeas, who were known to monopolize the meat industry, since this family of nobles owned various slaughterhouses and meat markets across Yharnam as a whole. However, several of the noblewomen of House Judeas dabbled some in the bakery industry as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite her status as a noble, Clarissa only had eyes for one individual. More specifically, Vicar Amelia. Unfortunately, due to her deep connections and ties to the Healing Church, it was considered forbidden and highly taboo for a female member of the Church to have a romantic relationship with an individual of the same gender. And yet, even after she was forced to sever her relationship with Clarissa, Amelia still harbored deep loving affection toward the curvaceous noblewoman, even after physically succumbing to the Scourge of the Beast plague, becoming the antlered wolf creature she has now become, despite retaining her human sentience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....CLARISSA?\" Amelia asked, recognizing Clarissa's sweet nectar-like scent, where she then heard Clarissa spoke toward her and said, \"Come closer, Amelia. I want to see those lovely eyes of yours.\" In response, Amelia lowered her lupine head and snout, laying it right next to Clarissa. From there, the plus-sized noblewoman carefully lifted the enlarged ceremonial veil from Amelia's lupine face, attempting to look at the beastly Vicar in the eyes. In turn, this didn't just confirm to Amelia if she indeed was conversing with her long-lost lover, but also display the current physical state of her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her irises remained a radiant cobalt blue, Amelia's transformation into beasthood had altered the white sclera of her eyes, tinting them with a tainted yellow hue. Upon glancing at Clarissa, Amelia's beastly urges have temporarily subsided, like an animal reuniting with their chosen mate. Of course, Amelia then felt Clarissa wrap her arms around Amelia's lupine snout in a loving embrace and said, \"Oh, Amelia. I'm greatly relieved that you're still capable of recognizing me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUT *snarl* HOW? HOW CAN YOU STILL *growl* REC~snarl~RECOGNIZE ME?\" Amelia asked, still quite confused as to how Clarissa could easily tell that it was her, despite the realization that she was now a victim of the Scourge of the Beast plague, becoming the antlered lupine beast she has become. In response, Clarissa stared at the beastly Amelia and explained, \"I recognized that it was you by your tattered garbs, my love. Though, I'm quite surprised but thankful that you still retain your intelligence, despite your....beastly appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>And yet, despite her newfound beastly appearance, Vicar Amelia began to shed these tears of joy from her yellowed eyes, as she then wrapped her elongated arms around Clarissa in a deep, loving embrace. In turn, this showed the beastly Vicar that despite her transformation into an antlered beast by the Scourge of the Beast plague, the plus-sized woman held tenderly in her inhuman grasp still displayed romantic feelings toward Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*giggle* It's so good to see that you still harbor feelings for me, Amelia.\" Clarissa said, who responded by hugging Amelia's lupine snout, returning those affectionate feelings toward the transformed Vicar. Needless to say, the reunion between these two felt quite satisfying. Moments later, Amelia severed the embrace with her beloved Clarissa, gently lowering the voluptuous woman back onto the cobbled street, where the beastly Vicar slowly turned her gaze away from the curvaceous noblewoman and answered, \"YOU....*growl* YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE *snarl* *growl* COME HERE, CLARISSA. *snarl* NOT 'TIS NIGHT.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, Clarissa clearly understood what Amelia was talking about, aware of the notorious epidemic known as the Scourge of the Beast plague. And yet, despite her lover's valid warning and the knowledge of this horrendous but somewhat contagious disease, Clarissa ignored the foreboding danger that Yharnam now holds, all in an attempt to reach her beloved Vicar Amelia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for the voluptuous noblewoman, her efforts were proven fruitful, as she has reunited with her forbidden lover, despite the inevitable possibility that Amelia might be infected with the Scourge of the Beast plague. However, Clarissa could clearly understand what Amelia was referencing. After all, judging from the somber tone of Amelia's voice, Clarissa understood that the beastly Vicar was frightened at the mere thought of her unwillingly succumbing to her newfound beastly instincts, bringing unintentional harm to her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, in her best attempt to reassure the beastly Vicar, Clarissa cautiously approached the antlered beast that was Amelia, placing a hand upon the back of Amelia's furry paw-like right hand, then truthfully spoke toward the beastly Vicar and replied, \"...I know, my love. But...I don't care about the various dangers scurrying through the streets of Yharnam. I only care about your well-being, even if you have been afflicted by the Scourge of the Beast. And yet, from what I've bared witness to, you still retain your humanity, despite your transformation into a beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing those words of passion from the plus-sized woman before her, Amelia slowly turned her head to face her beloved Clarissa, realizing how devoted the voluptuous noblewoman was with their love. In turn, this made Amelia contemplate some on what her life would've been like if she had abandoned the Healing Church and joined her lover in House Judeas, how happier her life would've been. And yet, this made the former human think that maybe....maybe this was fate giving her a second chance at love and happiness, just as Clarissa spoke to her once more and said, \"Please, let us leave this accursed city and live out the rest of our days in House Judeas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing what Clarissa had said, Amelia's thoughts of fate offering happiness to her on a brass platter were confirmed. Plus, thinking back to her time as a Vicar of the Healing Church, she has seen her fellow clerics, nuns, priests, Church Hunters, and Church Huntresses either slaughtered by those afflicted with the Scourge of the Beast plague, or succumbing to the plague and becoming beasts themselves. Along with that, Amelia still recounted the occasional attempts on her life by numerous Hunters when she eventually became a beast herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, these Hunters were defeated by her claws and consumed for survival, but she could still recall some of the physical scars that were inflicted upon her physique by the weapons the Hunters, especially when said Hunters used serrated weapons like the Saw Cleaver, which was purposely designed against beasts. And now, thanks to her newfound hunger, Amelia soon came to the realization that the overall situation was becoming all the more grim for Yharnam, for both the city, the Healing Church, and of course, the city's denizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Yharnam would inevitably be fully succumbed to the Scourge of the Beast plague, Amelia now understood that leaving Yharnam and joining Clarissa in House Judeas sounded not just the only option available left besides staying in the city and wait until a Hunter ended her life as a beast, it was a more peaceful alternative than waiting for the inevitable outcome that awaited for a beast like her. From there, Amelia exhaled a deep long sigh, then gazed upon the curvaceous noblewoman and answered, \"ALRIGHT, CLARISSA. *growl* *snarl* I'LL *growl* I'LL JOIN YOU AT *snarl* HOUSE JUDEAS. I'M TIRED *growl* OF BEING HUNTED LIKE A *snarl* *growl* LIKE A BEAST.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing the beastly Vicar's words with her own two ears, Clarissa could not help but feel excited at Amelia's acceptance, causing her to hug the former human in response as she replied, \"Oh thank you, Amelia! I knew you would agree with me, my love.\" But then, all of a sudden, both the inhuman Amelia and the voluptuous Clarissa suddenly heard the loud growling noise emanating from nearby. The culprit: Vicar Amelia's stuffed belly, bloated with man-sized chunks of meat gurgling inside the beastly Vicar's rounded stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this caused the antlered beast that was Amelia to bear a crimson red blush on her lupine head and snout, greatly embarrassed from such unintended gluttony from earlier. This made Clarissa let out a light chuckle, as she approached Amelia's bulging abdomen, where she lightly patted the bulging furry gut and said, \"My my, it seems you're developing quite an appetite, aren't you dear? *giggle*\" \"*growl* NOT INTENTIONALLY.\" Amelia answered, still bearing a deep crimson blush on her lupine snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Clarissa then spoke once more toward her beloved Amelia and explained, \"Don't fret. I'm quite certain that we have more than enough meat to satiate your.....beastly cravings, Amelia.\" From there, Clarissa began to walk down a wide cobbled street, which prompted Amelia to soon follow, just to both keep her safe and escort the plus-sized noblewoman out of Yharnam.</span></div></div>",

After all,both Amelia and Clarissa were forced to take various detours throughout the multiple complex cobbled streets of Yharnam, outright avoiding any and all scuffles with numerous beastly creatures scattered throughout the once pure city, whether these took on the forms of the mobs of corrupted Yharnamites treading through the hallowed streets, their equally tainted hounds, the malformed and grotesque Beast-Men, the skittish Crows perched on the archways scattered throughout Yharnam, to even the bloodthirsty Werewolves stalking on the upper levels of Yharnam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, their journey to leave the city was a long, convoluted, and daunting task, as Amelia carried the curvaceous Clarissa in her beastly grasp on one hand, whilst using her newfound beastly strength, agility, and prowess to traverse the numerous layers of Yharnam. Fortunately for the two forbidden lovers, their effort was proven fruitful, as they inevitably reached one of the large main gates that were scattered across different sections of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS THIS *growl* THE GATE?\" Amelia asked, as she gently lowered Clarissa onto the cobbled street, allowing the plump noblewoman to approach the gate, examining it to see if it was marked with chalk, which she used as a method to easily recognize which gate she used to enter Yharnam. Of course, Clarissa took full notice of the chalk marked on the gate's bars, where she then turned around to face the beastly Vicar, nodding twice in confirmation and answered, \"Fortunately for us, it is. Now then, there shall be a carriage waiting for us within Hemwick Charnel Lane. From there, it should transport us to the Judeas Estate. Though, due to your....current condition, I'm afraid you will have to follow the carriage on foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*growl* I'M USED TO *snarl* IT BY NOW, CLARISSA.\" Amelia replied, reassuring Clarissa that the former human had grown accustomed to traversing in her current inhuman physique. And with that, Clarissa stood aside as Amelia used her beastly strength to tear the locked gate asunder, prying open the metal and iron gates with relative ease, allowing both her and the voluptuous noblewoman to proceed down the pathway which led to Hemwick Charnel Lane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what she was able to remember, Amelia knew that Hemwick was considered the outskirts of Yharnam, with decrepit and abandoned buildings that have seen better days, along with numerous tombstones scattered across almost every grassy knoll in Hemwick. Despite now becoming an antlered beast, that area still made her skin crawl due to the eerie and haunting atmosphere Hemwick displayed in full view. However, knowing that the only way out of Yharnam was residing in Hemwick, Amelia temporarily suppressed her uneasiness about the place, and continued to follow Clarissa into Hemwick Charnel Lane.</span></div></div>",

However, having misinterpreted that Amelia was hunting Clarissa, the 3 bodyguards protecting the carriage unsheathed their weapons, ready to defend their client with their lives. \"Calm down, gentlemen! Amelia has not brought any physical harm upon me.\" Clarissa answered, causing the bodyguards to become confused upon hearing that the plump noblewoman was defending the antlered beast before them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Clarissa spoke once more and asked, \"What? Do you not easily recognize a member of the Healing Church due to her beastly physique?\" Of course, this eventually persuaded the bodyguards, causing them to slowly lower their weapons and sheath their firearms upon understanding that Amelia was with the voluptuous noblewoman. Then, Clarissa proceeded to enter inside the carriage, as it took off toward House Judeas, with Amelia following not too far behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n========<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after several hours of traversing the vast landscape, Amelia and Clarissa finally arrived at the expansive Judeas Castle: the centuries-old home of House Judeas.

I greatly apologize for providing adequate transportation, my love.\" Clarissa apologized, feeling sorry for forcing Amelia to traverse on foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO *growl* PROBLEM.\" Amelia replied, reassuring the curvaceous noblewoman, where they then approached the enormous main gates as the gate opened access into the expansive castle grounds. But as they progressed through the castle grounds, Clarissa spoke toward her beloved Amelia and confessed, \"Though, I must confess, my love: You are not the only individual I hold dear who has been infected with the Scourge of the Beast plague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, this caused great confusion for the beastly Amelia upon hearing such news, where she then tilted her lupine head to the right a little from confusion and asked, \"WHAT ARE *snarl* YOU TALKING *growl* ABOUT, CLARISSA?\" In turn, this made the plump noblewoman let out a sigh, before she then looked upon her transformed lover and answered, \"....It would be best explained if I show you.\" From there, Clarissa guided Amelia toward an enormous, well-maintained structure, perfect for housing a creature of Amelia's size or larger.

Aside from their rotund bulky physiques, Amelia also noticed that the 3 Beasts were also wearing these giant dresses, large enough for a beast of her size, which clearly showed off their rotund frames and fat-laden curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, the sight before them left Amelia utterly even more confused, where she then looked down at Clarissa and asked, \"CLARISSA, *growl* WHO ARE THEY?\" From there, Clarissa then turned around to face her transformed lover, as the plump noblewoman spoke toward Amelia and explained, \"Amelia......Meet my mother and two sisters, Annabelle and Catherine. Like you, they are....afflicted, with the Scourge of the Beast plague.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this obviously gave Amelia some clarity as to the identities of the 3 rotund beasts before them, making the transformed Vicar feel sympathetic toward her lover's plight. And yet, this raised a few questions for Amelia to wrap her brain around, like \"How did this happen?\", \"How long have Clarissa's mother and sisters been like this?\", and \"Do they still retain their humanity like her or were they now mindless beasts consumed with sheer gluttony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Amelia, she was about to get those answers resolved, as the 3 corpulent beasts then took notice of her and Clarissa almost instantaneously, where, surprisingly, waved a plump paw-like hand at Clarissa and said, \"WELCOME HOME, *purr* CLARISSA.\" In turn, this revealed to Amelia that Clarissa's mother still retained most of her humanity, which was quite a rare occurrence considering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Clarissa calmly approached her beastly mother, where the voluptuous noblewoman gently rubbed her mother's fat furry abdomen and replied, \"Hello, mother. It's so good to see you, Annabelle, and Catherine once more.\" From there, it was there that Clarissa's mother finally took notice of the antlered lupine beast that was Vicar Amelia, as she then spoke toward her beloved Clarissa and asked, \"MAY I ASK *purr* WHO IT IS EXACTLY YOU HAVE *growl* RETURNED HOME WITH, *purr* MY BELOVED DAUGHTER?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously knowing that her mother was referring to Amelia, Clarissa then looked up toward her transformed mother and answered, \"That's Amelia, mother. I'm quite sure you still remember her, right?\" Upon hearing such a familiar name, Clarissa's mother slowly rose to her paw-like feet, where she profoundly waddled on all fours due to her girth, slowly approaching Amelia with intrigue and curiosity. Upon closer inspection, Amelia could see that Clarissa's mother had numerous feline features in her current form, along with various other features that were akin to several different animals, like how Amelia sported lupine features but also had deer antlers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would explain how Clarissa's mother was purring a little while she spoke. Once she was done circling around the beastly Vicar, Clarissa's mother then stood snout to snout with Amelia, where a intrigued smirk appeared on the rotund matriarch's feline snout, as if she easily recognized who Amelia was and said, \"*giggle* MY MY, *purr* AREN'T YOU SUCH A BEAUTIFUL BEAST.\" The compliment inadvertently caused the beastly Vicar to blush profusely from embarrassment, seeing as how she was complimented as a \"Beautiful Beast\" by her lover's own mother, albeit her lover's own transformed mother, but her lover's mother nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly, Amelia's stomach began to unintentionally growl intensely, demanding to be fed with rich juicy meat. In turn, Clarissa's mother couldn't help but let out a playful giggle in response, as she then spoke toward Amelia and said, \"NOT TO MENTION *purr* HUNGRY. COME IN, COME IN, *purr* THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH MEAT TO SHARE.\" From there, Clarissa's mother proceeded to haul out a large rotund pig, similar to the same hogs sparingly seen across Yharnam. Of course, the beastly matriarch of House Judeas restrained the hulking porcine with both her weight and girth, grasping the pig's flesh with her paw-like hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Amelia couldn't help but drool upon seeing how much meat the corpulent hog was hauling around, making her inhuman instincts tempting her to give in to her beastly cravings.And yet, that's exactly what happened, as Amelia lunged at the massive porcine, viciously and mercilessly biting into the pig's thick bulky neck with her sharp canine teeth, causing the pig to squeal wildly in pain, attempting to free itself from Amelia's vice-like grip, as the beastly Vicar used her sharp claws to slice at the hog's bulky flesh, tearing off large chunks of meat and consuming said chunks with relative ease, devouring more and more pig meat by the minute, killing the enormous hog from making it succumb to it's injuries.

This is just a concept from a fan of the game. Anyway, Enjoy!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, over the course of nearly an entire hour, Amelia surprisingly managed to consume the entire gargantuan porcine, reducing the hulking hog into nothing more than a dead skeleton of it's former self, as the bones themselves were licked completely clean of any remaining meat residue. However, despite the shocking success in consuming the enormous member of the Judeas livestock, it didn't rule out the results and aftermath of such consumption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this left the group with a moaning antlered beast that was Vicar Amelia, who leaned herself against one of the sturdy walls, groaning in some sense of pain due to her now overly bloated stomach, which was now past stuffed to the brim, as her now bulging stomach forcefully pressed her animalistic hind legs apart. With her stomach appearing to reach the brink of rupturing from too much consumed meat, Amelia could hear her own stomach emitting these loud gurgling noises, which indicated that her stomach was in the midst of slowly digesting the consumed porcine flesh, preventing said organ from rupturing internally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*long painful groan* SOOOO....*growl*...STUFFED.\" Amelia moaned, obviously attempting to deter herself from any further physical movement, laying a clawed paw-like hand on the top of her engorged and bloated abdomen. But it was there that Clarissa's mother calmly approached the stuffed Amelia, displaying a Cheshire Cat-like grin on her plump feline face and snout, as if she seemed quite impressed with the beastly Vicar's beastly display of sheer gluttony. From there, she spoke toward Amelia with a soothing yet risque tone and said, \"*purr* DO NOT FRET, AMELIA. *light growl* YOU WILL BECOME *purr* ACCUSTOMED TO SUCH FEASTING. THOUGH, I MUST ADMIT: I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED *growl* BY YOUR RAVENOUS HUNGER *purr*.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Amelia was completely unsure if what Clarissa's mother had said to her was either a compliment or mere sarcasm. Either way, Amelia slowly turned her lupine snout to face the Judeas matriarch and hesitantly replied, \"UM....*growl* THANK YOU, MRS. JUDEAS?\" \"*giggle* OH PLEASE *purr*, YOU CAN SIMPLY CALL ME ELEANOR, *light growl* MY DEAR.\"  Clarissa's mother answered, allowing Amelia to use her first name to address her, gently stroking Amelia's overstuffed and bulging belly with a steady paw-like hand, giving the transformed Vicar a weird but oddly soothing and comfortable feeling swelling within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her mind, now she somewhat understood how a dog would feel if someone would gently scratch their belly repeatedly, as Eleanor's belly rubbing was causing Amelia to pant a little, sticking her lupine tongue out in the process. And yet, Amelia still couldn't understand how Clarissa's mother and sisters were still able to retain their sentience despite transforming into beasts themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SO *growl*, I GATHER THAT YOU'RE *purr* ABSOLUTELY CURIOUS REGARDING *light growl* OUR BEASTHOOD, CORRECT?\" Eleanor asked, catching the beastly Vicar completely by surprise, despite not confessing such a question beforehand. However, the transformed matriarch of House Judeas could somehow see right through her on that subject, as Amelia hesitantly nodded once in confirmation, causing Eleanor to display Cheshire Cat-like grin once more in a sense of acknowledgment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, Eleanor turned around to gaze upon her second eldest daughter, Clarissa, who was playing around with Annabelle and Catherine, using a large rubber ball as a source of entertainment for her beastly siblings, as she then spoke toward Clarissa in a maternal tone and asked, \"CLARISSA DEAR, *purr* WOULD YOU KINDLY EXPLAIN *light growl* TO YOUR BELOVED AMELIA IN *purr* REGARDS TO OUR CONDITION?\" \"Of course, Mother.\" Clarissa answered, where she stopped playing with Annabelle and Catherine, approaching the stuffed Amelia, while the beastly matriarch waddled toward a side of the building opposite of the two beastly siblings, watching over them like a mother bear as she carefully laid down on her fat furry belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she made her way to her beastly lover, Clarissa laid against the side of Amelia's left hind leg, enjoying how soft Amelia's fur was. From there, Amelia looked down at the plump noblewoman and asked, \"I STILL DON'T *growl* GET IT. HOW'S YOUR *snarl* MOTHER AND SISTERS *growl* ABLE TO RETAIN *snarl* THEIR HUMANITY--\" \"Despite transforming into Beasts? Well, allow me to elaborate...\" Clarissa answered, completing Amelia's question in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Clarissa began to divulge into thorough detail in regards to how her mother and younger sisters were still able to preserve their humanity while in their current conditions and explained, \"Since you happen to be a Vicar of the Healing Church, I'm guessing you are quite familiar with the treatment known as Blood Healing?\" In response, Amelia nodded in confirmation, obviously familiar with what her beloved Clarissa was talking about, as the curvaceous noblewoman continued her explanation and said, \"Well, as you know by now, my grandmother, her brother, and two sisters were profound and well-established members of the Healing Church's Choir. When the previous Scourge of the Beast plague appeared, they were originally with the concept of using Hunters to hunt down Beasts. However, from what my grandmother told my mother and I, something.....bad, happened to her brother. He was infected with the Scourge of Beast plague, transformed into a Beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hunters of the Healing Church were forced to put him down. This tore apart my grandmother, since my great-uncle was trying to get away from her, not wanting to bring her harm once he transformed into a Beast. And yet, despite turning into a Beast, my grandmother could see some semblance of humanity still inside what her brother had become. So, she ended up experimenting in Old Blood, attempting to conjure up a method to allow someone to retain their sentience, despite the transformation into Beasthood. After all, even if someone turned into a Beast, one must remember that these Beasts were once human before descending into Beasthood.\" Clarissa explained, giving Amelia some thoughts to contemplate on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later after that, Clarissa continued her explanation once more and explained, \"...Anyway, my grandmother eventually discovered the fruition of her experiments, which originated from mixing Old Blood with Pthumerian Blood. To test her concoction's potency, she injected the serum into her veins, which resulted in her transformation into a Beast after giving birth to my mother, my 2 Aunts, and my 3 Uncles. However, the Healing Church wasn't exactly...supportive of her experimenting with Old Blood, forcing her and her sisters to be expunged from Healing Church's ranks, hence why my mother, Annabelle, and Catherine were able to retain their humanity when they succumbed to Beasthood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter such a detailed explanation, Amelia was finally able to comprehend how Clarissa's mother and younger sisters were able to preserve their sentience, despite succumbing to Beasthood. However.....</span></div></div>",

I would someday succumb to Beasthood like my mother, Annabelle, and Catherine, my beloved Amelia. However, it's not a matter of 'if I could transform into a Beast', it is more akin to 'when will I transform into a Beast'. That alone is somewhat.....terrifying, yet intriguing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Clarissa slowly stood up onto her feet, approached the front of Amelia's bloated overstuffed belly, and gently pressed herself against the beastly Vicar's bulging abdomen, inadvertently causing Amelia to emit a light but loud burp from her lupine snout, making her blush out of embarrassment, yet also making Clarissa giggle some out of loving comfort with her transformed lover, as the plump noblewoman spoke once more and said, \".....And yet, when I laid my eyes upon you in your current physical state within Yharnam, my resolve to willingly succumb to Beasthood was cemented firmly, for I don't want you to feel alone in this often cruel world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom hearing what her beloved Clarissa had confessed to her, Amelia couldn't help but shed a few tears from her yellowed beastly eyes, feeling very thankful for her beloved's compassionate devotion to her, despite her transformation into Beasthood back in Yharnam. So, in response to such devotion, Amelia slowly extended her left paw-like hand, reaching out to have Clarissa hold onto her, like two lovers holding hands in romantic affection toward one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU *growl*....FOR NOT LEAVING ME, *snarl* CLARISSA.\" Amelia confessed, feeling grateful for Clarissa staying devoted and faithful to her, despite her transformation into the antlered beast she has now become. Of course, Clarissa grasped one of Amelia's elongated paw-like fingers, since her hand was completely miniscule compared to Amelia's beastly paw-like hands, as the curvaceous noblewoman spoke toward the transformed Vicar with a reassured tone and replied, \"Anything for you, Amelia. Anything for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after such an intimate interaction between these two lovers, Amelia began to let out an exhausted yawn, slowly drifting off to sleep via food coma, due to over-stuffing herself to near bursting limits. She wasn't sure how long she slept, but by the time Amelia regained consciousness......</span></div></div>",

Although she was slumbering for who knows how long, the beastly Vicar could easily see that she clearly slept until morning. From there, as she let out a loud inhuman yawn, Amelia suddenly noticed that her stomach wasn't on the brink of rupturing anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, what laid before her, was a soft, plump belly, jutting out somewhat from her abdomen. \"WHAT THE?\" She thought to herself, slowly poking and prodding her newfound stomach pudge with a paw-like hand, feeling a mix of uncertainty and curiosity from gazing upon such an awkward sight. And yet, Amelia couldn't help but feel.....aroused, from such a side effect from binging, feeling how soft her belly fat was underneath all that fur, causing her to blush some in response. However, Amelia eventually became aware that it wasn't just her belly that received such a small layer of cellulite. Her arms and legs appeared to be slightly thicker than they were previously, as they were coated with a thin but noticeable layer of fat on her beastly frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from her belly, arms, and legs, Amelia also noticed how her furry butt felt a bit more softer than she remembered, becoming a bit more bloated, rounder, and fuller than the beastly Vicar remembered from last night. However, it was there that Amelia began to comprehend what Eleanor meant by \"Becoming accustomed to such feasting\", which meant that she will eventually become just as corpulent and rotund as Clarissa's mother and younger siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, this revelation gave off mixed messages in Amelia's conscience. On one side, she thought it was utterly revolting to succumb to such a lifestyle, becoming as fat or fatter than the blubbery hog she consumed. And yet, on the other side of the spectrum, Amelia couldn't help but feel.....aroused and excited, tempted to playfully tease herself by fondling her pudgy abdomen with her paw-like digits, feeling how soft she become, anticipating for the next meal, so she could downright consume said meal and add more flabby softness to her beastly and inhuman physique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Amelia noticed that her beloved Clarissa was currently sleeping beside her, dressed in a pink flowing night gown, while using the transformed Vicar's plump belly as a giant makeshift pillow as she drifted about in her slumber. Although the scene itself was rather adorable, Amelia felt quite lost upon how she should react to such erotic thoughts about becoming a fat, blubbery, and corpulent beast. And yet, in times of such doubt, she would always consult with a fellow Healing Church member for guidance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her,there were no other Healing Church members she could discuss with about her fattening desires. However, it was there Amelia realized that there was another option: She could talk to Clarissa's mother, Eleanor, and consult with her upon such an arousing but corpulent desire, since Eleanor was currently feeding Annabelle and Catherine breakfast for for a couple of beasts. And yet, the beastly Vicar felt hesitant to converse with the Judeas matriarch on such a.......sexually sensitive topic, but who else could she consult this to? Eventually though, Amelia decided to resort with....</span></div></div>",

But still, the beastly Vicar needed the sage-like advice when it came to her newfound corpulent desires, and the only person capable of such guidance, was none other than Clarissa's rotund beast of a mother, Eleanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Amelia was hesitant towards conversing with the corpulent and beastly matriarch of House Judeas. However, Amelia forcefully endured on, as she mustered up her courage and said, \"ELEANOR, *growl* MIND IF I..... *snarl* DISCUSS SOMETHING *growl* WITH YOU?\" Of course, the beastly Vicar successfully gained the Judeas matriarch's attention, where she looked at the slightly plump Amelia, sporting a curious but caring smirk on her snout. From there, Eleanor spoke toward the beastly Vicar and replied, \"WHY OF COURSE, *purr* AMELIA. TELL ME: *light growl* WHAT DO YOU WANT *purr* TO DISCUSS?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, shortly after overcoming the hesitation stirring within her, Amelia then spoke toward Eleanor as best as she possibly could and asked, \"HOW.....*growl* HOW DOES IT FEEL? *snarl* YOU KNOW, *growl* BEING A FAT BEAST?\" In response to such a trivial and arousing question for the likes of her, Eleanor couldn't help but emit an amused giggle upon hearing Amelia's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, upon seeing the embarrassment on Amelia's lupine snout, Eleanor could obviously interpret that this was a rather sensitive topic for the transformed Vicar, causing the beastly matriarch to abruptly stifle her Cheshire giggling, then calmly gazed upon the chubby Amelia and answered, \"I SEE *purr* YOU ARE QUITE..... *light growl* SERIOUS ON THE SUBJECT, *purr* MY DEAR. WELL, *purr* ALLOW ME *light growl* TO ELABORATE....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, Eleanor calmly shooed Annabelle and Catherine away, where they then began to play around with one another, allowing the beastly matriarch to become preoccupied on consulting with Amelia on the subject at hand....or rather, at paw, in their case. Then, Eleanor slowly approached the slightly plump beastly Vicar, waddling profoundly in the process due to her rotund fur-covered girth, as she then sat next to Amelia and calmly explained, \"TO ANSWER YOUR *purr* QUESTION, DEAR AMELIA: *light growl* BEING AS FAT *purr* AS I AM, IT FEELS.....*aroused purr* IT FEELS QUITE...*aroused purr* AROUSING YET *purr* PERPLEXING. THERE ARE *light growl* NUMEROUS BENEFITS TO HAVING *aroused purr* SUCH A QUANTITY *purr* OF BLUBBER UPON OUR *light growl* BEASTLY PHYSIQUES.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BENEFITS? *growl* WHAT BENEFITS?\" Amelia asked, becoming a bit more confused upon the subject she presented to the rotund and beastly matriarch of House Judeas. Of course, this caused Eleanor to display a Cheshire grin upon her plump feline snout, where she then thoroughly explained, \"QUITE SIMPLE, AMELIA: *purr* WARMTH, COMFORT, AND *giggle* PLEASURE. *light growl* WARMTH THROUGHOUT *purr* THE LONG COLD WINTERS. THE FEELING *light growl* OF SOOTHING COMFORT, *purr* BECOMING A LIVING PILLOW *aroused purr* OR BED OF YOUR OWN *purr* MAKING. AND OF COURSE, *aroused purr* THE EROTIC PLEASURE OF *aroused purr* HAVING YOUR BELLY RUBBED *aroused purr* BY A LOVER. *giggle*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what Eleanor's explanation foretold, along with taking notice of how sexually aroused the corpulent matriarch was becoming, Amelia couldn't help but admit to herself that what Eleanor had explained to her had some actual merit, grasping a bit of newly formed belly fat displayed on her abdomen with a paw-like hand, feeling it jiggle and wobble with each slight ripple of movement upon her beastly frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn turn, Amelia inadvertently began to blush some out of this swelling arousal within her, her inhuman heart thumping faster, and her beastly womanhood becoming warm and somewhat damp in the process. Although Eleanor intentionally became aware of the plump beastly Vicar's slowly swelling arousal, inadvertently causing the obese Judeas matriarch to giggle some from a mix of curiosity and amusement. However, upon Eleanor's giggling, Amelia immediately snapped out of her aroused stupor, her cheeks turning a deep crimson from great embarrassment due to unintentionally losing her composure mere moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, such lewd and erotic behavior was quite unbecoming for a Vicar and considered somewhat as taboo in the ranks of the Healing Church. Then again, Amelia couldn't exactly call herself a member of the Healing Church anymore, considering she has succumbed to the Scourge of the Beast plague, inadvertently transforming into the antlered beast she has now become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, the situation was quite a conundrum for the beastly Vicar, just as Eleanor laid a plump paw-like hand on Amelia's right furry shoulder, attempting to reassure the confused antlered beast that was Vicar Amelia, where the rotund beastly matriarch spoke toward Amelia and said, \"TIS' QUITE ALRIGHT,*purr* AMELIA. THERE IS NOTHING *light growl* TO BE ASHAMED OF, *purr* ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES *light growl* TO ONE'S.....LEWD DESIRES. SO, ENLIGHTEN ME: *curious purr* WHAT IS IT THAT *purr* YOU DESIRE THE MOST?\" Although it was such a simple question, Amelia encountered some difficulty in finding the most suitable answer, which eventually surmised in the form of....</span></div></div>",

lake made entirely of thick gooey cooper smelling blood.<br>\r\nIt was enouth to make a man sick and to The Cleric Beast it was heavenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast wasted no time he drank up the blood filling his skinny belly with warm gooey liquid crimson. <br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast drank and drank till he had a huge boulder like belly filled with blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he was done but as it turned out the lake was not done with him.<br>\r\nWhen he tried to leave The Cleric Beast found blood tendrils came out of the lake and dragged him into the warm red liquid. <br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast was trapped in the lake floating above the blood.<br>\r\nHe thought he was done for and the lake would surely kill him but to the beasts surprise the blood lake did not end his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead with its blood tendrils is feed the blood directly to The Cleric Beast mouth and fed the beast gallons of blood till The Cleric Beast was filled to the brim with a massive and round house sized belly filled with blood.<br>\r\nThe blood lake had kept him in the middle of the lake feeding and pampering The Cleric Beast ever since like he was the blood lakes pet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now we find ourselfs here.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast had been stuck in the middle of the lake for god knows how long being fed day in and day out.<br>\r\nThe beast had a massive belly filled with blood so big to the point his belly button had turned into an outi and jolted up into the sky. <br>\r\nHe had no way of escape and almost accepted his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut their was a light of hope for The Cleric Beast.<br>\r\nThe beast while just a monster was no all that dumb.<br>\r\nIt began to notice something recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile before the blood lake would feed the beast blood none stop till his belly was at bursting point now the lake hardly ever fed him.<br>\r\nThe lake would maybe feed him enouth blood to make his huge belly bloat but other then that it was feeding him very little.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast thought this might be a way to get out while he did kind of like the blood he hated being trapped and treated like a pet. <br>\r\nSo as time went on The Cleric Beast saw that his building sized belly was becoming smaller and smaller from the lack of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was good as not only did it make The Cleric Beast easier to move his bloated body he didn't feel as bloated and huge anymore which the beast found to be a positive. <br>\r\nTime went kept going and The Cleric Beasts once huge belly was now as big as a small boulder which to the huge beast was pretty small <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast now able to move without the heavy weight of his massive gut now just needed an opening.<br>\r\nThe lake always kept its blood tendrils around his arms and legs keeping him bound.<br>\r\nBut their were times when the blood lake loosened its grip probably because The Cleric Beast never really struggled anymore.<br>\r\nSo The Cleric Beast bided its time waited for the perfect opportunity to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast looked up at the blood moon hanging above in the stary night sky.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast hated that moon simply because the massive round rock only reminded him off his massive grey dome of a belly. <br>\r\nBut no more would the beast be trapped in this blood lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lake seemned ever so clam The Cleric Beast suddenly began to thrash and claw at the lake.<br>\r\nThe blood tendrils were not strong enouth to keep the beast pinned The Cleric Beast began to swam with all its might to the shore of the blood lake.<br>\r\nThe beast clawed it way the grassy shore  and dug in deep into the ground as the blood tried to drag him back to the middle of the blood lake.<br>\r\nThe tendrils even tried to reach his mouth in order to feed him again and inflate his belly with blood to pin him down again.<br>\r\nBut it was too late as The Cleric Beast late out an anger filled screech as it pulled itself to the shore and quickly ran out of the lakes grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast found itself on the grassy ground panting out of breath.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast looked behind at the blood lake to see the red lake bubbling like the blood lake was boiling.  <br>\r\nThe Blood lake was anger.....It didn't like that its pet had escaped its grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for The Cleric Beast it stood on the grassy ground it felt so good to be standing on his own two claws again. <br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast felt almost like laughing (If it even could) it had escaped the lake and was free again to terrorise the world. <br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast looked down at his still pretty large dome of a belly and patted it with his massive claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made him look silly but soon his belly would be shrink down and be back to normal so he may bring fear to the hearts of men once more. <br>\r\nThe beast felt ready to finally leave this place but as it was about to leave and never look or be near the blood lake again <br>\r\nBut suddenly The Cleric Beast looked right back at the blood lake as something happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast looked in horror as.... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of the once normal people that inhabited the city where now either raving mad dead or no longer human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once busy streets where quiet and socked in dry blood,<br>\r\nThe brick buildings and old wooden homes where now boarded up or empty.<br>\r\nThis dead city had no life in it anymore the only things that walked the dark streets of Yharnam now where the cursed and the beasts...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne beast a massive house sized monster that was once a normal human wondered through the cold empty streets of central Yharnam looking for its next victim. This beast was known simply as The Cleric Beast once a normal man the cursed old blood had changed him into a inhuman monster.<br>\r\nWith an almost half human half beast like body with tattered long black and white hair.<br>\r\nIts skin a dark grey with short black hair covering his boney limbs.<br>\r\nIts long maw was lined with razor sharp teeth and to to top it all of his left arm was a massive strong clawed arm that could rip apart any mortal into ribbons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruly the Cleric Beast was a monster that struck fear in the hearts of men.<br>\r\nAll human desires and emotions where gone and all that remained was pure animalistic rage its only desires now was to kill and feast on the carcasses of its victims.<br>\r\nIt had no mercy and no love left in its black heart only anger rage and desire for more blood...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast had almost no human intelligence left in its madness and rage filled mind he was driven only by the most basic of desires such as the need for food blood or water and the primal urge to kill.<br>\r\nBut unlike most beasts of the night The Cleric Beast had a few brain cells that still worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt couldn't say anything as its inhuman tongue could only loudly roar make blood curdling screeches and growl in anger.<br>\r\nBut it could still think it could even speak to itself.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast was wondering the streets there was not one sign of anything living it seemned that The Cleric Beast was alone in this dead city <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meat..blood...KILL.....\"  The Cleric Beast was always angry and desired its next victim but sadly for him it seemned that there was no prey left in this cursed town. The Cleric Beast wondered the blood coated streets of Yharnam for what felt like ages searching for prey food water anything... but it seemned this town had nothing left  \" Grrrrrrrhh Thirty...hungry...meat...blood.....need.......\" <br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast had lost all sense of time the night was endless and all he did was stomp through Yharnam The Beasts mouth felt as dry as the desert and his thin belly was so hungry and empty all it did was growl which the beast found so annoying as the rumbling growling noses it made was the only sound that filled the silent dead town along with the beasts stomping feet which the beast hated the sounds off he felt thirsty hungry and tired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours went by and The Cleric Beast was so hungry he slowly stomped throw the empty streets of Yarnam and there was nothing for him to eat or drink.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast was so thirty that he begun to lick up the dried old blood the stained the city streets and walls just because he was so thirty.<br>\r\nHe would drink anything right about now blood or water he didn't care he just wanted to drink something.<br>\r\nIf this kept up The Cleric Beast wouldn't even be able to walk soon \"Blood..Grrrr..need...blood....need.....water...need...to drink...something..Grrrrr....ANYTHING....\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast soon stumbled into an abandoned market to his dismay there was nothing hear either not one meat carcasses no left over blood vials the place was dead just like the rest of the city.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast felt like screaming his lungs out he couldn't take it anymore was there truly nothing left in this city for him to drink or eat? <br>\r\nHow was he to survive in this cursed town? what was the thirty and starving beast to do? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the Beast felt ready to smash apart the near by buildings in anger and frustration he suddenly smelled something with his highly sensitive nose \"Sniff...Sniff.... \" the beast sniffed the air trying to pin point where the smell was coming from he couldn't tell what it was it didn't smell like blood or meat it wasn't a particularly good smell but The Cleric Beast was desperate enouth for anything that he followed the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell lead the horrid beast to the middle of the old market in the middle he saw a huge fountain.<br>\r\nIt was old and dirty the Beast could even see blood stains on the fountain but the worst part there was nothing coming out of the fountain it was dry like everything else in this dead town.<br>\r\nBut the smell was definitely coming from it so The beast went up to the large fountain and when the beast looked down into the fountain he saw that there was indeed water! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the beast could smile like a normal human he would be grinning right about now. <br>\r\nIt seemned that even though the fountain wasn't working anymore the water was still in it even after all this time.<br>\r\nHe looked at the water and sniffed it it smelled awful like bog water it didn't look right either it was so green with light shades of orange and red.<br>\r\nIt didn't seem like this water was clean at all what in the world could be in the water to make it smell so bad?<br>\r\nTo the Cleric Beasts nose it almost smelled like chemicals where in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut The beast didn't care if it was dirty old fountain water.<br>\r\nIt could be the nastiest dirtiest water in the whole world and he would still drink it he was that desperate.<br>\r\nThe beast wasted no time and put its mussel to the bottom of the fountain the water tasted awful but to the thirty Cleric Beast it was the best water he had ever tasted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe begun to drank up big gulps of the nasty contaminated water he drank up as much as he could without stooping to breath it didn't take too long for the contaminated water to lower as the Cleric Beast dark more and more.<br>\r\nIt didn't take too long till the fountain was near empty the beast was drinking so much that he didn't even notice the many pennies and coins that where thrown into the fountain that he had swallowed up along with the gross water he was drinking so much that slowly his once thin belly was growing out into a nice cute little pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis grey round smooth tummy grew out a few inches with ever big gulp he took slowly filling up with more gross contaminated water and cooper pennies and lead coins. <br>\r\nBy the time the fountain was empty The Cleric Beast was just sipping up any last drops of gross water he could find till the whole fountain was licked clean.<br>\r\nNot one drop of contaminated water left there was not even one penny left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast sighed in relief feeling as his thirst had finally bean quenched.<br>\r\nHe sat next to the empty fountain The Cleric Beast only just noticed his big round pot belly.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast was surprised by his now big gut even back when he was feasting on hunters he never really got a big round belly but now after drinking up all that nasty fountain water he had a pretty big tummy he put his large claw to his gut and gave it a shake the water sloshed around in his belly and he could even hear the sounds of the pennies and coins jingling inside his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though his thirst was quenched his belly started to feel pretty weird maybe he drank to fast some bad water and a few coins and pennies couldn't make a strong scary beast like him sick...could it?<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast didn't feel sick but his belly still felt really funny after a few minutes he started to feel kind of dizzy.<br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast looked at the Yarnam market. The streets and buildings became blurry and everything seemned to be spinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt so weird and he had no idea what was happening his whole world seemned to be changing as everything in his vision became nothing but blurry random colours. <br>\r\nThe Cleric Beasts vision soon started to come back to him he looked forward trying to make out the strange colourful wobbling shapes that filled his vision. <br>\r\nSoon The Cleric Beast could start to make out what he was looking at but it didn't make any sense... was what he was looking at real? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision got better and as he saw the wobbling shapes take form The Cleric Beast felt more confused then ever as he saw what was once Yarnam turn into something completely different... <br>\r\nThe Cleric Beast looked around and saw that he was now in...                                          </span></div></div>",

The sound of Chaus' belly gurgling and groaning was soothing for Garrett as he continued sleeping peacefully, with Chaus, none the wiser.  As night time came, however, despite the vast amount of alcohol consumed, Chaus; shockingly, would gradually awaken to find his hangover wasn't nearly as bad he had expected it to be.  Perhaps courtesy of the vast amount of food still sitting in his rounded belly, but minus a fairly notable headache, he was no worse for the ware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was when he felt something pressing against his stomach that he found himself taken back.  The thief's eyes slowly drifted up to his big belly, and, much to his surprise, the bartender had used it as something of a pillow, resting idly atop it within the empty, now closed tavern.  Chaus wasn't sure to make of it at first.  Perhaps Garrett was just too tired helping out.  Regardless, Chaus smirked as he jostled his gut a bit, causing the internal bubbling and rippling to his scaly belly to catch Garrett's attention, and quickly rouse the bartender awake.  Then, upon seeing a groggy Chaus awake, and smirking at Garrett, the bartender's face immediately reddened as he sat up and pulled himself aside from Chaus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, g-g'd evening, Chaus,\" Garrett said, trying to play it cool, before clearing his throat and changing the subject.  \"So...seems you won the bet...\" he muttered, glancing down at Chaus' plump, scaly belly for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaus, meanwhile, rested his palm against his gut, rubbing over every inch of it as he nodded to himself and licked his chops and said, \"As if there was ever any doubt.  Bit of advice?  NEVER doubt how much I can put away, because that's one bet you're never gonna win...speaking of...\"  Chaus sat up, his fat belly spilling down onto his lap as he continued rubbing over it, and grinning cockily at Garrett.  \"I do believe I WON that little bet of yours...which means, all I can eat and drink...on the house.  And now that you know what I can put away, hehe, you better believe I'm gonna take advantage of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett, for his part, occasionally glanced back at that perfectly spherical belly of the Argonian, watching Chaus rub it slowly and soothingly, then immediately found himself looking skyward, chuckling nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-heh, yeah, looks that way...and a bet's a bet...congratulations, by the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaus bowed his head, still smirking, but he never once took his eyes off Garrett, more specifically, the way Garrett was looking at him...or rather, his currently plump midsection.  The aversion in Garrett's eyes, the evasive behavior, the way he found Garrett in the morning, and, of course, the way the bartender occasionally bit his scaly lip, it was all too obvious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Garrett...\" Chaus began, catching the bartenders attention.  \"Y'know, my gut IS still fairly jam packed...\" and for emphasis, Chaus gave his scaly belly a hefty slap, causing it to jostle a bit as a result, and once again, making Garrett avert his gaze, \"...and unless I wasn't PISS drunk...you were tending to it quite nicely earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving the Argonian bartender a knowing look, the scaly thief smirked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to give it your attention again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarrett glanced back at Chaus, then down at his domed gut, fidgeting a bit as he thought to himself for several moments, before finally, turning back to Chaus...</span></div></div>",

You know your always welcome after hours,\" he said.<br>\r\nThe two settled down at the bar's counter and catched up on old times. Garret's day was pretty boring; there wasn't a lot of costumers today. But Chaus' day was much more exciting; he stole a bunch of very valuable things away from some sorcerer. Garret also saw that he used his newly required wealth to buy him some good clothing; he was dressed in thickly padded leather tunic and wore leather pants as well. Across his chest was a strap (which held his short sword and dagger in place) fitted with rubies.<br>\r\n\"Most of the stuff I stole is magical, but I'm not sure what this does though.\" He produced from his pocket a locket made from solid gold. Inside was a picture of some sort of entity surrounded by piles of food. \"So I was thinking that you should have it.\"<br>\r\nGarret excepted his gift happily. In return he gave Chaus a free meal, drink, and place to sleep for the night.<br>\r\nGarret went to sleep that night as well with the locket around his neck.

Not one person?\" Mae asks as Gregg stops waving his arms around, \"Nope, nobody, other then you and Steve Scriggins that is\" Gregg says as he walks around the counter and over to Mae \"I wouldn't really count him as a person\" She responds with a mild frown, thinking about Steve Scriggins and how much of an ass he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregg nods in agreement as he quickly changes the subject, \"So what are you doing here?\" He asks tilting his head slightly, \"I was wondering if you wanted to hang out, I'd ask Bea but she's busy with work right now\" She replies, \"But I don't want you to get in trouble with your boss\" She responds, \"Nah it's fine, Christine doesn't really bother checking up on me right now\" He says putting his hands into his jacket pockets \"And Angus isn't in town right now, so I'm up for anything!\" Gregg exclaims pulling his hands out of his pockets as he stretches out his arms, \"Where's he gone?\" Mae asks folding her arms as Gregg lowers his back down to his sides, \"Something to do with his family, said he's going to be away for a few weeks\" He says in a saddend tone, \"But now that gives me more time to hang out with you\" He's perking up as quickly as he did earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae unfolds her arms and smiles \"So does that mean we get to do..\" She says as she leans over to Gregg and whispers \"Crimes?\" She leans back from Gregg as he smiles and responds \"Crimes\" They both nod at each other as they go to leave the Snack Falcon. But not before they hear a loud rumbling coming from Greggs stomach, \"Oh, heh, must of skipped lunch\" He says blushing and rubbing the back of his head in an embarrassed manner, \"Do you want to go somewhere to eat?\" Mae asks, \"You can't do crimes on an empty stomach\" She says while moving to just about to open the door, \"Sure that sounds great, where do you want to go?\" Gregg asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, where do you want to go for food?</span></div></div>",

She was thinking about Gregg and what he might look like if he was rounder, and through this thought she hatched a plan to make Gregg as big as reasonably possible, though she'd have to do it subtly, cause there was no way Gregg would ever agree to this, besides, it might be more fun this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally arrived at The Clik Clak Diner, they both noticed that it was also surprisingly quiet, with only a handful of staff on duty, \"Wonder where everybody is?\" Gregg asks as he walks over to a booth at the back and takes a seat, \"Maybe they're all still at work\" Mea responds as she follows Gregg to the booth, \"Probably\" Gregg replies shrugging his shoulders, \"Means a quicker service for us I guess\" He says while picking up a menu and look at the options on offer. Mea also grabs a menu and takes note of the various food items and which one would best suited for en-biggening Gregg, but then she realises how much it might cost, so now she has to think which item is less expensive but also highly fattening, \"Thought of anything yet?\" Gregg asks from behind the menus he was holding, \"Hmm, not sure yet, you can pay for this right?\" Mae asks as she continues reading the menu, \"Oh yeah I should be fine, got a decent pay day recently and I've got a bit of extra cash from it\" Gregg replies as he puts the menu down, \"Ah that's good to hear, because I think I've got a few things to order\" Mae says as she puts down the menu on top of Greggs and moves them over to the corner of the booth table, \"Great! Would you mind doing the order? I've gotta go to the mens room\" Gregg says as he motions towards the toilet doors, \"Yeah sure thing\" Mea says as Gregg gets up from the table and goes through to the mens room, Mae smiles to herself as she gets her plans moving along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gregg finishes drying his hands and walking out the mens room, he notices the smell of pizza, his mouth starts to water as he walks over to the table and sits down, \"Wow that looks good\" Gregg says, eying the pizza, \"Yeah it looks like they've improved somehow\" Mae responds grabbing a slice, Gregg also doing the same, \"Only one way to find out\" He says as he shoves the slice into his mouth, savoring the melted cheese and pepperoni slices, quickly finishing it off as he puts the crust back onto the tray and goes for another slice, \"Mmm, pizza good\" Mae says as she just finishes her first slice, grabbing her second one, noticing Gregg has now moved on to his fourth slice, which he also quickly devours and moves on to his fifth and sixth slice, leaving only the crusts, \"You really were hungry weren't you?\" Mae says as she eats he second slice, \"Heh, well I did say I skipped lunch\" Gregg replies after quickly finishing his sixth slice, \"Still a little bit hungry though\" He says looking over at the pizza tray, now only covered with pizza crusts and small bits of grease, \"Good thing I ordered some pierogis\" Mae says as the pizza tray is removed and a large tray with a mountain of various flavoured pierogis is shoved on to the table, \"Nice!\" Gregg exclaims as he is about to grab a handful, Mae stops him, \"Hey I've got an idea\" Mae says, \"Remember a few months ago when I tossed pierogis into your mouth?\" She says as she pulled the tray over to her, \"Oh yeah I remember that, I also remember you missing almost every time and hitting me in the face with them\" Gregg says while pointing out the various spots she had tossed a pierogi at his face, \"I had to explain to Angus why my fur was so greasy\" He says \"It took an hour for me to wash it out!\" He exclaims while waving his arms in the air, \"It'll be fine, I promise, I've also worked on my aim so I won't miss as much\" Mae explains, Gregg puts his arms down and gets into a comfortable position \"Alright fine, just try not to hit me in the eye this time\" He says as he opens his mouth ready for his first Mae delivered pierogi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae aims carefully and flings the pierogi into Greggs waiting maw, first a normal meaty one, then a spicy jalapeno one and then a vegetable, she keeps the same pattern going, all the while noticing how round Greggs middle was getting and how it had started to push out against his leather jacket, causing one of the buttons to look like it was about to pop off, Mae some how managed to hold back a blush as she saw the foxes belly growing in front of her, but she had her mind set on not missing a single shot and when when she got down to the final one, she made sure it'd hit its mark, with a final toss it landed in Greggs maw and went down into his bloated belly, \"Oof that was filling\" Gregg said as he leaned back causing his jacket to strain, \"I think you got all 30 of them down\" He said as he and Mae slowly got up from the booth, leaving some cash for the bill on the table behind them, \"I told you wouldn't miss\" Mae said while looking at Greggs massive middle, forcing herself not to prod or stroke it. As they leave the Clik Clak Diner, Gregg starts puffing, \"Hey uh Mae?\" Gregg asks, \"Would you mind helping me back to mine and Angus's? I think I ate a bit too much\" He says as Mae moves one arm around his back to help him move with his swollen bulk, \"Sure thing dude\" She says as they both walk to the appartment building. When they finally arrive, Mae slowly lets Gregg down onto the sofa and closes the door, \"You alright?\" She asks looking over Gregg, trying not to completely focus on his round belly, \"Yeah I'll be fine\" He says while adjusting himself on the sofa, \"I just need to sleep this off that's all\" He says as he pulls the zipper down his jacket, revealing his grey shirt just bearly covering his round belly, his belly fur just poking out slightly, Mae blushes at the sight, desperately trying not to think about grabbing it and squishing it and kneeding it, \"You alright?\" Gregg asks raising one eyebrow, \"Y-yeah I'm perfectly fine!\" Mae says, \"I-I was just thinking about Angus...\" She says in her most convincing manner possible, \"And his sweet ass? Yeah I don't blame you\" Gregg said smiling, now thinking about his boyfriends ass, \"But he is mine remember?\" He says in his 'serious' tone, \"Yeah I know\" Mae says, \"But that wasn't was I was thinking about\" She replies, \"I was thinking about how he might react to you spending your money like that\" She says, still trying not to look at Greggs belly for too long, \"Oh it'll be fine, he's away for a few weeks remember, besides, he'd be fine with it any way\" Gregg says as he sits upright on the sofa, \"I'll be fine by myself for a few weeks\" He says as he puts both hands on his belly, still not noticing it or its largeness, \"Well, I could stay here the night if you wanted? I'm sure my partents would be fine with it\" Mae says, \"Only if you're cool with it though\" She says while sitting down next to Gregg, \"Of course I'd be fine with it!\" Gregg exclaims, \"We can have a night together, maybe watch a terrible movve or something\" He suggests while moving up the sofa to get more comfortable, \"Awesome, I'll just phone my folks, check its ok\" Mae says as she goes over to the phone and starts to dial her house number, \"Great\" Gregg says as he lies down on the sofa and falls asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, love you too\" Mae says as she finishes the call and looks over at the sleeping Gregg, \"Oh I'm going to have fun making you big\" She says quietly while looking over the sleeping fox, \"I'm sure Angus won't mind a bigger boyfriend, more to play with that way\" She says as she walks over to the kitchen and looks in the fridge, \"Looks like Angus cooked you some stuff before he left\" She says to herself, looking over the various foods, then closing the fridge to go rest of the sofa next to Gregg, \"sweet dreams big guy\" She says as she quickly drifts off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning quickly came, as Mae slowly woke up and got off the sofa, trying not to wake up Gregg, who was now looking a lot pudgier and softer, much to Mae's delight. She was tempted to get a proper look at Greggs rounder body, but first she thought it might be a good idea to cook something for them to eat first, so she walked over the the fridge and grabbed a few eggs and some bacon, turning on the stove and as best she could, cook up some omelettes with bacon. Just as she finished cooking, Gregg slowly walked into the kitchen and sat down at the table, \" I didn't know you could cook\" Gregg said with surprise as he'd never seen Mae cook anything that wasn't using a microwave, \"My mom is teaching me a few things, might as well try them out\" Mae said while giving Gregg a plate full of omelettes and a stack of bacon, \"Smells great and tastes even better!\" Gregg said as he started to chomp down on his meal, Mae nodded in agreemeant as she ate her slightly smaller portion, mainly watching Gregg and his full figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe noticed how his arms and neck were slightly plumper and how his cheeks had a slight roundness to them, when she looked to the side to view Greggs belly, she noticed how it slowly pushed out from under his grey shirt and how tight his jeans looked from his growing body. Gregg quickly finished his meal and leaned back against his chair, \"That was good, we should hire you as our personal chef\" He said as he rested both hands on his slightly rounder belly, Mae chuckled, \"Heh, you could afford me if I was\" She said as she finished off here small meal, Greg smiled and got up from his chair and put the dishes in the sink, \"You're right, it's much easier to have Angus do that for me\" He said while cleaning the dishes, \"Angus would do a lot of things for you without even asking\" Mae said as she got up from her seat, \"He's great like that\" Gregg said as he finished the the dishes, \"I should probably have a shower\" He says quickly changing the subject, \"Or do you want to go first?\" He asks motioning toward the bathroom, \"Uh sure, thanks Gregg\" Mae says as she goes towards the bathroom, \"I'll be quick\" She said before shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMae looked in the mirror at her refelction, noticing the bags under her eyes, \"You need to sleep on a proper bed\" She said quietly to herself, before stepping into the shower and turning it on. Gregg waited outside the bathroom patiently on the sofa, hoping Mae would be done soon so he could get to work and possibly get something to eat, thinking about it, since last night he was thinking about food a lot more, but he couldn't but his finger on as to why. Just as Gregg was in thinking about it, Mae came out of the bathroom, \"Uh Gregg?\" She asked, \"Can you help me with something?\" She said while motioning into the bathroom, \"Uh sure\" Gregg said as he walked over into the bathroom and immediately noticed what Mae needed help with, she had somehow gotten one of her shoes onto the bathroom cabinet, a little confused though still willing to help his best friend, Gregg hopped onto something to grab the shoe with ease, what Gregg didn't know was that the thing he hopped on was some scales, Mae leaned in as Gregg reached for the shoe, the scale read Greggs weight at 219 pounds, Mae tried to hide her pleased shock, but then Gregg turned around to hand her the shoe, \"You alright?\" Gregg asked slightly confused, \"O-oh Yeah I'm fine, I'm just happy you got my shoe back\" Mae said as he manged to fool Gregg once again, \"I better get going, you've got work to get to\" She said as she put her shoe back on and then started to walk towards the door, \"Yeah you're right, it was awesome hanging out with you!\" Gregg said with enthusiasm, \"It was awesome, meet you later after work?\" Mae asked as she opened the door, \"That'd be great!\" Gregg says as he moved towards the door, \"Great! I'll see you later Gregg\" Mae said as she left towards the elevator, \"Later!\" Gregg said as he closed and locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick shower and a change of clothes and his leather jacket, which felt a bit tighter then a few days ago, \"Maybe they shrank in the wash?\" Gregg said to himself as he walked out of the bathroom and over to the appartement door, going though it and on his way to the Snack Falcoln. When he finally arrived he noticed that everthing was the same as he left if before, quickly going behind the counter and getting ready for the next customer, which just so happened to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will this customer be?</span></div></div>",
