My parents aren't very creative with names, either. I'm just glad I wasn't born in February or October (shudder).<br>\r\n     Anyway, right now I was looking at the black inside of the small, coffin-sized sleeping chamber. I liked to trace the letters of my name that were etched into the side. Some of the kids in my school had even signed up for this, either because they were total daredevil idiots or because their parents didn't care about them any more than mine cared about me.<br>\r\n     We'd been in space for about a week. Probably a year or two in Earth days. I was still getting used to that wording, even though I felt more at home on this giant machine than on Earth.<br>\r\n     Suddenly, the door behind my head slid open, revealing the room outside. Gratefully, I stretched and pushed myself out, gripping the edges as I did so I wouldn't float out of control.<br>\r\n     Thankfully, Ricky was there. He caught me as I came out and slid me the rest of the way, so that we were both floating and gripping the edge to stay upright as he closed the compartment.<br>\r\n     \"How are you?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n     I shrugged. \"Fine, I guess. I'm sick of being stuck in those coffins, though.\"<br>\r\n     He laughed, apparently amused by my discomfort. \"Yeah, those things do suck. But the Captain said we would be landing in about thirty minutes.\"<br>\r\n     I nodded, trying not to show my excitement. \"Great.\"<br>\r\n     \"Wanna get ready?\" Ricky asked.<br>\r\n     \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n     \"Great.\"</span></div></div>",

He leaned back in the courtroom chair he was in, probably the last comfy chair he'd ever sit in. The judge dismissed the jury, and the bailiff was called to remove Axel to a holding cell. Found guilty for the murder of two civilians. Just another example of his knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Except this time it really bit him in the ass. He let out a quiet sigh, and listened to the almost imperceptible mechanical whir that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Davis, correct?\" A tall, thin man in a business suit asked. he had the look of a stuck-up but sniveling underling who was easy to push around if you had a higher station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" Axel replied in a bored tone, \"Already processing requests for last meals? Didn't know the system worked so fast these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here on behalf of any judicial or federal system. I'm here to make you an offer.\" The stick figure said. Axel could practically <b>hear</b> him looking down on him. \"My employers have taken an interest in you. A near spotless record until now, plenty of useful skill sets, and now a good reason to agree to what I'm about to say. My employers want you to work for the company. You would be going to Pandora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel's eyes lit up at the name. There wasn't a kid on Earth who grew up without hearing about it, and most would kill (no pun intended) to go there. Barring the hostile atmosphere, hostile fauna, hostile natives, and hostile just about everything else. \"I'm listening.\" Axel said, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can agree, and you'll get the details later, or decline, and we'll leave you to rot in a prison cell until your execution.\" The suit said flatly. \"Your choice.\"</span></div></div>",

When do I get out of here?\" Axel asked clasping his hands around the bars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, but you will have to wait for your escort. You will be taken home briefly to collect some of your belongings, and afterwards you will be taken to the launch area. Once you have departed, you will be put in cryo. Don't create any problems, and things might go nicely for you. Got it?\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n\"All personnel going to cryo, please place your baggage into your locker, and prepare for cooling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel moved with unusual grace without gravity holding him down, although the handcuffs on his wrists did make a few things difficult. Before long, he was being put in a cryo chamber and being told to relax. He closed his eyes and briefly wondered if he should've worn anything more than a Hawaiian shirt, jeans, and hiking boots as the chamber hissed shut, to remain that way for almost the next six years.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------<br>\r\n\"Rise an' shine, dirtbag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel winced at the rude voice yelling at him, and smoothed out the creases in his shirt before exiting the cryo tube. He moved over to his locker, still handcuffed, and got his bag before being escorted to the surface shuttle. He was shoved down into his seat by a tough looking military type, and practically had an re-breather system thrown at him. Other guys took their seats around him, mostly guys who were likely working as hired guns. The shuttle detached itself with a small jolt, and before long, a man in army greens was standing up, giving them instructions for what to do when they landed.</span></div></div>",

There were loud, ominous crashing noises outside, giving a few of the men sitting down reason to look around nervously. Axel simply sat there, eyes closed and mind clear, ignoring the turbulence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!\" One of the flight crew called out loudly, walking to the back of the shuttle where the docking bay was. \"Remember, people, you lose that mask, you will be unconscious in under half a minute, and you are worm food in four minutes! It looks very bad on me for any of you to die, so let's nobody be dead today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel listened to the collective hissing noise of everyone else putting their masks on, and then joined the mask wearing brigade with a tiny smirk stamped on his face. He didn't need it, but he'd humor them for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shuttle landed with another small jolt, and the crewman who was giving them instructions said, \"Remove your seat-belts and get your bags! Let's keep it moving boys! When that ramp opens, head straight to base. This is not a vacation, so there is no stopping for sight-seeing! On my signal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ramp descended, the air shimmered as Pandora's breath rushed in. The crewman in charge waved his hand in a \"get moving\" signal. Axel was at the back of the line of men, and followed two steps behind the girl in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it moving! Do not make me wait on you special case. Your security escort will be waiting right inside, do not make him wait!\" The crewman shouted as Axel moved past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel looked around a bit as he kept up in line, and thought one thing. <i>Looks like prison to me.</i></span></div></div>",

Hell, you are no longer anywhere close to it. And speaking of Hell, if there is one, you may want to go there to recover from a tour here on Pandora. That aside, I am Colonel Quaritch, current chief of security in this facility. It is my job to protect you. I will not succeed. Because inevitably, someone here is not going to follow the rules. Not Earth rules. Pandora rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuaritch moved farther forward, up towards the shuttered window that everyone was facing. He snapped his fingers for dramatic effect, opening the blinds to a vast wall of slightly distant foliage of a multitude of colors ranging from ordinary to a bit luminescent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule number one.\" He said, pointing out at the dense jungle, \"Out there, beyond that lovely, barbed-wire fence, every living thing that is not from Earth wants to kill you and and drain you of your bodily fluids like soda from a soda can. If you have any intention of survival, you will remember that fact every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great</i>, Axel thought, propping his head up on the palm of his hand, <i>This is the guy who's tossing me orders. Probably has been here for half his life, and is just as probably bat-shit insane.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AM I BORING YOU, BOY?\" Quaritch said very loudly from a foot behind Axel, snapping him out of his thoughts. \"This is a prime example of a violation of rule number one. Do not let this,\" He then indicated towards Axel, \"happen to you. And I will be having a discussion with you after this little brief is done\"</span></div></div>",
