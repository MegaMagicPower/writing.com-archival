Tonight was the 20th anniversary of his marriage to his wife, Linda, and he'd forgotten all about it. Now he was desperately searching for anywhere selling something that could make for a halfway decent anniversary gift before he had to go meet Linda for dinner. As he drove he saw a store he'd never noticed before in their town, one selling antiques. It seemed to be the only place around that was still open so he decided to give it a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe store was deserted save for an old woman behind the counter, who looked up from her romance novel to give George a polite smile. There was nothing among all the nicknacks and dusty lamps that stood out to George untill underneath some old magazines he found an old leather-bound tome, with arcane and demonic looking designs on the cover. Inside was page after page of Latin text. Linda had always loved magic stuff, being a big fan of fantasy fiction, so something like an old spellbook, even if magic wasn't real, would be perfect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorge took it to the counter to pay for it, but the old lady insisted he have it for free. \"I hope you and your wife have a wonderful anniversary,\" she said. George thanked her and rushed out to the car, now officially running late for dinner. In his haste he didn't stop to wonder how it was that the old lady knew it was his anniversary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda had already ordered them both drinks by the time George arrived at the restuarant. \"I'm so sorry I'm late,\" he said, leaning in to kiss his wife's cheek before sitting down across from her. Linda shrugged, \"you're not as late as last year anyways,\" she said. Although she was 44, Linda Robertson could still have passed for ten years younger, keeping her body in great shape thanks to her strict regimen of yoga and crossfit. She had striking green eyes complimented by red hair that fell just past her shoulders, and wore a blue dress that accentuated her C-cup cleavage. She smiled and extended her wine glass across the table to George. \"Happy anniversary, baby\" she said as they clinked their glasses together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards their waitress came by for their dinner orders. She couldn't have been much older than 20, with short black hair framing her pale face, wearing a black tanktop and a skirt that ended about her mid-thigh. She wore a nametag the same silver colour as her nose piercing, it said her name was Andi. George tried as hard as he could to avoid admiring the younger woman's figure in front of his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Andi had taken their orders Linda slid a small box across the table to George. It contained a new watch, like he'd secretly been hoping for. George handed her the giftbag he'd put the book into. \"Apparently it's supposed to be magic,\" he said. Linda was thrilled. \"That's so thoughtful,\" she said, flicking through it. \"Any idea what any of this says?\" she asks, placing the book on the table between them so that they can both have a look. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All the other inmates knew what he'd done to get in there, the rape of a teenage girl in his neighbourhood, and kept their distance mostly. Occasionally he'd get beaten up, mostly he just got dirty states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst thing about prison so far though was one of the guards names Marissa. She was a blonde that couldn't have been more than thirty, with a pretty face, green eyes and, as far as he could tell under the guard uniform, a fit body. She often went out of her way to make his life hell: beating him with her baton unprovoked and having him sent to solitary for supposedly assaulting her, taking him away from the cafeteria with no food to clean toilets, and waking him up randomly in the middle of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIncreasingly determined to get himself out of prison, he began to study in the library whenever he had free time, hoping to learn more about the legal system to hopefully find a way to reduce his sentence. One day he was doing just that when he found a mysterious leather-bound book behind one bookshelf. If he didn't know better he would have sworn it was calling to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book is covered in various pentagrams and other satanic looking images. Inside it was all Latin, and he couldn't understand a word. His vision blurred for a moment and he suddenly realised that what he thought was Latin is in reality English, and that the book is supposedly a collection of magic spells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began flicking through the time eagerly, reading the English titles and descriptions while mouthing the Latin incantations. After a long time Marissa saunteres in, holding her baton in one hand and lightly smacking it against the palm of her other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, creep,\" she said, grinning as she approached him. \"I've been looking for you, I need to let off some steam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Anthony do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
