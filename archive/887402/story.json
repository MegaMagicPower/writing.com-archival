It had been a long day and he just wanted Double Potions to be over with so he could focus on more exciting things, like Quidditch practice.  Professor Snape had already visited his desk 3 times this class period to tell him that he added too much wolfsbane or not enough snake fangs or that he was stirring in the wrong direction.  In his usual eerie way, the pale professor glided along from cauldron to cauldron.  Harry turned his attention to the shouting that occurred as Snape approached Neville's potion.  Neville had apparently messed up again and Snape was reassuring his position as the young boy's biggest fear.  The sudden outburst startled Ron, who had been very close to falling asleep and landing his face into the cauldron in front of him, and in doing so, caused him to knock one of his ingredient bottles from the desk.  Harry saw this and made a dive after the bottle, but was too late.  Snape turned around in a swift movement to see what the commotion was.  His long cape billowed out and around in the motion and covered the bottle from his view.  With a look that could suck the life from a giant, Snape stepped toward Harry, who was now laying on the floor in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bowing to me will not get you a higher grade, Potter.  10 points from Gryf...\" Snape's words were cut off as he stepped on the jar and was sent backward into Neville's cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contents spilled out as the cauldron rocked and tipped onto its side.  Before he had a chance to react to the situation, Snape had been covered by the unknown concoction.  A puff of smoke and a flash of light engulfed the greasy haired Potions Master.  When the smoke cleared, Snape, fearing the worst, took a look at himself.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he raised his eyes, he stumbled slightly in shock as he saw his classroom towering over him.  The students were in an uproar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now I've done it...I'm dead..Snape's gonna kill me for sure this time!!!\" Neville began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Neville!\" Harry comforted, \"It was an accident.  It wasn't your fault, and I'm pretty sure there's a rule against killing students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now look what you've done!\" Draco accused as he examined the area for any sign of his head of house. \"You are SO dead when Snape gets back, ya bloody idiot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is IF the greasy git ever does come back!\" Ron added, stepping through the crowd of students gathered around Neville's desk, \"Who knows what your potion could have done, Neville.  What do you suppose happened to em, Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape took a moment to gather his bearings and as soon as he had, he was forced to dash under the desk to avoid being crushed by the Weasley boy's foot.  Dreading what he was about to do, Snape took a deep breath and stepped back out into the open, \"Weasley!  Look down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape's calls went unheard over the commotion.  He reached into his pocket and pulled out his wand which had shrunk along with him.  Pointing up at the redheaded student, he tried to send off sparks, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just great.  The change is size must be affecting my wand.  Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had made her way to the others, \"This is terrible!  What if something horrible happened to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for him! Stupid git!

He noticed the tipped cauldron and the uncleaned potion on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's strange,\" Lupin thought out loud, reaching for his wand, \"it's not like Severus to leave a spilled potion all over the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wave of his wand, the potion had vanished.  Lupin then proceeded to walk over, pocketing his wand, and right the tipped cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape slid back behind the leg of the desk to avoid the approaching Marauder's old and worn down shoes.  \"What is he doing on school grounds?\" Snape questioned with a hint of disgust in his tone, \"And why is he looking for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden thunderous noise jolted Snape from his pondering and he watched as the legs to the chair in front of him slid out from under the desk and turned to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupin, looking worse for wear, took a seat next to the now upright cauldron.  \"I'll rest here for a bit and see if he returns.\" Lupin stated to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this, Snape closed his eyes in a momentary attempt to hinder his dislike of the distraught wizard.  'Well I'm going to need assistance in finding an antidote at this size,' Snape thought to himself, 'and Lupin's wolf-like senses should allow him to find me easier than  anyone else...'  Crinkling up his abnormally long nose in disgust, he approached the resting wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the base of his shoe, Snape called up to him.  Lupin, who had been resting his head upon his hand, leaning on the desk, jumped slightly at the sound of his name.  He looked around for the source and raised an eyebrow in confusion when he found none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Severus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Snape was about to call for Lupin to look down, the doors swung open once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remus!\" came the cool and collected voice of Albus Dumbledore, \"What a pleasant surprise.  What brings you to Hogwarts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupin stood up to answer, but before he had a chance, he was almost knocked over by the three students accompanying Dumbledore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry! Ron! Hermione!  It's great to see you, too!\"  Lupin smiled, hugging the trio back. \"I'm sorry to intrude, Albus.  I was hoping to get a chance to speak to Severus. You see my Wolfsbane supply is running threateningly low and without work, it's been difficult to get ingredients.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no worries Remus!  You are always welcome in my school.\"  Dumbledore smiled at Lupin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But professor, we don't have a clue what happened to Snape, how are we going to get the ingredients for a wolfsbane potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PROFESSOR Snape, Harry, my boy.  And well, we'll just have to find our Potions Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this commotion, Snape, fearing being trampled by the three students he despised most, had managed to climb onto Lupin's shoe, taking hold of the cuff of his pants leg for support.  Right when he was thinking that things couldn't get much worse, he was forced to hold on for dear life as Lupin took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\"  Lupin questioned, now seeing the disconcerting looks on their faces, \"What happened to Professor Snape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, to put it simply,\" Hermione began, \"we were in class and Neville had messed up his potion again, so Professor Snape was scolding him, when Ron, who was about to fall asleep and lose Gryffindor even more points, knocked an ingredients jar onto the floor.  Well Harry dived after it and Professor Snape turned around to see what all the fuss was about.  He stepped right on the jar which his cape had covered from his sight and fell backward into Neville's cauldron. The potion spilled all over him and the next thing we knew he was gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon turns to Harry, \"To put it simply?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry snickers, but turns his attention back to Lupin and Dumbledore, \"So what should we do?\"</span></div></div>",

Unbeknownst to him the poor professor who been transformed into his living, breathing Sneakers was being tortured beneath his huge feet. The first steps were like ecstasy. The intense pain and pressure that the poor soul residing in his sneakers felt was transformed into pure pleasure for the tall, muscular God. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy strutted up to the front of the classroom, landing especially heavily to teach the poor man who was boss before totally forgetting that sneakers conscience even existed. After an hour of standing on his feet, deliberating Malfoy decides to walk to the great hall for a bite to eat and to play his day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>Snapes Pov.</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Malfoy leapt to his feet and the God like muscular blonde landed, Snape almost blacked out from the incredible pain and pressure exerted from above. The huge tonnage of the near perfect body squashing the built up sweat from his socks before it oozed into the insole and Snape's mouth. With every step there was respite as the shoe flew through the air like a giant rollercoaster before <b>Wham!</b> The pain and pressure was back. Snape's entire world was only one thing, Malfoy. It was difficult to concentrate on anything but, even though he could see the outside world all that was imprinted in his mind was the huge gold lettering D.M. just as an imprint of the huge sole and massive digits were being imprinted on the insole, on Snape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape's attention however was quickly diverted however when on the downwards stroke he saw a small bug fall into the great shadow. <b>Crunch</b>, the poor bug, completely oblivious to the giant wizard had unfortunately missed out on the full weight of the god, jamed between the treads, Snape watched helplessly as the creatures body was further mangled with every step. Still alive but horribly mutilated. Twenty minutes of pacing and Snapes agony was increasing ten fold when the bug finally came free and was splattered beneath the Jock. This was quickly followed by Malfoys decision to go to the dinning hall, something that Snape knew would only be more pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm not sure myself\" responded Harry, creases of worry appearing on his forehead.  The classroom door was left wide open. The real professor Snape reached for it and banged it shut. He bolted it, not wanting the bizarre accident to cause further chaos as Slytherin prefects had a meeting with him set for that afternoon. He turned to find Harry standing up straight, square shoulders with his hands joined behind his back. A posture only Snape could procure. Deep in his mind, Harry could barely think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Dumbledore!\" he thought \"He'll know what to do.\" But before he could say it out aloud another thought clouded the first. He felt a cold hate sneak up upon him with anger and disapproval. \" Look at him\" he thought, completely disgusted by the boy who stood before him \" Just like James Potter. Untidy, thick glasses.....and that hair!\" Harry felt his feet move closer to his own image, with his back still straight. His mouth opened before he could stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what are you looking for Mr Potter? I should think it is extra lessons telling from your last piece of work.\" Harry thrust his hand and covered his mouth as if able to take back his words. He felt the cold hatred slide over, leaving his mind as it was before. Professor Snape stared at him. Harry looked up only to see a reflection he knew too well. It was the reflection he had seen in his first year in the mirror of Erised where he had seen his parents, smiling at him. An anger had taken over him the moment the image had vanished, of how he was robbed of a perfect childhood with his mom and dad. The mirror had shown an angry eleven year old boy. Now the same reflection was presented before him. But he knew it was the hate he felt for Snape. The only difference is Harry was at the other end of his cold gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No sir. I don't need any lessons. I should like to leave the room as soon as you unbolt the door. I have Quidditch practice to attend to.\" Harry was alarmed in his mind impressed by what he heard. \" Professor ? Can you hear me\" Harry asked  the boy infront of him. Snape seemed to come back to his right mind. \"Yes\" he almost whispered. Looking at the floor with a look that displayed a perplexed mind. Harry knew that Snape had just felt what he had felt, a cold hatred. \" Quick!\" he spat, hand me my wand. It's behind my desk, in my draw, second from bottom.\" Harry scrambled toward the desk. He was moving so fast. Upon turning round the desk, he lost his footing and fell flat on his stomach .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Be careful you clumsy rat!\" Snape spat \" Watch where you're going. It's my bones you'll wreck.\" He paused heaving with his new nostrils flaring. \" Wouldn't be in this position if you and that Weasley did your work! Filthy Gryffindor pigs.\"  This time the shouting Harry received from Snape didn't aggravate him, instead, Harry nearly giggled hearing himself shout with that sort of accent. \" Sorry proffesor. Trying to get familiar with these rather old legs. Not easy you know.\" said Harry, trying to hear himself squeal once again. But Snape simply stared at him. Harry reached for the wand and swiftly walked over to Snape. He handed it to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnape took up the wand and pointed it at Harry. \" Riveletus!\" he shouted. Both of them paused as a silence followed. Nothing happened. Harry stood still, awaiting a sudden crash, bang or drum sending him back to his body. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, green shiny sparks shot out of the wand and hit Harry on the chest. They engulfed him in a huge green flame, covering him from head to toe. Harry felt a sharp pain on his left shoulder where the sign of the death eaters was en-printed on Snape's shoulder. The flame cleared and Harry found himself in a dark cave. Right before him, where a desk had been, roared a huge bonfire with fresh wood, sending bright red embers into the dark air. His hands were out stretched as he held hands with two cloaked men on either side of him. Harry turned to the man on his left to find a mask where a face should have been. Turning to the right, he saw another mask. Next to this man, stood another, their hands held. Harry shifted to the left and saw a few other men on the other side of the fire. They all stood in a circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked down at himself. He too wore a black cloak with black boots. Judging from the vast distance between his eyes and the floor beneath him, Harry could tell he was still Snape's height, but felt much thinner. His inspection was cut short as the men before the fire began an enchantment. They whispered into the fire in hisses. Harry found his own lips moving as he  hissed into the fire. The language was familiar . Parsel tongue. Apparently he had spoken it before to a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire roared even louder. The embers now turned to a blinding white. Slowly a wisp of white cloud erected from the flame. Harry felt his left shoulder prickle with  pain. He let go of  the man to the right and clutched his aching shoulder. So great was the pain he greeted his teeth and shut his eyes. Then the pain stopped. Harry felt his weight shift as it  increased slightly. His right hand stretched itself out as though it was being pulled. Far away in his mind he could hear a dog barking. The noise grew louder. <br>\r\nHarry opened his eyes to find Hagrid's dog before him, ready to pounce. In his outstretched arm he held a wand and felt his lips move  \"Stupefy!\" The dog fell on its back as the green sparks smashed into its face. It lay motionless, with its eyes starring into Harry with the uttermost loathing. Harry felt himself grin coldly. His eyes darted around the room. The familiar huge smelly couch in the middle of the room with rock bun crumbs all over let him know that he was in Hagrid's cabin. Harry moved swiftly toward Hagrid's closet. Opening the door wide , he nearly jumped back from the stench that greeted him. \"Filthy old beast\" he muttered under his breadth. Disgusted by Hagrid's clothing, he stuck his wand into the pile of huge trousers. Pulling out one, he let it drop to the floor. Harry reached into his robe and pulled out a shiny green stone. It glowed and sent tiny little sparks into the air. Quickly, Harry stuffed into Hagrid's pocket. Picking it up, he shoved it in the closet and banged the doors shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the wall, Harry saw a calender. The days crossed themselves out when done so he could see the date. It was the 24th of October. In two days it would be Saturday. Under the word Saturday, Harry read in bold letters<br>\r\n\" QUIDDITCH MATCH  : GRYFINDOR VS RAVENCLAW\" Harry then turned and walked toward the door. He couldn't help but laugh as he walked on, clearly excited about something. He pointed  his wand at the dog, \" Restorelas!\" It got up on its feet and before it could bite Harry, he had closed the door shut and walked away from the cabin. Suddenly the green flame engulfed him once more and he couldn't see past it. After a while, the flame cleared and Harry found himself in professor Snape's classroom. Standing where he had stood, and still in a foreign body. <br>\r\nHarry looked at Snape who was still in Harry's body. Snape clutched his forehead upon the lightning scar.He was down on his knees in evident pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry reached out to him and shook him \" Professor, professor!\" he called. Snape let go of the forehead and opened his eyes. Harry felt sorry for him as Snape looked like he had been through a terrible ordeal. \" Rovanius Priori\" he muttered. Harry simply stared at him unaware who was talking, Snape or him. \"Rovanius priori.\" he repeated \" It's the spell that just took place. It enables one to look into the mind of a stranger and see their thoughts and memories.\" Harry stared at him carefully taking in all he could. He helped Snape up and pulled up a chair for him. Only Harry understood what pain the scar inflicted when it glowed. \" I't's a forbidden spell. Must have been triggered by the potion. Quick, run and fetch professor Sprout. She must have a rare plant that can reverse it. Without thinking twice. Harry darted for the door.<br>\r\nAs he opened it Snape called to him \" Mr Potter whose the fat pig?\" Harry giggled. \"my cousin Dudley sir\". He then shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut side, he met up with Crabble, Goyle and Malfoy, who greeted him, grinning stupidly. Harry couldn't resist \"Stay clear of my classroom. Wipe that stupid look of your face. Fifty points off Slytherin. Detention at six be here.\"  Malfoy was livid. Harry couldn't help but smile at his art work. Turning from them , he broke out into a slow jog with his heavy feet. He turned by the notice boards toward the door leading to professor Sprout's classroom. Harry froze still. He saw a similar calendar, like the one he saw in Snape's memory. The last cross, was on Wednesday October the 23rd.      </span></div></div>",

'Thank you Severus.' she whispered<br>\r\n'Why are you thanking me?' he asked confused, 'I sold you out, I had a hand in killing you. why are you thanking me and not blasting me into oblivion?!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Because with out you my son would have never lived this long.' Lily said, 'and for that I thank you. But I also need you to know that I forgive you, and you need to forgive yourself and move on with your life. You've been given a second chance, Severus, don't waste your life again. this is your opportunity to live the life you want, to be happy.' Severus looked down at his hands and saw that they were the same boney hands that they had been when he was eleven. He looked up at Lily, 'Where can I go?' he asked, 'I don't have anyone.' <br>\r\nLily knelt down to his level and hugged him close, even though part of his mind knew that it was a dream, Severus couldn't help but think how real and warm Lily felt. He felt her love pour into him, a love he hadn't felt since he had been very young. 'Something will work out,' she whispered, ' it always does.' She kissed him on the forehead as everything began to grow dark. 'Goodbye Severus.' she said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'N-No! Wait! Lily!' Severus cried as darkness took over his vision and fear gripped his heart again, 'Lily! Wait! Take me with you! Lily!' he began to tremble, tears pouring down his face once more...<br>\r\n'Lily.'</i><br>\r\n\"Professor?\" Harry said as he gently shook his boney shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lily...\" he muttered incoherently, still half asleep, \"Lily come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor?\" Harry tried again shaking him a little harder, the fact that the younger Snape wasn't waking up was vaguely frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go and get someone now?\" Neville asked with a worried glance towards their professor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again how would we explain it to a teacher?\" Harry asked, \"If we could get to Professor Dumbledor, he would be able to help, but that would draw too much attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry and Neville debated what to do, Hermione came back clutching the book, but looking rather pale.<br>\r\n\"Hermione?\" Ron asked as she came over, \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked at the potion book,\" She said, her voice trembling, \"I wasn't able to find an antidote, though perhaps Professor Snape can coble one together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we may have a bigger problem on our hands,\" Draco put in having taken over trying to wake up their professor, \" he's not waking up.\"<br>\r\nHermione pressed her lips together as she looked at her professor, she had noticed lately that Professor Snape wasn't eating as much as was healthy, and that at times after class if the way out was slammed, she had seen him drink a small vile of a violet colored potion. <br>\r\n\"Draco,\" she said suddenly, \"go to Professor Snape's desk, look around in the drawers and you should find a small vile with a violet colored potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it?\" he asked as he looked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An apatite booster.\" she said quickly, \"If we mix it with a strengthening solution it should wake him up at least long enough for us to take him to the Hospital wing.\"<br>\r\nDraco eventually found the potion, and left Hermione to mix the potions properly. \"hopefully this will work.\"</span></div></div>",

Although the school had been known for having its share of eccentric happenings, it was still rare cases like this, that Dumbledore could take advantage of such strange events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeadmaster!\u201d the pint \u2013sized-Snape said in his usual jaded tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not amused; surely, you know it\u2019s me, Professor Snape.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProfessor Snape. No, you must be a bit confused, dear boy; you are a bit young to be a Professor at this institution- eleven, perhaps. Yes. Yes. My dear boy, you can\u2019t be any older than a first year. But, don\u2019t worry dear boy, I will contact Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic, immediately. It seems that someone has placed a memory charm on you, and you are in a bit of a confused state.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeadMaster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCalm yourself and have a seat,\u201d Dumbledore coaxed the disheveled, dark boy, who now appeared to be throwing a temper tantrum, pacing back and forth with clenched fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is ridiculous Headmaster! It is me Professor Snape! He said advancing upon Dumbledore, while raising his heavy brows as he attempted to give the Headmaster eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cIt was your pet, HARRY- THE CHOSEN ONE, whom, in all his infinite wisdom: ingeniously whipped up a split concoction; in which calculatingly lacked the element boomslang skin; which he claims to have clumsily wasted on me, just as I came to grade his murky potion for a\u2026fourth time!\u201d<br>\r\nFiguring that he should ease the fuming boy\u2019s tempers, Dumbledore decided to give up the charade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it is you. I see now, yes, yes. I see. This is a serious matter here that we have to change you back into your adult form.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Snape agreed wearily, with sweat beading down his ghostly pale skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re the potions professor what do you suggest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m inconveniently out of leechlang legs in my store room closet, a very rare element, which would cause me to regain my age, at the moment. I was wondering if you had any in your office? Or maybe you could get a hold of some by means of the Hog express?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no. No. No. My dear boy, \u2013Professor. I am\u2026out of the leechlang legs at the moment, for as you mentioned, it is rare.\u201d Dumbledore explained sympathetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, I will contact all of the emergency stores as soon as possible- maybe, I think. Your old friend Sirius Black may have some for you. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No! Wait Professor. Not the insolent, degenerate Black!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing heartily, Dumbledore reasoned with Snape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNonesense. Nonesense. He\u2019ll be more than delighted to help lend his old mate a hand!<br>\r\nAfter all, he has a knack for potions, you know?

In the first two years at Hogwarts he was always the fastest student in the class, picking up quickly not just the potion, but also the reasons for the ingredients. By the time he hit third year he was tutoring other students out of class. Fourth and Fifth year he assisted the teacher in the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had to restrain himself from.... well not exactly correcting the teacher... but from suggesting a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as a sixth year, all that could be taught in potions he had learned.

His chest had heaved, he stood suddenly in shock his hands exploring his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a woman's body, she was a sixth year Ravenclaw girl. Her hair was long and straight held back off her face with a simple band. When Snape ventured to a mirror she saw that she was quite beautiful, with high cheekbones and a rich full lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you up to the challenge, my dear?\" the voice echoed inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spun on the spot, as she tried to find the source of the voice.

And the chair was certainly more comfortable with a more generous, padded female ass. She looked over and saw Cho putting on make up in the mirror.

He could see the anger on the young potter boy's steaming glasses. Somewhere in the distance rang the curfew bell and the sun began to set outside the window.<br>\r\n     \"Your Severus, somehow your name seems to strike a bell. How did you come to arrive at Hogwarts? No one has ever seen you here before?\" Harry sat down beside a statue of a gargoyle and wiped his glasses with his sleeve. \"I can't believe Dumbledore really knows your true inclinations. Aren't you deeply versed in the dark arts?\"  The blood boiling in his face, Severus had to contain his anger as he replied,<br>\r\n      \"That shouldn't concern you. I'm as loyal to the ministry as you are to your girlfriend, Cho.\"<br>\r\n     The spell Professor Flitwick had placed on the entire student population had only fogged the memory of Severus Snape. He could vaguely remember his early life as a death-eater and then as loyal servant to Albus Dumbledore after that maniac Riddle had destroyed the one thing in all the world that had meaning for him.<br>\r\n     He could see Lilly Potters features on Harry's face,  and yet the obnoxious confidence and arrogant ways of the boy had forever infuriated him. His quick and clever logic, which seemed devoid of his mother's passion, were clearly derived from his father.<br>\r\n     \"Don't talk about her as if you know her; is this how rude you were at your old school?\" Harry traced his finger along the crack in his glasses, wondering if this obviously powerful wizard could be his class mate or even maybe, a friend. His hand, however had drawn his wand and aimed it at the skinny student.<br>\r\n     Severus, also drew his wand and waited...He knew the anger in young Potter was not directly his own, but had been a gift from the man who had tried to kill him. \"Harry, I'm new here, I really meant no offense. It sounded like she was a bit ...emotional and I sense it really had nothing to do with you and Ron beating her in the Gryffindor chess tournament yesterday.\"<br>\r\n     Harry tensed up and then laughed, it had most surely been that, he thought. They had celebrated late into the night. Perhaps a little too much, Cho had gone to bed early, declining a moonlight walk to Hagrid's with Harry. He lowered his wand a bit and a flash of silvery blue light danced off of Severus Snape's wand.<br>\r\n     Almost before he knew it had happened, the crack in the lens of his glasses disappeared. He lowered his wand, stepping back. \"T-thanks, Severus...what a name. That was nice of you. Hermione gets a bit tired of fixing them for me.\" Harry could see the new student had meant no disrespect and perhaps had only nervously run after Cho in his effort to avoid two angry people. Even he had run up those steps one late night, with his cloak on and it had still sensed him and his gender, sending him rolling down into the lower hall. He thought maybe he would like to get to know this Severus Snape a little better.<br>\r\n     \"Ron and I are going to the Lake tonight to catch and roast a few frogfish, would you like to join us? We'll get back in time for morning classes.\"<br>\r\n     As he had thought, fixing Harry's glasses in a surprise gesture, had eased the tension between them. <br>\r\n     \"Going out past curfew, that's 10 points ...\" Snape stopped himself; he was no longer his teacher, but a student like Harry. No one, not even the first time he had attended Hogwarts, had ever invited him to do..anything. Perhaps the brief period while Albus and Mcgonnacal work out his proper age, he could discover more about the two boys he had taught so much to in the past few years.<br>\r\n     \"We leave by broom and fly low to avoid being seen by anyone?\" Snape wondered how he was to sneak out this time? He knew he'd only caught Harry a few times, out of the many he'd gotten away with it.<br>\r\n     \"No. Ron and I discovered a secret passage recently and greased it up a bit ..er, repaired it, Let's go Ron's already out there, and we have 3 or 4 Fishing rods.\"<br>\r\n     As they stepped up to the small door behind an old dusty bookshelf in a corner storeroom, Snape couldn't see how they would be able to get in, much less, walk down through the narrow passage.<br>\r\n     Opening the door with a tiny doorknob, Harry grinned at the puzzled expression on his mysterious, new friend's face. \"Feet first...after you...\"<br>\r\n     Severus crawled into the hole and couldn't feel the floor below...\"What is this Harry-yyyy ahhhhh...\"<br>\r\nHe flew down what must have been an old tube used by the Basilisk long before. He flell down and around and up and over like a roller coaster. The narrow tunnel was indeed greased and as fast as he flew, he was unhurt by the cobblestones and bricks along the walls. In minutes he could see a dim light below and then twilight and the edge of the lake just before he splashed into the water's edge. Far above him as he bobbed and choked in the shallow water he could just see Harry fly out of the castle and sail down into the water beside him. Splashing and then swimming up to the shore, They saw that Ron had the fire burning and was starting to gather the gear. He was not alone;  Hagrid had appeared from the trees and seemed to be erecting a tent.<br>\r\n     \"Hagrid loves frogfish stew, and tells a great ghost story. Come on Severus, let's get out of this lake.\"<br>\r\n     Out of breath and vaguely remembering the giant, Hagrid, Severus Snape crawled from the lake and they drew close to the fire to dry their robes. Snape had felt exhilarated by the slide through the castle, and didn't quite recognize the feelings it had evoked. It was, perhaps the first time he had ever experienced the true meaning of the word, fun. He wanted, for some strange reason, to do it again.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Amara is a rough-tough Gryffindor who is enemies with Harry and Malfoy, but friends with Hermione and Blaise. And Melody is the DADA teacher who is close friends with Snape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeverus awoke with a start upon the squashy couch of the common room. He looked from left to right, BOOKS! Small and large stacks of books had surrounded him and engulfed the entire carpet to a point where he couldnt escape. his head shot away from the books and to his surroundings; Blood-red carpet and pictures of many restless Godric Gryffindors mingled calmly with the walls, The fire a-blazing proudly and dancing to greet Severus cold and questioning face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" You're finally awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the top of the stairs, one of his actual \"favorites\" emerged. Her brown hair astray, her ragged robes clung closely to her body, and a magenta muggle composition book was held tightly in one hand. there was no way to mistake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Amara?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a casual giggle and replied while descending, \"who else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she began acting, as Professor Melody would say, \"out of charachter.\" She reached the moat of books surrounding him, pushed them gingerly aside to create a tiny bridge for herself, and sat next to him as if he were the best person in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Are you feeling okay Amara?\" He suddenly stuttered. He never realized how calm she was in the morning, but that was common, for she was usually restless after battling it out with Draco and Potter in his class. Now, she acctually seemed very.. what was the word?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Yeah, Potter tried to plant dungbombs under and in some books, but i chased him off,\" She checked her watch and gave a dissapointed sigh, \" Its almost time for our first class, we need to leave now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeverus felt his heart drop. He wanted to stay here slightly longer; talk to Amara and listen to her interesting tales like the ones she spun to Granger as they worked on their potions. Severus didnt show it, but he had a slight interest in them. But on the other hand, he needed to get to class if he were going to find a reversal to this potion. Maybe one of his \"collegues\" can assist; Melody the most reliable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?  </span></div></div>",
