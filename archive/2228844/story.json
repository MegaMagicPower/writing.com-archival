Don't you have work today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find them in their room, standing up from their desk, which was cluttered with papers, notebooks, and other writing and school-related supplies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no?\" You say, \"It's Saturday, why would I work today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob smacks his forehead, \"It's Friday!

Well, except your job maybe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat all changes, however, when you spot something that should not exist anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</td>",
