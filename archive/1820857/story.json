The two had just met this morning, Daniel thought -- heck, he had just flown into Redwood Bay this morning -- and already the overweight grump twice his age was giving him a hard time. It was just as well, he figured. He had heard that the Bureau had a habit of pairing Agents just out of training with the gruffest, most jaded people they could find. Daniel wasn't sure if they did that in order to toughen the new Agents up or to try to drum out those that didn't belong, but whatever the case, he knew that it could be a lot worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel took a deep breath and walked to the door. \"Ready when you are,\" he said, mustering up as much confidence as he could manage. The best advice he had been given on how to deal with the situation was to just put up with the abuse as best he could and wait until he got reassigned, always making sure to behave professionally but never letting himself be provoked. \"I've almost got everything settled on my side of the office,\" he continued, \"so the boxes should all be gone by the end of the day tomorrow, Katzmann.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't come soon enough, I say,\" Katzmann muttered. \"The office was small enough when it was just me in there.\" The two continued walking through the hallway towards the stairs at the end, heading down to the first floor, where Agent Phillips, the Special Agent in Charge of the Redwood Bay field office, was waiting for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walter! Daniel!\" The corner of Phillips' lips rose in approval as he saw the two round the corner. \"Good to see the two of you together at last.\" He placed his hand around Daniel's shoulder. This, combined with the fact that he was the only Agent that Daniel had ever heard call him by his first name, gave off an almost-fatherly vibe, one that Daniel felt was very out of place, especially for the FBI. \"The boys in Washington have been saying some very positive things about you, Daniel,\" he continued as they walked, \"and I had to call in several favors to get you assigned to my office. But I know that you'll be worth the extra effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Daniel said, feeling the faintest bit of sweat start to form on his forehead, \"it sounds like I have a lot to live up to. I only hope that I can meet your expectations.\" As he talked, he felt his body begin to vibrate slightly. At first, he thought it was his heart beating much faster than normal, so he tried to put the sensation at the back of his mind. Something about it, though, felt rather strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will, my son.\" Phillips was beaming with pride. \"And I'm sure you'll find that working in Redwood Bay will be like no place else in the world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Kelly scoffed slightly. \"Heh,\" he said, as his version of a smile formed on his face. \"That ain't the half of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel wasn't sure what exactly the two men were referring to. He had barely heard of Redwood Bay before being informed of his assignment last month, and he hadn't gotten to see much of the town so far, but, by his estimation, it sure seemed like your typical moderately-large sized city: a bustling downtown built off of the shores of the bay that the town got its name from, complete with several large skyscrapers, both a basketball arena and a football stadium, and a nice-looking waterfront park. Pleasant enough, sure, but nothing really spectacular. He knew, though, that he would have to at least feign appreciation if he was going to have any chance of being promoted and transferred to a more exciting location, like New York. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied to Phillips as he nodded enthusiastically. \"I think it's already starting to grow on me.\" As he said this, he again felt the vibrations he had sensed before, only this time, they seemed to be louder. Daniel now was certain that it wasn't his heart. Something was happening outside, something that -- whatever it was -- was getting closer. He looked at the two men next to him, neither of which seemed to be reacting with any sense of shock or surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting choice of words, Daniel,\" Phillips patted him on the back as they arrived to the front entrance of the office. He reached out and opened the door outside, letting the sunlight pour in. \"So does that mean you have met our 'claim to fame', so to speak?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shook his head as the three stepped outside. \"Uh, I don't think so, sir. What are you referring to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillips only smiled, as he lifted a finger into the air. As Daniel winced, trying to adjust to the brightness of the day, he looked in the direction that Phillips was pointing. When he was able to make out the scene after a second or two, he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him. Rubbing them, he blinked several times and then tried to focus again on the massive object in the distance. Sure enough, he had seen it correctly the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is that?!\" Daniel couldn't hide the surprise in his voice, and nearly fell to the ground, both from shock as well as the now-intense shaking of the ground. He didn't believe he was seeing, for walking down the middle of the street, almost as tall as the buildings themselves, was a \u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel didn't know what he was seeing. No, scratch that. He knew <i>exactly</i> what he was seeing, he just couldn't dream in a dozen lifetimes that it could be possible. Strolling through the city, as nonchalantly as could be, was a young teenaged boy who looked to be somewhere around thirteen or fourteen years old. If Daniel had to guess, he would say the boy had to be between one-hundred and one-hundred and fifty feet tall. His skin was olive, bronzed by the sun, and he had dark hair that covered his ears and fell into his eyes. He had on a relatively small amount of clothes: just a pair of crimson red shorts and a navy blue vest, left open and revealing his smooth, lean torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was smiling as he walked, and seemed to be looking around with interest on either side of the street. A few times he even lifted his hand and waved to someone he saw, though Daniel couldn't see who it was that he was waving to. He appeared to be taking great pains to tread lightly as he walked and to avoid stepping on any cars or people, but his bare feet still shook the ground with every step he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, Daniel,\" Phillips continued as he lowered his finger, \"is Tidas. He's called Redwood Bay home for the past six months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six months?!\" Daniel exclaimed. \"How come I haven't heard anything about him before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhillips' eyes lit up in surprise as he scoffed. \"You haven't? I'm pretty sure there's been plenty of national news coverage of him since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel kept his mouth shut at this. One of the things his instructors at the Academy always criticized him for was not paying attention to the news, saying that it was important to stay on top of world events to be an effective and successful agent. He had always figured that if any report pertinent to a case he was working on came up, he would find out about it, either by doing research then or by the Bureau sending it to him in his case file, but no one had prepared him for the shock of seeing a bona-fide giant in the middle of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions were swimming through his head, he couldn't grab a hold of any of them. He tried to focus, clearing his thoughts and asking what he needed to know now. \"W-where did he come from?\" he stammered out, aware that his nervousness and lack of preparedness was obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one knows, kid,\" Kelly replied. \"He just walked into town one day, wearing that exact outfit you see him wearing now. He seemed to be in a bit of a daze and didn't know what he was doing or where he was, or even his name. And of course he had no explanation for being so gigantic. At first, the mayor called in the National Guard, but it soon became apparent that the kid was no threat to anyone, and things kinda settled down after that. The newspaper took a poll of what his name should be, and Tidas was chosen as the winner. Good thing that he liked how it sounded, I guess,\" he added with a gruff laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after that explanation, Daniel still was incredibly confused and bewildered. There were so many things that he needed to get answered: where did Tidas sleep at night, how could the people of the city feed and support someone that huge, and a host of others. But he didn't have time to get them answered, because right then, Phillips turned to him and said,</span></div></div>",

We're not asking you to do anything particularly dangerous. Tidas is even okay with someone watching him like this. He might even help you out a little. We just need you to make sure that A, he doesn't suddenly go crazy and start stomping on people or buildings, and B, that no one with, shall we say, less-than-sincere motives comes and tries to get Tidas to do something that wouldn't be in his best interest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or the town's,\" Kelly added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, exactly.\" Phillips nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, sir,\" Daniel started, \"I don't know if I can do this. Nothing in the training prepared me for anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly chuckled slightly. \"Now what the hell kind of training do you think could prepare you for something like this, son?\" He shook his head. \"Just get in there and do what you've got to do. Hopefully, he won't mind ya so much. Who knows, maybe the two of you could even be friends,\" he added this last part in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel didn't have much choice. It was either do this, or lose his job, the job he'd worked years to try to get and keep. The FBI wasn't exactly flexible on positions and assignments, and maybe, he began to reason, this was to be some sort of test for him, a trial by fire, so to speak. Taking a deep breath, he nodded towards Phillips and Kelly, and stepped forward, ready to get to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Tidas was about three blocks away, and seemed to be standing still and facing a building, talking to someone. The large teen's voice boomed throughout the streets, but the other side of the conversation was impossible to hear. Assuming he stayed still for about five minutes, Daniel thought, he could jog to where the boy was standing. What to do when he got there, though, he hadn't a clue.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel continued to observe Tidas as the giant chatted with a few store owners about the weather. Then, one of them had asked the giant boy if he had enough food for the day, and if the water truck had delivered drinking water to the warehouse. Warehouse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was already late afternoon and the sun was setting. It began to get a bit chilly outside and Tidas had already waved goodbye to the store owners after his short conversation. Daniel had become curious about where the giant boy was staying at, and he decided to get into his car and follow the giant boy wherever the boy was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tidas started walking away, Daniel began to follow him from a distance, which was rather easy since Tidas pretty much remained walking along a paved asphalt road. But Daniel had to really step on the gas pedal, due to Tidas long strides! The boy\u2019s long legs made it that the giant teen was covering a great distance rather quickly, heading towards the industrial side of town, located around the southern tip of the city around the airport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Tidas had found a large, abandoned aircraft hangar, which had high ceilings and steel doors. The hangar was big enough for a boy of his size, and the owner of the building had allowed the giant teen to stay there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel saw the giant boy push open one of the hangar doors, leaving it open just a little bit, as the giant had to crawl on his hands and knees in order to fit through the large door. Once Daniel had parked the car, he quietly jumped out and ran over to the hangar door, and slipped through the opening as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were only a few lights on inside of the large hangar. Part of the vast, concrete floor inside of the hangar was covered with blankets which were neatly placed next to each other in order to form some sort of soft cushion for someone to sleep on. As Daniel looked up, he had found what he was looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel was staring face-to-face with two giant feet, towering over him! The heels were resting on the blanket while the toes were sticking out straight up in the air. As Daniel walked along the side of the giant feet, he spotted the biggest, longest legs he had ever seen in his life! He continued walking past the giant knees and then the large arms and the huge torso, until he passed the shoulders and then, finally, he reached the head of the giant boy! What a sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant head was resting on a pile of blankets that were neatly stacked on top of each other, so it formed something that was similar to a giant pillow for the large boy. Since Daniel was standing just to the boy\u2019s left side, he noted that the boy\u2019s head was also slightly turned and facing to the left, with his mouth slightly open but his eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel could hear a constant breathing coming from the giant boy as he inhaled and exhaled air from his lungs through his mouth. His mouth was open slightly, exposing some of his teeth as well. This made Daniel chuckle since he found that the giant boy actually had an incredibly cute face, with long, black hair that covered his ears and even covered his eyes a little. The giant teen also had thick eyelashes and a cute mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just shuddered for a moment. A boy of this size had giant muscles! He couldn\u2019t even begin to imagine how strong the giant teen must have been, having the world\u2019s largest muscles! And here he was, standing next to the sleeping giant, and trying to muster the courage to wake him up so that he could introduce himself! Daniel was absolutely terrified!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Daniel was about to speak, there was a rumble coming from the sky, which seemed to come nearer and nearer! It was the roar of a jet engine, flying overhead! Of course! They were located within a mile from the airport! The roar of the jet engines shook the steel walls of the hangar briefly, causing Tidas to yawn and move his head. Did that wake him up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmmm\u2026. Excuse me!\u201d Daniel said to the giant boy, while standing a few feet away from the boy\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh\u2026.\u201d Tidas moaned softly in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello! Over here!\u201d Daniel said, a little louder this time, as he waved his hands through the air. \u201cMy name is Daniel and I just want to meet you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhmmmm?\u201d Tidas groaned as he groggily opened his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just smiled back. Then, he raised up his right hand and waved. He couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with the giant boy, because he just had the most beautiful big, blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas blinked a few times as he stared at Daniel for a few seconds. Then, he completely turned his giant body so that he was lying on his side, facing Daniel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho\u2026 Who are you?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Daniel! I came out here\u2026 To meet you! Is that alright?\u201d Daniel asked him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I woke you up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas closed his eyes and opened his mouth as wide as possible, letting out a deep yawn! In fact, Daniel could feel the hot air that had escaped from the boy\u2019s mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhh\u2026 Umm\u2026 Sure! I mean\u2026 I never get any visitors!\u201d Tidas replied. \u201cIt\u2019s so lonely living in this place\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel could already sense that Tidas had a deep longing for friendships. He could understand the giant teen\u2019s situation very well. Who would want to hang out with a hundred-foot-plus-tall kid? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I just wanted to get to know you\u2026 And see that you\u2019re doing alright\u2026 And that you\u2019re safe and happy!\u201d Daniel said, wanted to be as truthful as possible before the giant teenage boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! But\u2026 You\u2019re not a kid! You look like a grownup! Do you still wanna be my friend?\u201d Tidas wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why\u2026 Of course! That\u2019s why I came all the way out here to meet you in the first place!\u201d Daniel explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas then turned around so that he lay flat on his back. He added four more blankets on top of the ones that were already there, so that he was able to raise of the area where he lay his head so he could sit up a bit more on his \u201cBed\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tidas reached over with his long arm, Daniel noticed that the boy was not wearing his vest. He was completely bare-chested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, now that you\u2019re my friend, why don\u2019t you come up here so I can see you better so we can talk?\u201d Tidas ordered, as he reached over with his long arm and wrapped his long, giant fingers around Daniel\u2019s torso. Then, the giant boy gently lifted Daniel up and placed him on his huge chest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSit there so I can see you better!\u201d Tidas commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel sat down on Tidas\u2019 abdomen muscles! It was just an amazing sight for Daniel, to be able to sit on the torso of the giant, teenage boy! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Why do you want to be my friend?\u201d Tidas asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Look\u2026 I want to make sure\u2026 My work wants me to make sure that you\u2019re safe at all times! Do you understand? I\u2019m not here to hurt you!\u201d Daniel responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour work? Wow, you seem like a young guy to be working already! So, where do you work?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel always hated it when people asked him that, and he was really afraid that, especially in this situation, he might get rejected if people knew what his real profession was. On the other hand, he wanted to start off his friendship with Tidas on the right foot and be as open and as honest with him as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I work for the F.B. I\u2026.\u201d Daniel responded, not knowing for sure if the boy understood what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhmm\u2026 Does that have something to do with the police?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it does\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas stared at him for a moment, with an expression of shock and concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I in trouble? Did I do something wrong? Did I break something?\u201d he said, with a great feeling of concern coming over him by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Oh, No-no-no-no!\u201d Daniel assured him as quickly as possible. \u201cYou\u2019re fine, my friend! You didn\u2019t do anything wrong! I just need to make sure you\u2019re safe, you have everything you need, and you\u2019re all cared for! And\u2026 That the city gives you everything you will ever need!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Well, that\u2019s good for me, then!\u201d Tidas replied with a smile. \u201cSo\u2026 You want to help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES! I\u2019m here to help you any way I can!\u201d Daniel said, now standing up and getting excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww! That is awesome! Thank you so much! I just wish\u2026\u201d Tidas said, with a touch of sadness\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish you could sleep here and spend the night with me here in the hangar! It\u2019s so lonely!\u201d the giant sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Let me go to my house and get my clothes and a sleeping bag, and I\u2019ll be back here in an hour, okay?\u201d Daniel said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay! I\u2019ll wait for you! You promised!\u201d Tidas reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel jumped off Tidas\u2019 torso and ran towards the hangar door. He couldn\u2019t believe it! He was going to have a sleepover in an aircraft hangar and he was going to spend the night sleeping next to the world\u2019s largest teenage boy! He had to pinch himself just to make sure he wasn\u2019t dreaming as he got into his car\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You're still excited when you gets back to your house. Since you only moved here a few days before, many of your things were still in boxes scattered around in several different rooms, so it takes you a few minutes to find your sleeping bag. You eventually find it in a box that is filled with, of all things, glassware. After packing some toiletries and a change of clothes, you're out the door and back on your way to Tidas' hangar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the drive back, you can't help but marvel at how quick your everything has changed. A few hours ago, you didn't even know that Tidas existed, and now you're planning on spending the night with the giant teen. Thinking about it all for a moment, a thousand questions you'd like to ask the giant pop into your mind. You make a note to ask him whenever you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the trip to and from your house takes a little over half an hour, much shorter than you thought it would. Since you told Tidas to wait an hour, you're actually surprised to find the giant sitting next to the hangar, waiting for you to arrive. When Tidas catches a glimpse of Daniel's headlights, he springs up to his full height in excitement. \"Happy he's as pumped for this sleepover as I am,\" you mutter to yourself, followed by a brief chuckle. As you puts your car into park, you look over and start to fully realize just how big Tidas is. one of his feet could easily crush your mid-sized SUV. You're happy he's so amiable as you start to appreciate just how awful it would be if he fell into the wrong hands or under the wrong person's influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks over and kneels as you unload the few things you'd packed. You worry that you might have to take a second trip, but eventually rearrange things in your arms enough that everything fits. Tidas notices how weighed down you look and says \"I can help with that, if you'd like.\" Not wanting to be rude and realizing that to the 100 foot teenager what you're carrying is probably light as a feather, you agree. He lowers his hand, and you think he's going to hold it out for you to unload your stuff or something. Instead, you wraps it around you and carries you inside. At first you're shocked, unsure of how to react to what feels like an invasion of personal space. Once again you are reminded of just how big Tidas is. By the time he drops you off inside, you actually sort of miss the warmth of his hand as it surrounded your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that,\" you say, trying to be a good guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you for staying with me!\" Tidas replies with much enthusiasm. He's sitting up in the hangar, his head about 10 feet from the roof, and you are on a catwalk about level with his chest that runs on either side of the hangar. \"It...gets really lonely in here sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how does the town treat you?\" you ask, putting your stuff down and segueing into what you hope is a happier topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been really nice to me so far. They provide all the food and water that I need, as long as I help out with a few things around town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuff that someone as big as me can do pretty easily. Mostly construction work, honestly. It's actually really easy, so I'm really grateful for how nice they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't hold yourself back from asking the next question, as much as you might want to. \"And you don't remember anything before six months ago? Or how you ended up 100 feet tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Well, occasionally I remember snippets. Very vague memories of things that I think I did when I was much younger and slightly more regular sized. Nothing major, though, just little things like playing a jungle gym or looking out the window of a car. Nothing that's been of help in finding out who I am or how I got this big, basically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you like it? Being big, I mean,\" you add as you realize the word 'it' might need some clarification.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis question makes him stare off into the distance, clearly thinking over his answer. Eventually, after a few moments consideration, he says \"yes and no. When I first came across Redwood Bay, I couldn't believe how small everything was. It definitely took some adjustment, and a lot of times the good comes with the bad, if you know what I mean. For example, I'm really powerful, and it's exhilarating sometimes to know that I am the strongest and fastest human being that has ever lived, even if they are both just because of how large I am. At the same time, though, that power comes with a need to be constantly conscious of what I'm doing so I don't do anything that might hurt anything. The first few weeks, before I got a hang of how to do that, there were a few...accidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" You don't want to push him into thinking of things that he's clearly uncomfortable with, but your curiosity is too strong at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifts a little and gives a brief sigh. \"Mostly just property damage. A few cars and buildings suffered some damage from my footsteps before I learned to soften them a bit. And...there was an incident with a person. I wasn't paying as close attention to where I was going as I should have, and so I ended up almost stepping on an older woman who had stumbled from the shaking of my footsteps. Luckily enough, I heard her scream before I lowered my foot, but...things could have gone much worse. It's why most people around here keep their distance--they know that I wouldn't intentionally hurt anyone, but they're still worried, even if only subconsciously, what I might do if I slip up, even if only for a second.\" You can't help but notice that his eyes are starting to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's an uneasy silence before you ask your next question. You don't want to push him much further, but once again you can't stop yourself from asking \"Has anything else happened since?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wipes the tears from his eyes before he answers. \"No. Honestly that even shook me up enough that I'm always on alert when I'm in town. The people who live here have also learned to keep their distance, which has probably stopped anything further from happening, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has also made you feel lonelier,\" you finish for him. You're starting to really feel for this kid. \"I can't pretend to know what you're going through, but I can definitely promise that I will always be here for you if you need me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas raises his eyebrows in astonishment. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" you say. You were not prepared for what happened next. He grabbed you with his right hand and pulled you close to his chest. So close, in fact, that you could feel the beating of his massive heart. You figure it's the closest that he can come to hugging someone your size, and even though you'd rather he asked before just picking you up out of the blue, you're touched by his enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Tidas says as he lies down and puts you on top of his abs, \"for everything, really. I'm happy we met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" you reply. \"Just, next time you pick me up, would you mind asking me first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" Tidas said, a little mortified. \"Sometimes I just get a little overeager...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are definitely worse things to be,\" you say with a laugh.</span></div></div>",

I think maybe we should go to bed. Does that sound okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, letting loose a yawn of your own. \"Yeah, it's been a long day for me. Not that I'm complaining,\" you add, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas returns your smile and pats you on the head, chuckling. \"Heheh. Well, then\u2026 um, is it okay if I lift you back to your sleeping bag and stuff?\" When you nod, he wraps his fingers around you again and lifts you back off of his chest, sitting you back on the ground. \"Good night, Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Tidas,\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you fall asleep quickly, exhausted as you are, you are periodically woken up during the night by Tidas's tossing and turning. By the time sunbeams begin to stream into the hanger windows in the morning, prying your eyes open, Tidas has completely kicked off his covers and is lying on his blanket-covered cushions, wearing only his boxers. You can't help but notice the tent that has formed there, and you realize that even giant teens must experience morning wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily coming to your senses, you pull out your cell phone from your pocket and notice a text message from Agent Phillips, your boss, with only two words: \"CALL ME\". Not wanting to wake up Tidas, you quietly slip outside the hanger doors and dial him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phillips here,\" comes the response from the other line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Agent Hartfield. I got your message to--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Daniel!\" The interruption caught you off guard, but Phillips quickly continues. \"I was concerned when you didn't check in this morning\u2026 or yesterday, for that matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Looking at your watch, you realize that it's already 9:20, much later than you thought. \"I-I'm sorry, sir. I actually, uh\u2026\" You stop as you realize that you're not sure how much of last night's events you should share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm with Tidas right now,\" you finally say. \"I've introduced myself and am, um, getting to know the young man.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow, waiting for a response that seems to take too long in coming, but finally hear, \"Excellent! Well, Daniel, I'm glad to hear your assignment is going so swimmingly. But please make sure to check in with someone in the office, preferably me, at least once a day. And contact me immediately if anything unusual or important happens. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Phillips hangs up, and you quickly scamper back into the hanger, realizing that the conversation could have gone a lot worse.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you walk back into the hanger, you're a little surprised to see that Tidas has woken up, has already put on his vest, and is in the process of fastening his shorts. You're not quite sure, but it looks like he might be in some sort of hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tidas?\u2026\" you say hesitatingly as you step closer to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head jumps up, and he turns towards you, a strained smile on his face. \"Oh, Daniel. Hey\u2026\" Something had definitely changed overnight, you were sure; Tidas had seemed to have lost his eagerness and excitement to meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goin' somewhere?\" you ask, hoping not to sound too interrogating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, not really\u2026\" Tidas fidgets, shifting his weight from foot to foot, while scratching his arm with his hand. \"I mean\u2026 yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't quite know how to react to Tidas' sudden bout of nervousness, and you decide just to keep on being straightforward. \"Where are ya headed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas sighs, shaking his head. \"I'm sorry, Daniel, I\u2026 I forgot last night that today was Wednesday. I-I have to go somewhere, but I can't tell you, and I can't take you with me.\" Looking at his feet, you can tell that he's struggling with something inside, something he wants to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tidas,\" you start, \"I told you last night that I have to keep tabs on you for my job. I need to go with you, or at least know what you're doing.\" Even if he doesn't tell you, you think to yourself, you would still follow him as best you could, but this will be a hell of a lot easier with Tidas's permission and cooperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks back up, staring at you for a few seconds, biting his lip. \"Well\u2026.\" he closes his eyes, shaking his head. \"Okay. But\u2026 you have to promise me something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, Tidas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go with me\u2026\" He slowly says, opening his eyes back up. \"But you can't tell <i>anyone</i> where we go or what you see there. Even for your work. Can you promise that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurrowing your brow, you consider Tidas's request. Of course, if there's something that Tidas is hiding this closely, then it probably <i>is</i> something that Phillips will want you to report. Yet, something about Tidas's warmness last night, and his willingness to trust you this morning, makes you feel some sort of strong connection with him. He seemed like such a sweet kid; you couldn't imagine him being involved with anything dangerous. Maybe it won't be so bad, maybe Tidas is just being overly cautious. \"Okay,\" you finally say, nodding. \"I promise, Tidas.\" You hope it's a promise that you can keep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" Tidas's face suddenly turns from concerned to enthused, and he sticks out his hand to you. \"Ready to go, then? I kinda have to, uh\u2026 I need to be there quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you're unsure of why Tidas is extending his hand to you, but you soon realize that he wants to pick you up. Slowly and unsure of yourself, you step onto his hand, which gently wraps around you, lifting you up in the air and setting you on his shoulder. \"Do you mind riding up here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, not at all,\" you stammer, trying your hardest not to look down the more than hundred feet below. From up here, you can see just how big Tidas really is; his slender form stretches on down forever, it seems like. You pray that you don't suddenly develop a fear of heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on tight,\" Tidas advises, and he starts walking, bending down when he reaches the hanger door, and then standing back up to his full height. Going down and back up so quickly nearly makes your stomach sick, and you cling to the fabric of Tidas' vest as tight as your hands will allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas turns south and heads away from the city, in the direction of the mountainous area about twenty miles away from Redwood Bay. Taking a path parallel to the interstate, he passes through the suburbs and eventually to a more sparse area. When he reaches the overpass for a moderately wide river, he turns away from the road, following the river inland. A thin layer of coniferous trees start dotting the area, turning into thicker and thicker forest the further he gets from the highway. Although you're not entirely familiar with the geography of the area, having only recently moved to Redwood Bay, you guess that Tidas has entered the large and seldom-visited Hawkeye State Forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after about five minutes from when Tidas stepped into the forest (which covered, you guessed, about six or seven miles, though you had a real hard time guessing his foot speed), he comes to a lake, and stops. It's a small lake, maybe a thousand feet across, but the waters look serene with a dark blue color; you guess the waters might be deeper than they first appear. Sitting down, Tidas stretches his legs out and crosses his feet at his ankles, leaning back against his palms. \"We're here,\" he says. \"Guess I'm a little earlier than I thought.\" Turning to you, he smiles softly. \"Is it okay if I set you back down on the ground?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and he gently wraps his fingers around you, lowering you to the ground by his knees. From this angle, you realize that you can see down Tidas's shorts to his boxers, his powerful thigh muscles looking slightly tense. This sight stirs up something inside you, something a little unsettling but that you can't deny. After everything that happened last night and this morning, you finally realize that you find this giant boy\u2026 attractive. You try to shake this feeling off, but it's one that has latched onto you pretty tightly, and won't go away easily. Hopefully, you can concentrate on something else, like the beautiful scenery around you, or the slight chill in the air, or\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tidas,\" you ask, looking up to the boy. \"Can you tell me now why we're out here so far away from town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Tidas leans back a little further. \"Okay, Daniel. The reason we came out here so far, and the reason that I can't have you tell anyone about this, anyone at all\u2026 is that I'm meeting my\u2026 my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"boyfriend\" nearly knocks you on your ass, and you're momentarily speechless. \"B-boyfriend?!\" you finally manage to spurt out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Tidas confirms. \"Boyfriend. We've seen each other for about three months now, although I only get the chance to do it on Wednesdays. We have to meet here, out away from everyone for\u2026 obvious reasons, I guess.\" Tidas pauses, and you see a soft smile begin to form on his face. \"He's the only one who really gets me, you know? The only one I can confide in\u2026 I guess until you showed up, Daniel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many thoughts fly through your head, you're not sure where to start. What kind of person could possibly be the boyfriend of a hundred-foot-plus tall teenager? Is this someone from Redwood Bay or from somewhere else? What did Tidas mean by \"obvious reasons\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can start asking questions, though, Tidas' eyes light up, and he quickly rises to his feet. \"I think I hear him coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe points excitedly at a particularly thick part of the forest, where you're shocked to see...</span></div></div>",

Slightly taller than Tidas' 100 feet and rather close to his build, you can tell this giant is slightly older than him -around fifteen or sixteen years old. He has ebony skin, grey eyes, shaved heaed and his face leans more towards \"handsome\" than \"cute\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, unlike Tidas, this new giant is completely nude, and your view eventually drifts down to his cock. It hangs proudly from his crotch, partially resting on his testes, the tip going down to mid-thigh and swinging side to side with his steps.

Tidas advances towards him -to put some distance between their meeting point and you, you realize- and both giants collide with each other with a thunderous sound. They embrace each other, their arms wrapping around each others' bodies, and their lips locked in a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time, Tidas manages to pry himself away from his lover long enough to get words in.

Equal parts awe and fear had his stomach dropping and his mind failing. Even as he tried to forcibly assert to himself that this was just like any standard interview he'd done before and that he had to act professionally, his train of thought just couldn't reconcile the- <i> GIANT KID</i>- in the room. <i>Get a hold of yourself, Daniel. This is just a talk with a kid. A kid over 100 feet tall, bigger than the size of a ten-story building.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs moved with no input in them whatsoever. He couldn't jog, like he planned, but at least he wasn't standing still. Steadily, his legs propelled him one step at a time towards the base of the giant in front of him. It was three blocks, but thankfully, the kid seemed to be going nowhere soon. Daniel looked up, craning his neck, to see Tidas deep in conversation with whoever was up there. From the context of the conversation that Tidas was having- something about moving shipping crates onto barges- it must have been a captain or a harbormaster. <i>I'm still two blocks away. I'm still two blocks away from this behemoth of a colossus of a kid, and I'm looking up at him, because he's taller than the city's skyline. And he's talking about moving shipping containers with his bare hands. Jesus.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through the second block, Daniel took a deep, shuddering breath with his eyes closed.<i> In, out. Focus. Just think of this from his point of view- he has no idea where he came from or why he is, and he just wants to help. Kid doesn't even have hair on him yet. </i> It was true- except for his head, the kid had a modest amount of muscle on him, but was as bare as a whale. <i>Like his legs. They go up just past the sixth floor, must be around 60 feet tall. The size of a whale. And that's just his legs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this thought, Daniel stumbled. It wasn't his nerves this time, though it certainly didn't do anything to alleviate them- between craning his neck back to look at Daniel and closing his eyes to regain his composure, he'd been neglecting his footing and hit a snag in the sidewalk. Daniel floundered a bit to regain his balance, but did so quickly, and stopped for a moment, bent over, breathing. Half a block away. Cross one more street and he'd be at Tidas. <i>At his feet. At the base, the foot of Mt. Tidas. What the hell were they thinking, assigning one guy to watch this kid? It's nuts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned his head back to look at where he'd gotten his assignment from Phillips, and lo and behold- Phillips and Kelly were still there, watching with amused grins on their faces. Of course they were. Watching a new arrival meet the 100+ foot giant he was in charge of taking care of? Premium comedy. Wouldn't miss it for the world. Daniel turned around, the anger removing a fair portion of his inhibitions, straightened up, and walked briskly up to Tidas himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTidas was barefoot, and his feet showed all the signs of having adapted as such. Cracked, white-laced callouses covered the bottoms of his feet over all of the prints of his sole. Daniel was shaking again, but his thoughts (Jesus Christ, this foot's gotta be twenty feet long. And the ankle's ten feet in the air. And the toes are waist-high. The toes, big as boulders. <i>Jesus</i> Christ.) were at least under control. At this point, ten feet away from him, Daniel actually had to lean back to see Daniel's face, as he gestured with his arms to his conversation partner. The kid really was a walking tower. But all that was left to do was to tap on him, hard, to get his attention and make introductions. Daniel cleared his throat, ready to yell an 'excuse me'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, in an instant, Tidas did one of the most natural things in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shifted his stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was neither a conscious nor a large motion- for Tidas- but just like that, his leg drifted forward and his foot jumped five feet to re-position itself. It didn't even touch Daniel. Daniel didn't care. In that instant, all the anxieties Daniel had been fighting for the last five minutes overwhelmed him, because with the most innocuous of possible gestures, Tidas had shifted hundreds of tons of mass in an instant. It was a power that could do anything or kill anyone around him at a moment's notice, intentionally or unintentionally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was in the control of a 13-year-old kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, nope, nope, nopenopenopenopenope. Nah uh. Abort. Mission over. I'm out.</i><br>\r\nDaniel pelted around the block, briefly noticing Kelly and Phillips doubling over in laughter like assholes, and he could not have cared less. He didn't stop until he had fifty yards between him and Tidas, and there he just sat on the ground and let his jitters consume him.</span></div></div>",

It was somewhere between 600 and 700 feet tall, if an inch, and loomed over or matched height with all but the tallest skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing that came to mind was that the massive figure was female. The second was that she was <i>very</i> female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titaness was a young woman, in her early twenties, if Daniel was any judge. Her skin was bronzed from the sun, her hair brown, long and luxurious, her face pretty and her curves to die for. Toned thighs met with a set of large, pleasantly shaped hips and rear, which narrowed into a tight, flat stomach. From her chest hung a pair of massive breasts, each the size of her head and their bottoms just below her ribcage. The only clothes she wore was a bikini, made from huge sheets of tarpaulin that had been plastered with colourful advertisements. Not recognizing many of the brands and names, Daniel's inner FBI agent concluded that they must be local establishments. Daniel's inner FBI agent noted that this was a rather clever way of making those clothes pay for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess was walking through the city, very careful to keep to the wider roads, which Daniel's inner FBI agent noted were completely clear of vehicles, but packed full of pedestrians on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the rest of Daniel was making a decent impersonation of a goldfish. He opened and closed his mouth for a full minute, and finally managed to kick himself into gear and blurted out, \"What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, Daniel,\" Philips said, as smug as you please, \"Is Jenny. She's been a good and productive member of the Redwood Bay community for the past six months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six months!?\" Daniel exclaimed, scrambling back to his feet, \"Why didn't I know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's been on this wonderful thing called <i>the news</i>,\" Philips interrupted, punching the other man on the shoulder, \"I know you think the channels are full of bullshit; because they <i>are </i>full of bullshit. But that's no reason to refuse to get some basic fucking knowledge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilips crossed his arms, staring at the giantess. She waved at the little crowd at her feet, smiling brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody knows where she came from,\" Philips said, answering Daniel's unasked question, \"Not even her. She just... walked into town one day. Caused a hell of a panic, once people realized it wasn't a joke. Mayor even called the National Guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, turns out, she's knows just as much as we do about her. All she remembers is waking up over at the mountains, and then walking over here. Also, she's harmless, if a little on the grabby side. The newspaper -which is something that you're going to read, by the way- ran a poll on what to call her, and they ended up with Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel had been silent, observing Jenny. On one hand, she was gorgeous. On the other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced when she crouched down, holding a finger out to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where do I fit into this?\" He asked, turning to look at Philips, \"What am I supposed to do about this... this giant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Philips answered...</span></div></div>",

He was a large beast, with dark orange skin and digitgrade feet, which didn't look at all dangerous. He sported a medium sized snout and and a single horn came from the top of his head backward. His underside was a smooth creamy tan color and his eyes were light blue. Daniel wished he was dreaming, but he wasn't. Sure enough, the orange mammoth of a lizard was tip-toeing his way to their location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but that's a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, he's a dragon, a damn good worker too!\" Phillips interrupted Daniel as he chuckled at his surprise. \"Yah see, he's been here for a while now, the city had agreed to keep him under wraps, he was small enough to fit in a small vacant building, but, as you can see he's grown quite large, too big for a building.\" The dragon was coming closer to the men, Daniel was shaking a little. \"So he's too big now not to keep him secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel just kept watching as the ground shook with each step. He couldn't help but think of an old game he used to play, and the character in it resembled the monster. \"H-how long has the public known about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bout 4 months now.\" Daniel was shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...Mr. Phillips?\" Daniel almost jumped as he looked behind him to see a giant crouching dragon in front of him and the group of people, behind him just acting as if nothing was there, going on with their daily lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What is Maximus?\" Phillips had to shout a little to the dragon to get him to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell the mayor for me that the construction of the stadiums finished?\" He looked at them with dull tired eyes, almost too groggy to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! Say, you look a little tired, how bout the rest of the day off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GROOOOOAAAAAHHH\" The massive giant yawned in front of them, blowing back Daniel a bit, while the rest stood there like it was just a breeze. <i>Man, i need to watch the news more often! </i> \"That'd be nice, but doesn't the old Schuller building need help with its remodeling too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, the construction crew will be fine without you today.\" The dragon smiled. And nodded then stood back up to his full height. It was too dizzifying for Daniel to watch. He began his tedious task of walking away from the area, and into the streets once again, tail sticking straight up and hovering above the ground to make sure he didn't hit anything by accident. \"Amazing fella i tell ya. Anyways, your job is to keep an eye on him for a while, the National gaurd and other such organizations have been telling us for a while that we need to monitor him at all times, we've tried to for the past couple of years, but people aren't that comitted, so you'll be watching over him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel, sweating a bit, adjusted his neck tie and almost choked when he spoke \"Me? Y-you want me to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Did i not make that clear?\" Phillips almost seemed annoyed at the new agents impatence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But..why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like i said, the government wants a close eye on him.\" Phillips handed him a map \"He lives in a cave off the coast, near the bay.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Daniel couldn't believe what he is seeing right not outside the window, and he was totally shock of what he is seeing himself. He wish he could stop seeing it for reality checking reasons, but it is true. Strolling through the city with a playful smile on her face with her hands raised up as if she was a monster, was a 7 year old child who is easily around 170ft tall. The girl has pale skin that can easily be pretty reflective to the sun and was a bit nice to behold, and the girl has medium length black hair that easily goes to her shoulder. Her green eyes were also kinda net. She has the bare minimum of clothes for a girl her age, just wearing a two-piece pink bikini to cover her private parts. She was seen currently giving the people around her a good monster like show, also playfully roaring like a monster, and when she actually roars, her roar almost sounded like Godzilla in a way. Daniel was totally in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can see that you are in total shock to witness this. Trust me, everyone here is always in shock when they see her around town. This girl you are looking before us right now is Koyuki, or as many calls her and she prefers to be called around here, Koyukizilla!\" Phillips said as he pointed his figure at the giant girl outside who was giving the show, with the various people cheering her on. Koyuki was very careful not to crush anything with her feet, though it still causes the ground to rumble when she moves. She also looks like a monster when's she moves around as if she was imitating the giant monsters in the old Japanese movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she got that name for sure. I am sure I should have been keeping up with the news regarding this girl, as she seems to be a huge story.\" Daniel admitted as he never really paid attention to things like this during his FBI works, and that is where Phillips cracks a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she is, because she actually grew up here all her life as a monster to the public, but I mean that in a good way. You see, there was a scientist lab that operated here many years ago working with the military to create a weapon that can help us take down terrorists easily. They were experimenting with super soldier like serum and such, and a accident occured 7 years ago when a pregnant woman and her husband who was working at the lab at the time got affected by the serum in a explosion caused by a freak accident. Luckily no one was injured seriously, and the woman did survived and gave birth to the child we are seeing before us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what does that have to do with her growth?\" Daniel asked, now wondering about the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is where the story get good. She actually developed a very rapid growth spurt during her first few years, but the simple part of the story is right now at age 7 alone, she is almost the height of Godzilla, but that is only the part of the story here. She even developed some super human like abilties during those years. Obviously the roar she emitted was enhanced greatly, also lots of practice because when she was young she would watch monster movies all the time. Military actually tested their weapons on the giant child, and she actually never took any damage or flinch at all. In fact, her body regenerated any wounds she might have suffered. She is also able to breathe underwater, and essentially go like hours into water without ever suffocating. Wish we could all do that, but the best part of all. She can actually shoot laser beams from her eyes, and cause destruction if she wanted to. I know, lots of things that can make the people fear her and run away easily.\" Phillip said just as he shows Daniel some videos on the projector in the room that demonstrates all the points that he was talking about. The laser beam was used just lately as Koyukizilla was using her laser beam to destroy a building for reconstruction and they needed her to destroy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that is something I didn't know about her at all until now.\" Daniel now said, impressed by all the details. \"So y'all have a living giant monster in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. Luckily, she is a very nice and helpful friend in the city, but she also loves to act like a giant monster all the time, so expect her to roar and even more around like a monster from time to time. She lives by a specially made docks by the bay for her size that provides everything for her, like food and such, and she has done a lot for this city. She was so well liked by the people here that everyone gave her the name Koyukizilla, and she likes that name so much, she will roar anytime anyone says her name like that.\" Phillip said. \"And that now leads me to asking you to... (choice here) \"And one more thing, once you get her to be your friend, you might just have someone to really watch your back. Especially if you got a giant monster as your friend.\"</span></div></div>",

Though it seems crazy dangerous at first, the giant happens to be very friendly, and is a model citizen, helping out the community whenever possible.
