How have you been?\" Gramps says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm doing well.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then look over to Yugi and see a rope around his neck. I look down and notice a golden pyramid there, with the eye of Wdjat in the middle. \"So you finally solved that thing, right Yugi?\" I say chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks down at the Millennium Puzzle, \"Oh, right! That was the big surprise!\" he says grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi then notices the Millennium Pendant around my neck. \"Whoa! The Pendant looks awesome!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Millennium Pendant is a golden flat circle about the size of the Puzzle. On it, it has golden wings coming out of the top, and the eye of Wdjat in the center. I was able to finish the Pendant not long after I can to America. Grandpa said that the Puzzle and the Pendant were shattered sitting in a Pharaoh's tomb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us then walk to the exit of the airport eating our cheeseburgers, and catching up on what's been happening since we last saw each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then get into a cab and drive back to the Game Shop. \"So what's Domino High like?\" I ask Yugi. The two of us are in our sophomore year, just like all of his friends. I left Domino City before my freshman year, so I was unable to experience the school myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi looks kind of taken aback by this question. \"Oh, oh. It's a good school overall.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we finally reach the Game Shop, I can't wait to get to my old room. I run up the stairs and open the door to my room; it's just as I left it. The walls are painted a pale blue color and the sheets on my bed are a dark purple color. My room looks about the same as Yugi's, though the desk is on the right wall, and the bed is against the back wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find my new school uniform hanging in the closet. It consists of a blue skirt, white dress shirt, blue bow tie, and a pink jacket. Yuck, pink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days later, I begin my first day at Domino High. I try to avoid getting up for the day, but I can't find a good excuse. I get up and walk down to the kitchen. Yugi is sitting on the kitchen table, nibbling on some toast. I grab a piece of toast and sit next to him. \"Hey Yugi.\" I say rubbing my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Sabrina.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue eating my toast rather slowly. Yugi then gets up from his seat, \"Well I better get dressed. You should probably do the same.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to wear uniforms? I hate mine.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckles slightly, \"If you want to get an education, then you'll have to wear it.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI roll my eyes and walk back up to my room. I get into my uniform, grab my school bag, and walk back downstairs. I look down to make sure that the Millennium Pendant is on my neck; which it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi practically runs to school, \"Yugi can you slow down?\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I'm so excited for you to meet my friends.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us enter the classroom to find everyone there standing in their own little groups. I notice a group of two guys and one girl standing together, which Yugi approaches; I follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi taps one of the guys on the shoulder. He turns around to look at him. \"Oh, hey Yug, what's up?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi smiles widely, \"Guys I want you to meet Sabrina.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all look up at me with great interest. \"Hey there, I'm Joey Wheeler.\" The same guy says. Joey has shaggy blonde hair and brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Tristan Taylor.\" says another. He has brown hair that spikes at the top and brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention then moves over to the girl, \"Nice to meet you Sabrina. I'm Tea Gardner.\" She says nicely. She has short brown hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\" I say back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to know them quite well. Tea seems like she's really glad to have me here, because she doesn't seem to be friends with any other girls. I begin telling them about myself, and what America is like. Joey then looks up at me, \"Hey Sabrina, ever played Duel Monsters?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI seem kind of taken aback by this, \"Of course I do! I've won at least three tournaments in America.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooo, looks like Yugi has some competition.\" Tea says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, believe me Tea. Yugi always beats me.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles slightly, \"Welcome to the club.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look over to my left for a second and notice a student reading some kind of novel. He has brown hair and cold blue eyes. I feel as though I've seen him before though. I then recognize him, \"Hey guys, isn't that the famous Seto Kaiba over there?\" I whisper to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look over at Kaiba, \"Yeah. He's not much of a talker in school.\" Tea says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised he even goes to school. He's the president of Kaiba Corp., you'd think he'd go to a better school then this place.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of them just shrug. Kaiba has a bit of a reputation in America, because come on, he runs a billion dollar company. And most people play Duel Monsters there, so it only makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Sabrina, are you staying in Domino for good?\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I don't think I'll ever leave this place again for a while.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone grins largely. I can tell their happy about that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell for class then rings. Everyone scurries to their seats and sits down. The teacher then comes in and introduces me to the class. The students don't seem to really care though; Yugi says they get new students a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day goes by pretty quickly. I can't help but want to keep talking with Yugi's friends though; it's nice to have someone other than Yugi to talk to here. When the bell finally rings, everyone hops out of their seats. \"Well we'll see you tomorrow guys!\" says Tristan. Joey and Tea leave with him, leaving me and Yugi to walk home alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we're about halfway home, Yugi speaks up, \"So what do you think of Domino High?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love it.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, that was six months ago. And I feel that something bad is going to happen soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi! Come on, we have to leave!\" I say throwing a pillow at his door. I'm already dressed and waiting for Yugi to get ready. He soon emerges from his room, finishing putting on his jacket. \"Okay, okay, I'm ready.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and grab my school bag. The two of us walk down to the game shop part of the house, \"Bye Gramps, we'll see you later.\" I say waving to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles and waves back to us. Yugi and I make our way to school quietly. \"Hey Yugi, did you bring your deck today?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I promised Joey that I'd duel him today.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle slightly, \"I don't expect him to win.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe enter the school to find Joey and Tristan talking around a table. \"Hi guys!\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey look over at me, \"Oh, hey Sabrina.\" Joey says. He then looks down at Yugi, \"Oh Yug! You ready to duel now?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi smiles, \"If you're ready.\" He says sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan, Tea, and I then crowd around the table. Yugi has the upper hand most of the duel, but Joy is still able to hold his own. When its Joey's turn, he hasn't talked in a minute; which is surprising. \"Hello, earth to Joey. You know it's your turn right?\" Yugi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Yug, it's time to duel.\" Joey says putting a monster on the field with 800 ATK. \"Pretty good, eh?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. But not good enough.\" Yugi then puts another monster down with 1500 ATK. His monster then destroys Joey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Thanks a lot Yugi.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, its fine Joey. I just have better cards then you. You see, I get all my best cards from my Grandpa.\" Yugi says wearing a huge smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the one who owns the game shop! You've got to bring me there Yug!\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, maybe he'll even show you his rare card.\" Yugi say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm still not sure how Gramps got his hands on a Blue-Eyes White Dragon card, but I enjoy looking at it. I can't help but take out my own deck from my pocket and look at it. It may not have the best cards in the world, but I've won quite a few duels with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen school ends, we all make our way over to the Game Shop. \"Grandpa! We're home!\" Yugi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandpa chuckles, \"And I see you've brought some friends with you.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gramps, can you show my friends your super rare card?\" Yugi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rare card? You mean my special rare card?\" Gramps says. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Gramps stands there in thought for a moment. Joey and Yugi beg him to show it, which makes Gramps agree. He then takes out a box that looks neatly polished. \"Here it is. The Blue-Eyes White Dragon.\" He says. \"This card is so rare and powerful that I never let it leave my hands.\" He continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTristan then takes the card from him. \"Doesn't look all that special.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the card from him and give it back to Gramps. \"This card is priceless! There are only four in the entire world!\" he says cuddling the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, I'm ready to trade!\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help but roll my eyes at him. \"Not for this card!\" Gramps says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey then takes it back, and insists on seeing some other cards. Just then I hear the bell on the door ring. I look over to see Seto Kaiba standing in the doorway. What's he doing here?! \"Can I help you?\" asks Grandpa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can't, I wouldn't be surprised.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else gasps at seeing Kaiba. \"What are you doing here?\" I ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here to see the card.\" He says walking up to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're into Duel Monsters? Maybe we could all duel together sometime.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba rolls his eyes, \"I'd have more fun playing solitaire.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looks pretty mad at this comment. \"How about we settle this with fists then?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi then comes in and separates them. I move Tristan and Tea to the side. The next thing you know Kaiba then notices the Blue-Eyes card sitting on the table. He pushes the rest of us aside, \"Can it be? The Blue-Eyes White Dragon, in a dump like this?!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scowl at him. Sure this place isn't a mansion, but it's no dump. Gramps then takes the card and places it in the box. \"Is there anything else I can get you?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba then puts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens it up and turns it so Gramps can see it. Inside are about every other card in Duel Monsters. \"Hand over the card old man. I'll trade you all of these.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a pretty good collection, but no thanks.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh of relief for a second. Sure I don't hate Kaiba, I just don't want Gramps to give up a card like that for cards you can buy every day. Yugi and the rest of the gang gasp though, as if that was a horrible choice. \"Fine, if you won't trade then maybe you'll sell. Name your price. I can pay anything.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you could. But this card is worth more to me than any amount of money.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba looks shocked at this; probably because he's never heard the word 'no' before. \"Fine, I've had enough of this.\" Kaiba says walking away. \"Old fool.\" He mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't help but roll my eyes. What a jerk. Tea, Tristan, and Joey leave shortly after, leaving me and Yugi to go to bed. As I try to sleep, I can't help but have a bad feeling about Kaiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning seems pretty normal. Me and Yugi go off to school, leaving Grandpa at the Game Shop. Kaiba wasn't at school today, which makes me worry slightly. But then again, he has a company to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang and I then walk home together when school ends. \"I hope he has some good cards today.\" says Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gramps we're back!\" I say opening the door. I notice that the shop is completely empty, and the room is dark. I knew something was going to go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think he is?\" says Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he went out.\" says Tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head, \"No, I doubt it. He wouldn't leave the door unlocked.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the phone on the wall starts ringing. Yugi walks up to it and answers it, \"Hello? Game Shop.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can hear a dark voice through the phone, \"Kaiba?!\" Yugi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba's voice continues talking, causing a worried look to appear on Yugi's face. \"Kaiba? What have you done?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suddenly realize what happened; Kaiba did something to Grandpa. \"Let's go!\" I say. Within seconds, we all start running toward Kaiba Corp. Headquarters. We eventually reach it and rush through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe enter the elevator up begin to head upwards. As we reach the floor we need to go to, the doors open. As they open, we see Grandpa lying on the floor. \"Grandpa!\" Yugi yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi and I run up to him, to check if he's alright. Grandpa looks up at Yugi, \"Yugi I failed. I wanted to teach Kaiba a lesson about the Heart of the Cards, but I lost.\" He says weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the old man doing?\" says a voice in the background. I recognize it instantly; it's Kaiba. \"Kaiba! What did you do to him!\" I demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a duel; that's all. With each of us putting our most valuable card as the prize. But I guess facing the Duel Monsters champion was too much for the old man.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes twitch slightly. I hold my hands into fists, as I watch Kaiba carefully. Kaiba smirks again, \"Just look at the sweet prize I won. \" He says. He then holds up the Blue-Eyes White Dragon card, and rips it. \"G-Grandpa's rarest card...\" Yugi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba throws the pieces of the card onto the ground. \"Yes, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon is a rare and powerful card. But this one will never be used against me.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-my treasure\u2026\" Grandpa says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could you do such a thing Kaiba?\" I say. My rage just keeps growing as I look at him. I then look over at Grandpa and Yugi. Grandpa is holding his deck toward Yugi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi, please take this. I built this deck and I put my soul into these cards. Please take my cards and teach him a lesson.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Grandpa, I need to get you to a doctor.\" Yugi insists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba walks closer to us this time, \"Sounds like an excuse. Your friends can care for your Grandfather, while we duel.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi still looks like he's resisting it. \"Do it Yugi. Teach Kaiba a big lesson.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi stills looks skeptical. But we convince him otherwise. \"Alright, I'll do it.\" Yugi says grabbing Grandpa's deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone put your hands together.\" Tea says. She holds up a marker, which makes me skeptical at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all put our hands into a circle. She then draws random lines and squiggles that somehow connect. \"What the heck is this?\" I say looking at my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a symbol for our friendship. It means that no matter how Yugi duels, that he'll know that we'll always be there with him.\" Tea says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel that it's a decent idea, but at the same time it doesn't. \"Sabrina,\" Joey says. I look over at him, \"stay here and watch over Yugi. We'll take care of Gramps.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, \"Okay Joey, take good care of him.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods and they carry Grandpa downstairs. Kaiba then leads me and Yugi to a Duel Arena on the next floor. Yugi enters the dueling platform, while I stand on the sideline. \"Alright, we each begin with 2000 life point, first one to zero loses.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Play time is over Kaiba.\" Yugi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I feel something come over me, as if I'm being controlled. The Millennium Pendant glows and the rest is a blur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Yami Sabrina~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down at the body I now possess. I'm finally free. I don't remember how I got trapped in the Pendant; I just know that it's been over millennia since I was free. I look up at the boy my host refers to as Yugi, he looks different. He must also have a spirit inside his body, from the Millennium Puzzle. I feel as though I know the man now standing in Yugi's body, I just don't know from where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Kaiba, prepare yourself. Because it's time to duel!\" he says. The voice of this man is much deeper than Yugi's; who is he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the game begin. I summon the mighty Hitotsu-Me Giant.\" Kaiba says. Then the giant comes forth onto the field, almost like a real version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" says the imposter Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my virtual dueling system. It turns every duel monster into a hologram.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now it's my turn. I call forth Winged Dragon- Guardian of the Fortress.\" The spirit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon appears on the field, just like the other one. \"Fireball attack!\" he says. The blast blows up Kaiba's monster, causing him to lose 200 life points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad Yugi; for a beginner anyway. But how will you deal with this?\" Kaiba says. Just then a clown appears on Kaiba's side of the field, with 600 ATK. Why would he summon a monster with such low attack points?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Saggi doesn't have that many attack points. But what if I add it with this card?\" Kaiba says placing a magic card on the field.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That's right, my Negative Energy Generator.\" Kaiba says. His monster then triples its attack points up to 1800, which is higher than Yugi's dragon. The Dark Clown then attacks, causing Yugi's life points to go down to 1600.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Yugi summons a monster in defense mode. Kaiba then immediately attacks his monster; destroying it. Kaiba then beats every defense mode monster Yugi puts on the field. Come on, you can do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba laughs, \"Your deck is just as feeble as your grandfather Yugi.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandfather is a great man. And a better duelist then you'll ever be. He trusted me with these cards, and I can feel his heart within this deck.\" The spirit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi then draws a card. \"And looks like my faith has helped me; with Gaia the Fierce Knight! With a destructive power of 2300!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaia attacks Saggi, causing Kaiba's life points to go down to 1300. \"Your move Kaiba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba then draws a card. His eyes have a sinister look in them, which makes me flinch. \"I call upon the Blue-Eyes White Dragon!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widen at this. How did he get his hands on another Blue-Eyes? \"Surprised? Do you think your grandfather was the only one who has a Blue-eyes White Dragon?\" Kaiba says. The dragon then attacks Gaia, causing Yugi's life points to go down to 900.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faith or no faith, you will fall to my superior monsters Yugi.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game goes on, Kaiba's blue eyes destroys more of Yugi's monsters. \"I've seen you handle one, but let's try what hope you have against two.\" Kaiba says. Just then, another Blue-Eyes appears. That figures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the spirit within Yugi looks almost defeated. Don't give up. \"I won't give up; grandpa's counting on me.\" He says. He then draws another card, and by the look on his face, I can tell it's good. He then plays Swords of Revealing Light. I smile at this. \"How desperate, what good will a three-turn delay do you?\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba then draws a card, \"You may have stopped my Blue-Eyes, but my new monsters aren't affected. Now I summon Judgeman!\" he says. This claim may be incorrect, but Kaiba seems to have controlled this Duel. Judge man then destroys one of Yugi's face-down cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit then summons the Dark Magician. I know my host refers to it as one of Yugi's ace monsters. The Dark Magician attacks Judgeman, leaving Kaiba down to 1000 life points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba begins his next turn. Just then he summons the third Blue-eyes. No way! That means that Kaiba has all of the three Blue-Eyes left in the world! Blue-Eyes then attacks the Dark Magician, making Yugi fall to 400 life points. \"Tell me Yugi. How's your faith now? On my next turn I can attack with all three of my Blue-Eyes.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirit then goes to draw his next card, but he stops for a moment. He looks over at me, as though he feels that he knows me. I nod at him, saying 'go ahead'. He nods back and draws his next card. \"Draw your last pathetic card, so I can end this Yugi.\" Kaiba says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandfather's deck has no pathetic cards Kaiba, but it does contain\u2026the unstoppable Exodia!\" says the spirit holding up the head of Exodia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've assembled all five cards; all five pieces of the puzzle.\" He says. Exodia then appears on the field, as real as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Exodia it's not possible. No one's ever been able to summon him.\" Kaiba says taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exodia, Obliterate!\" the spirit commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExodia forms a huge energy ball in his hands, and then releases it toward the Blue-Eyes. \"You play only for power Kaiba, and that's why you lost. But if you play with the Heart of the Game, there is nothing you can't do.\" The spirit says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I have lost to him?\" Kaiba says to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kaiba, if you really want to know; open your mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eye of Wdjat forms on Yugi's head, along with mine. He then fires a blinding, imaginary light from the palm of his hand. Kaiba yells in pain, then falls to his knees, ending this duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watch the spirit get down from the duel platform. He approaches me casually. He's then all of the sudden right next to me. He smiles at me and begins to speak, \"You're a spirit, like me, aren't you?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, \"For some reason, I feel that I know you. But sadly, I cannot remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. If we are somehow related then I should see you again. But what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thinks for a moment, \"I'm mostly referred to as Yugioh, the Game King, but I have no known name, so you may call as you wish. But what should I call you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes me think for a moment, I have the same problem. \"I cannot say, for I have the same issue. So for now, I will call you 'Spirit'.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, \"Alright, until we meet again.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Battle City Finals, here we come.\" Yugi Motu thought as he and his friends walked into Kaiba Corp Stadium. He, Mai and Joey were finalists in the Battle City Tournaments. The rest of their friends, Duke, Tristan, Serenity, and Tea were there for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the stadium, they looked around. \"This is it?\" Yugi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is still under construction.\" Duke pointed out. The stadium looked only half finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the stadium stood Seto and Mokuba Kaiba, and two men who worked for Kaiba Corp. \"Welcome duelists.\" One said. \"Please present your locator cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey held up his with a triumphant smile. \"Check it out. We call have six!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations then.\" The other man said, reaching into his pocket, and pulling out eight cards. \"These are your tournament . You are now officially Battle City Finalists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMai rolled her eyes and too her I.D. \"We already knew that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey took his and looked over it. \"So where is everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far there are only three of you, including Mr. Kaiba. The other four are expected to arrive shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that being said, the group stood and waited, watching the entrance to the stadium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after, another Duelist arrived. Yugi got a strange feeling in the pit of his stomach. \"Guys, I've got a bad feeling about this.\" He said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked at him. \"Do you think it's that evil creep Marik?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi shrugged. \"It could be.\" He brought his gaze back to the door and watched as the duelist made their entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man who looked to be nineteen entered. He had platinum blonde hair, lavender eyes, and he had a tan, as if he'd spent most of his life in the sun. He was wearing a sleeveless vest, black leather pants, and a few pieces of jewelry. (A/N: Release the squealing fangirls!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea and Joey ran to greet the duelist. \"Hey, we know you.\" Joey pointed out. \"You're Namu right? You're the one who helped Bakura out earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik smiled. They still thought he was a friend, Namu. \"Glad I could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea turned and introduced him to the rest of the group. But the whole time, he was looking at Yugi. Yugi instantly got that feeling in his stomach again. But he kept up his smile, and welcomed \"Namu\" to the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to be with such a welcoming crowd.\" Namu said. \"I hope everyone I meet is as nice as you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that, another duelist limped their way into the stadium. Everyone gasped. \"It's Bakura!\" Yugi shouted. (A/N: Cue the rest of the squealing fangirls!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to Bakura, and stopped him from falling over. Tristan ran over as well. \"Bakura? What are you doing here? You need to get back to the Hospital.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura smiled. \"I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Just getting used to walking again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi looked at Bakura's arm. \"What are you doing wearing a Duel Disk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How else was I going to get six locator cards and enter the finals?\" Bakura said. He held up the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of pure shock spread over everyone's face. \"No way!\" Yugi thought. \"Bakura could barely walk! How could he win six locator cards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey and Tristan join in on the questioning. But Bakura quickly changed the subject. \"Looks, it's the seventh duelist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned back towards the entrance. A big, strong looking man walked in wearing a purple cape. Tea and Joey gasped. \"That's him!\" Tea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi looked at her concerned. \"He's the one who kidnapped me.\" Mokuba added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba glared at this duelist. \"State your name and business now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man lifted his head and looked at Kaiba. \"I am Marik.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should disqualify you for capturing my little brother.\" Kaiba returned. \"But have something I want, and before the finals are over you Egyptian God Card will be mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik showed no emotion as he walked away from Kaiba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Kaiba's men stood in front of the finalists. \"Alright. Give me your attention please. Seven out of Eight of you are here. So now it's time to announce\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" a female voice shouted. Everyone turned to the source of the voice. A girl who looked to be about Seventeen was running in the stadium. \"Wait! Hold on a minute!\" She stopped just short of Kaiba's men. She bent down trying to catch her breath. \"Sorry I'm late.\" She panted. She held up her locator cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba looked at the girl. \"State your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked up at him. \"Kayla. Kayla Edwards. I'm filling in for the eighth duelist until she arrives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura watched the girl with interest. She had long curly brown hair that reached her lower back, and piercing green eyes. She was wearing a grey tank top, a thin white knee length skirt, brown leather boots with a jacket to match, and the Kaiba Corp Duel Disk on her left arm. The right sleeve of her jacket lifted up a bit, exposing a gold bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura's Millennium Ring, hidden under his shirt, was starting to act up. The needles of the ring started pointing at the girl. Luckily no one was looking at him at the time. He put his hand over the ring, forcing the needles to go back down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.\" Bakura thought. \"I wonder if this girl is in possession of one of the Millennium Items. I shall have to look into this later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your story checks out. The eighth finalist called ahead of time, telling us this. Welcome to the Battle City Finals.\" The guard gave Kayla her I.D.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla smiled, and stuck it into the pocket of her jacket. She then walked over to where Yugi and his friends were standing. She looked up, and spotted Tea. \"Tea? Tea Gardner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea looked at Kayla. \"Kayla? Oh my god, what are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla lifted up the arm that she wore her Duel Disk on. \"I'm in the Finals. Duh.\" She smiled. \"What are you doing here? Are you in it too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea shook her head. \"I'm just here to cheer on my friends.\" She turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, this is Kayla. She and I were best friends before her dad was stationed over in the Middle East. Kayla, these are my friends, Tristan, Joey, Mai, Serenity, Duke, Bakura, and Yugi. And over there is our friend Namu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla looked at them. \"Wait, you mean Yugi and Joey? As in the two finalists for the Duelist Kingdom Tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey laughed. \"See? I told you guys someone would recognize me!\" He quickly walked up to Kayla and held out his hand. \"Joey Wheeler. Second runner up at Duelist Kingdom.\" Kayla shook his hand with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi held his hand when Joey was finished. \"And I'm Yugi. It's nice to meet you Kayla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet all of you.\" Her gaze eventually met Bakura, and she noticed him staring at her, almost as if he was examining her. She looked away ignoring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi and Bakura could both sense a great power coming from her. \"Who exactly is this girl?\" Yugi wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't tell me that you played Duel Monsters, Kayla.\" Tea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I didn't before I moved. I just got into it after watching the Duelist Kingdom tournament. It looked like fun, and my brother was really into it. He gave me his deck, and taught me everything I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome.\" Tea said. \"Maybe you could duel one of us later, and show us what you can do. Not for competition, just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla smiled. \"I'd like that. Who wants to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey jumped up. \"I call first duel.\" He said. \"I want to see what you've got, Kayla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on Wheeler.\" </span></div></div>",

Everyone gasped. \"So we're dueling in the sky?\" Yugi asked, amazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it Yugi.\" Mokuba said with a smile. \"Four thousand feet in the sky.\" He turned to everyone else. \"Alright everyone, climb aboard for the Battle City finals!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blimp landed, and everyone entered. Kayla stopped Tea right after Bakura boarded. \"That's Bakura right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea nodded. \"Yeah. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no reason. Just curious.\" Kayla said. She now had his name. If she found him staring at her the same way he had before, she would confront him. Something about him made her feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys? You coming?\" Yugi shouted from the blimp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, hurry up!\" Joey added. \"I want to get some practice in before the finals start!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla smiled, and ran on board. \"Come on Tea!\" she shouted with a laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like old times.\" Tea thought to herself. \"Hey, Kayla! Wait up!\" she ran after her friend, laughing along with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the security guards boarded, another duelist made their way into the stadium. \"I believe you were waiting for me?\" she asked. The two nodded. She handed them her locator cards. \"Should we inform the girl that you have arrived?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duelist shook her head. \"Let her duel in this tournament. She has a lot at stake here, and has something she's fighting for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards nodded, and let the duelist board. \"And besides,\" She thought. \"If I fail to save my brother, then Kayla will have to do it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Joey stared at the card in his hands, trying to come up with a new strategy. So far, Kayla was winning against him in their \"non-hologram, just for fun, game\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New to duel monsters my foot.\" Joey thought. \"She plays like a pro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Joey, you're boring the poor girl to death. Make a move already.\" Mai said, trying to edge the duel on. Joey glared at her. \"I'm workin on it! Don't rush me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla smiled, and stifled a giggle. \"Take all the time you want Joey.\" \"You'll regret saying that.\" Tea mumbled, earning another laugh from Kayla and Mai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's sister Serenity watched patiently, taking in all of the rules and strategies of Duel Monsters. She hoped to someday play like her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the table right now, Kayla had two monsters, Mystical Elf in defense mode, and Mermaid Knight in attack, including a face down card. Joey had his Baby Dragon out in attack mode, and that was it. Kayla had defeated his other monsters, bringing his life points down to five hundred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more moments, Joey made his decision. \"Alright Kayla, prepare to lose. This strategy is a keeper here. I play Time Wizard in attack mode.\" He slapped the card onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla smirked. \"I activate, Spell Binding circle.\" She gracefully flipped over her face down card. \"And I choose to use it on your Baby Dragon. It's now stuck there until it's destroyed, or the game is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's eye widened, as did Kayla's smirk. \"And now, I attack your Time Wizard with my Mermaid Knight. Bringing your life points straight down to zero. I win.\" She crossed her arms over her chest, and crossed her legs, giving a triumphant smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great job, Kayla.\" Tea said. \"You play as if you've been playing your whole life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I let her win.\" Joey said. \"You know, just to give the newbie a bit of confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really.\" Mai questioned. \"Is that how it was? Well if that's true then why don't you go again, and give her a real challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey swallowed hard. \"On second thought, I think I'll pass. But hey, maybe someone else would like to give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls laughed, up until Bakura approached Kayla. \"I'll give it a shot.\"She looked up at him, his brown eyes piercing into hers. \"Um\u2026 It's Bakura right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, and smiled. \"And you're Kayla, if I'm not mistaken, and you're playing just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla nodded. \"Yeah. That's right. Just warming up for the real event.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura took Joey's spot and laid his deck on the table. \"Then allow me to help you, if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"Bring it on.\" She shuffled her deck, and Bakura did the same. They then placed their decks on the table. \"Alright.\" She said. \"Let's duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both drew their hands, and the duel began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes. That was all it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Ten minutes, Bakura had gotten Kayla's life points down to six hundred, with Bakura's remaining at two thousand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla tried to think of a different strategy, but her hand wasn't doing her much justice. She slipped off her jacket, trying to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Bakura got his first good look at her bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a golden cuff bracelet, with three large turquoise stones. There was a small golden eye symbol embedded into the center stone. His Millennium Ring started pointing at the bracelet. He quickly put his hand over it to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is this possible?\" He wondered. \"All these years, I've never once heard of a Millennium Bracelet. Or anything else along those lines. I must investigate this. I must know if this girl truly does possess a Millennium Item. She could become very useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a very\u2026 Interesting bracelet you have Kayla.\" Bakura pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kayla looked down at her wrist. She was so absorbed in the game that she forgot about her surroundings. \"Oh. That. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething changed in her then. The very mention of the bracelet seemed to bring sorrow to her eyes. Bakura ignored it. \"Do you mind me asking where you got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got a thing for jewelry now Bakura?\" Joey asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's just that I think I've seen it before, I just can't remember where.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla shrugged. \"Unless you've been to Egypt recently, you probably haven't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You went to Egypt?\" Tea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla nodded. \"When we moved, my dad took me and my brother on a few trips. We stopped by the Pyramids in Egypt since we were close by. He bought it for me while we were there. The lady that sold it to him said it had some special gift that came with it. Or something crazy like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as I had suspected.\" Bakura thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is pretty crazy.\" Tea said, agreeing with Kayla's previous statement. \"Speaking of your brother how is Gavin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla's hand froze just inches above her deck. Bakura seemed to be the only one who noticed. Kayla dropped her eyes, looking down at the table. \"He's fine.\" She said quickly. \"He's doing great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea smiled, not noticing her friend's discomfort with the subject. \"Did he ever get accepted into the tech school he wanted to go to?\" Kayla nodded. \"That's where he is right now actually.\" Bakura could sense the lies behind her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla quickly stood up. \"I forfeit. You win Bakura.\" She said, picking her jacket and her deck up. Her Duel Disk was lying on her bed in her room. She slipped her deck into her pocket and walked out of the room. \"It was nice to meet you guys, and it was a pleasure to duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea looked at the others when she had left. \"Did I say something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Serenity said. \"Did you see how she froze up? Maybe it has something to do with her brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever it is, it seemed to tick her off big time.\" Joey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea looked back at the door, deciding on whether to follow Kayla or not. \"What happened to her in the past four years?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla walked down the hall to her bedroom in silence. When she was finally in her room, alone, she pulled her backpack from the closet. She began to unpack her things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnderneath all of her clothes, she stopped at a frames photo of her and her brother in Egypt. Her father had taken the picture right in front of the pyramids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the picture Kayla and her identical older brother Gavin, were both wearing sunglasses. Kayla was wearing a black tank top and cut denim shorts. Gavin wore a white t shirt and tan cargo pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pose the two made was the typical brother-sister pose. Kayla doing a peace sign, and her brother hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories brought tears to her eyes. \"Don't worry Gavin.\" She whispered. \"I'm going to win this. Just hold on a little longer.\" She held the picture to her chest, as if she was holding her brother. She then placed the picture on her nightstand and got ready to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Kayla, she'd left her bedroom door open, and Bakura was standing outside, listening and watching the whole thing. He'd seen the picture, and the pain it brought to Kayla.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBakura smirked to himself. \"This gets even more interesting by the second. This girl will definitely become a part of my plans.\" With that thought in mind, Bakura walked down the hall to his own room. He couldn't wait to put his plan into action.</span></div></div>",

Seeing it as none of her business, she ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura dragged Marik into the hall. \"What the hell was that! You said that you would use the power of the Millennium Rod to make sure that I dueled with the Pharaoh!\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik brushed Bakura's hand away. \"I tried doing that. Something interfered with the connection of my Rod. A powerful force stopped my signal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura glanced back at Kayla. \"How powerful would you say it was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stronger than any other power I have felt. Stronger than any of the Millennium Items.\" Marik looked in the direction Bakura was looking. \"You think she's the power source?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" Bakura said. \"Whether it was intentionally or not, she did it somehow.\" Then, a thought came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe dueling her isn't such a bad idea. I could get her bracelet ahead of schedule, and find out what it does in time to duel the Pharaoh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at Marik. \"You're lucky that girl possesses something I desire, Marik. Otherwise you would regret that little mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarik glared at him. \"Watch it, Bakura. You're forgetting that I also possess something you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura backed off, and walked back to the crowd. He looked at Kayla and put on a fake smile. \"It will be a pleasure to duel you officially, Kayla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla smiled, and nodded. \"May the better duelist win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Bakura said. \"And may that better duelist be me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walked to the elevator, and went up one more floor to the top of the blimp. Kaiba had set up a dueling arena there. Kayla stepped onto her side of the arena, and slipped her deck into her duel disk. She took a deep breath, and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gavin, where ever you are, I want you to know that I trust in your deck. Give me the strength to win this duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura stepped onto his platform and did the same thing as Kayla. \"Now, before we begin, there is something I must tell you, Kayla. You see, I'm not always\u2026. Myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice grew deeper, and there was a fire in his eyes now. Something under his shirt glowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on with Bakura?\" Tea gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA necklace suddenly appeared from under Bakura's shirt. It was a gold ring with a pyramid in the center, and five pointers. The center of the pyramid had an eye symbol on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw man!\" Joey shouted, jumping back from where he stood. \"He's wearing that Millennium Ring again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Tristan said. \"I got rid of that in Duelist Kingdom. I'm sure of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla gasped. She'd seen that ring before. Or at least something like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayla, you shouldn't be touching that. We're not even supposed to be down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Gavin, come look. There are seven spaces in this coffin. Do you think something is supposed to fill them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kayla, let's just get out of here.\" he took a hold of her arm. Her fingers trailed over the shape of the ring. The necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe necklace Bakura now wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla took a step back, and ran into the platform's railing. How were people getting these items?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura smirked. \"You seem nervous Kayla. Don't be. The quicker we get to this duel, the quicker you'll be reunited with your brother Gavin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea looked up at Kayla. \"What does he mean by that Kayla?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla ignored her and glared at Bakura. \"How do you know about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have friends in certain places. One friend in particular was there the day you lost your brother to the Shadow Realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla could hear Tea, Mai, and Serenity gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second, you lied to us.\" Tea pointed out. Kayla turned and looked at them. \"Could you blame me? I didn't think you'd believe me. Hell, I still have a hard time understanding it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of this.\" Kaiba shouted. \"Either you start this duel now, or both of you will lose your slot in the finals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura's smirk widened. \"Yes Kayla, let's start the show now. We don't want to keep your brother waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla growled. \"Alright. I'll make my move.\" She drew her hand. She remembered back to yesterday when Bakura almost beat her in ten minutes! She was definitely going to avoid that this time. \"Alright.\" She said. \"I place one card face down, and play Mystical Elf in defense mode. It's your move now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura smiled. \"Before I make my move, I say we take this game to the Shadow Realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla gasped. \"No!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura's Millennium Ring began to glow, and the entire top floor of the blimp was covered in darkness. \"The loser of this duel will lose their slot in the finals, their Millennium Items, and their souls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how a Shadow Game works.\" Kayla snapped. \"Just make your damn move already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my. Someone has a temper today.\" Bakura said mockingly. \"That can be easily fixed. I play the Lady of Faith in attack mode, and play my magic card, The Change of Heart. I can now gain control over one of your monsters. And since you only have one on the field, I choose your Mystical Elf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla's Mystical Elf slowly disappeared, the reappeared on Bakura's side of the field. \"Now my Lady of Faith, attack her life points directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reveal face down card!\" Kayla said. \"Spellbinding circle. Meaning your Lady of Faith is trapped on your side of the field, unable to attack or change positions until she is destroyed. And if I am correct, that ends your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck was on your side once Kayla.\" Bakura growled. \"Don't expect it to be again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't luck.\" She said, drawing her card. \"It was faith. Faith in my brother, and faith in his deck.\" She looked at her card, and smiled. \"I play Enchanting Mermaid in attack mode. And since you're turn is over, I regain control over my Mystical Elf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother was always into the feminine cards, to him they seemed pretty powerful. He had said once that each of his main cards reminded him of some woman that was important in his life. He'd said that the Mystical Elf reminded him of their mother, who had died when Kayla was born. She had stayed strong when everything got tough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla closed her eyes, and took a deep breath, stopping herself from breaking down. The memories were all so painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened them again, she brought up her hand. \"Enchanting Mermaid, attack his Lady of Faith!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hologram charged at Bakura's monster and whipped her tail at it. The attack caused his Lady of Faith to shatter, and make him loose 1,100 life points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Bakura lost the life points, Kayla suddenly felt weaker, but she ignored it. \"You underestimated me Bakura.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBakura smiled. \"1,100 life points? That's it? A small price to pay, but no matter. This duel will be over soon, and I will have your Millennium Item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi looked at Kayla. \"What Item could she possess?\" he thought to Yami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, Yugi. Whatever it is, she's doing a good job of hiding it from us. I must ask her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Yami took over Yugi's form. \"Kayla.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla heard a deep voice call her name. She turned around to see Yugi. But it couldn't have been Yugi\u2026 Something didn't seem right about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you have that Bakura could want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this Pharaoh.\" Bakura growled. \" This is my duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla sighed. \"I'm not exactly sure if I have these Millennium Items like you do, but I think I know what he wants.\" She brought up her arm, and rolled down her jacket sleeve. Her bracelet shone in the light emanating from her duel disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYami's eyes widened at the sight of it. It seemed so familiar to him. He had to have somehow seen it in his past. He just couldn't remember. \"Kayla, do you know why he would want it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head. \"I don't care what his reasoning is, I won't let him get it.\" She turned around, ready to get back to the duel, when suddenly, Bakura had summoned a monster and attacked her Enchanting Mermaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force behind the attack was so great it knocked Kayla off her feet. It was too powerful to be a hologram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she remembered, that was what a shadow game did. It weakens the player's opponent, and makes the monsters real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKayla fell back and struck her head on the railing. She could hear Tea and Yugi screaming her name, and before she knew it, everything went black.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name Tyler  Colt,<br>\r\nmy birthday was two weeks ago although for some odd reason I hadn't felt the urge to leave yet. I mean, I don't have a dream. I don't want to become a Champion, Pokemon master or Gym Leader like most kids do. I really have no clue. All I know is that I want to travel, catch Pokemon and make new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was leaving tomorrow. That wasn't too far away since it was already sunset. All I had to do really was walk down the road to Professor Sycamore's Pokemon Lab. I sat there foretelling my journey, giving off a rare smirk in my case as I did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHIRP! CHIRP! I snapped out of my daydream as some Fletchling and Staravia flew past me. It's so magical to see two Pokemon that originated from different regions live in harmony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The wind also picked up and it was so strong I felt as if it would blow me off the tower, so, I decided to get down. Before doing so I had one last glance of this magnificent view as I wouldn't see it for a long time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran back inside my house only to find my mother waiting there for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie you're home! You've been out all day!\" my mother cried as she ran over to hug me. My mum had brown hair that was usually tied up in some swirly bun with hazel eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got the green eyes and the dirty blond hair from my father. She usually wore a white shirt and some brown tight pants. When she was working or in the kitchen she wore a cyan apron with thick white lining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum please!\" I groaned as I pulled away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I thought you'd have that reaction. So I got you a gift!\" she said with a cheer. I perked up at the word gift and looked over at my mum as she brought back a box. I calmly opened it and inside I saw some brand new clothes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow mum they look great,\" I told her with a hint of a smile. I didn't laugh or smile that often as I wasn't the type of person to laugh or smile at everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then go try them on!\" I ran out of the room and chucked off the shabby clothes I had on and put on my new ones. I walked back out and my mum squealed with excitement as they fit perfectly and looked great on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I was wearing mustard coloured chinos and a white top. Over the white top was an unzipped jacket that was a very light sky colour. I wore black vans and also had three bracelets on my right arm; one was blue and red, one was white and black and the other was rainbow coloured. They all were about a centimetre thick and were made out of coloured thread and embedded into a pattern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mum, I love them. The perfect clothes to start my journey with!\" I complimented her. She gave me a warm smile in return as she watched me run up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my boy\u2026\" I heard her mutter as I walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\" I waved to my family as I started to walk down the road that lead to Professor Sycamore's Pokemon Lab. I decided after I got my starter I wouldn't come back home and immediately start on my own. I needed to show I wouldn't have to rely on anyone throughout my journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay safe and keep healthy!\" my mother reminded me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a safe trip!\" my father yelled to me. My father had returned home to give me a send-off as well. I was wearing the clothes that my mum gave me and also wearing a necklace that was a strange rainbow colour \u2013 it was transparent but not transparent at the same time. My father had given it to me but I had no clue what it did. He said I'd find out in due time. It seriously seemed like it had no purpose at all though. \"Prepare yourself Kalos, I'm coming for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked into the large building that rested near the outskirts of town and I found in the lobby no one but a receptionist and a cute little Dedenne that rested on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, I'm here to see Professor Sycamore\u2026\" I told the receptionist nervously. I had no clue as to why I was nervous. I guess starting your journey can give some people jitters?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the new trainer!\" she realised. I nodded. \"Well, one of them anyways\u2026\" I gave her a confused look as I hadn't heard of other new trainer/s. \"You see, there's two other new trainers starting in Aquacorde Town and Vaniville Town and since you were meant to come two weeks ago\u2026 Well, Professor Sycamore kind of went to meet those two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" I groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he won't be back for another month! After he gives them their starting Pokemon tomorrow he's then leaving to go to the Kanto region for a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I guess I'm going to Aquacorde Town!\" I shouted with energy I didn't usually have. Why am I getting so pumped up over this?<br>\r\n I usually don't feel like I need to shout or run but I want that Pokemon. I want to battle! \"See you another time!\" I dashed out of the door and headed for Route 4 but then realised that lots of Pokemon roamed Route 4. It was a few hours of roaming through the fields and then an hour going through the magnificent garden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I couldn't survive that long without any Pokemon by my side. I sighed. Looks like I'll have to go back home after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm so sorry to hear that sweety,\" my mother said as she tried to comfort me. \"Is there anything I can do to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes actually. Could you by any chance get Kris to lend me his Staraptor?\" I questioned. \"He said no when I asked him.\" I gave my mum then 'pretty please' look until she caved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, anything for my baby boy!\" Too easy mum, too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came back minutes later with a pokeball in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I've talked it over with your brother and he said he'd lend it to you only until you get your starter Pokemon. He said if it's not back by tomorrow night then he'll have to punish you!\" my mum said with a wink. \"You know how to work the pokeball transporter at the Pokemon Centre right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, it's already noon so you better hurry if you want to get to Santalune City before sunset.\" She gave me a kiss on the head. I smiled, waved goodbye and ran out the door. I was so excited that yes, I ran. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since I wasn't much of a flyer (even though I do like to sit on top of Prism Tower \u2013 logic) we decided to walk. We peacefully walked through the beautiful garden that connected Santalune City to a route that led to Lumiose City. We had already been walking for like six hours and sunset was quickly approaching\u2026 I had let Staraptor out of his pokeball to have a little fly around. At the moment he was flying above me as I spectated the garden. I hadn't realised that it had been over a year since I'd relaxed in this garden, as it is quite a relaxing place to be and makes you feel connected to Pokemon. They accept humans in their little home and will be friendly to you as long as your friendly back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead I could finally start to see Santalune City and I saw Staraptor start to speed up. We had made it here on time, thankfully. We had left home at 12pm and it was about 6:00 now. The distance between Lumiose City and Santalune City was quite a short distance compared to other cities. Well, nothing like the walk between Vaniville Town and Aquacorde Town. That was only ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star!\" Staraptor chirped as a wild flock of Fletchling and Fletchinder flew right past Staraptor, some even hitting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and murmured, \"No respect,\" to myself. Staraptor floated back to down to the ground as he no longer felt like flying in the sky with other birds who were dis-respectful and rude. I then looked closely at Staraptor's feathers and saw a bald patch where a scratch was. \"Hey one of those birds scratched you!\" Staraptor sadly nodded. \"And it looks like it was with their beak. It was intentional then. Hmph!\" Those birds better watch themselves!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe continued walking along the garden path after I potioned the scratch on Staraptor's wing and finally, we had made it to Santalune City! We walked into the all so familiar town side by side and it was a refreshing sight. I hadn't come back and visited here in so long. We moved when I was just 7 so it had been six- whole years. It brought back memories that had been long forgotten. 6 years had washed them all away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could see the Santalune City Gym from here and I knew I wanted to challenge it. I had known the Gym Leader, Viola, when I was young and told her when I became a trainer I would return to challenge her. And that's what I intend to do once I get my starter Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM! My attention was drawn away from my memories as an explosion summoned itself nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Star?!\" Staraptor seemed startled by the sudden explosion and squawked as a reply to the loud noise. Staraptor wanted to start flying away like birds do when there's an explosion but I stopped him by tugging down on his wing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Staraptor stop! Keep calm. It was probably just a nearby Pokemon battle,\" I explained. Staraptor nodded his head and kept calm. \"You should probably stay in your pokeball for now since we're in a big city.\" I then took out his pokeball and a red light beamed him inside it. I looked over towards where the explosion seemed to have come from and I saw a bit of smoke coming from the air. That sure doesn't seem like the smoke from the collision of two attacks, that seems like the smoke of a fire! Maybe I should swing by to see if everything's ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran up to the place where it was coming from and I saw that the smoke was coming from the Santalune City gym!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here\u2026?\" I questioned someone who was also standing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Team Flare\u2026\" the young boy murmured as he watched the Bug-Type gym begin to burn down. Ugh. Not Team Flare\u2026 Team Flare was an organisation of people in the Kalos region that promised all they wanted was to make the world a more beautiful place, but all they did was destroy things and treat Pokemon like garbage that they argued were \"not beautiful enough\". Every Pokemon was beautiful in some way, such as a Dunsparce or Goomy. Even they have beauty, if not on the outside then on the inside. And it seems they were burning down a Pokemon Gym this time. They have some nerve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHH! Not my Vivillon!\" a woman cried in fear. After a moment I retaliated,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was Viola!\" after realising who screamed. I'm not usually the type of person to rush into situations like this. I didn't make rash decisions, I was calm, but there are Pokemon in there and also Viola! \"Staraptor, go!\" I threw Staraptor's pokeball underarm and into the air; my signature throw!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starrr-aptor!\" Staraptor screeched as he whizzed into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into the Pokemon Gym!\" I commanded him as I started to run inside. He nodded and sped ahead, flying straight into the gym. When I got in there I saw Viola's beautiful forest Gym being burnt down. And, thankfully, the webs that were on the ceiling were burning too. I never really liked them. It just made it seem like it was forever Halloween. \"Staraptor, use Whirlwind to extinguish some of this fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Raptor!\" Staraptor called in agreement with my command. He then started to forcefully flap his wings which stirred up a heavy gust that started to blow some of the fire away. With some of the fire put out, it made us a path to Viola and Team Flare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit your Vivillon was a beautiful Pokemon. But you had to use it in battle. Couldn't you have used something less exquisite?\" a woman with orange hair asked the Bug leader. Viola looked like a scared little girl as the woman's Pyroar seemed to be getting closer and closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brave Bird!\" All of their heads jerked towards Staraptor and I; Viola, the woman with orange hair, the two men in slightly different uniforms to her with red hair, and the woman's Pyroar (who was actually a female Pyroar; you could tell by whether they had a mane or a long ponytail thing at the back of their heads). Staraptor came smashing into her Pyroar and it was slammed up against the wall with a lot of force. Pyroar fell to the ground with swirled eyes, meaning it had fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little brat! How dare you come in here and make my Pyroar faint!\" she moaned. She then opened half of her mouth and it showed her teeth clenched as she started to growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" I questioned the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Aliana, one of four admins of Team Flare,\" she responded. She now had a smirk on her face and looked at Staraptor impressively. \"So that's your Staraptor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My brother's. He's loaning it to me so I can make it to Aquacorde Town so I can get my starter Pokemon,\" I responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not even a trainer yet?!\" she gasped, before smiling again and looking devilishly at me. \"Impressive young boy. Hmph! I have a feeling we'll meet again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlikely, I wouldn't want to get involved with people from Team Flare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, until that time comes then,\" she softly said. She had gone from being a hot head like herself and her two teammates to being calm as still water. \"Depart!\" Suddenly a glass pane in the ceiling shattered and a ladder cam rolling down. They all grabbed onto a rung on the ladder as it started to slowly rise up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just going to leave like that?! Coward!\" I shouted. She just shook her head and smiled at me and eventually, was lifted out of sight and into a massive grey helicopter. Although there was the all so familiar red flame on the side, Team Flare's symbol. The helicopter flew away and all that was left was a burning gym. It wasn't like Team Flare to give up without a fight though\u2026 \"Let's go Viola!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" she responded as we ran outside to find that some fire fighters had just arrived and were already working to put the fire out. We felt the cool air on our skins after being near the scorching heat of a fire for so long and just sighed and sat on a bench next to the Roselia fountain near middle of town. \"Are you by any chance Ty-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, yeah,\" I assured her with a cheesy grin. Yeah that's right, my name is Tyler. Tyler Colt's my name, and Pokemon's my game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You've grown up so much!\" she screamed. I scratched my back embarrassed and replied with a simple \"Yeah\". \"So, you're finally becoming a trainer. Remember our promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Pokemon battle!\" I shouted. \"I assure you this will be my first stop after I get my starter Pokemon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about that. It might take a while to have the gym fixed from the fire\u2026\" she muttered with a sad look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter \u2013 I'll wait,\" I told her. She gave me that 'oh you' look with a sigh to go with it. But she also gave me that 'you'll be waiting a while' look. Oh well, guess after I get my starter, I'll be spending a lot of time in Santalune City! My hometown. But before that, on to Aquacorde Town! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I casually strolled out of Santalune City and was on the road yet again. I unfortunately had to make it through Santalune Forest, plus routes 2 &amp; 3. It was a lot to do in one night. Yup, the sun was setting and I had a half a day's walk ahead. First night of my journey will be a sleepless one\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerial Ace!\" I shouted. Staraptor zipped into yet another Pokemon with speed and force. We had just made it out of Santalune Forest and onto Route 2. From here you could see the riverside town of Aquacorde. It was build alongside a river and also up a small hill. Most of it was also built with goldy coloured bricks so it shone beautifully against the sun. Speaking of the sun, it was sunrise. Yup, 12 hours of tramping through that forest and I had finally made it through. Only thanks to Staraptor creaming all those weak Pokemon. It will be a weird feeling having a Lv.5 Pokemon after battling alongside a very strong one for the past 12 hours. Oh well, every Pokemon starts somewhere and every Pokemon has potential!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starrr!\" Staraptor screeched as she started to zip ahead. Both of us could see a red roofed building up ahead (of course it would be the Pokemon Centre) and both of us desperately needed a break. But that didn't mean I was in the mood to run. I thought I'd let Staraptor go up ahead as this route should only take about a 30 minute walk. Aquacorde Town looked so close but I knew that it was quite far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 7am. I was in the Pokemon Centre's built-in caf\u00e9. And, I was eating for the first time in 12 hours. I had rang up the Sycamore Lab receptionist and asked her when Professor Sycamore was supposed to meet the two other children. She said at noon so I had five whole hours to rest here. I was relieved. Although that wouldn't be enough to counter having no sleep last night. I decided to take a nap in the room I had booked out. I was out for the count within the minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I next awoke, I heard the alarm I set pounding away relentlessly, not stopping. I slammed my hand down onto the button that would stop the beeping. My eyes flickered open and I looked at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! NO WAY!\" I shouted unbelievingly. It was 12:00 already and I had set the alarm for 11:45. \"Did I sleep through 15 minutes of that thing beeping?! Never mind I gotta go!\" I quickly put on my clothes and grabbed Staraptor's pokeball before dashing out of the door. I ran outside of the Pokemon Centre and out into the quite large town. \"Dammit where did she say they were meeting again?\" I was worried, excited and angry at myself all at the same time. I never usually feel this way about anything. Is this what Pokemon does\u2026? \"Ahh... I think she said they were meeting outside the Breston Caf\u00e9. And it was near the top of the city,\" I told myself as I started to sprint up the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around the town as I ducked and dived past the citizens of Aquacorde. Until finally, I reached the top of the massive stairwell. I looked back across the town. A beautiful, large fountain stood in the middle of town. You could also see the old yet still gorgeous bridge that connected Route 2 to the town. Aquacorde Town was truly beautiful. I nice place to get my starter Pokemon. I turned back around and started to run around, looking for the caf\u00e9 and Professor Sycamore. Then, suddenly, the light dimmed everywhere else but there, right there, where I saw\u2026 a Goomy. The holiest Pokemon; Goomy. It deserves to have the light shine down to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goom!\" Goomy cried as he jumped up and hopped away. But right there behind where Goomy just was, was Professor Sycamore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Goomy!\" I shouted out to the big blob of goo. I looked out as the goo happily hopped into the sunset. What a beautiful sight. Well except there was no sunset. I ran over to Professor Sycamore who was sitting outside on a seat that was up against a table with two other kids my age. There was one seat left, and I assumed it was for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess he's not coming,\" I heard the man sigh to the other two. \"I guess I'll just start then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Professor Sycamore!\" I cried as I came running up to the group. I stopped when I got to the table and started to pant after having run up a long staircase and then over to here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" he questioned as he turned away from the kids and looked at me. \"Oh, why aren't you Tyler Colt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're five minutes late! But... Take a seat. I was just about to get started,\" he instructed me. I nodded and took the seat that was free next to him. \"Ok. I'm sure that none of you know each other so how about we do that first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Bree,\" the only girl of the three of us introduced herself. She had straight, light blond hair that came down slightly past her shoulders and a side fringe that came down to her eye. She had blue eyes and tanned skin. She wore a red singlet (that was sort of like a shirt without sleeves. You know those ones that chicks wear) and a dark grey skirt that poofed out. She had a grey belt that went around her waist as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin,\" the boy said to us with a smile. Kevin had short black hair but also had a side fringe that came to his eyebrow. He had light brown skin and brown eyes. He wore a puffy grey snow jacket as well as red chinos. He wore a black bracelet that had a spherical jewel inside of it that resembled the jewel on my necklace. He also wore black sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Tyler,\" I finally said politely. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Good, that's out of the way!\" Professor Sycamore said with a chuckle. \"Now\u2026 I am about to send you three out on a journey. You three do not have to travel together but it would be nice if you would help each other out when help is needed. I will give all of you Pokedexs and one Pokemon to set you out on your journey. I only have one request. I would appreciate it greatly if you would inform me of any information on Mega Evolutions that you find or come across. As some or all of you would know I study Mega Evolution so your help would be appreciated. As you know Tyler, I am about to go to the Kanto region to study Mega Evolution further. Even though Mega Evolution was discovered in Kalos it seems that most Pokemon that can Mega Evolve come from Kanto. And it also holds the most information about Mega Evolution. So you'll find that I pop over there a lot. But if you ever need me, don't hesitate to call. Did you all get all of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" we all replied in unison with a cheerful smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad that I have three bright and bubbly students who will be helping me! Now, here are your three Pokedexs\u2026\" he mumbled while messing with his briefcase. After 30 seconds of an awkward silence he finally pulled out three square machines. One was navy coloured, one was pink and the other was red. Kevin took the navy one and Bree took the red one so I was left with\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, a pink Pokedex\u2026!\" I fake exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you can have the red one. I think Professor Sycamore intended for me to get the pink one anyway,\" Bree said with a smile. We exchanged Pokedexs and I looked over at Professor Sycamore and he had a big smile on his face. He nodded at me before reaching into his briefcase and pulling out a cylinder machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! You may choose your starter Pokemon!\" Professor Sycamore screamed as the cylinder opened on one side and three pokeballs appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first,\" Kevin and I both told Bree. She blushed and giggled a little before saying,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks boys!\" She then reached into the cylinder and pulled out the middle one. \"*giggles* I know this Pokemon is just right for me!\" Then, Kevin and I stared at each other wondering who should go next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, I think it's only fair that Kevin goes first since he came earlier and you made us wait,\" Sycamore suggested. I nodded in agreement and gave a forced smile. Oh man that's what I get for coming late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take this one!\" Kevin exclaimed as he grabbed the pokeball on the very right. \"We're gonna make it! And win the Pokemon League!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then that leaves me with\u2026\" I stopped what I was saying. I didn't know who was inside. I guess I'd have to find out. \"Alright, come on out!\" I threw the pokeball underarm and into the air, yet again doing my signature throw. The pokeball burst and a white and blue light flooded the area as the Pokemon was entering into the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light was fading and revealing a figure. Spikes? A Tail? What looked like a nut with legs? Oh, it's a- \"Chespinnn!\" the small Nut Pokemon screeched as he did a quick 360 degree spin before striking a battle pose. He looked serious; he looked like he wanted to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alight go Fennekin!\" Bree squealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Froakie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fenn,\" Bree's Fennekin yawned as the Fox Pokemon got up from its nap. She looked like she meant business; you wouldn't want to get on the wrong end of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kie!\" Froakie yelled as he jumped up into the air and punched it showing his 'strength'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Energetic Pokemon for some energetic trainers!\" Professor Sycamore chuckled. He then quickly stopped laughing and looked at his watch. \"Oops! I've got to go. I need to make it back to Lumiose City for my flight. I only have one hour. Luckily I have my Talon-\" the Professor stopped himself as he started to feel his pockets for his pokeball but to no prevail. \"OH NO! I forgot my Talonflame at the lab!\" Professor Sycamore hung his head low as he came to the realisation he would miss his flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry Professor! Use my brother's Staraptor!\" I offered him. He suddenly perked up. \"I have it right here with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Oh thank you Tyler! Won't your brother need it though?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just send it back to the lab through a pokeball transporter when you're at the airport. I'll tell him to get it from there,\" I told him. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wow, never did I expect my students to get me out of trouble this quick! Thank you Tyler!\" he bowed to me before starting to speak again. \"Well, I best get going!\" I chucked him the pokeball and Staraptor appeared. Within 10 seconds Professor Sycamore had told Staraptor where to go and they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice save Tyler,\" Kevin complimented me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was really cool of you to help the Professor out like that!\" Bree butted in. We stayed silent for a few seconds until Kevin piped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Tyler. Let's battle!\" Before I even could answer or think the battle had begun just like that. Froakie and Chespin had jumped into position and the battle was underway. \"Alright Froakie, use Quick Attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kie!\" Froakie spat as he quickly pounced at Chespin. Chespin didn't have time to avoid the speedy attack so was knocked back by the Frog Pokemon. Chespin quickly recuperated and stood up strong, more anxious to battle than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chespin, use Tackle!\" I ordered the tiny, little, nut-like Pokemon. Chespin nodded his head, understanding my orders and threw himself at Froakie with full force. Froakie was pushed back to his trainer's feet but just like Chespin, got back up with even more battle in him. \"Now, use Vine Whip and slap Froakie over and over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ches\u2014pin, pin, pin!\" Chespin screeched as he threw two long green vines out from behind him and started to slap Froakie relentlessly. Chespin wasn't stopping so Kevin needed to do something quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Froakie, spin and use Bubble!\" I looked at Kevin confused as to what his strategy was but when I saw it in action it all became clear. Froakie started to spin, making the vines unable to hit him anymore. But then a very vicious Bubble attack was added to that and piles of them came flying towards Chespin, hitting him over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use Rollout!\" I roared as I couldn't bear to see my Pokemon be hurt any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pin!\" Chespin called as he curled up into a ball and started to fiercely roll towards Froakie like a steam roller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aim your Bubble towards Chespin!\" Kevin retaliated. Froakie stopped spinning and directly aimed his Bubble attack towards Chespin, who just looked like a green ball while using Rollout. But, to no prevail, the Bubble attack didn't work and Chespin just smashed through all of them, before smashing into Froakie. Although Chespin wasn't done yet, he kept on rolling, gaining more and more momentum. \"Use Quick Attack on him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Froa!\" Froakie cried as he dashed as he was sent flying back towards the rolling ball of death; my Chespin. Silver and white light followed Froakie like a trail behind him as he slammed against Chespin. But, yet again, nothing. Instead of Chespin being hurt, Froakie was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will not lose! POUND!\" Kevin roared as the momentum inside him was growing too. I didn't feel that way. This battle for me wasn't like that; I was in enough danger to get energized like he was. I was just plain, boring me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, no matter how many more powerful attacks you use, they're no use. As you're getting more powerful, so is Chespin. You can't beat him with raw power. Strategy,\" I simply told Kevin. He sighed and looked helplessly as his Froakie's white fist that had started to shine. It's whole hand then fully engulfed in light and he came surging down towards my still spinning Chespin. BOOM! As the two collided there was quite a large explosion. I was surprised. It seems that Froakie had matched Chespin's power after all. Was it because of Kevin's energy? His belief that he can win? Who knows. But even still, as the smoke cleared it showed a panting Chespin and a fainted Froakie. I looked over to the trainer and he sighed before walking over to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good battle Tyler,\" he complimented me with a bow. He smiled at me but then as he stared at his pokeball, his smile turned to a frown. \"I guess we're not as powerful as I would've hoped to be. But, everyone has to start somewhere.\" He returned to a smile as we looked over at Bree who had her battle face on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any of you care to battle Fennekin and I?\" she questioned the two of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Bree, I'm all tuckered out after my battle,\" Kevin sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I'll go for another round! Chespin needs to be healed first though,\" I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already one step ahead of you,\" she giggled. She had a potion in her left hand and a berry in her other. She quickly got to work with healing up Chespin and in no time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PIN!\" Chespin roared as he soared into the sky, rolling and then landing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, he's ready to fight alright!\" I smirked. I looked over at Bree who was already walking over to where Kevin stood last time. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" she suddenly went from giggly Bree to battle Bree. \"Alright Fennekin, lets him them out of the park!\" Bree threw her pokeball into the air, and Fennekin quickly popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fen!\" Fennekin said as she spat a little ember. I pointed to the imaginary battlefield and Chespin ran forward. Although we had a type disadvantage we had Rollout, a Rock-Type attack. I am sure we can win this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChespin growled at Fennekin and she did likewise. \"Time to start with Rollout.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ches,\" Chespin grunted as he jumped into the air and started to roll, before surging forward towards Fennekin. He got faster and faster as he span and was gaining more power. Couple hits of this and Fennekin would be knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fennekin, dodge with Flame Charge and then charge into Chespin head on with Flame Charge!\" Bree craftily countered me. Fennekin nodded her small head and then stomped her paw against the ground, sending small embers around her body. Then, as the fox jumped into the air she fully engulfed herself in flames. Chespin stopped his attack as the Rollout was dodged but before he could counter, the speed buffed Fennekin came barrelling down towards him. Instantly, Chespin was sent flying back towards me and was in severe shape from just one hit. I gasped and stared towards the fierce team of Fennekin and Bree, wondering if I could beat them. The question was though was I going to be a real Pokemon trainer and fight for my victory\u2026?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chespin, let's try Vine Whip this time,\" I said calmly. I wasn't going to be a real trainer quite yet. It wasn't worth it at the current time. Chespin swung two long vines towards Fennekin, hoping to either slap her silly or wrap her in the malicious trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fennekin, use Ember!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kin!\" Fennekin quickly spat immediately upon hearing her trainers commands. Small embers swarmed around the vines and they quickly sizzled away. Soon they were just ash and Chespin was left with no attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now use Scratch!\" Bree commanded her Pokemon. She did it with force, passion; something I felt I lacked. Fennekin pounced forwards and swiped Chespin across the face, leaving claw marks. \"Finish with an Ember to the face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quickly dodge that!\" I retaliated. Emphasis was in my words that time, and Chespin knew it was because before I had even finished my sentence he had jumped over Fennekin and avoided the Ember. \"Now Tackle from behind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PIN!\" Chespin roared as he slammed his whole body up against Fennekin. She stumbled forward and almost fell over but stabilised her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Perfect\u2026\" I heard Bree mutter. Why would she want me to dodge and then hit her? I didn't understand. I did understand however when I saw Fennekin stamp her paw against the ground. Embers flew around the Fox Pokemon and she was getting ready to charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chespin get out of there!\" I called for my Pokemon. It was too late because BOOM! Fennekin slammed her body against Chespin and an explosion occurred, quickly sending a small cloud of smoke to cover the field. When the smoke had lifted Chespin had fainted and Fennekin stood over him prominently. I looked over at the powerful duo in awe; they were going to be tough to beat! I remembered about my small Pokemon and ran to his side. I picked him up. He was so small and cute; the little guy was tuckered out. \"You were great Chespin! Return.\" Chespin was beamed into the small device and I put it away into my pocket as Bree walked over towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great battle Tyler! Although it was a little too easy,\" she giggled with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thanks; I enjoyed it,\" I replied with a smirk in return. The three of us awkwardly stood there for about ten seconds, unsure of what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys remember what the Professor said about travelling together? Helping each other out? I'm sure we could all help each other out by getting through Santalune Forest together!\" Kevin suggested. Bree immediately smiled and agreed. I thought about it for a short time but then obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds great Kevin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Well, how about we leave now?\" Bree asked the two of us. \"Ooo! Then we'll get to have our first night out in the woods together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I know a lot of star constellations so I can point them out to you guys,\" Kevin offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose now's as good of a time to leave as any,\" I told the two other 13 year olds. They nodded and we started to work into the Santalune Forest, together, as a group. Funny thing was I'd only met these people about half an hour ago and they already seem so comfortable around each other and me. I don't really know anything about these guys. But I guess this'll be my chance to do just that. I better watch out for Bree though; she's a fierce battler! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright Fennekin finish this with Flame Charge!\" Bree commanded the small fox Pokemon. Fennekin drenched herself in fire before charging forwards and knocking over the Spewpa. Fire scorched Spewpa and it quickly fainted after only two hits. Fennekin had majorly levelled up since our battle yesterday. It was already strong enough before but now she was over powered. \"Alright, go pokeball!\" Bree threw the small device at the fainted Spewpa and it hit her on the head. The pokeball wobbled a few times until a delightful PING sound was made. \"Yes! I caught a Spewpa!\" Bree's face was filled with delight. This was her first caught Pokemon, so she was really excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congrats Bree!\" Kevin told the early-teen. He had already caught himself a Bunnelby so I was the only person who hadn't caught a Pokemon out of the group. \"You need to catch up!\" he pointed at me with a wide smirk on his face. I smiled and nodded back to him. A funny thing then happened. I didn't know whether it was a coincidence or if it was fate. The flock of Fletchinder and Fletchling that had injured Staraptor were now causing a ruckus in the sky. They were fighting with a flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ge-otto!\" all of the Pidgeotto screeched as they flapped their wings and created a massive Gust that started to knock the native Kalos Pokemon back. All of the Fletchling were knocked back by the vicious wind but the Fletchinder kept their position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fletch!\" the Fletchinder all then spat out a fiery Ember attack but combined, it created a massive blazing ball. The fire ball slammed into the other flock and they all were knocked into the trees. The Fletchling joined the Fletchinder in the sky and they all seemed to have a devilish look on their faces and they looked down upon their prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do those birds think they are? Why do they just go and attack everything they see?!\" I asked with gusto in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler why are you getting so worked up over this?\" Bree questioned me with a hint of worry in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These birds hurt Staraptor. Now they go and attack a wild flock of Pidgey and Pidgeotto. They need to learn how to respect others!\" I looked down at the pokeball that I felt in my hand. I didn't know how it got there but I felt as if my hand was telling me to battle these birds and teach them a lesson. \"Chespin, show time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pin!\" my Pokemon cried as he burst out of the small spherical device. I could feel myself getting worked up and I no longer felt apart of nature in this forest, all I felt was strength. I was strength. I am strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chespin, Vine Whip!\" I commanded it. Chespin quickly threw two vines at the birds who had surely noticed we were here now that Chespin was out and attacking them. The Fletchinder were quick and avoided the attack with ease but the Fletchling started to get slapped silly by the attack. \"And now Tackle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ches!\" Chespin screeched as he whooshed into the sky and went head on towards the Fletchling who were still dazed from the previous attack. But Chespin didn't even reach them because two Fletchinder swooped down from the sky and slammed into Chespin with a double Flame Charge attack! \"PINN!\" Chespin fell from the sky and went straight into the ground, leaving a small indent into the rock hard earth. I gasped and looked up at the powerful birds who stared down at us with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bree, let's help out!\" Kevin told the young blonde girl. She nodded and got out her pokeball as Kevin did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fennekin/Froakie, go!\" the two yelled at the same time. I stared over at the latter of the two. You could tell they were strong, just by their energy and the way that they'd so willingly stand up for me. Why don't I have that. I want it, but yet still lack it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kinnn,\" Fennekin said while she rolled her head around. She then stopped and put one paw forward, a fearful expression crossing her face; she was ready to battle. Froakie did the same but came out of his pokeball with a bit more energy and cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kie!\" he roared towards the birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Ember/Bubble!\" Fennekin and Froakie both reared backwards and then fired their respective special attacks. Both of them hit the flock of native Kalos Pokemon, of course Froakie's doing more damage as it was super-effective. I watched them all, two trainers, two Pokemon, fighting a fight I should be fighting alone. It had nothing to do with anyone here but me. But that's what friends are for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chespin, get up and use Rollout on all of those birds!\" I shouted out. Chespin got up and nodded before curling up into a ball and charging forward at breakneck pace. Chespin steam rolled through all of them, shooting them out of the sky. Not for long though, the birds quickly flew back up and all started to spray a hot Ember out, injuring Chespin and stopping his Rollout attack. Chespin fell to the ground with swirls for his eyes and I sat there helplessly and had to leave it to my friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys, now you're the only ones who can battle. I got you into a bad situation that you shouldn't even be involved in\u2026\" I muttered with a guilty tone. I sat there sad faced and continued to watch the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Froakie, use Quick Attack!\" Kevin ordered without any regards to my comment but a smile. Froakie zipped forward but was countered by a quick Fletchling who also used Quick Attack. Although that little bird was no match for Froakie and so was sent flying back into the ground. Froakie then proceeded to smash through the flock and deal some serious damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Fennekin, use Flame Charge!\" Bree then added to the mix and got her Fennekin to charge towards them too. They were really taking this head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kin!\" Fennekin screeched as she drenched herself in a gorgeous fiery coat before charging up at the Fletchinder, who was unsurprisingly, also using Flame Charge. They collided and little embers started to fly everywhere. No Pokemon was backing down but in the end it was a draw and both Pokemon were sent flying back. I watched this cold war and couldn't help but feel like this wasn't the right thing to do. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Guys stop!\" I commanded my two friends. All of the Pokemon and my two friends looked my way. All of them looks vicious and ready to attack. Yep, even the humans looked like they wanted to pounce on me. \"Look, I was trying to teach them a lesson about not being mean to others but now, we're being mean to them! I know the whole 'have a taste of your own medicine' but I don't like that, and I've gotten all worked up over nothing. This is why I don't get worked up, this is why I don't get motivated because I always do something I'm not supposed to, something that doesn't go by my morals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tyler, that's what happens to everyone. They get energetic and worked up and they go crazy, but in a good way. You got crazy for a good cause, you did it because they hurt your brother's Staraptor. You're no different from anyone else,\" Bree assured me. Huh, I'm not different eh? Truth is, I actually like being different. Whatever, now there's a big scene for nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Birds, we're sorry for causing you any hurt or pain. Please, go home but just don't be mean to everything or everyone you see. Otherwise soon you'll have no friends. Not even each other,\" I warned them. \"So again, sorry for the troubles, and we'd kindly like you to leave.\" The birds squawked and squabbled among themselves for a few seconds until a few of the Fletchinder pointed their wings in the opposite direction of us and, they were off. \"Talk about a long walk for a short drink of water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok Tyler?\" Kevin asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fi-INE!\" I screamed as I suddenly felt a peck on my foot. \"Ouch!\" I looked down to see a Fletchling who was persistently pecking my foot. \"Hey, that's not nice!\" Fletchling didn't care and kept trying to peck at it, while I was craftily avoiding it. I looked up at the sky and could no longer see the flock. \"Um, you little brat, your friends are gone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fletch?\" Fletchling questioned as it looked around but then seemed unfazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I guess you'd become so mean already that you weren't even friends with them\u2026\" I muttered. Fletchling seemed angered by the remark and flew up into my face and pecked me on the nose a few times. \"Ouch! No wonder you have no friends.\" I couldn't believe I just said that aloud. I'm usually not mean to others in this way, especially not to Pokemon. However, he did peck my foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ling!\" Fletchling cried and pointed at me before walking back a little, then squawking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it wants to battle Tyler,\" Kevin suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need Chespin healed then!\" Bree quickly ran over and 'potioned' my Chespin, making him awaken and feel all better again. She ran away with a smile. I looked over at Fletchling and it seemed to be as worked up as ever. \"Alright, battle begin!\" Before I could even call a command Fletchling was already attacking with a speedy Quick Attack right off the back. Chespin had no time to avoid the attack so Fletchling landed a clean hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chespin, use Vine Whip!\" Chespin sent out two green vines and they surged towards Fletchling. As Fletchling flew up to get away, so did the vines, chasing the bird through the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ling!\" Fletchling cried as it started to spin and speed up, using some crafty skills to avoid the Vine Whip. Quickly after that, Fletchling straightened out and started to dive directly towards Chespin, wind currents flying from around its body. It was an Aerial Ace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chespin try to dodge!\" I encouraged my Pokemon. Chespin jumped into the air but Fletchling immediately changed its flight course and slammed into Chespin, sending him high into the air. Fletchling stopped the Aerial Ace but its beak grew; it was a Peck attack. If Fletchling landed this Peck then it would be all over for Chespin and I. Fletchling grew ever closer to Chespin and I was frantically thinking of what to do. \"I got it! Chespin, use Rollout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pin!\" Chespin said with a sigh of relief. He then started to frantically roll until all you could see was a spinning green ball. Fletchling tried to bash Chespin hard enough to stop the attack but instead, was rebounded off of him. Chespin then dove down and pressed his spinning body up against Fletchling, dealing even more damage. Fletchling smashed into the ground and struggled to get up. Although before she could fully get up and fly away Chespin came in for another round of Rollout and knocked its brains out. Fletchling collapsed onto the ground, knocked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, this seems like the perfect time\u2026\" I muttered to myself. I looked down, anticipating the moment. The moment I'd remember for the rest of my life. \"Go, pokeball!\" I threw the empty pokeball towards the small bird. Everything seemed to slow down as I watched the pokeball soar through the air. I could hear music playing in my head, victorious music. The pokeball grew ever closer to it until, suddenly the world came back into normal speed as Fletchling was hit on the head with the pokeball. One shake, two shakes, three shakes\u2026! PING! I stood there for a few seconds, not believing I actually caught a Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did it, I caught\u2026 A Fletchling!\" I roared as loud as I could. I ran over and grabbed the pokeball and proudly thrusted my hand into the air. A toothy grin covered my face as I had just caught my first Pokemon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work Tyler!\" Bree cheered as she came over to admire the Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were a little late, but you finally caught up to me eh?\" Kevin chuckled. I smiled over towards the two and then towards Chespin. Yes! Now I'm definitely winning my Gym Battle against Viola! </span></div></div>",

Then spheres of light began to disperse from the lifeless statue-corpses of the fallen Bakugan that were condemned to this dimension. They all came together and formed a large purple and black energy sphere, which then took form and flew up into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, on Earth\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the park, all was calm\u2026ish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I wasn't making fun of you guys\" Conner insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Admit it punk. You were making fun of the way I battle. Right Akira\" Shuji asked, turning to the short redhead next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I heard. What's your problem kid\" Akira asked, turning to Conner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner was a 13 year-old-boy who had black, uncombed but not overly-messy hair. He had tan skin, and red eyes. He was wearing a dark purple shirt, with a black leather jacket, black chaps, black and white sneakers, and gloves that resembled Shun's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor those of you who have the game Bakugan battle Brawlers, here is the type of clothes that my character was customized with if you want more of a picture in your head:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair-Untidy<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHat-none<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlasses-none<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShirt-Leather Jacket<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPants-Chaps<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGloves-Shun's Gloves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoes-Sneakers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just like Bakugan\" Conner explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well so do I and now I'm gonna show you how it's played\" Shuji said, cradling his fist in his other hand (I think that's the proper term).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026but I'm new at Bakugan. I don't even know all the rules yet\" Conner admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're about to learn\u2026the hard way\" Shuji said, with a smirk and his arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teach him a lesson Shuji\" Akira cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back off Shuji\" a voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Shuji asked. All three turned to the owner of the new voice. They all immediately recognized him as\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan? This is none of your business. Get lost\" Shuji warned. Dan however, blew it off and did his signature nose swipe\u2026thing\u2026yeah I have no idea what he does. Maybe he has an itch\u2026or just wipes his nose a lot\u2026anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid\" Dan said, turning to Conner \"What's going on\" Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa Dan from the Bakugan Brawlers, You're all over the net\" Conner exclaimed, smiling with respect and admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you need any help\" Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you serious? That would be AWESOME\" Conner said, still with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I'll show you some of my old tricks and if you're lucky\u2026I won't even charge you\" Dan said, with a smirk on his face as the four male brawlers opened the field with their cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Bakugan being a very popular game, people were always trying to improve on the variables, including custom field cards. Now they don't know how they did it, but somehow, people were able to modify field cards. The ones they were using now were standard issue arena cards that instead of a plain dimension, there was a battle field arena. The players would be able to roll their Bakugan on a gigantic board. Every brawler can have access to one just by purchasing them from a Bakugan store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe players stood on opposite ends, Shuji and Akira on one end, and Dan with Conner on the other. Akira was there just to watch Shuji, while Dan was giving Conner tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So right now you have all that you need: a bunch of ability cards, three Bakugan, and three gate cards. Now all you need to learn is how to use them. In order to win, you must defeat all your opponents Bakugan. First, take one of your gate cards and throw it on the battle field. Try starting with a card that is good for any of your Bakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, then let's start with this one\" Conner said, throwing down a card after saying \"Gate card set\". Shuji did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go first kid. I will win anyway so it doesn't matter\" Shuji said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shuji uses Subterra Bakugan. So keep that in mind, and throw one of your Bakugan\" Dan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok let's do this, Bakugan Brawl!\" Conner shouted, throwing his Serpenoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serpenoid stand\" Conned said as soon as the Bakugan landed on its owner's card. The black snake enlarged to its true form and hissed at Shuji. Shuji checked his BakuPod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Serpenoid enters the field at 150gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, what a joke, I can crush your puny snake. Bakugan Brawl\" Shuji said as he threw a brown Bakugan onto the same card as Serpenoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juggernoid stand!\" Shuji shouted. A brown turtle then appear on the card and let out a roar. Conner checked his BakuPod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Juggernoid starts the battle at 170gs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, his Bakugan is stronger than mine\" Conner panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry; remember that he landed on your gate card. So how about you open it up and turn this battle around\" Dan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, gate card open, Darkus!\" Conner shouted. The gate card then opened up, making a purple aura appear around Serpenoid, causing it to hiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Serpenoid power level being raised by 80gs. New power level is 230gs, Serpenoid takes the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, but take this! Ability card activate: Earth Slap!\" Shuji shouted, using one of his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Juggernoid power increased by 100gs. Juggernoid now leads at 270gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you use an ability card before Juggernoid attacks\" Dan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha, Ability card activate: Shadow Bind!\" Conner shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hiss Serpenoid leapt at Juggernoid, wrapping around the turtle's body, causing it to yell out in pain before disappearing back into its ball form. With a victory hiss Serpenoid returned to its ball form and flew back to Conner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Rock!\" Dan encouraged, patting Conner on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but it isn't over yet\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how did you do that\" Shuji asked, picking up his Juggernoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you check your BakuPod\" Conner asked, which Shuji did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Ability: Shadow Bind allowed Serpenoid to nullify ability: Earth Slap, returning Juggernoid's power level to normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate card set! Bakugan Brawl!\" Conner said throwing out another card, followed by a Bakugan being thrown at the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saurus stand!\" The black dinosaur appeared on the card and let out a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two can play it that game. Bakugan Brawl! Saurus stand.\" Shuji shouted, throwing another Saurus on the card, making a Subterra duplicate of the Bakugan appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Both Saurus are tied at 180gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get ready for this, Ability card activate: Rapid Subterra!\" Shuji shouted, the second Bakugan in his hand glowing as it flew towards the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrorclaw stand!\" The armed killer crab emerged and let out its war cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Terrorclaw enters at 270gs. Combined power with Saurus is 450gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like my best combo kid\" Shuji taunted with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do? He has got 2 Bakugan against my Saurus\" Conner panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your gate card, it may help\" Dan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Gate card open!\" Conner shouted. The card opened and Shuji's Bakugan were covered in lightning, and then they both turned back into ball form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joker's Wild!? Where did you get such a powerful card\" Dan asked, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the first card I got. Since it lets Darkus Bakugan automatically win battles, I felt that Darkus was the right attribute for me\" Conner explained. After that, the field faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How\u2026how did you beat my brother\" Akira asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't finished kid, just wait until the tournament\" Shuji said before laughing and then adding \"You'll be sorry\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuji and Akira left, but not before Conner and Dan heard Shuji say to his brother \"And he didn't beat me Akira, I...I let him win\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job, you rocked. A little more practice and who knows, you may become the newest battle brawler. We could always use another\" Dan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be awesome\u2026but, I'm just a beginner. To become a Brawler I need a wicked Bakugan, something like Drago\" Conner said, looking at the Bakugan sitting on Dan's shoulder, which was a Pyrus Dragonoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I see what you mean. It's real important to have a tight relationship with your Bakugan\" Dan said, looking at his Guardian Bakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, thanks Dan\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta roll (heh, like a Bakugan), catch you later buddy, and good luck\" Dan said, patting Conner on the back before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner took a look at his field card and his Serpenoid which were both in a separate hand. He then smiled, and decided to head back home. </span></div></div>",

It was a Darkus Ravenoid, one of his favorite Bakugan and according to the online records, is very rare to be found in the Darkus attribute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Bakugan is so cool! I want one just like this...\" Conner said, not taking his eyes off of it. Then a girl with orange hair came up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, can I help you\" the girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Alice\" Conner exclaimed, recognising the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know me\" Alice asked, surprised that this boy knew her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026well, not really, but I've see you online with the other Battle Brawlers\" Conner answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really love Bakugan, don't you? I see you looking almost every day\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you work here\" Conner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the past week yes. But, today is my last day here. Tomorrow I start working at a restaurant that my friend's family owns\" Alice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's why I didn't see you when I bought my first three Bakugan\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any more\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No just these three. Actually, I had my first battle yesterday\" Conner admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, did you win\" Alice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thanks to the help of Dan's coaching\" Conner said, proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you are new at brawling, have only three Bakugan, and are friends with Dan, I will let you take that Ravenoid for free\" Alice said, taking the Ravenoid from the shelf and handing it to Conner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks so much! I will be sure to test it out at the park\" Conner said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck and I hope we can talk to each other again\" Alice said waving to Conner as he left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the park\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner had made his way over by the fountain, but he still couldn't find anyone to battle. How could he get any practice if there was no one to practice with? Conner was starting to think he may never be able to compete on Dan's level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be battle brawler\u2026someday\" Conner said to himself in order to cheer up. Somehow it worked and he decided to smile and continue searching for opponent. Then a bright light blinded him after it enveloped the area. He then heard something small hit the ground. After the light cleared, Conner looked down, and saw a black and purple Bakugan in its sphere mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? A\u2026a Bakugan\" Conner said, picking it up from the ground to examine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I've never seen one like this before\" Conner said, holding his hand in front of him. Then the Bakugan popped open, even though it wasn't on a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I\" it asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh\u2026planet Earth\" Conner answered the Bakugan. He was surprised that it too, like Drago and the other Brawlers' Bakugan, could talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in Vestroia then\" it said, looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who\u2026who are you\" Conner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Darkus Leonidas\" it said, looking up at Conner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you wanna partner with me? I bet we could beat anyone\" Conner said, with a hopeful smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I battle with you, I'll have the chance to defeat other Bakugan\" Leonidas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we'll beat em all\" Conner explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I sense that in this world I will only release my true power in these Bakugan battles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a yes\u2026Awesome!

The bird fell to the ground after being hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battlefield was enveloped in a bright light before closing, returning Conner and Leonidas to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang dude, I really thought I could beat your dragon that time\" the other boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the battle, you did well\" Conner replied, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you too, see ya\" the other boy said as he walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner started walking home too, but while he was walking, Leonidas flew out of Conner's pocket and onto his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you say that your opponent did well? He didn't even win a single round\" Leonidas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be fair, I did use you every round\" Conner pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless, you were nice to your enemy. In battle, one should never let their guard down\" Leonidas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a game Leonidas\" Conner explained, as he stopped walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Conner, it's combat. What do you think I do whenever you roll me on a card? I defeat my opponent until he falls. How could such a situation be a game?\" Leonidas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Leonidas, we had fun. The battles we fight are without a serious purpose. We do it for the sake of fun\" Conner explained, as he started to walk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Conner, it looks like we just have different views on what we do\" Leonidas concluded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Conner to just roll his eyes. Within a few minutes, he made his way home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home mom\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, supper will be ready in a few minute. So please go wash up\" Conner's mom ordered. So Conner went to the bathroom, and again, Leonidas flew out of Conner's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, why do you let her order you arou-\" Leonidas was cut off as Conner shoved him back into his pocket. Clearly, Leonidas could not be taught the concept of 'parents'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-After supper-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner was on his computer, checking his Bakugan Brawler ranking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"978, awesome I'm in the triple digits now!\" Conner exclaimed in excitement. However, this only irritated Leonidas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only 978? But, I have never been bested in battle before! Why aren't we number one\" Leonidas angrily asked, standing on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner scratched his head \"Well, I'm still new to brawling and there are thousands of kids who play Bakugan. In order to make it to number one we are gonna need to win a lot more battles\" Conner explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, then I will defeat every Bakugan on earth until we make it to the top\" Leonidas vowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner just shook his head and smiled, seeing that the only thing Leonidas understood was battling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a chat screen popped up with Dan's face on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Conner, how's it going\" Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! It's Dan! I mean\u2026er\u2026I'm good. How's it going with the brawlers\" Conner asked, dialing back the fan boy attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we defeated the top ranked brawlers that fell under Masquerade's control and we also met web master Joe. Oh yeah, and Drago evolved\" Dan said, pointing to the Delta Dragonoid beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, but uh\u2026as awesome as it is to hear from you, why did you decide to contact me\" Conner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when we got back from the hospital, I heard from some Bakugan players that you are getting really good and you're ranking has really improved\" Dan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it's all thanks to Leonidas, my Bakugan partner\" Conner gestured to the Bakugan sitting on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, never seen a Bakugan like that before. He's Darkus too, we could use a Darkus Bakugan with a skilled Darkus brawler. I got it! Conner, would you like to become a Bakugan Battle Brawler\" Dan said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"REALLY! THAT'D BE AWESOME\" Conner shouted with enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but on one condition: you battle me in the park tomorrow so I can see if you really have enough skills to be able to protect the infinity core. What we do is really dangerous\" Dan warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner then turned to Leonidas, who gave his consent with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand Dan, and I would be honoured to take the test\" Conner told him. Leonidas just rolled his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we'll meet in the park tomorrow. Smell you later\" Dan said before closing the chat window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Leonidas, it looks like we're about to join the best of the best\" Conner said, holding Leonidas in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already are the best of the best. In fact, these 'brawlers' should be joining us in our conquest for glory and destruction of our enemies\" Leonidas proclaimed proudly. This caused Conner to look at Leonidas strangely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean\u2026strive to become formidable opponents, make friends and all that crap\" Leonidas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Leonidas, if anything these guys will help us become stronger\" Conner said. This caused Leonidas' eyes to gleam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, we shall become Brawlers so our power will grow\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-The next day-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner came to the park and found Dan, as well as Marucho and Runo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, I didn't know you two would be here too!\" Conner said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well too bad kid because if you want to get in the battle brawlers, you need to beat all 3 of us, starting with me!\" Runo said with a confident smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse her rudeness. It's nice to meet you Conner, I'm Marucho\" Marucho said bowing. Conner bowed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who are you calling rude\" Runo asked, making Marucho do one of those comical sweat drop things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just a little cranky because she hasn't won a battle in a while. But don't underestimate her. She's not as tough as me, but make her mad and she'll bite your head off\" Dan laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh! Let's just start this battle already\" Runo said, taking her field card out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Field open\" Runo and Conner shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike usual, the field around them changed into the battlefield, not a gigantic board this time, just the regular battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate card set\" they both shouted, tossing the gate cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Throw me in Conner, I will defeat them all\" Leonidas said, as he let off a black and purple glow inside Conner's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wait, not yet. Not until our battle with Dan\" Conner said, throwing out a different Bakugan and shouting \"Bakugan Brawl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serpenoid, stand!\" The black serpent emerged and let out a hiss as it landed on Conner's card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, but I can do better\" Runo said before throwing out her Saurus, who let out a roar when it landed on the gate card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, but you are still going down, ability card activate, Venomous Fang!\" Conner said. Serpenoid then leaped at Saurus and bit its arm. Saurus roared in pain, but quickly retaliated by slamming the serpent with its fist. With a glow and a hiss, Serpenoid returned to its sphere form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do a whole lot better than that to beat me, newbie\" Runo said with a smile, catching her Saurus as it returned to her. That small victory suddenly put Runo in a better mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist\" Conner said as he picked up his Serpenoid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't even put up much of a fight. Are you sure that this guy is Brawler material\" Marucho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the moment, but the battle isn't over yet\" Dan said, also having a bit of doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet it ain't, Gate card set, Bakugan Brawl, Ravenoid stand!\" Conner shouted as he threw out his second gate card before he threw his Darkus Ravenoid onto Runo's card. The black and purple bird let out its avian war cry, before crossing its arms, waiting for an opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakugan Brawl\" Runo shouted as she threw then threw out her Griffon onto her card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Haos Griffon enters the battle at 250gs, opposing Darkus Ravenoid's 315gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate card open! Triple battle\" Runo said as the gate card glowed and Runo threw out her Saurus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Saurus enters the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaurus ran towards Ravenoid, charging fist-first. Ravenoid just flew past Saurus and hit it with its claws. Then Ravenoid sprung at Griffon, using both its claws to scratch at Griffon. Both Haos Bakugan then returned to sphere form defeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Impossible, how did your 1 Bakugan beat my 2\" Runo asked, her smile turning into a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check your BakuPod history\" Conner said. Runo did as Conner suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Saurus power level at 0gs, Griffon at 250gs, combined power level reaches 250gs. Ravenoid out powers opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did my Saurus only have 0gs\" Runo asked, angry and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serpenoid's previous attack only looks like it didn't do anything. In truth, Venomous Fang renders the opponent's Bakugan with 0gs when it's used again\" Conner explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So even though Serpenoid lost, its defeat lead to defeating two of Runo's Bakugan at once\" Marucho said, surprised and impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew this guy was good\" Dan said, his faith once again restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not over yet, Gate card set, Bakugan Brawl, Ravenoid Stand!\" Conner said before throwing out his last Gate card and then rolling Ravenoid on top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, well you can't beat Tigrerra\" Runo said before throwing her last Bakugan on Conner's other, empty gate card. Tigrerra let out a roar as she entered the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you down Runo\" Tigrerra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay kid, time to show us your last Bakugan\" Runo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I don't have to, ability card activate, Shadow Soar!\" Ravenoid then made its body intangible and then dove into the card, and then appeared on the card Tigrerra stood on.</span></div></div>",

To be fair, I have analysed your Brawler strategy extensively. I did this not only so I could find a way to beat you, but also because you're a very powerful Haos brawler\" Conner explained. Runo then went from sad and looking at the ground, to happy and having a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So not only were the odds in your favor, but you also view me as a powerful battler. This changes everything!\" Runo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, you still lost\" Dan said before laughing. But it was Runo who had the last laugh, as she shut him up by delivering a powerful kick to his stomach. This spark ignited a flame of Dan and Runo getting into another petty argument, which caused Conner and Marucho to sweat drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we battle since Dan and Runo are busy\" Conner suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, that sounds like a fun way to pass the time while they're preoccupied\" Marucho said as the two activated their field cards, opening the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate card, set!\" both boys shouted as they threw down their gate cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Conner, can you use me now?\" Leonidas asked, still in Conner's pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not until we fight Dan\" Conner said, afterwards shouting \"Bakugan brawl\" and throwing out Ravenoid onto Marucho's card. The bird let out a squawk as it assumed its true form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me in there coach! I can take him! I can take him!\" Preyas said, hopping on Marucho's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But shouldn't I save the best for last\" Marucho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard how he beat Runo, Conner probably studied what we do so let's do what we don't, and amidst chaos, I will emerge victorious\" Preyas said with a glimmer in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Bakugan Brawl! Preyas stand!\" Marucho shouted after he used his launcher to shoot out Preyas onto his own card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the blue corner we have the reptilian river rumbler, the blue Bakugan battler, the all-star of awesome! Preyas!\" Preyas announced as he entered the battlefield, somehow holding a microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Preyas enters the battle at 340gs, opposing Ravenoid's 315gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ability card activate, Shadow Drag\" Conner commanded. Ravenoid then went up to Preyas and grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHH! MARUCHO HE'S GONNA EAT ME!\" Preyas screamed. But Ravenoid simply dragged Preyas into the gate card, phasing through it and emerging from Conner's gate card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate card open, Jokers Wild!\" Conner shouted as the gate card began to glow and open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Preyas switch attributes quickly!\" Marucho ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Attribute Change, Subterra! How do you like me now?\" Preyas said as he turned orange and brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit fooling around Preyas, change to your Darkus attribute\" Marucho shouted. Preyas then switched into the Darkus attribute, just as the card opened. Pink lightning began to strike the field, but both Bakugan remained unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, I bet you forgot that I could change attributes\" Preyas said, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually no, and I also didn't forget that you don't have any Darkus ability cards you can use against Ravenoid\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but good sir, I have the, diplomatic immunity!...I also have a higher power level\" Preyas boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for long. Ability card activate, Shadow Wing!\" Ravenoid's wings began to glow a purple/black shade and then Ravenoid went flying at Preyas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Power level increase of 100gs. Ravenoid power level, 415gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreyas began to scream and run for his life, but he didn't get too far, as Ravenoid hit Preyas with its wings, sending the Chameleon back to Marucho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preyas!\" Marucho shouted before running to go pick up Preyas. Once Marucho brought his hands up to his face, Preyas' sphere form popped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Marucho, but the early bird gets the Preyas\" Preyas said, disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Preyas, you were fighting a very formidable opponent\" Marucho said, trying to cheer him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Marucho, you want to keep going?\" Conner asked, but Marucho just shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you beat my best Bakugan, I surrender the battle to you\" Marucho said, before the field disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Dan, you done fighting ye- oh, right\" Conner and Marucho forgot that when you open the battlefield, you stop time, so Dan and Runo were still fighting. </span></div></div>",

We decided to go to Marucho's house to hang out. Please meet us there when you're done-Marucho &amp; Conner : ).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Later at Marucho's house-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we use a jet to travel around the world\" Marucho said, sitting at the dining table and eating supper at Marucho's house, which Conner loved. It was huge, awesome, and even the bathroom was ginormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so cool, oh, and thanks Mr. Kato\" Conner said, thanking the old, friendly butler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime, Master Conner, and you may call me Kato. It is much easier\" Kato said, about to take Conner's plate away until Conner stopped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let me take my plate\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure Master Conner\" Kato asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you can call me Conner if you want. It's much easier\" Conner said, laughing and taking his plate through a door that lead to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems you have found a very kind and humble friend, Master Marucho\" Kato said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he is also a very powerful brawler, he beat both me and Runo\" Marucho said. At that moment, Dan and Runo ran in (Combine Dan and Runo's names and what do you get, Ran!...I'm smart).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marucho how could you\u2026eat without us? How long were we fighting\" Dan asked, changing his words mid-sentence when he noticed the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour. Conner and I have already battled and he beat Preyas with his Ravenoid. Dan, didn't you say that Conner had a partner Bakugan\" Marucho asked. Dan nodded before replying, \"Yeah, he said his name is Leonidas, but I have never heard of him before\". At this moment, Conner came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dan and Runo\" Conner greeted with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you ready to battle?\" Dan asked.</span></div></div>",

Conner had used his Ravenoid while Dan used his Mantris with the battle ending in a draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakugan Brawl, Griffon stand!\" Dan shouted, throwing out Griffon, who roared once he emerged and face the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Griffon enters at 370gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, but's it's my turn, Bakugan Brawl, Darkus Siege Stand\" Conner shouted, throwing out his Siege onto Dan's card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Siege enters at 370gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate card open, Fire Storm!\" Dan shouted. The gate card let out a stream of flames which encircled the battlefield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Power level increase of 100gs, Griffon takes the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ability card activate, Siege Smash\" Conner shouted. Siege, drew back its fist, before punching the gate card, causing it to shatter. Fire around the gate card then vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Power levels are balanced<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one, but I'm not done yet.

Ability card activate, Wing burst!\" Griffon's wings then began to glow, sucking out energy streams from Siege.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Siege power level decrease of 50gs. Griffon power level increase of 50gs. Siege at 320gs. Griffon at 420gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ability card activate, Dark Blade!\" Conner shouted, his card glowing a bright purple colour. Siege's weapon began to glow dark purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Siege power level increase to 520gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"520gs!\" Runo and Marucho shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ability card activate, Burning Lion!\" Dan shouted, his Griffon enveloping itself with flames as it roared and charged at Siege. Siege ran towards Griffon with a war cry of its own. Once the two clashed with each other they both returned to their sphere forms with a red and purple glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Battle ended in a draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing! Both of their 2 battles ended in a draw. Now Dan only has Drago left to use\" Marucho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Marucho, do you think it's possible that Conner might beat Dan? You know, since Conner researched how we all battle\" Runo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Conner doesn't seem to be deploying any special tactics against Dan. Instead, Conner seems to be meeting Dan's aggressive battle style with force and determination. Now the two only are allowed to use one more Bakugan, so maybe now we'll finally see what Leonidas looks like\" Marucho replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we don't know how strong Leonidas really is. Won't that put Dan at a disadvantage?\" Runo asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but since Delta Dragonoid is an evolved Bakugan Conner won't know what to expect either, and Drago's evolution should easily make him stronger Leonidas\" Marucho explained after crossing his arms in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Drago, it's time\" Dan said, looking at the Bakugan on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready Dan, now let's do this!\" Drago said, curling up into his sphere mode. Dan grabbed him and then threw him onto Conner's gate card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakugan Brawl! Drago stand!\" Dan shouted. Once the sphere transformed, Drago let out a loud roar and flew up into the sky before landing on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it time?\" Leonidas asked. Conner couldn't answer because he was currently munching on a granola bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conner!\" Leonidas shouted, flying out of Conner's pocket and landing on his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Jwst\u2026waet\u2026a\u2026manate *Gulp*. Okay, let's do this!\" Conner shouted, grabbing Leonidas. (Sorry for putting you through the bad spelling that comes from talking while eating).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bakugan Brawl, Leonidas stand!\" Conner yelled as he threw out his Guardian Bakugan. As Leonidas was heading towards the gate card, black clouds began to fill the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Drago?\" Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Dan. I sense great power that I've never felt before\" Drago replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonidas rolled onto the gate card and his sphere mode transformed into its active mode. As soon as he did this, his toy-like body started to crackle with purple lightning. Suddenly, a purple lightning bolt surged from Leonidas' miniature form and made contact with the clouds. And from the clouds came a much bigger bolt that after making contact with the gate card, revealed Leonidas' true form. He had three horns, two over his ears and one in the middle of his muzzle, all were purple. He had three purple toes on each foot and three fingers on each hand (also purple). His tail was long and ended in a purple arrow. He also had three stripes on his shins. The rest of his skin was black. Leonidas then looked towards Drago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's finally time, no more holding back\" Leonidas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful Dan, he's different than any of Conner's other Bakugan\" Drago warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Where'd you get this guy Conner? Conner?\" Dan looked at Conner but he was very distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be AWESOME! Finally, no more holding back\" Conner said in pure happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever seen a Bakugan like this Tigrerra?\" Runo asked, turning to the white tiger Bakugan sitting on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never, he bares resemblance to Drago, yet he's entirely different\" Tigrerra said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check this out! According to my BakuPod, Conner is the only one who possesses a Bakugan like that!\" Marucho exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he is one of a kind. But that's MY thing Marucho. He's stealing my shtick\" Preyas whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Leonidas enters the battle at 340gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this started Drago! Ability card activate, Fire Tornado!\" Dan said, the card in his hand shining red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: 100gs transferred from Leonidas to Drago. Drago dominates at 550gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago flew up high and flapped his wings, causing a fiery tornado to appear and speed towards Leonidas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't let you do that Dan! Ability card activate, Beta Barrier!\" Leonidas held his hands in front of him and created a purple energy shield around him. The tornado hit the shield but the attack dissipated afterwards, Leonidas and his shield still standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened? Did he nullify my ability? Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Drago at 550gs, Leonidas at 240gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their power levels weren't manipulated, so why didn't Drago win?\" Marucho asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be that shield that he put up\" Tigrerra suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dan, try knocking out his shield!\" Runo shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ability card activate, Wall Burst!\" Drago flew close to Leonidas and fired a fire blast from his mouth, but Leonidas' shield did not falter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Leonidas' power level decreased by 100gs. Leonidas power level at 140gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it now Conner!\" Leonidas shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On it, fusion ability activate, Eta Explosion!\" Leonidas than charged energy throughout his shield until it glowed brightly and soon after it was destroyed, but not before letting loose an explosion of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Power level increase of 200gs. Leonidas power level returned to base level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gate card open!\" As soon as the card opened Leonidas let out a loud roar and began let off a pink glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Leonidas gains 200gs. Current power level is 540gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice one kid, but I'm not down for the count yet! Ability card activate, D Strike attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, ability card activate, Alpha Blaster!\" Conner shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Drago and Leonidas power levels increased by 200gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragons flew up into the air before blasting each other with energy and fire. The blasts came from their mouths, and the attacks  were currently pushing against each other, trying to gain dominance.</span></div></div>",

Ability card activate, D Strike attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast, ability card activate, Alpha Blaster!\" Conner shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Drago and Leonidas power levels increased by 200gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragons flew up into the air before blasting each other with energy and fire. The blasts came from their mouths, and the attacks were currently pushing against each other, trying to gain dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Leonidas\" Conner said before he realised something. \"Wait a minute, if both Bakugan had an increase of 200gs\u2026plus 3\u2026carry the 2\u2026uh oh\" Conner muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Drago's fire breath overpowered Leonidas. When the combined blast was completely pushed back to Leonidas, the field was enveloped with a cloud of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try Leonidas, but in the end I was th-, wait. Why hasn't the battle ended?\" Drago asked, realising he was still in his natural form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet Drago!\" Leonidas shouted as he flew out of the clouds towards the air born Delta Dragonoid. Leonidas threw both his fists forward, which Drago caught. Not long after, Leonidas quickly kicked Drago away, sending him back towards the ground. But Drago quickly recovered and charged at Leonidas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible, Drago should be 10gs higher\" Conner said, puzzled. He then reviewed the data being displayed on his Baku Pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Unknown power increase of 10gs detected. Both Bakugan are even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that possible?!\" Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Drago and Leonidas were clawing and slashing at each other, and occasionally biting. Both dragons then flew higher into the sky before meeting each other fist to fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say Leonidas, you are a formidable battler\" Drago said, still attacking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not too bad yourself Drago, but I'm just getting started\" Leonidas said before flying backwards. Leonidas then let out a loud roar as he enveloped himself with a purple aura of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComputer: Unknown power surge of 50gs detected. Leonidas leads at 800gs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awesome Leonidas!\" Conner cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is he doing that?\" Dan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's somehow channeling power into his body. How is this possible?\" Drago asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been fun, but now, I'm ending this!\" Leonidas shouted as he charged towards Drago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago raised his defences, but Leonidas struck like a lightning bolt, delivering a critical blow with his claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026is\u2026he\" Drago muttered before returning to his sphere mode. Immediately after this, the battle field faded out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He just\u2026\" Marucho started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beat Dan and Drago\" Runo finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan stood phased for a moment before finally walking over to Conner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was AWESOME Dan!\u2026so did I make the cut\" Conner asked with a nervous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan's lips formed a smile right before the brown messy-haired boy put his arm forward with his hand open, as if he were gonna give Conner a hand shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Battle Brawlers Conner\" Dan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner smiled and shook his hand. So many thoughts were in Conner's head, but there was one that stood out from the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did I win that' Conner thought, as Leonidas' sphere glowed bright purple in Conner's pocket. </span></div></div>",

Perhaps I should pay him a visit\" Masquerade said to himself before thinking 'No, wait. The brawlers are quite suspicious of there being a spy in their ranks. I need to stick to my priorities. Although this could be a good time to test out a new trick'. Masquerade then got up from his chair in his dungeon-like room and faced towards the empty space in front of him. He took one of his cards and threw it right at the ground. Upon landing on the ground, the card transformed into a mirror, which contained Masquerades reflection. Suddenly, but not to the surprise of a certain evil blonde, the image stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect\" Masquerade said before reaching in his pockets to pull out three Bakugan. The mirror clone held his hands out so the real Masquerade could give him the Bakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Defeat the Brawler's newest member\" Masquerade ordered his reflection. The reflection smiled and replied \"With pleasure\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-At the park-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step right up! Come see the legend for yourself. Today could be your lucky day. Come play against the great Bakugan Battle Brawlers. Now who wants to take me on?\" Dan announced to a small group of children who were in the park. Beside Dan were Julie, Marucho, and Conner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a small fee you can battle the best. A chance like this only comes along once in a lifetime. You know our motto, 'we do battle anytime, anywhere'. Now, don't be shy I know you wanna play\" Dan said, accidently knocking over a radio with his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, the tunes\" Dan exclaimed, as if the 'tunes' actually mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey come on! We love a good challenge\" Julie said before walking over to a little boy with dark hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there little boy! I'm looking for a big strong Bakugan player to roll with and you look just like my type\" Julie said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she trying to brawl with him or ask him on a date?\" Conner whispers to Marucho.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since she's twice his age, let's hope it's the former\" Marucho whispered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince joining the Brawlers, Conner met all the other members. Shun was difficult for Conner to be able to figure out, but Shun didn't vocalize any negative opinions towards Conner joining. They hadn't met in person as Conner's introduction to Shun was via video chat. Alice was quite surprised when she saw that it was Conner. She asked how Conner's Ravenoid was doing and he showed her that it was doing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was pretty cool with Conner joining too. But over time, Conner noticed that Julie was a bit\u2026forward towards people she doesn't even know yet\u2026even if they are small children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about me?\" Dan asked before continuing \"I bet you and I could have a great brawl\" Dan said before winking and revealing his sparking teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the kid ran off screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait come back!\" Julie told the boy, but the child did not change his course and kept running until he was out of viewing distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boy talk about sensitive\" Dan said before turning towards the rest of the kids. \"So then-\" Dan didn't get to finish his sentence as the rest of the kids ran off after a few cries of terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with kids today!? Don't they like to have fun anymore\" Dan said in frustration while moving his arms and legs like a monkey\u2026a mad monkey at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The real question is why do adults permit their children to roam free in the park when Dan is around\" Marucho whispered to Conner, making him laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shun?\" Julie said in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those kids wouldn't like him either\" Marucho said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No look, its Shun right over there\" Julie said, pointing to the path above the park steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the brawlers looked but saw nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where? I don't see anybody\" Dan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No I just saw him\" Julie insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way you could've. Julie we dropped him off at his dojo remember\" Dan reminded the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he was in the area I'm sure he would contact us\" Marucho added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you guys tell me that Shun is a ninja, and a quiet ninja at that? It's not impossible that Shun could be here\" Conner commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, and you guys doubted-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it's also possible that you could've seen someone else that looks like Shun\" Conner added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud grumbling sound was then heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm so hungry. Hey, let's go eat, we can try this again later\" Dan suggested, holding his stomach in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks Dan, I already ate. I'm gonna see if I can find anyone to brawl with me. But send me a message if you want to meet up again\" Conner said, walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-10 unsuccessful minutes later-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't believe that Dan scared off all the prey\u2026I mean, honourable opponents\" Leonidas groaned in displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look on the bright side, we're Brawlers now Leonidas. Strong battles will find us eventually\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like who?\" Leonidas asked, eager for combat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like me\" Conner turned around and saw\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, it's Masquerade!\" Conner exclaimed, sort of afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the new Brawler, and by the looks of that Bakugan on your shoulder, you use the Darkus attribute\" Masquerade stepped closer to Conner, who was still a bit nervous \"I don't see what's so special about you. You don't seem worthy of even using the power of darkness, much less Darkus Bakugan\" Masquerade taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conner, you must swallow your fear if you want to defeat the idiot with the weird mask and the bad haircut who thinks he even stands a chance against us\" Leonidas proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate him Leonidas, his name is Masquerade and he is a long time enemy of the brawlers. He's also the top ranked Bakugan player\" Conner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, so if we beat him then we are the strongest?\" Leonidas asked, now very eager to battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sort of\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's do this Conner\" Leonidas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough talk, are you gonna battle, or run home to mommy\" Masquerade taunted\u2026again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner then gathered his courage and said \"Okay then, let's battle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Field, open!\"</span></div></div>",

He introduces himself as . Jaden is allowed inside, where he watches one of the Duels. Bastion Misawa has \"Vorse Raider\", one Set card and 3200 Life Points, while the examiner has \"Big Shield Gardna\", \"Gear Golem the Moving Fortress\" and 1900 Life Points. The proctor claims that no matter how capable Bastion is, he can no longer lower his Life Points when playing against his \"Super Defensive Deck\" (in the dub, he instead gives Bastion a mock \"multiple choice question\"). Bastion activates his face-down \"Ring of Destruction\", destroying his own \"Vorse Raider\" and causing both players to take 1900 damage. This defeats the proctor, but leaves Bastion with 1300 Life Points. The proctor congratulates him as on his win, and the applicant thanks him. Three male students dressed in blue talk with another. Taiyou Torimaki says that the #1 examinee, Bastion, is not half bad, while Raizou Mototani says that it was worth coming to see him after hearing the rumors. Chazz Princeton says that's nonsense, as the Duels here are set at a low level and that coming here was a waste of time. After all, Duel Academy needs only one king, not two believes they'll be better to him since they've been in \"Duel prep school\" Jaden speaks with Syrus, saying that \"number one\"'s combo was amazing. Syrus responds that Bastion had the highest score on the written test. Jaden was unaware that was what determined the numbers, while Syrus says that the final score depends on the combination of written and practical exam scores. He states he's unsure that they'll accept him. Even though he won his Duel, he's still examinee #119. Jaden tells him to relax and that he himself is #110 (numbers are omitted in the dub, and they both simply say that they \"barely passed\"). Syrus tells him that the Duels for the examinees in the hundreds have already ended (in the dub, Syrus mentions test anxiety, and has apparently already been accepted to Duel Academy). Two teachers agree that they need no not debate about Bastion - he'll be accepted for sure (in the dub, they simply state that they have many good applicants this year). He was also the last examinee. The man from outside approaches Dr. Crowler, telling him that's one more applicant that arrived at the last minute (in the dub, he addresses Crowler as \"Mr.\" and when Crowler question that, he uses \"Mrs\" instead. Crowler then states he has a \"PhD\" in Dueling and has thus earned the title of Doctor). Crowler asks what his number was. Upon hearing that he was #110 and that he was late, he won't accept him. The academy has no need for drop-out boys. Another teacher tells him that they have to let him take the test - he was late due to his train being delayed (Jaden's reason for being late goes unmentioned in the dub). Crowler gets a call from Chancellor Sheppard, who tells him that he's aware of the late student. He instructs Crowler to let him take the test, low written score or not, as the school's objective is to gather a wide range of Duelists to train (in the dub, Sheppard states he doesn't want a repeat of last year - Crowler had cut one third of the applicants for addressing him as \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\"). Crowler believes the academy is built for the elite and does not understand why Sheppard is backing the \"dropout boy\" (in the dub, he goes so far as to call Sheppard a \"furry-chinned windbag).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowler rises, announcing he'll Duel the  two himself. Another professor tells him to wait and to please take an examination Deck. Crowler responds that he has no need for one - he'll use his own (in the dub, Crowler does not mention where he's going and simply says to leave the selection of opponent and Deck up to him). Bastion takes a seat in the stands, and Jaden tells him that he may be the second-toughest student to apply this year. Jaden is announced as the next person to Duel and he begins to walk to the arena. Bastion tells him to wait, and asks why he's number two. Jaden responds that it's because he's number one. Syrus questions why someone scoring only nine points higher than him would be so confident. Jaden arrives at the arena, and Crowler introduces himself as the acting Chief General Director of Practical Application (in the dub, Crowler is the \"Chair of Department Techniques\"). </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The whole room was abuzz with noise as Jaden walked into the stands after beating Dr. Crowler, the teacher quickly got back up and acted like nothing had ever happened.<br>\r\n\"Tell me that was the last duel.\" said Crowler angrily to one of the proctors.<br>\r\n\"Well there is one more duelist,\" he said, \"but they haven't...\"<br>\r\n\"WAIT!!!\" came a loud shout.<br>\r\nSomeone ran onto a duel field breathing heavy. They looked very strange in their baseball cap, large loose and baggy leather jacket with a baggy black shirt, and baggy blue jeans with holes in the knees. It very hard to tell if they were male or female.<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late,\" the kid called, \"I got lost like three times on the way here, and before that the train I would've taken was having maintenance.\"<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious,\" said Crowler to the proctor, \"another Slifer Slacker!?\"<br>\r\n\"Well sir,\" said the proctor, \"we have to at least...\"<br>\r\n\"We don't need another one like that boy!\" said Crowler, \"Get rid of that kid!\"<br>\r\n\"Or you could let me duel.\" said a voice in the back of the room.<br>\r\nCrowler turned to see who spoke, and his blood turned cold at what he saw. A girl stood in the corner of the room in a black tank top that didn't cover her stomach and black miniskirt. The girl\u2019s eyes were said to be blue, but who could tell looking through the orange lens of the girls black sunglasses. She had short black hair that only reached the end of her neck.<br>\r\n\"Ms. Okami, you're a student,\" said Crowler, but still in a fearful tone, \"You can't...\"<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" she said, \"you think my dad would be happy if his little girl's enrollment was slowed down because you couldn't find a proctor.\"<br>\r\n\"Well...\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\u201d said the girl, \u201clike your Chancellor said, I could out duel most teachers, so beating me will be real a test.\u201d<br>\r\nThe girl left to enter the arena, the proctor stopped her and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to use a pre-made deck.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019d rather follow Dr. Crowler\u2019s example and use my own,\u201d she said, \u201csame for the kid down there.\u201d<br>\r\nWith that she exited, but soon was on the opposite side of the field opposing the kid.<br>\r\nBy this time Jaden had found a seat in the front row as close to the action as possible.<br>\r\n\u201cThis should be fun to watch,\u201d he said, \u201ca student dueling a student, now this is the kind of thing dueling was made for.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou,\u201d said the black haired girl as she removed her sunglasses and sat them on top of her head revealing her blue eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s customary that both duelists see all of each other\u2019s face and know at least their opponent\u2019s name. I\u2019m Kurai Okami. I would like you to show me this same respect.\u201d<br>\r\nKurai saw a smile curl across the kid\u2019s face. The kid grabbed its hat and threw it to the wind to reveal long, bright red, hair that reached the small of the kid\u2019s back. The kid also shook of its jacket to reveal a slender, feminine frame. The feminine theory was proven true by the sound of the voice that came next and what she said.<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Pyra Dan Basuto. It\u2019s my dream to be the world\u2019s greatest female duelist.\u201d she activated a duel disk, \u201cnow let\u2019s get this duel fired up shall we!?!\u201d<br>\r\nPyra: 4000<br>\r\nKurai: 4000</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside of the smaller houses of Crash Town a sleeping boy, who had black hair with cerulean blue highlights, was sleeping peacefully in his bed. This boy's name is Takashi Nakamura and he is 15-year-old. Ever since he could walk, Takashi has always loved to Duel. He especially loved Turbo Dueling. The speed and the excitement of the event has always been on his mind. However, even though he was a good duelist, Takashi doesn't own a Duel Runner nor does he have the means to construct one. Despite those obstacles though, Takashi still believes that one day he'll become the next King of Turbo Duels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young man sleeps in his bed an old man, with gray hair, huge mustache, and was wearing cowboy clothes, entered the room. As he looked at Takashi, the old man started glaring at him and proceeded to slap the boy in the head. The slap woke Takashi up at once and he immediately jumped up. However when he turned and saw the old man, he just sighed and sat back down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Klaus\u2026\" Takashi groaned as he placed the blanket over his head. \"Why the hell are you waking me up so early in the morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused Klaus to punch Takashi in the head. \"First of all it's not morning!\" He said. \"And second don't use that language in this house Takashi. You know better than that. Now get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man sighed again before getting out of his bed. \"Fine\u2026fine.\" He said. Takashi got up from his bed and proceeded to head over to the bathroom. As he was washing his face and brushing his teeth, Klaus began talking to him some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026\" He said. \"Do you plan on leaving the house today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi gave him the thumbs up as he was busy brushing his teeth, thus was unable to talk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Then I need you to go to the bank and withdraw some money.\" Klaus explained. \"We're almost all out of cash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing him say that caused Takashi to almost swallow the toothpaste that was in his mouth. He quickly caught himself and spit the teeth cleaning liquid into the sink. He then ran out of the bathroom and glared at the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the heck did we run out of money so fast?\" He asked him. \"Last time I checked we had enough cash to last us for an entire month!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because you always spend your money are the newest Duel Monster cards.\" Klaus told him. \"You know those cards aren't cheap here and yet you still buy them as if we have all the money in the world. Do I need to remind you about what's going out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at Klaus for a minute before swinging his head in disagreement. He knew about the conflict between the Radley and Malcolm families and he also knew that both sides raised the amount of money on Duel Monster cards. They did this because they didn't want the commoners to buy cards, when they really needed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Takashi\u2026\" Klaus said as he put his hand on one of the boy's shoulders. \"I know you love to Duel, but you shouldn't let dueling get in the way of our money problems. We barely have enough to keep the place that we have now. So you can't spend it on things that aren't as important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded his head. \"I know\u2026I'm sorry.\" He said. \"I'll try to handle our money better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\u2026\" Klaus said as a smile appeared o his face. \"Now I'm about to head to work. You enjoy yourself until I get back and make sure you go to the bank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head and with that Klaus left his room and proceeded to leave the house. Once he was gone, Takashi proceeded to put on his clothes, which were like Klaus's. Once he was done getting dress he walked over to his desk and opened the top cabinet. Inside was his Duel Disk, a device that Duelist use to bring Dueling to a higher level, and his Dueling Deck. He attached the Duel Disk to his left arm and inserted his deck in the slot provided. Once he finished doing that, he left his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was outside, the young began observing the scenery. He saw that a lot of people were out so he knew that today was going to be pretty busy. He decided to head over to bank first before going out to do anything else. So he quickly made his way over there and luckily for him hardly anyone was inside. So Takashi quickly made his withdraw and left the bank. He then headed back home and put the money inside of a safe before going back outside. However as soon as he came out he saw a young boy with dark skin and black hair waiting for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Takashi\u2026\" The boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled when he saw him and began walking over to him, \"Hey West.\" He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest was 8-year-old boy who saw Takashi as one of his best friends. He always looked up to him and would always challenge him to a duel. It was good for them because, the two of them were always looking to improve. However they always avoid dueling whenever members of the Malcolm or Radely family were around because they didn't want them to notice that they were dueling. If they did they might want to recruit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you've been up too?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much\u2026\" West answered. \"Though, I have been looking for you all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused Takashi somewhat. \"Why were you looking for me?\" He asked. \"You needed me for something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" West said as he nodded his head. \"Come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest lead Takashi to the end of Crash Town and the two of them soon came across an old shack. This was West's hiding place and he would always come here to play or to be alone. When the two went inside they saw a little girl with long black hair and skin just as dark as West's. The girl turned and looked at the two boys and began to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"West\u2026Takashi\u2026\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nico\u2026\" Takashi replied with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico was West's older sister by 2 year, thus making her 10-years-old. Like her little brother, Nico saw Takashi as one of her best friends and almost saw him as an older brother. Takashi felt the same about the two children as almost saw them as his younger siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis\u2026is it ready yet?\" West asked his sister. \"I really want to show it to Takashi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico shook her head. \"Not yet West.\" She said. \"Give me more time and it'll be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest nodded his head at Nico before looking back at Takashi. \"Hey\u2026while we wait for her to get ready, why don't we have a Duel?\" He proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\u2026I don't have a problem with that.\" Takashi said. \"Besides, it would be good to see how much you've improved since our last Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've improved a lot.\" West told him. \"I'll defeat you this time Takashi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the young boy brought out his Duel Disk from his trunk and inserted his deck into the slot holder. Takashi and West would then activate their Duel Disk, which started to glow as soon as they cut on. They then separated from one another and began drawing 5 cards from their decks</span></div></div>",

Once he did that, he took another card and placed it onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Summon: Celtic Guardian, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeltic Guardian: ATK 1400 DEF 1200 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon placing the card onto his Duel Disk, a bright light illuminated West's side of the field. Soon, an elf knight appeared and stood in front of him as it held a sword in its right hand. Once it was on the field, Wes grabbed another card from his hand. This time however, he inserted it into the Spell/Trap Zone of his Duel Disk. The card appeared face-down on the field, right behind Celtic Guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then set one card face-down on the field and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head in approval as he knew that it was his turn now. So he proceeded to gently place his right hand on the top of his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn.\" He said. \"Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man swiftly drew a card from the deck and looked at it for a few moments. Once he finished, Takashi placed the card onto his Duel Disk's Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Summon: Luster Dragon, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuster Dragon: ATK 1900 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like when west placed Celtic Guardian's card onto his Monster Card Zone, a bright flash of light appeared as Takashi placed his card on his Duel Disk. From that light, a beautiful blue dragon with sapphire scales appeared onto Takashi's side of the field. The dragon glared at Celtic Guardian and proceeded to roar at the knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luster Dragon, attack Celtic Guardian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuster Dragon obeyed its master's commanded and released a powerful blast of blue energy from its mouth. The attack struck Celtic Guardian, destroying the knight completely and draining a portion of West's Life Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest: 3500 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the attack ended, Takashi noticed that West was a little shaken up by it. Despite the fact that monsters that they summoned were holograms, they looked very realistic. This was due to the Solid Vision system which installed during old days of Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba. The purpose behind the Solid Vision system was to bring a sense of realism towards the game of Duel Monsters, thus making the game far more excited than it would be if played on a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, West?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest got himself refocused as he began to shake his head for a few seconds. Once he finished he looked towards Takashi and nodded his head in approval. Upon receiving his answer, Takashi continued on with his turn as he took one card from his hand and inserted it into his Spell/Trap Zone. Like with West, Takashi's card appeared face-down on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn by setting one card face-down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, then It's my turn again.\" West replied. \"Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy drew a card from his deck and placed it into his hand. He then examined all of his cards, wanting to make sure that the next card he chooses a card that will help him. After about a minute, he grabbed a card and placed it horizontally onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For this turn, I Summon the Tuner Monster: Tune Warrior, in Defense Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTune Warrior: ATK 1600 DEF 200 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bright flash of light appeared on West's side of the field as a red robot was summoned onto his field. The robot proceeded to kneel down to one knee and crossed its arm, taking a defensive position in front of its master. Upon seeing the monster, a small smile appeared on Takashi's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Tuner Monster\u2026\" He said. \"With that card in your deck, it must mean that you have a Synchro Monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" West replied, also with a smile on his face. \"I got it when I at the card shop. I've been practicing like crazy so that I can properly play it when we dueled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the game of Duel Monsters, there were special monster that were unlike the normal monster that people play. Synchro Monsters are one of those monsters. To summon one, a Duelist must first have a regular monster and unique type of monster called a Tuner Monster. The level of the Synchro Monster that the Duelist wants to Summon must equal the combined level of the Tuner and regular monsters used to form it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool that you now have a Synchro Monster of your own, West.\" Takashi said with approval. \"I hope I get the chance to see it in this Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest nodded his head. He knew by Takashi's words that while he wanted to see the Synchro Monster, he wasn't going to make it him to summon it. Realizing that, West looked through his hand again and picked out a card from it. He then inserted the card into his Spell/Trap Zone, which appeared face-down on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set one card face-down and end my turn.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn again.\" Takashi said. \"Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon drawing a card and placing it into his hand, Takashi examined West's side of the field very carefully. He saw that his young friend hand one monster out and two face-down cards. He could tell from this that the face-downs were going to be used to protect West's monster. At least until his brings out the monster needed to perform a Synchro Summoning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make sure his young opponent doesn't get the chance to summon his monster, Takashi grabbed a card from his hand and placed it horizontally onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Summon the Tuner Monster: Dread Dragon, in Defense Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread Dragon: ATK 1100 DEF 400 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright flash of light illuminated the field again as a brown dragon with short wings appeared on the field. The dragon stood next to Luster Dragon and proceeded to take a defensive position in front of Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll have Luster Dragon attack Tune Warrior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuster Dragon roared and started gathering power so it could release its attack. As that was happening, West pressed a button on his Duel Disk. This action activated one of his face-down cards, which started to flip up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card: Negate Attack!\" He declared. \"With this Trap, I can negate your Luster Dragon's attack and end your Battle Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Luster Dragon fired its attack, a giant vortex appeared in front of Tune Warrior. The vortex sucked up the attack, protecting the warrior in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice move there West.\" Takashi said with a smile. \"You're starting to think more strategically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026I did learn from the best.\" The young boy replied, having remembered that he learned most of his skills from Takashi himself. \"You were the one who always said that I needed to protect my monsters better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true\u2026But I also told that you need to protect your Life Points as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA confused expression appeared on West's face as he saw Takashi grab another card and insert it into his Spell/Trap Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card: Meteor of Destruction!\" He declared. \"With the power of this Spell, I can inflict 1000 points of damage towards your Life Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Duelists looked towards the ceiling as they saw a giant rainbow colored meteor appeared onto the field. The meteor quickly made its way over towards West and exploded upon making contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest: 2500 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched the smoke clear and saw that West was alright, Takashi looked through all the cards in his hand again. Once he saw that he didn't have another other moves to make this turn, the young man looked towards his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done for now West. I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing Takashi say that he ended his turn, a huge smile appeared on West's face. He then looked towards him as he placed his hand on his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" He yelled with an excited tone of voice. \"I finally did it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" The young boy replied. \"It's my turn. Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest swiftly drew a card from his deck and quickly placed it into his hand. Once he did that, he pressed another button on his Duel Disk so that his other face-down card could activate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card: Call of the Haunted! With this Trap Card, I can revive one of the monsters that rest in my Graveyard. The monster that I choose is my Celtic Guardian!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Trap Card flipped up, both Duelists saw Celtic Guardian pop out it and stand next to Tune Warrior. Upon seeing both monsters, a smile appeared on Takashi's face as he finally figured out why West said he did it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Takashi\u2026\" The young boy said. \"This is it! I Tune my Level 4 Celtic Guardian with my Level 3 Tune Warrior! Great spark of the sky, pass judgment on those that spread evil! Synchro Summon! Shine, Lightning Warrior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning Warrior: ATK 2400 DEF 1200 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTune Warrior and Celtic Guardian quickly jumped into the air as both monsters started to glow. Soon, Tune Warrior transformed into 3 green rings and placed them inside of Celtic Guardian. Once that happened, Celtic Guardian transformed into 4 shining stars. Then, a bright flash of light consumed the stars and a new monster appeared onto West's side of the field. The monster was a warrior wearing silver armor with two red scarfs, one of its neck and the other on its waist. The warrior also had spiky yellow hair ad was wearing a silver mask across its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of the monster impressed Takashi as it was the first time that he's seen West summon a Synchro Monster before. This action made him feel really proud as his young friend was on his way to becoming a True Duelist. </span></div></div>",

You have 4 cards in your hand Takashi. That means you're being dealt 1200 points of damage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning Warrior appeared before Takashi and placed its hand right on top of him. Once it did that, the warrior proceeded to shock the young man with its electrical powers and drain him of more of his Life Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2300 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takashi instinctively fell to one knee, the smile of West's face grew larger as he saw that his opponent's Life Points were now less than his own. The mere sight of this caused him to jump up and down with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" He yelled. \"I have finally have more Life Points than Takashi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little boy raced across the hideout, as the feeling of accomplishment only grew with each passing second. The mere sight of this embarrassed Nico, as she was ashamed that her little brother was making this big of a deal out of this. As for Takashi, who finally got back to both feet, he liked the scene. Out of all the times that he and West dueled one another, the latter had never reduced his Life Points beyond 1000 points. The fact that he was able to take down 1700 Life Points was a real accomplishment for him as he understood why he felt the way he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, West.\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest continued to parade around the hideout for another two minutes before Nico finally stopped him. She then got him to focus back on the Duel before she went back to doing what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Takashi\u2026\" The young boy said. \"I don't have any other moves to make. So I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026\" Takashi replied. \"It's my turn. Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takashi drew a card from his deck, he started to hear the roar of powerful dragon from within his mind. The sound of the dragon made him smile as he inserted the card that he drew into his Spell/Trap Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card: Monster Reborn!\" He declared. \"With this Spell, I'm allowed to revive one monster from either Graveyard onto my side of the field. The monster that I choose is my Luster Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother bright flash of light illuminated Takashi's side of the field as the young Duelist's Luster Dragon reappeared onto the field. Once it showed up, Takashi grabbed a card from his hand and placed it onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I Summon the Tuner Monster: Magma Drago, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagma Drago: ATK 1400 DEF 600 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful blast of fire erupted onto the field as a fierce red dragon arrived and stood next to Takashi's other dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now Tune my Level 4 Luster Dragon with my Level 2 Dread Dragon, to Synchro Summon: Iron Chain Dragon, Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Chain Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 1300 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two dragons flew up into the air and quickly perform the Synchro Summoning process that West's monsters did last turn. When they finished, a new dragon appeared from a bright flash of light. This dragon was very muscular and it had several iron chains around its body. The mere sight of this monster surprised West as he wasn't expecting Takashi to Synchro Summon a very powerful monster like Iron Chain Dragon so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iron Chain Dragon, attack Lightning Warrior!\" Takashi ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful dragon complied with its master's orders and proceeded to wrap its iron chains around Lightning Warrior. Once it did that, the dragon dragged the Warrior-Type monster over towards it before devouring it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest: 2400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched his monster be devoured, West was upset that Takashi was able to come back so easily even when he thought he had the advantage. Also, since he didn't have any other monsters out nor any Spell or Trap Cards, West knew that Takashi was most likely going to attack his Life Points directly with Magma Drago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a fun Duel, West.\" Takashi said with a smile on his face. \"As a reward for such a good match, I'll show you the monster that you always like to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs West eyes widen from surprise, Takashi activated the face-down card that he set during his first turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card: Urgent Tuning! With this Trap, as long as I have the required monsters on my side of the field, I can perform a Synchro Summoning! So I Tune my Level 6 Iron Chain Dragon with my Level 2 Magma Drago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs West's eyes widen even more, Nico stopped what she was doing and looked as Takashi grabbed a card from his extra deck and placed it onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clustering wishes will become a new shining star. Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Take flight, Stardust Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 2000 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Chain Dragon and Magma Drago flew high into the air and quickly perform the process for a Synchro Summoning. When they finished, a bright flash of light illuminated the entire hideout as a beautiful dragon appeared. It had shiny scales all over its body and had large wings which were almost as tall as it body. The sight of this dragon caused Nico and West to smile gleefully as they were excited to see the powerful Synchro Monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026\" Nico said. \"It's Stardust Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" West replied. \"That's the Ace of Takashi's deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Stardust Dragon flew just above Takashi, the young Duelist looked at the beast for a few moments. He then smiled at it, happy that it was once again by his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\u2026\" He said to himself. \"Stardust Dragon, attack West's Life Points directly with Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust complied and started gathering energy from within its body. Once it gathered enough, the powerful dragon fired a stream of cosmic energy from its mouth. The attack struck West's body, draining him of all of his remaining Life Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest: 0 LP <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce West's Life Points dropped to 0, all of the holograms started to vanish. Before they did though, Takashi looked back towards Stardust Dragon and watched it roar one more time before disappearing completely. Once it was gone, the young man deactivated his Duel Disk and walked over towards West.</span></div></div>",

As he was eating it, a huge smile appeared on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is good.\" He said. \"You're getting a lot better Nico.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico slightly blushed as she put her head down. \"Thanks\u2026\" She said. \"I'm glad that you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest smile too as he was putting some cookies into his mouth. \"See I told you.\" He told Takashi. \"You just had to see it\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head. \"Yup\u2026\" He spoke. \"I'm glad that I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio was busy stuffing their faces a young man with blonde hair, blue eyes and was wearing a red jacket entered the hideout. Takashi, West, and Nico turned towards the individual and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Toru\u2026\" West and Nico said at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you guys\u2026\" Toru responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru Ishida, this 16-year-old boy is one of Takashi's best friends since childhood. For as long as they could remember, the two of them had always been on the same page when it came to everything. They both loved to eat, they both loved to Duel, and they both wanted to leave Crash Town one day and head to New Domino City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there is one difference between Takashi and Toru. That difference is; unlike Takashi, Toru actually has his very own Duel Runner that he's been working on. Takashi and Toru found the Duel Runner, which was in terrible condition, near the mountains and both of them played a game of Jaken (Rock-Paper-Scissors) to see who would get it. Takashi eventually loss so Toru ended up getting the Runner. For almost 3 years the young man has made great progress in the repair of his Duel Runner and has brought it back to perfect condition. However, Toru is missing a few key pieces and that's keeping him from completely his Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026you found those pieces yet?' Takashi asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru sat down and took one of the cookies that Nico baked. As he ate it he responded to Takashi's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet\u2026\" He answered. \"I looked all over Crash Town and still can't find them. I'm starting to think that I'm going to need to get the parts from someplace else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what other place sells those types of parts\u2026?\" Nico asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru looked at Nico as he scratched the back of his head. \"That's the million dollar question.\" He said. \"However I'm sure I'll find some place.\" Toru then looked back at Takashi. \"So have you found a Runner of your own?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026\" Takashi answered. \"Besides even if I had one, I doubt Klaus would let me keep it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not\u2026?\" West asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klaus has always been against me on having a Duel Runner of my own.\" Takashi explained. \"For some reason he says it would be pointless to have one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too surprised.\" Toru said. \"Klaus used to be against me on having the Duel Runner I have\u2026yet he's been more on Takashi than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi grabbed another cookie and started eating it. \"He's my Grandfather and has been my only family since my parents died. He's just probably overprotective of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico and West looked at Takashi and Toru while the two teenagers were talking. They tried their best to understand the situation that they were talking about. Nico and West's father worked in the mines so they only got to see him during the night. And most of the time they were too tired to talk so they just went to sleep. However the two children were not mad at their father because they knew the situation that he was in. Also Takashi and Toru were kind of like big brothers to them, so it helped them not feel too lonely. Still they felt bad for the two boys in a way. They know that their father is still alive and they see him every now and then. However both Toru and Takashi's parents were dead so they wouldn't get the chance to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Takashi saw that both Nico and West were looking at him with some tears in their eyes. Guessing what they were thinking about, Takashi gently petted both of their heads and smiled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it you guys.\" He said to them. \"My parents died shortly after I was born so I have no memory of them. So I'm not too upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\u2026?\" Nico asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\u2026\" Takashi answered. \"I mean sure\u2026I wish I had the chance to know them, but there's no point in bitchin about what can't happen. All I can do is move forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicely put\u2026\" Toru said as he ate another cookie. He soon got up and prepared to leave. \"Well see you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest looked at him before remembering something. \"Wait Toru\u2026\" He said as he walked up to him. \"I forgot to ask you something\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that West\u2026?\" Toru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest pulled out a flyer that he had his pocket and handed it to Toru. Takashi, who was interested at what was on the flyer, walked over and took Toru and looked at the flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crash City's: Rental Deck Tournament?\" He questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" West said. \"The local card shop is hosting it later on today. It's a tournament where competitors Duel using decks that the card shop provides. The winner of the tournament gets to keep the deck that they rented.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru looked at the flyer for a little bit before handing it to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry West\u2026\" He said. \"But I'm going to have to sit this one out.\" </span></div></div>",

The young boy then looked at Takashi. \"Then will you compete?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\u2026\" Takashi answered. \"I'm always up for a Duel, no matter what type it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought a huge smile onto West's face. \"Awesome\u2026\" He said. \"This is perfect because since you can't use your deck in the tournament, I'll have a better chance to beat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Toru left knowing that his friends were going to have a good time. The others then continued on eating the rest of cookies before leaving as well. Once they arrived at the card shop, the three of them went inside so that they could register for the tournament. West was able to find the store clerk, who was wearing a Dark Magician Girl costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\u2026\" He said. \"Can we register for the Rental Deck Tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled. \"Sure thing\u2026\" She said. \"Though we only have two more spots left. I'm afraid that only two of you can compete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\u2026?\" West asked in disappointment. \"Isn't there some other way all of us can compete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stood looked at West for a moment before grabbing a notepad. She then looked over several pages before looking back at West again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026one competitor hasn't showed up yet.\" She explained. \"I'm pretty sure that he won't show up since it's so late. So I guess I can remove him and make room for all 3 of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest smiled when he heard this and looked over at Takashi and Nico, who were also smiling. The three of them registered for the tournament and took the deck that they were going to use for it. They soon left the store after that and waited for the tournament to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of deck do you have sis?\" West asked out of interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you, that'll be cheating!\" Nico replied. \"So mind your own business and look at your own deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest frowned and did as he was told. He opened the box that contained his rented cards and took a good look at them. Quickly his frown turned into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome\u2026\" He said. \"I'm so going to win this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled and decided to look at his deck. As he did a surprised look appeared on his face as he wasn't prepared to receive the cards that he has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be interesting\u2026\" He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon two clerks, who were both wearing Dark Magician Girl costumes, showed up. One of them had a microphone in her hand and started talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to our annual Rental Deck Tournament.\" She said. \"My name is Ashley and the lovely lady beside me is Rachel. We'll both be your host today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of people, who were watching the tournament, started clapping and cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get started with our first match-up.\"Rachel said. \"Will Takashi Nakamura and Nico Matsuda please come forward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Nico and Takashi walked out towards the field and stood on opposite sides of each other. The two of them looked at each other and prepared themselves for the Duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's have fun Nico.\" Takashi said. \"And make sure to do your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico nodded her head. \"Ok Takashi\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them inserted their decks into their Duel Disks and activated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the match begin!\"Ashley and Rachel said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first\u2026Draw!\" Nico said as she drew a card. She looked over at her hand and placed a card on her Duel Disk. \"I summon Marshmallon in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarshmallon ATK: 300 DEF: 500 LVL: 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small monster that looked like a giant Marshmallow appeared on Nico's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe\u2026what a cutie.\"Ashley said in a cute tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can this cutie be a match against Takashi and his deck?\"Rachel questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card. He quickly looked at it before looking at his other cards. He then decided on which card he was going to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon the Elemental Hero: Sparkman, in Attack Mode!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero: Sparkman ATK: 1600 DEF 1400 LVL: 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man wearing blue and golden armor appeared on Takashi's field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attack with Sparkman! Go, Spark Flash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkman fired a blast of blue electricity from the palm of his hand. The blast hit Marshmallon; however the attack wasn't able to destroy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Takashi\u2026\" Nico said. \"But my Marshmallon can't be destroyed by battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Nico\u2026\" Takashi replied. \"However you placed it in Attack Mode, so you still lose Life Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico: 2700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an amazing turn of events.\"Ashley spoke. \"Thanks to Marshmallon's Special Ability, it remains on the field. How will Takashi react to this development?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this\u2026\" Takashi said. \"I place 1 card face-down and end my turn.\" He inserted a card into his Duel Disk and its hologram appeared face-down on his field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026I draw!\" Nico said as she drew a card. She quickly put it in her hand and placed another on her Duel Disk. \"I sacrifice Marshmallon to summon my Dark Witch in Attack Mode!\" </span></div></div>",

Then, in that same flash of light, a beautiful witch that had wings and a sharp spear appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Witch, attack Takashi's Sparkman with you Shining Scepter Blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Witch pointed her spear at Spark and began to insert her energy into it. Soon the tip of the spear glow a bright green color and once that happened Dark Witch fired the energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate a Trap\u2026Hero Barrier!\" Takashi yelled as he pressed one of the buttons on his Duel Disk. His face-down card flipped up and a glowing shield appeared from out of it. The shield got in front of Sparkman and protected him from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what just happened?\" A confused Nico asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When one of my Elemental Hero monsters is about to be attacked, I can activate the Hero Barrier Trap Card.\" Takashi explained. \"With it, I can negate one of my opponent's attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no\u2026!\" Nico said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome\u2026Takashi saw Nico's attack coming and was prepared to block it.\" Rachel said over her microphone. \"I can tell that he's using his rented deck to perfection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, how will Nico respond?\"Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico looked over the rest of her cards and soon found one that caught her interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place one card face-down and end my turn.\" She said. The card appeared right behind Dark Witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card. He then looked at Nico's field and started to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, she's has a Level 5 monster with 1800 Attack Points and a face-down card on her side of the field. Odds are that her face-down is a trap. I better get rid of that before I make my next move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi inserted a card into his Duel Disk and the image of that card appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell, Mystical Space Typhoon!\" He yelled. \"With it, I can destroy one Spell or Trap Card. The card I choose is your face-down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful cyclone shot from out of the card and headed towards Nico's face-down card. The hologram was instantly destroyed and Nico, reluctantly, placed the real card in her Graveyard. Once she did that Takashi looked over his hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026now that her face-down is gone, I can go after her Dark Witch.\" He thought. \"Though I need to figure out how.\" He carefully looked over all of his cards and soon he found 2 that quickly caught his interest. \"That'll work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi seems to be in a deep thought.\"Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he is.\"Rachel said, annoyed that he co-host was stating the obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi soon stopped thinking and decided on what to do. He first inserted a card into his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell, Polymerization!\" He yelled. A card appeared on the field and it had the image of two monsters, combining into one monster. \"With this, I can take 2 or more of my monsters and fuse them together in order to Fusion Summon a new monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fusion Summon\u2026?\" Nico asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026it's been awhile since I've seen someone use a Fusion Summon.\"Rachel said. \"Ever since Synchro Summoning came around Duelist haven't been fusing monsters as much. It's good to see that some people still use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse my Sparkman with the Elemental Hero: Clayman that's in my hand. In order to Fusion Summon, the Elemental Hero: Thunder Giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Clayman ATK: 800 DEF: 2000 LVL: 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Thunder Giant ATK: 2400 DEF: 1500 LVL: 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's Clayman appeared on the field and quickly both it and Sparkman fused into one monster. Soon a giant man with yellow and purple armor appeared. In the middle of the man's armor was a dome, which was sparking with electricity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the crowd was amazed at the site of Takashi's new monster. However the person who was most surprised was Nico, who now had to deal with this new foe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job Nico, but this is where it ends.\" Takashi said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\u2026?\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my\u2026Takashi said that the match is about to end.\"Ashley said. \"What could he possibly mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Thunder Giant's Special Ability!\" Takashi yelled. \"By discarding one card in my hand to the Graveyard, I can destroy one monster on the field. As long as that particular monster's original Attack Points is less of that of Thunder Giant's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\u2026\" Nico said. \"Dark Witch has an attack of 1800. While your Thunder Giant has an attack of 2400. That would mean\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\u2026\" Takashi interrupted. \"That means that Dark Witch is automatically destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Thunder Giant fired a small blast of electricity from the palm of his hand. The blast hit Nico's monster, destroying it instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thunder Giant; attack Nico's Life Points Directly with your Thunder Beam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Giant began charging energy into his chest and soon shot a beam of electricity at Nico. Though the attack didn't hurt Nico, she instinctively flinched due to hologram looking extremely realistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico: 300 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an amazing move\u2026!\" Rachel said. \"In just one move Takashi has nearly taken out all of Nico's Life Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This young man is extremely powerful Duelist.\"Ashley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet.\" Takashi said. \"I've still have one more card left to play.\" He inserted his last card into his Duel Disk. The image on the card had a monster splitting into two monsters. \"I activate the Quick-Play Spell, De-Fusion.

The two of them shook hands and started the Duel. However the match didn't last too long because West's inexperience in the use of Spell and Trap Cards, caused him to lose the Duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026in no time at all Asami was able to defeat West!\"Ashley said. \"She must be one incredible Duelist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWest walked over towards Takashi while his head was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\u2026\" He said. \"I\u2026I lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico walked over to her little brother and gently patted his back.

He then looked at Asami as she was activating hers. Ashley looked at both Duelist and saw that they were both ready for the final match to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin!\"She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first\u2026Draw!\" Asami yelled as she drew a card from her deck. She looked over all the cards that were in her hand before finally making her move. \"I summon Etoile Cyber in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile Cyber- ATK 1200 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll place one card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful figure skater with red hair and a face-down card appeared on Asami's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn\u2026Draw!\" Takashi said as he drew a card. He quickly looked at the card and smiled. \"I summon Elemental Hero: Sparkman in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Sparkman- ATK 1600 DEF 1400 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi placed the card on his Duel Disk and Sparkman appeared right beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sparkman\u2026attack Etoile Cyber with your Spark Flash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkman fired a bolt of electricity at Etoile Cyber; however Asami was prepared for such an attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card\u2026Doble Pass\u00e9!\" She yelled as she pressed a button on her Duel Disk. Her face-down card flipped up and revealed the image of a ballerina, with the spotlight solely on her. \"With this card, I can turn your attack on my monster to a Direct Attack on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Takashi said in a shocked tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkman's electricity was about to hit Etoile Cyber, however the attack just went through her and headed straight for Asami. The electricity hit her and she started groaning, even though she wasn't in any real pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami: 2400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\u2026Asami used her Trap Card to save her monster from being destroyed, but it cost her almost half of her Life Points!\"Ashley said. \"Just what could she be up too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you\u2026\" Asami stated. \"I activate Doble Passes' second effect! Once you made a Direct Attack on me, then the monster that you tried to attack can make a Direct Attack on you. Oh and by the way, when Etoile Cyber makes a Direct Attack she gains 500 extra Attack Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtoile Cyber- ATK 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's monster headed for Takashi and began to spin around at an incredible speed. Once she got close enough, Etoile Cyber kicked Takashi in the chest and though it didn't hurt, Takashi felt the force of the blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2300 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami: 2400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting\u2026just has soon Asami lost some who her Life Points, she causes Takashi to lose some of his.\"Rachel said. \"And now, for the first time in this tournament, Takashi is actually losing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn\u2026I didn't see that coming.\" Takashi thought. \"Who would've guess that she sacrifice her own Life Points just to get to my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami drew a card from her deck and looked at it, which caused her to smile a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey since you fused your monsters, can I do the same?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\u2026?\" Takashi said in a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami placed two cards on her Duel Disk and both appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Blade Skater and activate Polymerization!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlade Skater- ATK 1400 DEF 1500 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple and blue figure skater appeared on Asami's field and stood right next to Etoile Cyber. Then an image of a Polymerization card appeared. The two monster then started to fuse into one monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon\u2026Cyber Blader in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Blader- ATK 2100 DEF 800 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother figure skater suddenly appeared on the field. This one had long blue hair and was wearing red goggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyber Blader, attack Takashi's Sparkman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Blader swiftly glided over towards Sparkman and sliced his head off with her figure blades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 1800 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami: 2400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn\u2026\" Asami said pretty confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the crowd Nico and West were shocked at what just took place. They've never seen Takashi lose that many Life Points before and they've never seen him be outsmarted before either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This\u2026could be bad.\" Nico said in a worried tone of voice. \"Takashi could actually lose this\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be quiet sis\u2026!\" West yelled. \"Takashi never loses\u2026and he's not going to start today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Duel Takashi drew a card from his deck and placed it in his hand. He then carefully looked over all of his cards and soon found one in particular. Taking a chance, he decided to play it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Field Spell: Fusion Gate!\" He said as he opened a slot on the side of his Duel Disk. He then placed the card in the slot and as it closed a holographic dimension, filled with whirlpools surrounded everyone. \"Now as long as this card is active, we can fuse monsters without the use of a Polymerization card.\" </span></div></div>",

Then a Fusion monster card suddenly appeared from his Extra Deck. He took the card and placed it on his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse my Elemental Heroes: Avian and Burstinatrix in order to summon the Elemental Hero: Flame Wingman in Attack Mode!\" Takashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero- Avian ATK 1000 DEF 1000 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero- Burstinatrix ATK 1200 DEF 800 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero- Flame Wingman ATK 2100 DEF 1200 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the image of a green birdman and lady who was mostly in all red clothing appeared on the field. However, they fused together to form a new type of monster. This monster had green and black skin, one white wing, and a dragon's face on its right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice looking monster you have there.\" Asami said. \"However it's Attack Power is only at 2100, which is the same as my Cyber Blader. That means if they attack, they'll just end up killing each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi simply smirked. \"You sure about that\u2026\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami had a puzzled look on her face as Takashi placed a card in his Spell/Trap Zone. The image of the card appeared on the field and it had he image of a swordsman covered in aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Equip Spell; Kishido Spirit!\" Takashi said. \"With this card, my monsters can't be destroyed when they battle against a monster of the same Attack Power. Meaning, my Flame Wingman can destroy Cyber Blader. Also, thanks to its Special Ability, when it destroys a monster in battle, you take damage equal to your destroyed monster's Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame Wingman pointed its dragon arm at Cyber Blader and shot a red hot flame at it. However, much to everyone surprised, Cyber Blader was still standing on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint you\u2026, but when you only have 1 monster on the field; my Cyber Blader can't be destroyed when it battles a monster of equal Attack!\" Asami explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\u2026\"Ashley said in shock. \"Takashi can't figure out a way to take out that Cyber Blader. Even with that scary looking monster of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just proves that Asami was one step ahead on Takashi on that one exchange.\"Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at the remaining 2 cards that he had in his hand. He knew that they wouldn't be of any use now, so he did the only thing he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn\u2026\" Asami said as she drew a card. She looked at it and smiled. She then inserted to cards in her Spell/Trap Zone. The first had the image of a monster becoming smaller. The other had an image of a monster holding a gun. \"I activate the Spell Cards; Level Down and Fusion Weapon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the crowd looked on in shock as they saw Cyber Blader become slightly smaller. They then saw that the figure skater soon had a blaster attached to her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to my Level Down card, Cyber Blader's level drops down from 7 to 6. Then, thanks to Fusion Weapon, my Level 6 monster receives a 1500 point power boost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Blader- ATK 3600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Takashi said in surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cyber Blader, attack Flame Wingman with your Cyber Energy Shock!\" Asami yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Blader pointed her blaster at Flam Wingman and shot a giant blast of energy at it. The blast so powerful that it disintegrated Takashi's monster the instant it made contact with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 300 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami: 2400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" She said confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like this Duel is almost over folks\u2026\"Rachel said. \"With no cards out and no monsters to defend himself with, it looks like Takashi is numbered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at his deck for a few minutes before taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026\" He yelled. He looked at the card and a smile appeared on his face, greatly confusing Asami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so cheery?\" She asked. \"You know that you're about to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you why I'm so cheery.\" Takashi replied as he placed a card on his Duel Disk. \"I summon the Elemental Hero: Clayman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Clayman ATK: 800 DEF: 2000 LVL: 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's Clayman appeared on the field and it looked ready for battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he going to do?\" Asami asked. \"There's no way that it can match Cyber Blader's power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that\u2026\" Takashi said confidently. \"But it can stand a chance if it's with its comrade.\" He took a card from his hand and put in his Spell/Trap Zone. The card appeared on the field and it had an image of a shining cross. \"I activate the Spell Card; Monster Reborn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit\u2026!\" Asami said, cursing herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this Spell I can bring back one 1 monster from either of our Graveyards.\" Takashi explained. \"I choose my Elemental Hero: Sparkman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of Monster Reborn, Sparkman appeared on Takashi's field and stood right next to his Clayman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I activate Fusion Gate to summon the Elemental Hero: Thunder Giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Thunder Giant: ATK 2400 DEF 1500 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Clayman and Sparkman fused together and in a flash of light, out came Thunder Giant. Nico and West were both happy to see that monster out, though everyone else didn't share their optimism. This also included Asami to some extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026so you managed to bring out your Thunder Giant.\" She said. \"But even though it has 2400 Attack points, it still doesn't come close to my Cyber Blader's 3600 Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that.\" Takashi said with a smile. \"But did you forget about my Duel against Nico? My Thunder Giant has to ability to destroy anyone monster who's 'original' Attack Points is less than its own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Original Attacks Points\u2026?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\u2026Attack Points without any type of enhancement.\" Takashi explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026when I first summoned Cyber Blader, her original Attack Points were 2100.\" Asami said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's also right.\" Takashi said. \"That means by discarding one of my cards, your Blader is automatically destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Giant placed his hand in front of Cyber Blader and shocked her with electricity. The shock destroyed the monster, leaving Asami wide open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Thunder Giant, attack Asami's Life Points Directly with your Thunder Beam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elemental Hero charged energy into his chest and soon fired a beam of electricity. The beam hit Asami and dropped her remaining Life Points down to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 300 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This match is over!\"Ashley yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The winner of the Rental Deck Tournament and owner of the Elemental Hero Deck is\u2026Takashi Nakamura!\"Rachel stated. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the Rental Deck Tournament now over, Takashi decided to head back home before he sunsets. As he did he looked at his new Elemental Hero Deck and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can tell that I'm going to win a lot of Duels with this Deck.\" He said to himself. He then brought out his Dragon Deck and the first card that he saw was his Stardust Dragon. \"However\u2026I'll still use this deck. I mean it was the first deck that I ever made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi started to flashback to the time where he first made his Dragon Deck. He was a little boy and Klaus give him his first card, which happened to be Stardust Dragon. Klaus told Takashi that Stardust used to belong to his father and that he should always cherish it. He also told him that one day; Stardust Dragon will open the door to his destiny. Even to this day, Takashi hasn't figured out what Klaus meant when he said that. However he's come up with the assumption that Stardust would help him become a great Turbo Duelist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished flashing back, Takashi put his Dragon Deck back into the Duel Box that he keeps on his belt. He was then about to do the same with his E-Hero Deck, however before he got the chance to do so\u2026a man accidently ran up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026watch where you're going!\" He said as he caught himself from falling on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\u2026!\" The man said. \"I'm in a hurry, the Rental Deck Tournament is about to start and I have to get there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at the man and saw that it was Bronson, a guy who works in the pub where Klaus works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bronson\u2026\" He said. \"What are you doing? Aren't you late for work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson looked up and saw that it was Takashi. He then stood and looked him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the day off today.\" He answered. \"I was going to use my day off to participate in the Rental Deck Tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said. \"But you should know that the Tournament ended a few minutes ago. I just won it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Bronson said in a shock tone. \"Why did they start it without me? I would've been there eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The store clerk said that you were running late and that the Tournament had to begin soon.\" Takashi explained. \"So she just allowed me to take your place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson kicked his boot towards the desert ground and cursed himself for a few seconds. He glared at Takashi and activated the Duel Disk that was attached to his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel me\u2026!\" He said. \"If you won the Tournament, then I'll just defeat you. That way I'll be the true winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at him for a few minutes before nodding his head. He then activated his own Duel Disk and inserted his E-Hero Deck into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card from his deck. He quickly looked at it before looking at all the other cards that were in his hand. He then decided to play the card that he just drew. \"I summon my Elemental Hero Clayman in Defense Mode! With that I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Clayman: ATK 800 DEF 2000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, I draw.\" Bronson said as he drew a card from his deck. He looked at the card and smiled at it. However when he looked at all of the rest of the cards in his hand, his smile faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong\u2026?\" Takashi asked. \"Don't have the cards that you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson looked at him. \"Don't worry about it! I have just the card to fix that problem.\" Bronson placed the card that he drew into the Spell/Trap Zone of his Duel Disk. The card appeared on the field and it had the image of a mallet with wings. \"I play Magical Mallet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magical Mallet\u2026?\" Takashi questioned. \"What does that card do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked.\" Bronson said with a smile. \"Magical Mallet is a Spell Card that allows me to add any number of cards that's in my hand and put them back in my deck. I then reshuffle and draw the cards that I added. I think I'll choose all of my cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked on as Bronson put Magical Mallet in his card Graveyard. He then took the rest of the cards that were in his hand and put them in his deck. The Duel Disk would then automatically shuffle his cards and Bronson would draw few new cards. When he did a smile appeared on his face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got a better hand this time?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026\" Bronson said. \"However there are a few cards that I need that aren't in my hand right now. So I think I'll do this.\" Bronson put a card in his Spell/Trap Zone and the card was revealed to be another Magical Mallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon\u2026!\" Takashi moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis opponent would take two cards from his hand and add them to his deck. The Duel Disk shuffled his cards again and Bronson drew two cards from his deck. When he looked at them, his smile got bigger. He would then place a card on the Monster Card Zone<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon V-Tiger Jet in Attack Mode!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nV-Tiger Jet: ATK 1600 DEF 1800 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hologram of a yellow and green tiger jet appeared on the field. Bronson would then put another card in his Spell/Trap Zone. \"I activate the Continuous Spell, Frontline Base!\" The card appeared on the field and it had the image of a knight riding a black dragon. \"With this card, I can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower Union Monster, once per turn! The monster that I choose to summon is my, W-Wing Catapult!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nW-Wing Catapult: ATK 1300 DEF 1500 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson placed the card on his Monster Zone and soon a blue, twin plane appeared right next to V-Tiger Jet. Takashi wasn't too worried when he looked at the monsters that he was facing. Sure, they were tough looking, but they didn't have enough Attack Points to break through Clayman's Defense. However there is one thing that was on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's a Union Monster\u2026?\" He asked Bronson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Union Monster is a type of Monster that can combine to form one powerful monster.\" Bronson explained. \"For example\u2026I combine my V-Tiger Jet with my W-Wing Catapult to summon my VW- Tiger Catapult!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVW-Tiger Catapult: ATK 2000 DEF 2100 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson's V-Tiger Jet got on top of his W-Wing Catapult. The two monsters then combined and landed on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That still doesn't help you!\" Takashi said. \"Your monster's Attack is just as strong as Clayman's Defense, so it won't be able to destroy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that!' Bronson yelled. \"That's why I'm activating my Tiger Catapult's Special Ability. By discarding one card, my Catapult can force one of your Monsters in Attack Mode!\" Bronson put one his cards into the Graveyard, which suddenly caused Clayman to stop defending. \"Now VW-Tiger Catapult, attack Clayman with your Tiger Missile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiger Catapult fired a missile from its and it headed straight for Clayman.

However he couldn't use that Spell right now so he just put it in his hand. Takashi would then take two cards and place one in the Monster Zone, while he placed the other in the Spell/Trap Zone. \"I summon Elemental Hero Sparkman in Defense Mode. Then, I place one card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Sparkman: ATK 1600 DEF 1400 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkman appeared on the field and sat in a defensive position. Then a face-down card appeared behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026is that all you have?\" Bronson said as he drew a card. \"I expected more from the guy who won the Tournament.\" He placed at card on his Duel Disk. \"I summon my X-Head Cannon, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX-Head Cannon: ATK 1800 DEF 1500 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA robot with two cannons on his shoulders appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I activate Frontline Base, to Special Summon my Z-Metal Tank in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ-Metal Tank: ATK 1500 DEF 1300 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yellow Tank with an eyeball in the middle of it appeared and stood right next to X-Head Cannon. Bronson would then press a button on his Duel Disk, which caused his face-down card to reveal itself. It had the image of graveyard with ghost coming out of the tombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card, Call of the Haunted, to bring back the Y-Dragon Head that I discarded using my Tiger Catapult's ability!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nY-Dragon Head: ATK 1500 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red, robot dragon appeared and stood next to its comrades. Takashi looked on in horror when he saw all of Bronson's monsters on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This\u2026is not\u2026good.\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right Takashi\u2026and it's about to get much worse!\" Bronson said. \"I combine my X-Head Cannon, Y-Dragon Head, and Z-Metal Tank to form the XYZ-Dragon Cannon. Then I combine XYZ-Dragon Cannon with VW-Tiger Catapult to form my ultimate monster, The VWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXYZ-Dragon Cannon: ATK 2800 DEF 2600 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVWXYZ-Dragon Catapult Cannon: ATK 3000 DEF 2800 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe X, Y, and Z robots combined to form a tank sized cannon. Then it combined with VW Tiger Catapult and it turned into a giant robot. When Takashi saw it, it reminded him of a Power Rangers Megazord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Crap\u2026\" He said in shock and awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet Takashi!\" Bronson yelled. \"I activate my Dragon Catapult Cannon's Special Ability. Now I can remove one of your monsters from the Duel and I choose Sparkman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVWXYZ Dragon Catapult Cannon shot a power laser beam from its eyes, which proceeded to hit Takashi's Sparkman. The Elemental Hero then vanished into another dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\u2026!\" Takashi cursed as he took Sparkman's card and put it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Catapult Cannon\u2026Attack Takashi's Life Points!\" Bronson yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Catapult Cannon fired two powerful laser beams from the cannons it had on its shoulders. As the beams were headed towards him Takashi pressed a button on his Duel Disk. His face-down card flipped up and it had the image of a monster coming out of a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Hero Emerges Trap Card!\" He yelled. The lasers beams stopped just before they hit Takashi and they stood in place as the young man continued talking. \"With this Trap, you have to pick a card that's in my hand. If it's a Monster then I can Special Summon it. However if it's a Spell or Trap card, then I have to discard it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha\u2026so this entire Duel is going to be decided by a random guess.\" Bronson said while he was laughing. \"Fine\u2026I choose the 3 card from the right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi slowly looked at the card and smiled. He then placed it on his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Elemental Hero Avian in Defense Mode!\" He yelled confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Avian: ATK 1000 DEF 1000 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winged Elemental Hero got right in front of the Takashi and prepared to take the hit for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't help you!\" Bronson stated. \"I activate VWXYZ Dragon Catapult Cannon's second Special Ability! When it attacks a Monster, I can choose its mode. I choose to switch Avian in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvian stopped blocking as the laser started moving again. The attack hit the Elemental Hero, destroying it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 800 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should surrender Takashi! You have no monsters that can stand up against my powerful Dragon Catapult Cannon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at Bronson and shook his head in disagreement. \"No way\u2026\" He said. \"I never give up. There's always a way to win a Duel. And I'll show you right now! Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi swiftly, but firmly drew a card from his Duel Disk. He slowly looked at it and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Winged Kuriboh in Attack Mode! Next I place on card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinged Kuriboh: ATK 300 DEF 200 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a face-down card appeared on the field, a small brown monster with brown fur, big eyes, green arms and legs, and small angel wings appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the little creature, Bronson couldn't hold back his laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026you're actually\u2026playing that thing\u2026Ha!\" He said. \"You must've gone\u2026insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you heard the story of David and Goliath?\" Takashi asked. \"That story brought true meaning to the phrase, 'big things come in small packages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026this isn't the story of David and Goliath!\" Bronson yelled as he drew a card. \"This is the story of my monster kicking your monster's ass. Show him what I mean VWXYZ Dragon Catapult Cannon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson's monster fired its laser beams at Kuriboh and the attack caused a huge explosion. As the holographic smoke covered the battlefield, Bronson started laughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that! I win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure about that\u2026?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson looked on as the smoke started to clear. He soon saw that Winged Kuriboh was glowing and that a Spell Card with an image of an angel was right next to it. As he pondered what was going on, Takashi explained the situation to his confused opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activated the Quick-Play Spell Card, Transcendent Wings. This card can only be activated when I have Winged Kuriboh on the field. Now by discarding two cards, and sacrificing Winged Kuriboh, I can Special Summon Winged Kuriboh Level 10!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinged Kuriboh Level 10: ATK 300 DEF 200 LVL 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi discarded the two cards had in his hand. This caused Winged Kuriboh to glow even more and soon it had a dragon, with a giant pair of angel wings, on its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lev\u2026level\u2026.10\u2026?\" Bronson stuttered in disbelief. He just couldn't believe at what he just saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi saw the shock on his face and smiled. \"I activate Level 10's Special Ability! By sacrificing itself, Kuriboh can destroy all of your Attack Position monster and deal you damage equal to their Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Bronson said in horror. He saw that Winged Kuriboh glowed so bright that it consumed his Dragon Catapult Cannon. Soon the light faded and both monsters vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 800 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson: 1000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at Bronson and saw that his will was broken. Not wanting to drag the Duel any longer that it needs to he simply drew a card from his Deck and placed it on his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Elemental Hero Wildheart in Attack Mode.\" He said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Wildheart: ATK 1500 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man, wearing jungle clothes and had a large sword, appeared on Takashi's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack his Life Points Directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWildheart ran over towards Bronson and slashed him in the chest with his sword. However Bronson didn't respond the attack, all he did was fall to his knees with a defeated look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 800 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBronson: 0 LP </span></div></div>",

He then walked over towards Bronson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to let you know\u2026the deck I used was the one I won at the Tournament.\" He said. \"So if I can beat you using cards that I'm just getting used to. Then imagine Dueling against my real Deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Takashi left, leaving Bronson to reflect on what he just said to him. Soon a bell started a ring, which caused everyone in Crash Town to jump up. This included Takashi who quickly ran towards his house. You see\u2026when the bell rings, it means that it's sunset and that means that the Radley and Malcolm family about to duke it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he made it inside his house, Takashi was relieved that Klaus was already inside making dinner. He quietly thanked God as he walked inside. Soon the two of them were eating dinner and as Takashi was stuffing his face with rice, beef, and broccoli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026\" Klaus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked at his Grandfather, with tons of food in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow, we're taking a little trip outside of town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\u2026?\" Takashi said as he swallowed the food that was in his mouth. \"Where to\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched his Grandson drinking some juice, Klaus answered his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to Satellite\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi eyes widen as he spat the juice from out of his mouth. Klaus reacted fast and quickly grabbed a pan, so that the liquid would get on it instead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going\u2026to the Satellite?\" Takashi asked in disbelief. \"Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026\" Klaus answered. \"I friend there and has some things I need for the pub. I want to take you along because I don't want you to be at Crash Town all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klaus\u2026\" Takashi said. \"You do know what happens at the Satellite\u2026don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be fine Takashi\u2026\" His grandfather said. \"Don't worry about it too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Takashi was busy laying on his bed thinking about tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what I heard\u2026\" He thought. \"The Satellite is an awful island, separated from New Domino City. It's filled with thugs and killer and all types of other people. Toru thinks that the people who reside there are suffering from an actual 'Living Hell'. However I've also heard rumors of a group of Duelists called 'Team Satisfaction' are trying to helped out the people living there and getting rid of all the thugs. I can't be sure whether or not this is true or not\u2026, but there's only one way to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Takashi and Klaus woke up at the crack of dawn and were preparing to leave in a small car. Just before they were about to get inside, Takashi heard someone calling his name. He turned around and saw that it was Toru, who was running towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi, where are you going?\" He asked. \"I wanted you to help me work on the engine of my Duel Runner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man\u2026\" Takashi replied. \"But Klaus and I are heading for the Satellite. Apparently he needs to get something from a friend, who lives there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Satellite\u2026?\" Toru said in shock. \"Do you know what that place is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head. \"I do, but Klaus says that there is nothing to worry about. I can't be entirely sure if that's true, but there is only way to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Toru said. \"Well if you're going, then can you do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but what is it?\" Takashi asked his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru went into his pocket and pulled out his cell phone. He would then text for a few minutes before finally putting his phone away. Just as he did that Takashi's cell phone started to ring. He pulled it out and saw that he's just received a text message from Toru himself. He would look at his friend with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why text me something, if you're right here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just read it\u2026\" Toru told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi sighed and opened his phone. He then saw that Toru texted him a list of Duel Runner parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friend told me, that the parts I need can be found in the Satellite.\" Toru explained. \"He was going to have one his contacts pick it up for me; however the timetable was around 2 to 4 months. However since you're going, you can pick up the parts for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026I have no problem doing that for you.\" Takashi said. \"However you need to do something for me in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\u2026what would that be?\" Toru asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you finished working on your Duel Runner, I want to be the first one to ride it.\" Takashi said. \"That's all I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru smiled when he heard his childhood friend say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026you do this for me and I'll allow you to ride my Runner as many times as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled. \"Awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the two boys shook hands and went their separate ways. Takashi would go in the car with Klaus and drive into the desert. However their drive only lasted for about an hour as Klaus parked the car by some boulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we parking here?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of the car and find out.\" Klaus said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus got out of the car first, followed by a curious Takashi. The two of them walked towards the boulders and soon saw an opened man-hole near one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back when Crash City was just being built, Radley and Malcolm used this underground tunnel to walk towards New Domino City, without having to cross the desert.\" Klaus explained. \"We can use this abandoned tunnel to make to Satellite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said. \"Then let's stop standing here, with are head up are asses, and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus slapped the young man upside the back of his head. \"Language\u2026!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them went inside the tunnel and used an old railcar to make their journey through the tunnel go by a little faster. After another hour they made it to the end of the tunnel and saw another man-hole entrance. They climbed out the railcar and made their way to it. Takashi was the first one out and got his first real look at the Satellite Sector. There were a lot of old and beat up building and the people that he saw were wearing old and beat up clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa\u2026\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus made it out next, however he didn't look around because he already been to the Satellite before. He would then look at Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm going out to get the things from my friend.\" He said. \"You go and look for the parts that Toru wanted you to get for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right\u2026\" Takashi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked away in opposite directions. Takashi, who was looking around while walking, soon made his way to the pier. As he looked out at the ocean he heard someone crying. He turned and saw a little girl, crying in the middle of the road. He walked up to her and gently patted her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok sweetie\u2026?\" He asked. </span></div></div>",

The two of them then walked all around the area, trying to find Crow. Soon they came across a young man with spiky orange hair and he was calling for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya\u2026Saya where are you?\" He yelled at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at the boy and smiled. \"Over here Crow!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's Crow\u2026\" Takashi thought as he put Saya back on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow turned around and saw Saya waving at him. He sighed with relief and ran towards her. Once he got to her, the two of them hugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are.\" He said. \"I've thought I lost you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow looked up and saw Takashi looking at them. This made Crow angry, so he stood up and grabbed Takashi by his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think you're doing?\" He yelled. \"Were you trying to kidnap this little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi glared at the carrot top as he slapped his hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do mean kidnap? I brought her to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you did!\" Crow replied. \"Then why haven't I seen you here before. No one around here would help a little girl for no reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What..?\" Takashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys glared at each other for several minutes. Soon Crow noticed that Takashi had a Duel Disk on his arm. This gave him an idea, so he activated the Duel Disk that was on his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel me!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel you\u2026?\" Takashi questioned. \"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow simply smirked at him. \"What wrong\u2026are you too much of a chicken shit to Duel me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Crow call him a chicken shit pushed Takashi over the edge. He quickly activated his own Duel Disk and inserted his Dragon Deck into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you asshole! You got yourself a Duel and I hope you're prepared to lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow smiled and soon pressed a button on his Duel Disk. Suddenly a black cable popped out of it and attached itself to Takashi's Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this?\" He asked. \"What you do to my Duel Disk, you bastard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just adding more excitement to this Duel.\" Crow stated. \"That wire carries a very unstable electromagnetic pulse.

His face-down card flipped up and revealed the image of giant vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trap Card Open, Negate Attack!\" He yelled. \"With this card, I can negate your monster's attack and end your Battle Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vortex appeared from out of the card and got in front of Red-Eyes. It then sucked up all of Gale the Whirlwind's wind before finally disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Humph\u2026\" Crow moaned. \"You got lucky on that exchange. I place one card face-down and End my Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Takashi said as he drew a card from his deck. As he placed the card in his hand, he began to think to himself. \"Damn it\u2026I expected that Red-Eyes Attack and Defense would return after that bastard ended his turn. But nothing has happened yet, so it must be a permanent monster effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over his hand and saw a picture of a brown dragon with small wings. He then picked it up and looked at the card some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to get rid of Wyvern.\" He placed the card on his Duel Disk. \"I summon the Tuner Monster, Dread Dragon, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread Dragon: ATK 1100 DEF 400 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon stood right next to the weakened Red-Eyes Wyvern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I tune my Level 4 Red-Eyes Wyvern with my Level 2 Dread Dragon to perform a Synchro Summon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragons flew high into the sky and as Crow looked on, he began to curse himself and Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn that bastard...!\" He silently said. \"I didn't think that he was a Synchro User too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got high enough, Dread Dragon turned into 2 small circles. Red-Eyes Wyvern brought its body into both of the circles and soon its body revealed 4 small level stars. Soon a flash of light covered the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon the Iron Chain Dragon, in Attack Mode!\" Takashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Chain Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 1300 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant blue dragon, with chains all around its chest, appeared from the flash of light and flew towards Takashi. The dragon then glared at both of Crow's Blackwing monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iron Chain Dragon, attack Blackwing-Gale the Whirlwind with your Hell Chains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's dragon roared and flew towards the smallest Blackwing. As it did, the chains that it had around its body began to burn with a dark red color. As the attack was heading towards his monster, Crow pressed a button on his Duel Disk. This caused his face-down card to flip up and it revealed a picture of a monster, getting in front of a another monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card, Shift!\" He yelled. \"With this, I change the target of your attack to another one of my monsters. I choose Blackwing- Bora the Spear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Chain Dragon suddenly stopped flying towards Gale the Whirlwind and started heading towards Bora the Spear. Once it got close enough to it, Iron Chain Dragon wrapped its chains around Bora the Spear and Crow watched his wing-beast burn to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow: 3200 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I activate Iron Chain Dragon's Special Ability!\" Takashi stated. \"When he successfully deals my opponent Battle Damage, he must discard 3 cards from his Deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow moans as he took the top three cards from his Deck and placed them in his Card Graveyard. Iron Chain Dragon then flew back over to Takashi and began hovering above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place two cards face-down and end my turn.\" Takashi said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo face-down cards appeared right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026I Draw!\" Crow yelled as he drew a card from his deck. \"You bastard\u2026I'll make you pay for that. I activate Gale the Whirlwind's Special Ability!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGale the Whirlwind flapped its wings at a very high speed and created another tornado. He then through it at Iron Chain Dragon, but Takashi was prepared for it. He pressed a button on his Duel Disk and one his face-down cards flipped it. The image on the card had the image of a dragon roaring at the top of its lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Dragon's roar Trap Card.\" He yelled. \"With it I can negate the activation of a Monster, Spell, or Trap effect that targets one of my Dragon Monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Chain Dragon starting roaring as loud as it could. The power of the roar created shockwaves, which destroyed Gale the Whirlwind's tornado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow was mad at Takashi's move, but he was able to refocus himself and continued on with his turn. </span></div></div>",

This one was purple and it looked like a ghost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I tune my Blackwing- Calima the Haze with my Blackwing- Gale the Whirlwind, in order to Synchro Summon Blackwing Armor Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackwing Armor Master: ATK 2500 DEF 1500 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Crow's monsters flew into the air and did the same thing that Takashi's Dragons did before. Gale the Whirlwind turned into 3 shiny circles and Calima the Haze put its body through them. Then, as Calima's body revealed 4 shiny stars, a flash of light covered it. Shortly after that a new monster flew down beside Crow. This one looked more like a man who was wearing armor. The armor covered most of the man's boy and it even included a pair of steel wings on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackwing Armor Master, attack his Iron Chain Dragon with your Black Hurricane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Takashi said with a confused looked on his face. \"Both of our monsters have the same number of Attack Points. If they fight, then they'll just destroy each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow didn't say anything and just watched his monster begin his attack. He saw Armor Master fire several steel feathers from his wings and all of them headed for Iron Chain Dragon. Takashi's monster attempted to block the feather with its chains, but it couldn't. It soon died in a hurricane of steel feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026what just happened\u2026?\" Takashi wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow smirked when Takashi asked his question. He then decided to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my Armor Master's Special Ability.\" He said. \"He can't be destroyed in battle. Also, his second Special Ability prevents me from taking any battle damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\u2026\" Takashi thought. \"That's going to be a pain to get rid of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow took two cards from his hand and put them in his Duel Disk. The image of those cards appeared behind his Armor Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place two cards face-down and end my turn\u2026\" He said with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card. He took a look at it and sighed. He then placed it on his Duel Disk. After doing that he inserted a card into his device. \"I place one card face-down and a Monster Card in Defense Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face-down Monster Card, which was placed horizontally, and a face-down Spell/Trap Card appeared on Takashi's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that's all you can do\u2026?\" Crow questioned as he drew a card. \"How sad\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and make you move, you prick!\" Takashi yelled. \"You're wasting my time here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow smirked again as he placed the card he drew into his hand. He would then take out another card and proceeded to insert it inside of his Duel Disk. The card appeared on the field and it was Monster Reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Monster Reborn!\" He said. \"I'll use it to bring back Blackwing- Bora the Spear.\" In a flash of light, Bora the Spear returned and stood next to Armor Master. Crow would then place a card in his Monster Card Zone. \"Next I Normal Summon the Tuner Monster, Blackwing- Mistral the Silver Shield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackwing- Mistral the Silver Shield: ATK 100 DEF 1800 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new Blackwing monster appeared beside Crow. This one was about the size of a crow and it had a giant shield attached to its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I tune my Level 4 Bora the Spear with my Level 2 Mistral the Silver Shield to Synchro Summon my Blackwing Armed Wing in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackwing Armed Wing: ATK 2300 DEF 1000 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow's monster flew into the air and performed the sequence for Synchro Summoning. Once they were done a new Blackwing monster appeared and stood next to Crow. This one had some similarities to Armor Master in terms of appearance. However the main differences are that it had a lot of real feathers all over its body and it also had real wings. It also carried a spear gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackwing Armor Master, attack his face-down card with Black Hurricane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmor Master fired another hurricane, filled with steel feather. The attack destroyed Takashi's face-down until there was nothing left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Blackwing Armed Wing, attack his Life Points directly! Black Charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Wing pointed his spear gun at Takashi and prepared to fire it at him. However, before it could, Takashi activated one of his face-downs. The card flipped up and revealed an image of different colored goats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell, Scapegoat!\" He yelled. \"With it I can Special Summon 4 Sheep Tokens, all of which I place in Defense Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red, blue, orange and pink goat appeared and surrounded Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't help you!\" Crow stated. \"Continue your attack Armed Wing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackwing Armed Wing fired his spear gun. The spear quickly ran through the red sheep and hit Takashi in the chest. Thinking that he was actually hurt, Takashi fell to one knee and groaned in pain. He then noticed that his Life Point meter was dropping at an incredible rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 1200 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow: 3200 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026the fuck?\" He said in shock. \"How did I lose almost \u00be of my Life Points?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all because of my Armed Wing's Special Ability.\" Crow said. \"When he attacks a monster who's Defense is lower than his Attack, then the difference is taken out of my opponent's Life Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then\u2026my Life Points should be at 1700.\" Takashi stated. \"How in the hell did Armed Wing gain an extra 500 Attack Points?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple\u2026Blackwing Armed Wing possesses a second Special Ability. When he attacks a Monster in Defense Mode, he gains an extra 500 points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Takashi cursed. \"This Blackwings are really starting to piss me off. I can't destroy Armor Master and Armed Wing can still damage me, even when my Monsters are in Defense Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at his Duel Disk and saw the cord that was on it. He proceeded to glare at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't give up. If I lose this Duel, then I can say goodbye to my Duel Disk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi got on his feet and proceeded to draw a card from his deck. He slowly looked at it and when he did he saw the image of a blue dragon. He would then look at his Sheep Token.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed another card from his hand and inserted it inside of his Duel Disk. The image of the card had a shining star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Reincarnation of Hope! By discarding two Monster cards I can add a new Monster to my hand on my Second Standby Phase. Next I summon the Tuner Monster, Debris Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDebris Dragon: ATK 1000 DEF 2000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takashi was discarding cards to his Graveyard, Debris Dragon appeared on the field and glared at Crow's Monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I tune all of my Level 1 Sheep Tokens with my Level 4 Debris Dragon to Synchro Summon Exploder Dragonwing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExploder Dragonwing: ATK 2400 DEF 1600 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Takashi's monsters combined to form a brand new Synchro Monster. This was creepy looking at and was mostly all purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a tough looking monster.\" Crow said in a sarcastic tone. \"I mean, sure you'll be able to take out Armed Wing, but I'll lose 100 Life Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll lose more than that!\" Takashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis opponent was confused at his statement, so Takashi decided to explain to him what he meant when he said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When my dragon attacks a monster whose original Attack Points is equal or less than its own, then Exploder Dragonwing can destroy that monster. Also, when that happens my opponent loses Life Points equal to the destroyed monster's Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026!\" Crow yelled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026!\" Takashi yelled. \"Exploder Dragonwing, attack Blackwing- Armed Wing with King's Storm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's dragon opened its mouth and fired a firestorm at Armed Wing. The flames were too intense for the Crow's Synchro monster and it died in the massive sea of flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 1200 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow: 900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow drew a card from his deck. He then glared at Takashi's dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackwing- Armor Master, destroy Exploder Dragonwing!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmor Master fired another stream of steel feathers, all of which hit Exploder Dragonwing and killed it instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 1100 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow: 900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow then pulled out a card from his hand and inserted it into his Duel Disk. The card revealed itself to be, Mystical Space Typhoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like those face-downs you have there.\" He said. So let me get rid of one of them for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe typhoon appeared from the card and destroyed the face-down card that was to the right of Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard\u2026!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asshole\u2026!\" Crow replied. \"I end my turn.\" </span></div></div>",

With that I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cards appeared on Takashi's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026Draw!\" Crow yelled. \"I summon Blackwing- Kalut the Moon Shadow in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackwing- Kalut the Moon Shadow: ATK 1400 DEF 1000 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small Blackwing, with yellow feathers on the top of its head, appeared on Crow's field. The Blackwing Duelist would then press a button on his Duel Disk, causing one his face-down cards to activate. The card flipped up and had the image of a bird, which was being struck lightning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card, Icarus Attack! By Sacrificing a Wing-Beast I have on the field, I can destroy 2 cards. I choose to sacrifice Kalut the Moon Shadow, to destroy your two face-down cards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything happened Takashi pressed a button on his Duel Disk, to activate one his face-downs. The card flipped up and it revealed an image of Stardust Dragon coming out of a stream of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Starlight Road Trap!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starlight\u2026Road?\" Crow questioned. \"What the hell is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starlight Road is a special Trap Card, which can only be activated when a card that can destroy 2 of my cards is activated.\" Takashi explained. \"I can destroy that card and Special Summon my Stardust Dragon, Synchro Monster, from my Extra Deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 2000 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow's Icarus Attack shattered into a million pieces as Takashi grabbed his Stardust Dragon card from his Extra Deck. He firmly placed it on his Duel Disk and the beautiful, but powerful dragon appeared. The Blackwing Duelist was amazed at the sight of the dragon, as he's never seen that card before in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get that card?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It belonged to my father.\" Takashi explained. \"When I was a baby he died, but before he did he gave the card and all cards relating to it, to my Grandfather. He also told him to give them to me, when I was old enough\u2026at least that's what I was told.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026well that is amazing dragon you have there.\" Crow said. \"Too bad it has to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Takashi asked. \"You make sound like Stardust Dragon is not going to survive this turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Crow said as he pressed a button on his Duel Disk. Crow's last face-down opened and it had the image of a bunch of birds gathering around a giant. \"I activate the Blackwing Barrage Trap Card.\" With it I can destroy one monster on the field, as long I remove the number of Blackwings whose level equal that of the destroyed monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so...!\" Takashi yelled. \"I activate Stardust Dragon's Special Ability, Victim Sanctuary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victim\u2026what?\" Crow questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victim Sanctuary\u2026\" Takashi repeated. \"By sacrificing itself, Stardust Dragon can negate the effect of a card that destroys other cards and destroy them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon glowed started glowing so bright that Crow's Trap Card exploded. However by doing that, Stardust Dragon vanished into thin air. Crow was amazed at what just happened, but he soon noticed that Takashi didn't have any monsters on his field to defend himself with. This brought a small smile, onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wide open!\" He yelled. \"Blackwing Armor Master, attack his Life Points Directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmor Master looked at Takashi and fired a barrage of steel feathers at him. However, just before the feathers hit him, the spirit of a white dragon surrounded Takashi and protected him from the assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Crow\u2026\" He said. \"But I activated the Special Ability of my White Dragon. When it's in my Graveyard, I can remove from the game so that I can end my opponent's Battle Phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026I never destroyed that card!\" Crow said to him. \"When did you put it in your Graveyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back when I played Reincarnation of Hope.\" Takashi answered. \"Remember, I had to discard two monsters cards from my hand in order to use it. One of the cards I discarded was my White Dragon. I choose it; because I wanted to be sure I could have another turn even though I didn't have any monsters to defend myself with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow was left speechless, as he didn't expect Takashi to think that far ahead. With no more moves to make Crow said 4 words he really didn't want to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that Takashi's Duel Disk glowed from his Graveyard. Soon Stardust Dragon appeared back on the field and it looked ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026I forgot to mention that Stardust Dragon has a second Special Ability.\" Takashi explained. \"When he uses Victim Sanctuary, then he can return to the field during that turn's End Phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow's mouth was opened so wide that a bird could fly into his mouth. This caused Takashi to laugh a little as he began his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man, didn't activate Reincarnation of Hope because he knew that he didn't need to anymore. So he just drew a card from his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon attack Blackwing- Kalut the Moon Shadow, Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust flew up high into the air. He then fired a powerful blast of cosmic energy from his mouth. The blast destroyed Kalut the Moon Shadow, created an explosion that caused Crow to fall to one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 1100 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Crow's Life Points dropped to zero, the cable that he attached to Takashi's Duel Disk popped off. Takashi checked to see if his device was working and was revealed that it was. He then walked over to Crow, who was just standing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen man\u2026I wasn't trying to kidnap that little girl.\" He explained. \"I just happen to find her and brought her to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow looked at Saya, who was watching the entire Duel. \"Is this true?\" He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya gently nodded her head. \"I couldn't find you and ended up becoming lost.\" She explained to him. \"But this guy found me and helped me find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Crow said. He looked back a Takashi. \"Sorry man\u2026I didn't know. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi thought for a moment before giving Crow his answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do 2 things for me and we have a deal.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\u2026\" Crow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First\u2026where is the Hardware Store? My friend needs parts for his Duel Runner.\" Takashi asked. \"You see, we both live in place called Crash Town and it's in the desert. He asked me to get the parts to him because I just happened to be going to Satellite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Crow said. He then pointed to the north of him. \"If you go that way, you'll come across a fork in the road. Take a right and you'll be at the Hardware store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026and now for my second thing.\" Takashi said. He quickly punched Crow in the face which caused the Blackwing Duelist to fall on the floor in pain. \"Ok\u2026I'm done.\" Takashi began to walk away. \"Oh yeah\u2026my name is Takashi Nakamura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow wanted to react to being punched, but he knew that he deserved to get clobbered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi followed the directions that he was given and after about 30 minutes of walking, he soon made it to the hardware store. As he went inside, he saw that the place was dump. </span></div></div>",

Along with her red hair, she had a black a white jacket on, light purple eyes, a nice figure, and medium sized breasts. As he looked at her Takashi started blushing, which he girl quickly noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" She asked him. \"Your face is red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi quickly stood up completely as he looked at her with an embarrassed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm\u2026I'm fine\u2026\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl smiled at him. \"That's good.

The goon who punched him in the stomach attempted to stop him, but Lilly attached a cord onto his Duel Disk, prevent him from going any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you don't\u2026\" She said with a sly smile on her face. \"He's off limits, but if you want to play with someone\u2026I'm right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goon glared at her. \"Don't get in my way you little bitch!\" He yelled. \"You don't want to mess with me; Goro Ishida!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong\u2026you scared?\" Lilly asked while she was still smiled. \"Are you afraid to get your ass kicked by this little bitch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro became even angrier at Lilly and proceeded to turn towards her. He then activated his Duel Disk and Lilly did the exact same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first\u2026Draw!\" Goro said as he drew a card from his Deck. \"I summon UFO Turtle in Attack Mode. Then I place one card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUFO Turtle: ATK 1400 DEF 1200 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant turtle with a small UFO on its back appeared on Goro's side of the field. Behind the turtle was a face-down card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Lilly yelled as he drew a card. She looked at it and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Magician's Valkyria in Attack Mode!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician's Valkyria: ATK 1600 DEF 1800 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female magician, who was wearing clothes similar to Dark Magician Girl's, appeared on the field. The magician had brown hair, blue eyes, and was carrying a hook-shaped staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack Magician, with you Mystic Scepter Blast!\" Lilly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician's Valkyria pointed her staff at UFO Turtle and prepared to charge energy into it. Once she was done, she fired the blast and it destroyed Goro's Turtle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro: 3800 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for doing that!\" Goro yelled. \"Since you destroyed my UFO Turtle as a result of battle I can Special Summon a Fire Monster from my deck, as long as it's Attack Points is 1500 or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro took his Deck from out of his Duel Disk and soon began searching for a card. After about a minute of looking, Goro found the card he wanted. He took it out and put his deck back into his Duel Disk. Then, as his Duel Disk was reshuffling his deck, Goro placed the card onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon; Solar Flare Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolar Flare Dragon: ATK 1500 DEF 1000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant dragon, who had flames all over its body, appeared next to Goro. It then roared at Lilly, but she was intimidated by it. She simply took a card from her hand and inserted it inside of her Duel Disk. The image of the card was face-down and it was behind Magician's Valkyria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place one card face-down and End my Turn.\" She said calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my Turn!\" Goro yelled as he firmly drew a card from his deck. When he looked at it he started laughing like a madman. \"You're in for now, you whore! I drew one of my best cards, and it's going to finish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really\u2026\" Lilly said as she was yawning. Even though the Duel just started, she was already bored out her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes really, you bitch!\" Goro yelled as he noticed the bored look on Lilly's face. \"Let me show you who it is! I summon my Little Chimera in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Chimera: ATK 600 DEF 500 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small little beast, which to Lilly looked like a combination of a horse and a cat, appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big deal\u2026\" She said. \"I'm not afraid of your horse-cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a horse-cat!\" Goro screamed. \"It's a Chimera! You know, the combination of two animals into one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\u2026\" Lilly said. \"Just continue on with you turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\u2026!\" Gora agreed. \"I activate my Little Chimera's Special Ability. For as long as it remains on my side of the field, all of my Fire Monsters will 500 extra Attack Points. This also includes Little Chimera too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolar Flare Dragon: ATK 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Chimera: ATK 1100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful flame surrounded Goro's Chimera while the flames on his Dragon became even more intense. Goro would then take a card and put it inside of his Duel Disk. The card appeared on the field and it was Monster Reborn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card; Monster Reborn! With it, I'll revive my UFO Turtle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro's turtle reappeared on the field and stood next to his other Fire Monsters. A flame would then appear on its back, while the flames on Solar Flare Dragon and Little Chimera grew even more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that a new Fire Monster is on my field, Little Chimera's Ability activates. Giving them another 500 extra Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolar Flare Dragon: ATK 2500<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle Chimera: ATK 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUFO Turtle: ATK 1900<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at all of her opponents monsters and yawned again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I supposed to be impressed by this or something\u2026?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her say that made Goro even more mad. \"You should!\" He yelled. \"I'm about to defeat you! Attack my Fire Creatures!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Goro's monsters combined their attacks and launched a giant stream of fire, which was big enough to not only take out Magician's Valkyria, but Lilly as well. However, before the flames hit its target, Lilly pressed a button on her Duel Disk. This activated her face-down card and as it flipped up it revealed the image of a laser being bounced off a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Mirror Force Trap Card!\" She yelled. \"With it, I can negate your attack and destroy all the monsters you have in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Goro said in shock. \"All of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Lilly stated. \"That means all 3 of your Monsters are automatically destroyed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful mirror suddenly appeared in front of Magician's Valkyria and protected her from the fire. The mirror would then absorb the power of the flames and redirect it back at Goro's Monsters, destroying all of them. Once all of Goro's monsters were destroyed, Lilly started yawning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I'm bored\u2026\" She said. \"You have got to be the weakest Duelist I ever faced.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\u2026!\" Goro yelled. \"Would a weak Duelist do this?\" He pressed a button on his Duel Disk. His face-down card flipped up and revealed a Call of the Haunted Trap. \"I activate Call of the Haunted, bringing back my Solar Flare Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro's Dragon popped out of the card and stood next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh\u2026yeah\u2026a weak Duelist would do that.\" Lilly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\u2026!\" Goro yelled. \"I End my Turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally\u2026Draw!\" Lilly said as she drew a card from her Deck. She looked at it and smiled before placing it in her hand. She then took out another card and placed it on her Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Summon Silent Magician LV4!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician LV4: ATK 1000 DEF 1000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little girl with white a blue clothes, white hair, white eyes, and was holding a small white staff appeared on Lilly side of the field and stood next to Magician's Valkyria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I attack Solar Flare Dragon with my Magician's Valkyria! Mystic Scepter Blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician's Valkyria fired a blast of green energy at Solar Flare Dragon, destroying it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro: 3700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll have my Silent Magician LV 4 attack you Life Points directly. Go, Magical Wave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small Magician waved her staff, releasing a wave of white energy. The attack hit Goro, causing him to flinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro: 2700 LP </span></div></div>",

When the glowing stopped, Silent Magician LV4 looked like a 10-year-old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician LV4: ATK 1500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't help you!\" Goro said as he placed a card on his Duel Disk. \"I summon Blazing Inpachi in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazing Inpachi: ATK 1850 DEF 0 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro's monster looked like a man made out of wood, that had its body completely covered in fire. On its chest was the number 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attack that stupid Silent Magician with your Fireball Attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlazing Inpachi fired a fireball Silent Magician's\u2026however Lilly activated a face-down card and magical barrier surrounded both Silent Magician and Magician's Valkyria. Goro was shocked at what just took placed and look at the card Lilly had activated. The card had a picture of two magicians being side a magical barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that card\u2026?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my Magician's Shield Trap Card.\" Lilly explained. \"When I have two Spellcaster-Type Monsters on my side of the field, I can negate one of your attacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro cursed himself and proceeded to play a card face-down, that card was destroyed as soon as played it because Lilly activated her other face-down card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\u2026, but my Mystical Space Typhoon Spell will get rid of that face-down card.\" Lilly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\u2026\" Goro cursed. \"I\u2026I End my Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Lilly said as she drew a card. \"I'm ending this before I fall asleep. So I sacrifice my Silent Magician LV4 to Summon Dark Magician Girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl: ATK 2000 DEF 1700 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly's Silent Magician disappeared in a flash of light as her Dark Magician Girl appeared on the field to take her place. The magician had long blond hair, green eyes, and was wearing pink and blue magician's clothes. She would then stand next to Magician's Valkyria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This\u2026this is bad\u2026\" Goro said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026you're right about that.\" Lilly replied. \"And it's about to get a lot worse for you!\" Lilly placed a card into her Duel Disk and as the card appeared it had the image of two shaking hands. \"I activated the Equip Spell; United We Stand and equip it to Magician's Valkyria! With this card, my Valkyria gains 800 Attack and Defense Points for every Monster on my side of the field. Counting both Dark Magician girl and herself, Magician's Valkyria receives a 1600 point power boost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician's Valkyria: ATK 3200 DEF 3400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\u2026Dark Magician Girl, take out his Blazing Inpachi and Magician's Valkyria attack his Life Points Directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Magician's placed their staffs together and fired a power stream of magical energy at both Blazing Inpachi and Goro. The attack hit them and as Inpachi turned to ashes, Goro's Life Points dropped to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the holograms disappeared, Goro's Duel Disk appeared due to the electromagnetic cord that Lilly placed on it before the Duel began. Lilly would then walk over to him and grab him by his shirt collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026who's black and blue all over?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who\u2026?\" Goro questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026\" Lilly answered. She took her right fist and began punching him repeatedly in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilly was kicking Goro's ass, Takashi continued chasing after Gordon. The two kept running until Gordon went inside an abandoned building. Takashi walked inside the place and quickly noticed that Gordon was nowhere to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coward\u2026\" He silently thought. \"Running away like a frightened animal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Crash Town resident started looking around the house, trying to find Gordon. As he was looking, Gordon was in the shadows looking at him. He slowly brought a knife out his pocket and slowly walked towards Takashi. Once he got close enough to him, Goro prepared to stab the young man in the back. However, Takashi saw Gordon's shadow on the wall and was able to avoid his strike without even turning his head. He then grabbed Gordon by the wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" He yelled. He punched Gordon in the chest, causing him to spit out blood. He then kicked him towards the wall. \"Run away and attack people from behind\u2026you've got to be the biggest coward on the face of the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi slowly walked towards Gordon and was prepared to beat the crap out him. Thinking, quickly Gordon started looking all around Takashi's body and soon noticed his Duel Disk. That's when he got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's Duel!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel\u2026?\" Takashi questioned. \"Why should we\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon slowly got to his feet and pulled out a Duel Disk that he had with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon now\u2026don't you have any pride?\" He said. \"As a Duelist, you should accept any challenged that's placed in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi pondered Gordon's words for a few seconds. He then started walking towards him again. This scared Gordon so he came up with another idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about this then\u2026you beat me in a Duel and I'll return the parts to you.\" He suggested. \"I beat you and you have to leave me alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi stopped and glared at him. \"You're scum\u2026\" He said. \"And it'll be fun to wipe scum like you off the face of the Earth. I accept your stupid proposal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi and Gordon walked into an empty room with a lot of space. Before the Duel began, Takashi took his Dragon Deck out his Duel Disk and put it in the deck case, which was near his right pocket. He then opened the deck case that was near his left pocket and took out his Elemental Hero Deck. He then proceeded to place it in his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This bastard doesn't have the right to face my dragons.\" He thought. \"He needs to face justice\u2026and no better cards to do that, than my Elemental Heroes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Gordon and Takashi activated their Duel Disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first\u2026\" Gordon said as he drew a card and placed it in his hand. He then opened the Field Spell Card Zone of his Duel Disk and placed a card in it. As he closed it a holographic ocean kingdom surrounded both him and Takashi. \"I activate the Field Spell; A Legendary Ocean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked around the area and saw virtual fish all over the place. He also saw that his clothes were moving, like he really underwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These...solid images are amazing.\" He thought. \"I've never get tired of seeing them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takashi was being amazed by the scenery, Gordon placed a card on his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place a Monster in Defense Mode and End my Turn.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he heard the words, End my Turn, Takashi refocused himself and got his mind back on the Duel</span></div></div>",

He looked at it and smiled before inserting it into his Duel Disk. When the card revealed itself it turned out to be a Polymerization Card. Takashi would then place two cards into his Graveyard. \"I play Polymerization, fusing my Elemental Hero Avian with Elemental Hero Burstinatrix to Fusion Summon; Elemental Hero Flame Wingman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Flame Wingman: ATK 2100 DEF 1200 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvian and Burstinatrix appeared on the field and fused together to form Flame Wingman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go Flame Wingman\u2026attack his face-down Monster with your; Flame Shoot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlame Wingman fired a powerful flame from his dragon arm. The flames destroyed the face-down Monster, which turned out to be a blue bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've activated my Mother Grizzly's Special Ability!\" Gordon said. \"When it's destroyed as a result of battle, I can Special Summon a Water Monster from my deck with 1500 Attack Points or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMother Grizzly: ATK 1400 DEF 1000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what\u2026?\" Takashi stated. \"By destroying your monster, my Flame Wingman's Special Ability activates.

He then pulled out the card he wanted and put it in his hand before putting his deck back into his Duel Disk. Then, as his Duel Disk reshuffled his deck, Gordon placed the card he found onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appear, Amphibious Bugroth MK-3!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmphibious Bugroth MK-3: ATK 1500 DEF 1300 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA robot with, jet missiles, on its back appeared on Gordon's side of the field.

Two face-down cards appeared behind Flame Wingman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn again\u2026Draw!\" Gordon said as he drew a card. \"I attack with Bugroth, go Water Missile!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurgroth fired a powerful blast of water from its missile. However instead of hitting Flame Wingman, the attack hit Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2300 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon: 2600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck!\" Takashi screamed. \"How the hell did your monster attack my Life Points directly when I have a monster on my field? Also how the hell did I lose 1700 Life Points when Burgroth only has 1500 Attack Points?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be glad to explain it to you.\" Gordon said in a sly tone. \"You see my Field Spell, A Legendary Ocean, raises the Attack and Defense Points of all of my Water Monsters by 200.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmphibious Burgroth MK-3: ATK 1700 DEF 1500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also\u2026my Burgroth Special Ability allows it to attack my opponent's Life Points when the Field Spell; Umi is on the field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that really pissed off Takashi. \"Umi isn't of the field you dick!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one of a Legendary Ocean's powers allows it to be treated as Umi.\" Gordon calmly told Takashi. \"Now\u2026I place one card face-down and End my Turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon inserted a card into his Duel Disk and it appeared next behind Burgroth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card from his deck. \"Flame Wingman, destroy his Burgroth!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Flame Wingman prepared to fire its flames at Burgroth, Gordon pressed a button on his Duel Disk.

The flames simply bounced off the bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Takashi said. He looked at his hand and took a card out. He would place the card face-down on his Monster Card Zone. \"I place a monster in Defense Mode and End my Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face-down card appeared right next to Flame Wingman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn again\u2026Draw!\" Gordon said. He drew a card from his deck and when he looked at it he smiled. He would then place it on his Duel Disk. \"I sacrifice my Amphibious Burgroth MK-3 to Summon; Levia-Dragon \u2013 Daedalus in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevia-Dragon \u2013 Daedalus: ATK 2600 DEF 1500 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant, blue, water dragon appeared on Gordon's field after his Burgroth vanished from it. Takashi was in awe at the beast, but soon realized something that made him angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the fuck did you summon a Level 7 Monster with only 1 sacrifice?\" He asked. \"You need 2 sacrifices in order to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Legendary Ocean\u2026\" Gordon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck!\" Takashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When A Legendary Ocean is out on the field, the Level of all my Water Monsters are reduced by 1. Meaning Daedalus is a Level 6 Monster instead of a Level 7 Monster. So I can summon it with just 1 sacrifice.

Takashi's monsters, his face-down, and even A Legendary Ocean too. It sucked everything away and as the area turned back into the abandoned building, only Daedalus remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, because it activated its ability, Daedalus' stats return to normal.\" Gordon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevia-Dragon \u2013 Daedalus: ATK 2600 DEF 1500 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well my friend, but\u2026YOU LOSE! Daedalus, attack his Life Points directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaedalus fired a huge blast of water at Takashi and as the water covered him Gordon started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you like that, you bitch! That's what you get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you calling a bitch?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon looked on and was shocked that the attack didn't affect Takashi's Life Points. Before he could ask him what happened, Takashi pulled showed him his Winged Kuriboh card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinged Kuriboh: ATK 300 DEF 200 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your dragon destroyed all the cards of the field, it activated my Winged Kuriboh's Special Ability.\" He explained. \"When it's sent from the field to the Graveyard, I can't lose Life Points as a result of battle for the remainder of the turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon was speechless at what just happened. He assumed that he had the Duel won right, but like a virus that mutated to preserve itself, Takashi was still in the Duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026you bastard.\" He said. \"I'll get you next round!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card from his deck. \"Sorry Gordon, but there isn't going to be a next turn for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" A confused Gordon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you\u2026\" Takashi said. He took the card from out of his hand and placed it on his Monster Card Zone. \"I summon Elemental Hero Sparkman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Sparkman: ATK 1600 DEF 1400 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of light, Takashi's Sparkman appeared on the field and stood right next to him. Takashi would then insert the card that he drew into his Duel Disk. The card appeared on the field and it had the image of two cards fusing together and in the middle of them was the letter H.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card; Miracle Fusion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miracle Fusion\u2026what the hell is that?\" Gordon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you asked.\" Takashi said with a smile on his face. \"Usually I can only fuse cards that are either on my field or in my hand. However with Miracle Fusion, I can fuse Elemental Hero Monsters that are in my field with Elemental Hero Monsters that are in my Graveyard! All I have to do is remove the Fusion Material Monsters from the Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Gordon said in shock. \"Your Graveyard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse my Elemental Hero Sparkman, that's on my field, with the Elemental Hero Flame Wingman, that's in my Graveyard, to Fusion Summon; Elemental Hero Shinning Flare Wingman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Shinning Flare Wingman: ATK 2500 D</span></div></div>",

The sight of the two monsters shocked Gordon a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Shinning Flare Wingman's Special Ability.\" Takashi said. \"For every Elemental Hero that's in my Graveyard, he gains 300 extra Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spirits of Avian and Burstinatrix flew inside of Shinning Flare Wingman, increasing its overall Attack Power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Shinning Flare Wingman: ATK 3100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also...let me tell you something really important.\" Takashi said Gordon, who looked like he was about to shit his pants. \"Elemental Hero Shinning Flare Wingman possesses the same Ability as Elemental Hero Flame Wingman. When it destroys a monster in battle, my opponent takes damage equal to that monster's Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026no\u2026!\" Gordon yelled in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Gordon\u2026YOU LOSE!\" Takashi yelled. \"Attack Shinning Flare Wingman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinning Flare Wingman started glowing even brighter than before.

The glow was so bright that Gordon's eyes started to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2300 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the holograms disappeared, and the room became dark again, Takashi walked over towards Gordon, who was busy covering his eyes in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you bastard\u2026\" He said. \"Keep your end of the deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon moved his hands and looked at Takashi. Acting on instinct, Gordon brought his knife back out and began swinging it around. However, because Shinning Flare Wingman blinded him a little, he couldn't see Takashi clearly allow the young Duelist to avoid the strike very easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi soon became bored though so he decided to end this. He grabbed the hand that held the knife Gordon was holding and made him drop it. He then began to punch Gordon's face repeatedly for about 10 minutes. Once he was done, Gordon fell to the floor a bloody mess. Takashi would retrieve not only Toru's parts, but the money he used to buy them. He then started to walk away, but not before telling a knocked out Gordon something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know the saying Gordon\u2026Payback's a Bitch!\" </span></div></div>",

Besides, it's my problem and I should be the one to settle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued running as fast as he could, trying to waste a single second. He found Team Satisfaction, but was shocked at what he also found. He saw that the goons that got in Takashi's way were on the ground and they were beaten up pretty badly. He also saw that all 3 of the goons Duel Disks were completely destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly saw Takashi and proceeded to walk over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" She asked. \"Did you take care of Gordon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi ignored her question and continued to look at the goons. Seeing that, Lilly slapped him in the face where his newly formed scar was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pay attention!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain from his scar and the force from her slap made Takashi focus all of his attention on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked if you were ok and took care of Gordon?\" Lilly asked again while glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026I took care of that bastard.\" Takashi answered while holding his face. \"But no, I'm not ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not\u2026?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have a huge cross-shaped scar on the left side of my face and violent female just slapped me in the place as the scar!\" Takashi stated while glaring at her. \"That's why I'm not ok!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly calmed down after realizing what Takashi said was true. She would then gently rub his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\u2026\" She said with a tone of regret in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi blushed when she was rubbing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's\u2026it's no big deal\u2026\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please don't petty him Lilly!\" The man with the black hair said as he walking towards Takashi and Lilly. \"If he's so weak to get hurt by those weaklings\u2026then he deserves to get beaten up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi turned his attention to the man and walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you say\u2026?\" He said in an angry tone of voice. \"Just who deserves to get beaten up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do\u2026\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi attempted to punch him, but the man simply blocked the blow. He then through him into a nearby pile of metal garbage cans. Lilly ran up to Takashi and helped him to his feet. She then glared at the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alistair\u2026!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" He said. \"You know it's true\u2026right Kalin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlistair turned to the man with white, who proceeded to shrug his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me involved in this.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon Kalin, you're just afraid to answer because Lilly, your girlfriend, is here.\" Alistar stated. \"You're just afraid to get your ass kicked by her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And is there anything wrong with that\u2026\" Kalin calmly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlistair was about to say something else, but stopped when he sensed something vicious behind him. He turned around and saw that Lilly was giving him a death glare, which had a lot of killing intent. Takashi saw this and almost pissed his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alistar\u2026\" She said. \"Shut up\u2026now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlistair slowly nodded his head. Lilly would then stop glaring and looked at Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you had to see that\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's\u2026it's\u2026ok.\" Takashi stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, from out of nowhere, Crow appeared and ran up to all of them. He looked at the scenery and sighed out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it guys\u2026\" He moaned. \"You could have a least save something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKalin looked at Crow and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, but that's the way the cookie crumbles.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow sighed again before seeing Takashi with Lilly. He would then walk up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man, what are you doing here?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi scratched the back of his head as he pondered Crow's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a damn good question.\" He thought. \"One minute I'm busy grabbing some parts and the next minute I'm here looking at all the members of Team Satisfaction.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a damn good question.\" He thought. \"One minute I'm busy grabbing some parts and the next minute I'm here looking at all the members of Team Satisfaction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was attacked by Gordon and his thugs.\" Lilly answered for him. \"We showed up when things got to rough and allowed him to take care of Gordon himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Crow said. He then started to remember his Duel with Takashi. \"Hey guys\u2026I just remembered something about this guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it..?\" Alistar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow walked over to Takashi and looked him in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026can you show us that dragon you used to defeat me?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Crow say that shocked Lilly, Kalin and especially Alistar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you mean my Stardust Dragon?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026that\u2026your Stardust Dragon.\" Crow replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi went and grabbed his Dragon Deck. He then began to search through all of his cards until he found Stardust Dragon. He then showed it to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of Team Satisfaction looked at Takashi's card and, in their own way, were impressed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this card\u2026?\" Kalin asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It belonged to my father.\" Takashi explained. \"He gave it to my Grandfather shortly after I was born and told him to give it to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does it do\u2026?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By sacrificing itself Stardust Dragon can negate and destroy Monster, Trap, or Spell effects that destroy other cards.\" He said to her. \"When it does this, Stardust Dragon can return at the turn's End Phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026and you used it to defeat Crow?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Crow answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlistair looked at Takashi's card for a few more seconds before looking at Takashi himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026You! He called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at Alistar and started glaring at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is not 'you'!\" He said. \"My name is Takashi\u2026Takashi Nakamura.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\u2026\" Alistar firmly said to him. \"I want you to Duel me\u2026Duel me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone looked on with a shocked expression on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see that dragon in action.\" Alistar explained while he was activating his Duel Disk. \"Also\u2026I want to how a weakling like you Duels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi growled to him and proceeded to take his Elemental Hero Deck from out his Duel Disk. He then inserted his Dragon Deck into the device and activated it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you prick!\" He yelled. \"I'll be glad to take you on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Duelists prepared to make their first moves, however before anything could take place Takashi's cell phone started ringing. He proceeded to take it out and answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026\"Klaus said. \"I got the things I need, so come over here and we can leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man sighed to himself. \"Fine\u2026I'll be right there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi hung up his phone and put it away. He then deactivated his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you running away?\" Alistair said. \"Well\u2026I don't blame you. A person like you has no chance in hell of defeating me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi charged at him, wanting to punch his lights out. However Lilly stopped him before he could get close enough to Alistair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about him\u2026\" She said. \"He's just like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi sighed and stopped trying to attack Alistar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll settling things with you some other time\u2026\" He said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlistar ignored him and proceeded to turn his back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026\" Lilly said. \"Hope we get to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Crow replied. \"I would like to have the chance to Duel you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled at them. \"Yeah\u2026I would like that. I'd like that a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Takashi proceeded to walk away. As he did, Alistair looked at his deck and pulled out a card that had the image of a red dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way he can beat me.' He thought. \"Not with Red Dragon Archfiend on my side!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi soon made it to Klaus, who was shocked by the scar that was on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck happened?\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Stuff.\" Takashi answered. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once there, they got back inside the car and drove back home to Crash Town. As soon as he got back, Takashi walked over to Toru's house and proceeded to knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up!\" He yelled. \"I have the stuff that you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru opened the door and the first thing that he noticed was the scar of Takashi's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude\u2026what the hell happened to you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi handed Toru the parts and started to explain what happened to him, while he was in the Satellite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's what happened.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Toru said as he was inserting the parts into his Duel Runner. \"That must've been an interesting experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was\u2026\" Takashi replied. \"Anyway\u2026how's the Duel Runner coming along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026let's find out.\" Toru said as he inserted the last part into his Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them brought the Duel Runner outside and brought out to the desert. Once they got there, Toru handed Takashi a helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on\u2026\" He said. \"I did promise I let you ride it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at him and smiled. He then put the helmet on his head and pressed the button that was on the side of it. This released a windshield, which covered Takashi's eyes. Toru would then walk over to him and was about to press the button, which would activate his Duel Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready\u2026?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go for it.\" Takashi said as he was gripping the Runner's handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru nodded his head and proceeded to press the button. The Duel Runner sounded and began rumbling. Takashi pressed the petal and immediately drove forward at an incredible speed. Seeing the Runner in action brought a huge smile onto Toru's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\u2026it works!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi was smiling too as he was finally riding a Duel Runner, like how he always wanted to. As he was driving all around the desert, Takashi began feeling an amazing sensation. The speed, the wind, the rush\u2026all of these things ran through his body and it made him feel incredible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome\u2026\" He said. \"This is Awesome!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving around for about 20 more minutes Takashi drove back to Toru and allowed him a chance to drive around. Like Takashi, he to enjoyed the rush of driving his Duel Runner around the area. Soon though, after about 30 minutes of driving, Toru headed back over towards his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a rush!\" He said. \"I've felt anything so amazing before in my entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Takashi agreed. \"It was like I was in a totally different world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends headed back to Toru's house and started to relax. As they were doing that though, Toru was thinking and soon started talking to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026\" He said. \"I'm thinking of leaving for New Domino City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Really\u2026?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Toru responded. \"I mean\u2026with my Duel Runner now working, there nothing keeping me from fulfilling my dream of become a Turbo Duelist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi replied. \"That does make sense. New Domino City is famous for having a large number of Turbo Duelists. Odds are it's the best place for you to make a name for yourself. Still\u2026Nico and West are going to be sad that you're leaving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\u2026, but you'll still be here to help fill the void.\" Toru said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True\u2026\" Takashi responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them stayed silent for a few minutes until Toru got an idea. He walked up to his Duel Disk and inserted his deck into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's Duel Takashi.\" He said. \"Let's have one more match before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled and nodded his head. \"You're on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them went outside to the backyard and stood about 10 feet apart from each other. They then activated their Duel Disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Takashi\u2026I don't intend on holding back.\" Toru told his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't want you to.\" Takashi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make the first move\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card from deck. He put the card into his hand and proceeded to take out another card and place it on his Monster Card Zone. \"I summon Masked Dragon in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasked Dragon: ATK 1400 DEF 1100 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brown and red dragon appeared on Takashi's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I place 1 card face-down and End my Turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face-down card appeared behind Masked Dragon as Toru began his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" He yelled as he drew a card. He looked at the card and inserted it into his Duel Disk. \"I activate the Spell; Foolish Burial!\" The card appeared on the field and it had the image of a hand, holding a shovel, popping out of the ground. \"With this, I can send a Monster card from my deck and send it to my Graveyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru took out his deck and began searching for the card that he wanted to discard. Once he found it he took out of his deck and placed it in the Graveyard. Toru would then put his deck back into his Duel Disk, watch it reshuffle, and continued on with his turn. He would take a card from his hand and place it in his Monster Card Zone. \"I summon my Scrap Hunter in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Hunter: ATK 1600 DEF 400 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Monster, which looked like a combination of different piles of junk, appeared on Toru's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attack with Scrap Hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru's monster ran over to Masked Dragon and proceeded to slice its head off with one swoop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3800 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When my Masked Dragon is destroyed as a result of battle, its Special Ability is activated.\" Takashi stated. \"I can now Special Summon and dragon type Monster that has 1500 or less Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he went through his deck though, Takashi pressed a button on his Duel Disk to activate his face-down card.

Go\u2026Molten Fireball Attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes fired a molten fireball at Scrap Hunter. However Toru activated his face-down and it turned out to be a Negate Attack Trap Card. The card released a giant vortex that sucked up the fireball and sent it to another dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Takashi\u2026\" Toru said. \"But my Negate Attack will prevent you from attacking any more this turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice move Toru\u2026\" Takashi said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\u2026and I'm not done yet.\" He friend replied. He pressed another button on his Duel Disk, which activated his other face-down card. The card flipped up and revealed the image of a punch of scrap pieces falling from the sky. \"I activate the Quick-Play Spell Card; Scrapstrom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrapstorm\u2026?\" Takashi questioned. \"What does that card do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scrapstorm allows me to select one Scrap Monster that's on my field and one that's in my Deck.\" Toru explained. \"I then send both cards to the Graveyard and draw one card from deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Hunter disappeared from the field and Toru placed its card in the Graveyard. He would then went through his deck and pulled out another card and would also place it in his Graveyard. After placing the deck back into his Duel Disk and watch it be reshuffled, Toru proceeded to draw a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi started questioning why Toru was putting cards into his Graveyard. He knew that the abilities of Scrap Monsters revolved around Toru doing that, but he knew that could backfire on Toru if he wasn't able to get the cards that he needed. However, Takashi didn't want to any unnecessary risks. So he took 2 cards from his hand and inserted them into Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place 2 cards face-down\u2026I End my Turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru nodded his head and proceeded to draw a card. He placed it in his hand and took out another card, which he placed in his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon my Scrap Chimera in Attack Mode!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Chimera: ATK 1700 DEF 500 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA metal chimera, which looked like a combination of an eagle and a lion, appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my Chimera's Special Ability. When it's successfully Normal Summoned, I can Special Summon a Scrap Tuner Monster that's in my Graveyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Takashi cursed. \"I had a feeling that would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA card appeared from Toru's Graveyard and he proceeded to pick it up. He then placed it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon; Scrap Goblin in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Goblin: ATK 0 DEF 500 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small goblin, with was made from different pieces of junk, appeared on the field and stood next to Scrap Chimera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'll tune my Scrap Goblin with my Scrap Chimera in order Synchro Summon; Scrap Archfiend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Archfiend: ATK 2700 DEF 1800 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Toru's Scrap Monsters performed the sequence for Synchro Summoning. In a flash of light, his new monster appeared on the field. It was a giant fiend that was constructed out different pieces of scrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi remembered facing Toru's Scrap Archfiend several times in the past. Its overwhelming Attack made it extremely difficult for him to defeat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attack Red-Eyes Wyvern with Scrap Archfiend!\" Toru yelled. \"Go, Scrap Fist!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Archfiend balled up its metal fist and proceeded to crush Red-Eyes in one single blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play one card face-down and End my Turn.\" Toru said as a face-down card appeared behind his Scrap Archfiend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched Takashi plan his next move, Toru began to think to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Takashi\u2026\" He thought. \"Despite being down by 1100 Life Points he still looks so calm. But then, he's been that way whenever he'd Duel someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru flashed back to the many times he seen Takashi Duel. Despite being down and sometimes frustrated. He would always find a way to win. This is what made Takashi and dangerous opponent to Duel against. He would always try to plan several moves ahead of his opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Totem Dragon in Attack Mode!\" Takashi said as he placed the card on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotem Dragon: ATK 400 DEF 200 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small dragon, that had a totem pole sized neck, appeared and stood right next to Exploder Dragonwing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now remove Totem Dragon from the game to Special Summon; The Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon: ATK 2800 DEF 2400 LVL 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotem Dragon vanished from the field and a new Red-Eyes monster took its place. This one was twice the size of Red-Eyes Wyvern and its entire body was covered in metal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy\u2026shit\u2026\" Toru said in shock. \"Takashi's strongest Monster; Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Red-Eyes' Special Ability!\" Takashi said. \"I can Special Summon a Dragon Monster from either my hand or Graveyard. I choose to Special Summon my Flamvell Guard Tuner Monster in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamvell Guard: ATK 100 DEF 2000 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dragon, with burnt metal armor, appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now Tune my Level 7 Exploder Dragonwing with my Level 1 Flamvell Guard.

Take Flight, Stardust Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 2000 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamvell Guard and Exploder Dragonwing flew up into the air and performed a Synchro Summon. In a blinding flash of light, Stardust Dragon appeared and stood next to Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru was amazed at what he just witnessed. In just 1 turn, Takashi had something 2 of his most powerful Monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attack Scrap Archfiend with Red Eyes!\" Takashi yelled. \"Go, Darkness Metal Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes fired a blast of dark energy at Scrap Archfiend, destroying it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru: 3900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll have Stardust Dragon attack your Life Points directly. Go, Cosmic Flare!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust fired a blast of cosmic energy from its mouth. As the attack was headed for him, Toru pressed a button on his Duel Disk. This activated his face-down card which, when flipped up, had the image of a monster trapped inside a fire barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell; Half Shut!\" He said. \"With it I can reduce the Attack Points of one Monster on the field by half. I choose Stardust Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall of blue fire surrounded Toru. Stardust's Cosmic Flare hit the flames and started to go through them. However when it finally made it passed the barrier, only half of the blast's power managed to hit Toru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToro: 2650 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi would then insert one card into his Duel Disk. The card then appeared behind his dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place 1 card face-down and End my Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Toru yelled as he drew a card from his deck. He looked at it and smiled for a second. He would then press a button on his Duel Disk, which opened his Field Spell Zone. He then placed the card he drew inside of it and closed it up. \"I activate the Field Spell; Scrapyard!\" </span></div></div>",

As his deck started to reshuffle itself, he would insert a card into his Duel Disk. The card appeared on the field and revealed itself to be Monster Reborn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I revive my Scrap Archfiend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru's giant Scrap Monster reappeared on the field and it glared at Takashi dragons, who proceeded to roar back at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's Toru thinking\u2026?\" Takashi thought. \"I mean even if he destroyed Stardust, he knows I'll just revive it my next turn. So what the hell is he planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru placed another card into his Duel Disk and when it appeared it had the image of two monsters standing next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell; Double Summon!\" He said. \"With it I can Normal Summon twice this turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Takashi said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru placed two cards on the Monster Card Zone of his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon both Scrap Mind Reader and Scrap Beast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Mind Reader: ATK 0 DEF 0 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Beast: ATK 1600 DEF 1300 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Scrap Monsters appeared on Toru's side of the field. The first was a small orb that had a telephone attached to it. The second looked like a panther. Both Monsters were made out of pieces of scrap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I Tune my Level 7 Scrap Archfiend with my Level 1 Scrap Mind Reader!

Soon a giant dragon, which was made out of scrap, appeared and started hovering above Toru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now activate my dragon's ability. I can select one card I control and one card my opponent controls and destroy them both! I choose to destroy Scrap Beast and Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Dragon fired a laser at Scrap Beast, destroying it completely. It then fired one at Red-Eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Stardust Dragon's Special Ability!\" Takashi yelled. \"I sacrifice him to negate Scrap Dragon's ability and destroy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon started glowing brightly, however as it was doing that a cage surrounded it and slammed Stardust into the card. Takashi was shocked at what he saw and started looking around the field. He then saw that Toru had activated a Quick-Play Spell. The card had the image of black cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell; Scrap Cage!\" Toru said. \"With it, I negate the activation of one of my opponent's monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Stardust Dragon trapped inside the cage, Scrap Dragon was able to destroy Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon with its powerful lasers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now attack Stardust Dragon with Scrap Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Dragon fired flames that were filled with shrapnel. The attack hit Stardust Dragon, killing it instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru: 2650 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I End my Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card. He looked at it for a second before inserting it inside of his Duel Disk. The card appeared and revealed itself to be Foolish Burial. \"I activate Foolish Burial to send a Monster in my deck to the Graveyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi took out his Duel Disk and proceeded to look for the card that he wanted to get rid of. Once he found it he proceeded to place it in his Graveyard before putting his deck back into his Duel Disk. Then, as his deck was reshuffling, Takashi inserted another card into his Duel Disk. The card appeared on the field and it revealed itself to be Scapegoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play Scapegoat to Summon 4 sheep tokens in Defense Mode! I then place 1 card face-down and end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA face-down card appeared on Takashi's field along with 4 sheep tokens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Draw\u2026!\" Toru said as he drew a card. He put the card in his hand and took out another card, which he inserted into his Duel Disk. The card had the image of several lightning bolts, striking the ground. \"I activate the Spell Card: Lightning Vortex! Now by discarding one card in my hand to the Graveyard, I can destroy all face-up Monsters on my opponent's field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toru placed the card that he was discarding into his Graveyard, Takashi pressed a button on his Duel Disk. This activated his face-down which, when flipped up, had the image of a machine with 3 different shields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Spell Shield Type-8!\" He said. \"With it I can negate to activation of a Spell Card and destroy it! All I have to do is discard a Spell Card from my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takashi placed the Spell Card into his Graveyard, the machine from his Trap Card appeared. It then produced a barrier that protected Takashi's sheep tokens from Toru's lightning blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Toru said as he brought out another 2 cards from his hand. He then inserted them into his Duel Disk. The first card had the image of a man putting together a robot while the other had the image of group of soldiers moving past another group of soldiers. \"I activate the Spell Cards; Scrap Repair and Bypass! With Scrap Repair I can Special Summon; Scrap Beast from my Graveyard. Then with Bypass, I can attack your Life Points Directly as long as my Monsters Attack Points are cut in half!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the Scrap Repair card, Toru's Scrap Beast reappeared on the field. Then it and Scrap Dragon's attack power were transferred to the Bypass card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Dragon: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Beast: 800<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Scrap Monsters then jumped over into the air and proceeded to launched their attacks at Takashi, causing him to flinch a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru: 2650 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that\u2026I End my Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at his hand and found nothing that he could use to combat Toru's monsters. So he gently placed his hand on the top card of his deck and closed his eyes for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026Draw!\" He yelled as he drew a card from his deck. He slowly looked at the card, and he sighed in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru saw the expression on his face and assumed that Takashi didn't draw the card that he wanted. He felt that he had this Duel in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi closed his eyes again and started to flashback on the moves that he and Toru made through the entire Duel. He then remembered something very important. So he placed the card he drew into his Duel Disk and it appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place one card face-down and End my Turn.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then\u2026Draw!\" Toru yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast!\" Takashi replied. \"I activate the Special Ability of my Red-Eyes Wyvern!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Toru said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Red-Eyes Wyvern is in my Graveyard and I don't Normal Summon or Set a Monster this turn\u2026I can remove it from the Duel to Special Summon 1 Red-Eyes Monster from my Graveyard!\" Takashi explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\" Toru said. \"That means\u2026you can summon\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means I can summon Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon in Attack Mode!\" Takashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon appeared from out of Takashi's Duel Disk and started flying above him. It then roared at Scrap Dragon, saying it was ready for Round 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026.Draw!\" Toru yelled as he was drew a card from his deck. He wasn't expecting Takashi to revive Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon. However he wouldn't let this new development stop him from winning this Duel. \"I activate the Special Ability of my Scrap Dragon. I sacrifice my Scrap Beast to destroy your Red-Eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Scrap Dragon destroyed Scrap Beast, Takashi pressed a button on his Duel Disk. The flipped his face-down card up and it revealed the image of a spirit protecting a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; Spirit Shield!\" He said. \"With it, I can negate the activation of Monster, Trap, or Spell effect that targets my Dragon Monsters and destroy it! All I need to do is remove a dragon from the Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi removed Exploder Dragonwing and its spirit appeared and protected Red-Eyes. The spirit then attacked Scrap Dragon, destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Scrap Dragon's Special Ability!\" Toru yelled. \"With it, I can revive a Scrap Monster from my Graveyard. I choose Scrap Goblin and place it in Defense Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Goblin appeared on Toru's field and made a defensive stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I End my Turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My move\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card. \"Sorry Toru, but you made fatal mistake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\u2026\" Toru said. \"And what would that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring out your Scrap Goblin!\" Takashi answer. \"I activate Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon's Special Ability! I revive the Stardust Dragon that's in my Graveyard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's Duel Disk started to glow and out came Stardust Dragon. It then stood next to Red-Eyes and both dragons glared at Scrap Goblin and Toru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon\u2026attack Scrap Goblin with Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Takashi, but my Scrap Goblin can't be destroyed in battle!\" Toru stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Toru, but you should know that if Scrap Goblin is attacked while face-up in Defense Mode, then it's automatically destroyed!\" Takashi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrap Goblin saw Stardust prepare to launched its attack. Scared, it self-destructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red-Eyes Darkness Metal Dragon\u2026attack Toru's Life Points directly with; Dark Metal Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes launched a blast of dark energy at Toru, creating an explosion that surrounded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru: 0 LP </span></div></div>",

Ever since Toru left for New Domino City, Takashi has been trying to become an even stronger Duelist than he was before. To accomplish that task, Takashi spends most of his time either Dueling the other Duelist within Crash Town or constructing his Deck to make it more powerful. For the last 30 months he's been trying to build a brand new Deck, one that combines his Dragons, Elemental Heroes, and the cards that support them. Now\u2026after several long months of planning, building, and rebuilding\u2026Takashi has finally finished completing his new Deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally\u2026\" He said as he held the deck in his hand. \"It's finally completed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi proceeded to look at the front of his deck and first monster that he saw was his trusty Stardust Dragon. He smiled for a few minutes before putting his deck into his deck box. He would then attach it to his belt before walking out of his room. Takashi quickly headed for the kitchen and sat down at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally\u2026\" Klaus said as he handed him his food. \"I thought that you would never come down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm here now aren't I?\" Takashi said as he started eating his food. \"Besides aren't you a little old to be waiting on me to come down and eat. For God's sake Klaus you're almost 70-years-old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it's important to eat with your family Takashi.\" Klaus reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026I know\u2026I know.\" Takashi moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them started eating in silence for a couple of minutes before they finally started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Klaus\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm\u2026\" Klaus moaned as he was chewing food within in mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were my parents like?\" Takashi asked. \"The only thing you told me was that my dad had Stardust Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus stopped eating and began looking at the table for a few moments. He then looked back at Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're parents\u2026\" He said. \"Well they were kind individuals\u2026Especially your mother/my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was she like\u2026?\" The young man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother was a beautiful woman\u2026\" Klaus explained. \"She had long cerulean blue hair and eyes of the same color. Like you she was an excellent Duelist and she even competed in the Riding Ace Dueling League.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nearly choked on his food. So he quickly grabbed a glass of water and started to pour the liquid into his mouth. Once he finished drinking, Takashi placed the glass on the table and looked at his grandfather with a huge amount of excitement in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom competed in the Riding Ace Dueling League?\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus simply nodded his head. Takashi was shocked by the fact that his mom competed in a tournament of that level. The Riding Ace Dueling League is the strongest, toughest, and the best Turbo Dueling League in the entire world. Every Turbo Duelist in the world dreams of joining the League and one day obtaining the title of World King, the title given to the best Turbo Duelist in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klaus\u2026Klaus\u2026did my mom become the World King?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus nodded his head in disagreement. \"No\u2026she became the World Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho\u2026Ly\u2026Shit!\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus attempted to punch his grandson in the face, Takashi however blocked the blow without even thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't you told me about this\u2026?\" Takashi asked while he looked at Klaus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus looked down again, this time for a longer period time. Before he could say anything else, someone began knocking on the door of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi!\" The person from behind the door yelled. \"Takashi please open the door!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked towards the door with a puzzled look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"West\u2026?\" He said. Takashi looked towards Klaus again before getting up from his chair. \"We'll talk about this later\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi walked towards the door and proceeded to open it. He saw West and noticed that he was breathing really hard. He also saw that he had tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What wrong West?\" He asked out of concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026I\u2026I can't find Nico!\" West said as he tried his best to hold back his tears. \"I looked everywhere, but I can't find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Takashi yelled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly looked outside and saw that town bell was going to ring at any minute. When that happens, both the Radley and Malcolm families will appear and both sides have only gotten more vicious during this past 2 and a half years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, without even thinking, Takashi dragged West inside of his house and quickly ran up to his room to get his Duel Disk. Once he grabbed it, he immediately ran back downstairs and proceeded to run out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026!\" Klaus yelled as he ran out the door. \"Where do you think you're going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think?\" Takashi said without even turning towards his grandfather. \"I'm going to find Nico and bring her here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane?\" Klaus yelled. \"The war between the Malcolm and Radley families are about to resume. You won't be able to make it back here with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus walked towards Takashi and touched his shoulder. However as soon as he did, Takashi turned around and punched him in the face. He then proceeded to grab Klaus by his shirt collar and glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I do nothing, then Nico is going to be found!\" He yelled. \"If that happens then her life is practically over! I don't know about you, but I'm not going to sit on my ass and wait to see what happens! I promised Nico's and West's father that I would always look after them while he worked in the mines. I intend to keep my promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi threw Klaus to the ground and proceeded to runs towards town as the bell began to ring. As Klaus looked on at his grandson he saw an image of his daughter running alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took 20 minutes for Takashi to reach the middle of town and he already saw that both the Radley and Malcolm families were already going at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it\u2026\" He thought. \"I'm going to have to take my time. If I rush through I'm just asking to get noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked over to side of one of the nearby buildings and proceeded to carefully walk against it. As he walked, he started thinking to himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026if I was Nico\u2026where would I be during this time\u2026the Hideout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi remembered telling Nico and West that if the bell should ring and they're not at their house, then they need to go to their Hideout. It was one of the safest places that they could hide out while the fights were going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the area and saw a space where no one was around and prepared to run over there, but before he could get the chance to do so a man appeared behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you\u2026!\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi broke into a cold sweat and slowly turned around. He looked at the man and saw that he had blonde hair, green eyes, and had a very muscular figure. The man also had a Duel Disk attached to his right arm. The man looked at Takashi for a few minutes, before seeing the Duel Disk attached to his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026\" He said. \"You're coming with me to join the Radley Family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi was shocked at what the man said to him\u2026however he was able to shake it off very quickly and proceeded to nod his head in disagreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I refuse!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrong answer\u2026\" The man replied as he walked over towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled out a knife from his pocket and was about to hit Takashi with it. However, the young man was able to avoid the first strike and quickly punched the man in the chest. He then quickly grabbed the man by the head and rammed it into the buildings wall, causing him to be stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry pal..., but I have somewhere to be!\" He said as he continued on his way. <br>\r\nTakashi continued to make his way for Nico's and West's hideout. As headed over there, he was constantly attacked by members of both the Radley and Malcolm families and each time he was able to defeat them, with just using his fist. Soon, after 40 minutes of running and fighting, Takashi made it to the edge of town and saw the Hideout. He ran over towards it and quickly ran inside. As soon as he came inside, Nico appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026!\" She yelled as she ran over hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi held the little girl for a couple of minutes before letting her go. He then looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nico\u2026why weren't you with West?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I about to meet up with him, but while I was running I ran into this big guy.\" Nico explained to him. \"He started yelling at me and calling me names, which made me really upset. So ran in here so that I could hide from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said. \"Well\u2026West is over my house. I'll take you to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico nodded her head. \"Ok\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked out of the hideout and proceeded to make their way back to Takashi's home. However as they were running, Nico tripped up and fell into the ground. She started crying so Takashi quickly ran over her, however something from behind grabbed him by the back of his shirt and slammed him to the ground. As he slowly picked himself up Takashi saw that the Radley Family member, whose head he rammed into a house, grabbed Nico by her shirt. The man grabbed his knife and proceeded to place it by Nico's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026we're going to try this again.\" He said. \"You're going to join the Radley Family\u2026if you don't', I'm going to kill this little bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026help me!\" Nico yelled at the top of her lungs.</span></div></div>",

He saw that Nico was wearing a loose t-shirt and as the man was holding it\u2026it looked even looser. This gave him just the idea that he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nico\u2026raise your arms!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico quickly did what she was told and raised her arms in the air. Once she did that, she proceeded to slide down her shirt until she hit the ground. Once that happened she proceeded to run over to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\" The man yelled as he watched Nico jump into Takashi's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the bastard.\" Takashi replied. \"Taking a little girl hostage like that. You're the biggest piece of shit I've ever seen in my entire life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your mouth!\" The man yelled. \"You're talking to Virgil\u2026second best Duelist within the Radley family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi took of his jacket and gave it to Nico, who proceeded to put it on. He then stood up and activated his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care if you're the best Duelist in the damn world!\" He yelled. \"No one threaten the lives of my friends and gets away with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil glared at him and proceeded to activate his Duel Disk too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you little bastard, have it your way!\" He said. \"It'll be more fun this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he swiftly drew a card from his deck. He proceeded to put the card into his hand and pull out another card, which he placed on his Duel Disk's Monster Zone. \"I summon Dragon's Knight in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon's Knight: ATK 1700 DEF 1400 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knight wearing dragon plated armor appeared on Takashi's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then place 1 card face-down and End my Turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi took a card and put it in his Spell/Trap Zone. As the card appeared on the field, Virgil began his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" He yelled as he drew a card. \"I place a monster in face-down Defense Mode. Then I place 1 card face-down and hand it back over to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo face-down cards appeared on Virgil's side of the field. One was in his Monster Zone while the other was in his Spell/Trap Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Takashi said. \"I summon Elemental Hero Stratos in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElemental Hero Stratos: ATK 1800 DEF 300 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Elemental Hero with, blue and white armor and airplane wings, appeared on Takashi's side of the field and stood next to his Dragon's Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Stratos' Special Ability! When he's successfully Normal or Special summoned, I can bring one Elemental Hero monster from my deck and add it to my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Duel Disk displayed a new holographic keyboard that displayed all of the Elemental Hero monsters that were currently in Takashi's deck. After spending a couple of seconds searching, Takashi found the card that he wanted. So he gently pressed it and the real card popped out of his deck. Once he saw it, he took it out and the holographic keyboard disappeared. Takashi would then add the card to his hand while his Duel Disk reshuffled his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragon's Knight, attack his face-down monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Takashi's knight headed for the face-down card, Virgil pressed a button on her Duel Disk. This activated his face-down card and it revealed the image of a lion roaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; Threatening Roar!\" He said. \"With this, I can cancel your Battle Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe roar of a powerful lion sounded, freezing Dragon's Knight in his tracks. He then fled over to Stratos, who was also pretty shook up from the roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Takashi said softly. \"I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Draw\u2026!\" Virgil yelled as he drew card and placed it in his hand. \"I summon Armed Dragon LV3, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon LV3: ATK 1200 DEF 900 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small dragon, with orange and tan armored scales, appeared on Virgil's side of the field. He then proceeded to insert a card into his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field it revealed itself to be Mystical Space Typhoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell; Mystical Space Typhoon! With it, I can destroy one Spell or Trap card that's on the field. I choose to destroy your face-down card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card shot out a virtual tornado which proceeded to destroy Takashi's face-down card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that your face-down card is gone, I'll end my turn by playing 2 cards face-down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil placed two cards into the Spell/Trap Zone of his Duel Disk and quickly, those two cards appeared face-down on his side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card. He then inserted a card into his Spell/Trap Zone and when the card appeared onto the field, it had the image of swords shinning down from the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card; Swords of Revealing Light! With this powerful Spell, not only are you not allowed to attack for 3 turn, but any monsters that you placed face-down on the field are now flipped up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 shining swords shot from out of Takashi's Spell Card and landed over towards Virgil's side of the field. The swords were so bright that Virgil's face-down flipped up, revealing to be a Masked Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasked Dragon: ATK 1400 DEF 1100 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masked Dragon huh\u2026?\" Takashi thought. \"Now I see. He must've wanted me to attack it so that he could use its ability to bring a dragon card to his hand. That ability could be a pain if he picks a dragon that can do damage to my Life Points. I better get rid of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi took a card from out of his hand and inserted it into his Duel Disk. The card appeared onto the field and it revealed itself to be a Lightning Vortex card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play the Spell; Lightning Vortex! Now by discarding 1 card from my hand to the Graveyard, I can destroy all face-up monsters on your side of the field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi took a card from his hand and put it in his Graveyard. This activated his Spell Card, which started shooting lightning blast at Virgil's dragons. However, before the lightning was to hit them, Virgil pressed a button on his Duel Disk. This activated his face-down card, causing it to flip up and when Takashi got a good look at it he saw that the card had the image of a magical circle, sucking up some steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Magic Jammer!\" He said. \"With this Trap Card, I can negate the activation of a Spell Card and destroy it. All I have to do is discard 1 card from my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Virgil placed the card that he wanted to discard into his Graveyard, a magical circle appeared in front of his dragons. The circle proceeded to suck up Takashi's lightning before redirecting it at his Spell Card, destroying it on contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then\u2026\" Takashi said when an irritated tone in his voice. \"I'll just get rid of them by force. I attack Masked Dragon with Dragon's Knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon's Knight pulled out the sword that he had hooked to his back and proceeded to run over towards Masked Dragon, destroying it with one swoop of his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Masked Dragon's Special Ability!\" Virgil yelled. \"Now I can Special Summon a Dragon-Type card with 1500 or less Attack Points from my deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA holographic keyboard, revealing all the dragons that Virgil was allowed to pick, appeared before him. After about a minute of thinking, he pressed the card that he wanted to Special Summon and that card popped out of his deck. Virgil took out the card and, while keyboard vanished, proceeded to place it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon; Red-Eyes B. Chick in Defense Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes B. Chick: ATK 800 DEF 500 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA baby Red-Eyes Black Dragon appeared on Virgil's side of the field and took a defensive position next to his Armed Dragon LV3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026so what now?\" Takashi asked himself. \"If I destroy that chick with Stratos, then on Virgil's next turn\u2026he'll just level up LV3 into LV5. However\u2026if I destroy LV3 then Virgil could exchange Red-Eyes B. Chick for Red-Eyes Black Dragon. No matter what I choose, I'm going to have to deal with a monster with over 2000 Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at his hand and saw that he had no other cards that he could play. He then looked over at Virgil's other face-down card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if I'm going to fight a powerful dragon\u2026I might as well deal with the one that doesn't have an effect.\" He pointed at Armed Dragon LV3. \"Elemental Hero Stratos\u2026attack his Armed Dragon LV3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStratos flew over to Armed Dragon LV3 and proceeded to beat the dragon to death with its powerful punches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil: 3400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he saw his monster defeated, Virgil pressed a button on his Duel Disk, activating his second face-down card. The card flipped up and revealed to be Call of the Haunted\u2026a card that Takashi didn't want to see.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Call of the Haunted\u2026so welcome back Armed Dragon LV3!\"</span></div></div>",

However\u2026he couldn't find one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" He said in a disappointed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn!\" Virgil yelled as he drew another card from his deck. \"I now activate my Red-Eyes B. Chick and my Armed Dragon LV3's Special Abilities! I offer both of my monsters to Special Summon; Red-Eyes Black Dragon and Armed Dragon LV5, both in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes Black Dragon: ATK 2400 DEF 2000 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon LV5: ATK 2400 DEF 1700 LVL 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi was in shock as he looked at both dragons. Like its names implies, Red-Eyes Black Dragon was a giant black dragon with red eyes. While Armed Dragon LV5, was a stronger version of Armed Dragon LV3. It had dark scales and more spikes all over its body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attack Elemental Hero Stratos with Red-Black Dragon, while I attack Dragon's Knight with Armed Dragon LV5!\" Virgil proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth dragons opened their mouths and released their attacks. Red-Eyes launched a stream of red-hot fire, while Armed Dragon released a gust of wind. The two attacks combined and formed a giant flame which consumed both of Takashi's monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil: 3400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Takashi said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn by playing 1 card face-down, but as my turn end's the Special Ability of my Armed Dragon LV5 activates!\" Virgil explained as a face-down card appeared on his side of the field. \"When it successfully destroys a monster as a result of battle, I can Special Summon; Armed Dragon LV7!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon LV7: ATK 2800 DEF 1000 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Armed Dragon leveled up and became more powerful. The spikes that were all over its body became much sharper and larger. The armored scales that was on it also improved to the point that almost half of its body was covered in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn. Draw!\" Takashi said as he slowly drew a card from his deck. He put the card into his hand and began to look at all of his cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she watched him, Nico silently prayed for Takashi to win, knowing that if he lost, he would be forced to join the Radley family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, after thinking for a few minutes, Takashi developed a strategy. He first took a card from his hand and placed it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Summon; Vice Dragon in Attack Mode!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVice Dragon: ATK 2000 DEF 2400 LVL 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant purple dragon appeared and stood next to Takashi. Virgil was somewhat shocked when he saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to pull?\" He said to Takashi. \"You know for a fact that you can't Normal Summon a level 5 or higher monster without sacrificing a monster first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said that I Normal Summoned, Vice Dragon.\" Takashi calmly explained. \"I Special Summon it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Special Summon it\u2026?\" A shocked Virgil asked. \"But\u2026how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Vice Dragon's ability.\" Takashi said. \"You see\u2026when my opponents have monsters on their side of the field and I don't, I can Special Summon Vice Dragon. However\u2026the drawback is that Vice Dragon's Attack and Defense Points are cut in half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVice Dragon: ATK 1000 DEF 1200 LVL 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it\u2026\" Virgil said. \"Why Special Summon a monster whose Attack and Defense Points gets cut in half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you\u2026\" Takashi said as he placed another card onto his Monster Card Zone. \"I summon the Tuner Monster; Delta Flyer in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelta Flyer: ATK 1500 DEF 900 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's trusty Delta Flyer appeared and started flying next to Vice Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\u2026I tune my level 5 Vice Dragon with my level 3 Delta Flyer in order to Synchro Summon; Dark End Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark End Dragon: ATK 2600 DEF 2100 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Takashi's monsters flew into the air and performed a Synchro Summon. Soon only one monster appeared and it was a giant black dragon, with a face on its chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Dark End Dragon's Special Ability! By giving up 500 of its Attack and Defense Points, it can send any of my opponent's monsters to the Graveyard. The card I choose to send\u2026is your Armed Dragon LV7!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark End Dragon: ATK 2100 DEF 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark End Dragon's chest mouth opened up and released a blast of evil energy that heading towards Armed Dragon LV7. However, Virgil was prepared for such a tactic. He pressed a button on his Duel Disk, which activated his face-down card. When the card flipped up it revealed itself to be Shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; Shift!\" Virgil yelled. \"With this, I'll change the target of dragon's effect to Red-Eyes Black Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark End Dragon's blast shifted towards Red-Eyes. When the attack hit the dragon, Red-Eyes disappeared into a void of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026!\" Takashi cursed. \"I'm not done yet though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Duelist inserted a card into his Spell/Trap Zone and when the card appeared onto the field, it revealed itself to be Half Shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell; Half Shut! With it, I can temporarily half the Attack Points of one monster on the field. In exchange though, the selected monster cannot be destroyed as a result of battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue flame surrounded Armed Dragon LV7, brining it both pain and protection at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon LV7: ATK 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark End Dragon\u2026attack Armed Dragon LV7 with your Dark Fog!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark End Dragon fired a mysterious black fog at Armed Dragon LV7. When the attack hit it, Armed Dragon began roaring in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 2700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil: 2700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that, I end my turn by playing 1 card face-down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi inserted a card into his Duel Disk and in a matter of seconds, a hologram of his card appeared face-down on his side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil was becoming angry at what was happening. He couldn't believe that Takashi was still in this match and that he was losing Life Points. The mere thought of that threw him over the edge and he started screaming for a few minutes before glaring at Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'VE HAVE ENOUGH OF THIS!\" He yelled. \"I Draw!\" He quickly looked at the card and smiled. \"It's over for you, kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk is cheap!\" Virgil proclaimed to him. \"I'll show you\u2026I sacrifice Armed Dragon LV7 to Special Summon; Armed Dragon LV10!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon LV10: Attack 3000 DEF 2000 LVL 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Virgil started laughing like a madman, Takashi and Nico looked on in horror as they witnessed Armed Dragon's ultimate form. It became a giant dragon that was around the size of small skyscraper. Every feature that it had while it was at its previous levels were completely modified to the ultimate scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate LV10's Special Ability!\" Virgil said. \"By sending 1 card from my hand to the Graveyard, Armed Dragon can destroy your monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon LV10 released a power sonic wave from its mouth and as soon as Dark End Dragon heard, it exploded into the nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I attack your Life Points directly and end this Stupid Game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon prepared to fire a giant flame attack at Takashi; however the young man quickly activated his face-down card. The card quickly flipped up and revealed an image of the soul of an Elemental Hero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Hero's Soul!\" Takashi yelled. \"For every Elemental Hero that rests in my Graveyard, I can lower the attack of one of my opponent's monsters. I have Stratos in my Graveyard, so Armed Dragon LV10's Attack Points drops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArmed Dragon LV10: ATK 2500<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElemental Hero Stratos' soul appeared from Takashi's Duel Disk and surrounded its master. When Armed Dragon attacked, the soul managed to absorbs some of the flames, but not all of them. When the attack ended Takashi fell to both knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 200 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil: 2700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMN IT!\" Virgil yelled. \"Why don't you just give up? You're only delaying the inevitable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi was breathing pretty hard, as it felt like Armed Dragon's attack really hurt him in some way. In his mind\u2026he truly wanted to give up, but then he turned to Nico and saw that she was crying. Seeing the girl, whom he viewed as a younger sister awoke something inside of Takashi. It gave him to strength to get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't\u2026give up.\" He said to Virgil. \"If I do\u2026then who's going to be there for Nico and her brother?\" He glared at Virgil as he placed his hand on his deck. \"I can't afford to lose here! Draw\u2026!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi drew a card from the top of his deck and played it without even looking at it. For some reason, even he didn't quite understand, he knew what the card was. When it appeared on the field, it turned out to be Monster Reborn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark End Dragon: ATK 2600 DEF 2100 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card; Monster Reborn! Be revived\u2026Dark End Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark flame popped out of Takashi's Duel Disk and from it, out came Dark End Dragon. Virgil wasn't too impressed by the return of Takashi's Synchro Monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That dragon won't help you kid...!\" He said as he discarded a card from his hand to the Graveyard. \"I activate Effect Veiler! By discarding it, I can negate the ability of one monster of the field\u2026and I choose Dark End Dragon!\" </span></div></div>",

Takashi didn't pay attention to it and simply glared at Virgil, while continuing his turn. He proceeded to insert a card into his Duel Disk and when the card appeared it revealed the image of a monster preparing to Synchro Summon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play the Spell Card; Synchro Change!

As it was preparing to fire, Virgil started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Fool!\" He yelled while he laughed. \"My monster has far more Attack Points than your monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Light End Dragon's Special Ability!\" Takashi declared. \"During the Damage Step, Light End Dragon can lower the Attack and Defense Points of the monster its attacks by 1500 points.

He then shoved a card into his Duel Disk and soon a Monster Reborn card appeared on his field. \"Monster Reborn; revive my Red-Black Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes Black Dragon: ATK 2400 DEF 2000 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes appeared back on Virgil's field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Destroy him Red-Eyes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes prepared to fire a fireball at Light End Dragon; however Takashi was ready and placed a card from his hand into the Graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Special Ability of Honest!\" He said. \"By discarding him, I can increase the Attack Points of one Light Attribute monster on my side of the field, by the Attack Points of the monster it's battling against!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight End Dragon: ATK 4500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO\u2026!\" Virgil yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes fired its fireball at Light End Dragon; however Takashi's dragon easily shook off the attack and fired its Heaven's Light at Virgil's Dragon, destroying it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 200 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirgil: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the holograms faded Takashi walked over to Virgil. He then proceeded to beat the living crap out of him. When he was done, he walked over towards Nico.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ok?\" He asked with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico slowly nodded her head and smiled. \"Yeah\u2026I'm ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them quickly headed back to Takashi's house. When they got there, the first person that they saw was West, who ran over towards his older sister and gave her a big hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're\u2026you're ok\u2026\" He said while he was crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNico stayed silent and simply held her brother in her arms. The two of them, along with Takashi went inside the house. Once inside, Takashi walked towards Klaus and looked his grandfather in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klaus\u2026\" He said. \"I know you're upset with me\u2026, but I did what I had to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus stayed silent for a few minutes before turning his back towards his grandson.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he waited for both Nico and West to fall asleep, Takashi spent his time looking at his right arm. During the final moments of his Duel against Virgil, Takashi has been feeling a small irritation coming from his arm. During the heat of the Duel, he didn't really notice it. But now, even though the pain is going away, he can feel the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on\u2026?\" He thought. \"I don't remember hurting my arm during the Duel. So why does it hurt now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could examine his arm some more, he saw that Nico and West were sleeping on the couch. He walked over towards them and proceeded to wrap a blanket around them both. Once he was sure that they were asleep, Takashi left them and headed for his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it\u2026\" He thought. \"Why did Klaus tell to wait until Nico and West were asleep before I entered my room? I mean\u2026they've been in my room before and I'm not hiding anything of real importance in there. Right\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached his room, Takashi slowly opened the door and walked inside. He took a look around and saw that Klaus was sitting on his bed. The old man looked at his grandson for a few minutes before getting up and walking towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Klaus\u2026?\" The young man replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you left to help Nico you said that we would continue our conversation about your parents.\" The old man explained. \"Well\u2026now is a good time to continue where were left off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026ok.\" Takashi said. \"But I don't understand something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" Klaus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why couldn't we finish our conversation back into the kitchen?\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus walked over to Takashi's bed and pressed a button that was on the side of it. The bed started moving away from its previous spot, revealing a staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026that's why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me Takashi\u2026\" Klaus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man walked down the staircase and his grandson slowly followed him. As they walked down the steps, the area behind them was becoming darker and darker. When they reached the bottom, they couldn't see anything. However Klaus flipped a light switch, illuminating the entire area. Takashi looked around and was shocked at what he saw. On the ground was a black Duel Runner. He walked up to it and was amazed on how it looked. Sure it was beat up and old, but with a little hard work it could be good as new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was Monet's Duel Runner\u2026\" Klaus explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monet\u2026?\" Takashi asked. \"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother\u2026\" Klaus explained. \"This was the first Duel Runner that she ever had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said. \"That's cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus stayed silent for a couple of minutes before sighing to himself. He then looked over towards his grandson, who was busy looking at his mother's Duel Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026I've never really explained to you on how your parents passed away.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked over towards his grandfather. For some reason, Klaus didn't tell him how his parents died. The only thing that he told him was\u2026he'll know when the time is right. And I guess that time is right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I explained before\u2026\" Klaus continued. \"Your mother was the best Duelist of her generation. She would win championship over championship and no one defeat her. She believed that she achieved everything that she would achieve. However there was 1 thing she gained that was far more valuable than any amount of fame or fortune could bring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026\" Klaus explained. \"When Monet was about 25-years-old, about a year after she became the World Queen, she met your father. The two of them fell in love with one another and not long after that, Sakura became pregnant with you. I was very happy to know that I was going to have a grandson and she was happy to know that she was going to become a mother. Your father however\u2026didn't seem as happy though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean\u2026?\" Takashi asked. \"Are you saying that my father didn't want me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026no\u2026\" Klaus said. \"He was happy; your father just had a hard time expressing his emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway\u2026now that she was going to become a parent, Monet was planning on retiring as a Turbo Duelist.\" Klaus explained. \"However\u2026a lot of people, especially her rivals, were upset at this announcement. Your father\u2026I don't know if he was predicting his own end, but before he and Sakura died, he came up to me and handed me a couple of Duel Monster cards. One of which was Stardust Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi pulled out his deck and took out Stardust. He then began to look at it before looking back at Klaus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad told me that if anything were to happen to him and Sakura, then I must hand over those cards to you.\" Klaus explained. \"I didn't understand, but I told I would. Shortly after that, Monet gave birth to you and she said that you were the most handsome boy she'd ever seen. However\u2026she wouldn't get to the chance to raise you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened\u2026?\" Takashi asked out of curiosity. \"How did she and dad die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The two of them dropped you over here and headed back to New Domino City, so that they could go get some other things.\" Klaus said. \"However\u2026they never came back. The two of them died in Duel Runner accident. Security looked all over for their bodies, but they couldn't find them. All that remained was their wreck Duel Runners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026so that's why you didn't want me to Turbo Duel.\" Takashi said. \"You didn't want me to end up like my mother and father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026\" Klaus said as he tried to hold back his emotions. \"However\u2026things are different now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus walked over to the Duel Runner. He then began to flashback to the time when Monet would spend endless hours working on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day dad\u2026\" She said. \"I'm going to become the greatest Turbo Duelist who ever lived!\" <br>\r\nKlaus\u2026\" He asked. \"Are you ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026\" Klaus answered. \"I'm ok Takashi\u2026anyway let's get to the matter at hand. Takashi\u2026I know you did the right thing by saving Nico. However your actions will have dire consequences if you remain here in Crash Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are trying to say Klaus\u2026?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying that you need to leave Crash Town\u2026and Never Return.\" Klaus said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing his grandfather say that to him, Takashi's entire body was shaken to its core. He always wanted to leave Crash Town, but not like this. It was like he was being exiled from his home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're shock by this Takashi\u2026\" His grandfather said. \"In truth I don't want you to leave and I know that you don't want to leave Nico and West alone. However since you defeated someone from the Radley family, everyone from in that faction is going to be after you. The only way to protect yourself is to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But\u2026but where I'm supposed to go\u2026?\" Takashi asked. \"It's not like I have a one-way ticket to New Domino City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026it's a long shot.\" Klaus said. \"But I do have a way for you to get to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so\u2026?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing you'll need to do is head to Satellite.\" Klaus started to explain. \"After that I want you to find my mechanic; Blister. Tell him that I want you to get to New Domino City and he'll help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about Nico and West\u2026?\" Takashi asked. \"I promised their dad that I'll be there for them. I can't just leave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll worry about the kids\u2026\" Klaus proclaimed. \"Besides\u2026if you stick around here, then they'll become endangered. Do you really want that to happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026No.\" Takashi said. \"I don't want that for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\u2026\" Klaus said. He proceeded to walk over to a desk and opened one of the cabinets. Inside of it was a punch of cards and notes. \"You'll be leaving in 3 days. In that time, I want you to learn everything is to know about Turbo Dueling, and the cards you need to Turbo Duel with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi walked over towards his grandfather and looked at him for a few moments. He then proceeded to hug him tightly. Klaus was filled with all sorts of emotions by Takashi's action. He tried to hold them back, but he couldn't do it. The old man spent about 1 hours crying as his Takashi hugged him, failing to hold back his own emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2 and a half days, Takashi has spent his time trying to understand the concepts of Turbo Dueling. He learned that in Turbo Duels, a special Field Spell known as; Speed World 2 will be activated. He also learned that he couldn't use regular Spell Cards and that he had to use Speed Spells, which are Spell Cards that Turbo Duelist uses. In order to activate these cards, Takashi must have Speed Counter, special counters that Duelist gain at the start of each of their turns. All of these things confused Takashi a little, but he was able to understand it after reading the notes that his mother had about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was done studying, Takashi worked on building a Turbo Dueling Deck. It was a little harder than when he made his regular deck, as he never had to include Speed Spells before. However, he soon was able to complete it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All done\u2026\" He said proudly. He looked at the clock and saw that it was 11:34 pm. \"I better get to sleep. Klaus said I had to wake up early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the young man went to bed. As he slept he began to have the strangest dream. In it was his Stardust Dragon, allowed with other powerful looking dragons. Together, the powerful beast fought back an ancient evil. Takashi also started to dream about several different people. Certain ones were Toru, some of the members of Team Satisfaction, and one that really caught his interest. It was a girl, around his age, that had burgundy/violet-red hair and brown eyes. She was the most beautiful person that he ever seen before, but before he could know more about her\u2026he woke up. When he did, he sighed quietly to himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Early that morning, Takashi and Klaus were busy preparing for Takashi's journey. The two of them packed Monet's old Duel Runner into Klaus's truck and the two of them proceeded to head over towards the secret entrance towards the Satellite. Once they were there, the two of them slowly brought the Duel Runner into the manhole. Once they were sure that the Runner was safely down, Takashi and Klaus looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Klaus\u2026are you sure that you're ok with this?\" The young man asked. \"I mean\u2026you'll be all alone now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus simply smiled and placed his hand on a Takashi's shoulder. He then looked his grandson in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me Takashi.\" He said confidently. \"I'll be just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus soon pulled out 2 letters and gave them both to Takashi. When he looked at them, he saw that 1 of them was from Nico and West, while the other was from Toru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost forgot to give these too you.\" Klaus said while he was laughing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrritated, Takashi punched his grandfather on the top of his head. He then began to read the letters, the first being Nico's and West's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Takashi\u2026\"The letter read. \"We heard from Klaus that you found a Duel Runner from out in the desert and that you're on your way to New Domino City. We're both happy for you and we wish you the best of luck. I know that we'll be sad now that you won't be here to play with us. However\u2026this is your chance to fulfill your dream and we just can't let you pass that by. Please know that you'll always be in our thoughts and that we'll be praying for your success. Best Wishes; Nico and West\u2026P.S. If you find Toru, tell him that we said hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi was crying somewhat as he put the kids letter away. He then pulled out Toru's letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sup bro\u2026\" It read. \"What's it been\u2026almost 3 years now? Wow, that sure is a long time. I hope you and the others are doing well. I'm doing pretty well for myself. I have won a couple of tournaments and have rented out a nice place here in New Domino City. However, there are a lot of people here who are on another level. People like the \"Devil's Duelist\" and the \"Black Rose\" are kicking ass, even though I haven't seen them Duel myself. Anyway I better wrap this up before I drag this letter on. If you come out here to New Domino City, then you can usually find me at my apartment. It's called; Poppo Time. Until we meet up again\u2026Take care. P.S. If you do show up, let's Duel. I've wanted a rematch with you for long time now. Things will be different this time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine Toru\u2026\" Takashi said as he put the letter away. \"It'll be good to face you in a Duel Again. Though\u2026hopefully it'll be a Turbo Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man proceeded to walk over towards Klaus and hugged him one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Kla\u2026I mean grandpa. Thanks for everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKlaus smiled while he had a tear in his eyes. He then hugged Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem, my boy.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stopped hugging, before it became gay and Takashi proceeded to enter the manhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a pain in the ass\u2026\" Takashi moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Duelist was currently dragging his mother's old Duel Runner down the underground tunnel that connects Crash Town to Satellite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How the hell could people do this in the old days? It's insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the young man was busy complaining he began to unconsciously flashback to the girl from his dreams. For some strange reason, he just couldn't get the girl out of his head. This bothered Takashi a little. Normally he would like dreaming about beautiful girls, but this one seemed different. She seemed special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just who is she?\" He asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he reached the end of the manhole and noticed someone looking down from the top of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026!\" The man said. \"Are you Takashi\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Yeah.\" The young man answered. \"Are you Blister\u2026Klaus' mechanic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Blister answered. \"Don't worry; I'll help you get that Duel Runner out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlister walked away for a second, only to come back with a long cable. He threw it down the manhole and Takashi caught it before it hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that cable and wrap it around the Duel Runner.\" Blister explained. \"As soon as you do that, attach it to handle bars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head and proceeded to do what Blister wanted him to do. Once he was done, Takashi gave Blister the ok. With that, Blister walked away again and soon the Duel Runner started lifting off the ground. Soon the Duel Runner was outside with Blister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice\u2026\" Takashi thought. \"That get rids of the problem of getting mom's Runner from off of the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi soon walked towards the nearby ladder and proceeded to climb out of the manhole. As soon as he got out, he saw Blister unwrapping his cord.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Blister responded. \"You're Klaus' grandkid after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them proceeded to walk towards Blister house and as he walked, Takashi looked around the area. He saw that Satellite was even worse shape than it was 30 months ago. This confused the young man somewhat because he thought that Team Satisfaction was trying to make Satellite a better place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me\u2026?\" He asked. \"What happened to Team Satisfaction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026..They broke up.\" Blister said. \"I'm not too sure on the details, but they decided to break up after a certain incident 2 years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked over towards Blister's garage and they began working on the Duel Runner. It was pretty hard as they had to replace all of the old parts with new ones. Once that was done, they adjusted it so that Takashi could ride on it comfortably. After that, Takashi gave the Runner a paint job. He added blue and white colors so that his Duel Runner matched the colors of his Stardust Dragon. The last thing that they did was hook the engine up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026\" Blister said to him. \"It's going to take a couple of hours before your Duel Runner is fully operational. So until then I might as tell you how you're going to make it to New Domino City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know\u2026you traveled through an underground tunnel that connected Crash Town to Satellite.\" Blister explained. \"You'll do a similar thing here. However instead of an underground tunnel, you'll use an underground pipeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pipeline\u2026?\" Takashi said in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026\" Blister continued. \"You see there is a pipeline that connects New Domino City with the Satellite. Once a month, the city ceases the pipeline's operation so that they can do internal maintenance. During that time, you'll use your Duel Runner to ride through the pipeline and make it to New Domino City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound too difficult.\" Takashi said. \"There got to be a catch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is.\" Blister said. \"You'll only have a 3 minute interval and as you make your way to the pipeline, Sector Security will be on your ass faster than Klaus getting on you for cursing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi flashed back to all the time he cursed around Klaus and each memory caused him to rub the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" He said. \"Then I better make sure that they don't get me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlister looked Takashi and saw him grinning with eagerness. This reminded him of Sakura as she had the same look on her face when she was faced with new obstacles. This brought a smile onto his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi soon walked out of the garage. \"I'm out of here\u2026\" He said. \"I'll be back before it's time for me to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man decided to walk around to see what type of places Satellite had to offer him. As he walked around, he saw something that really caught his interest. He saw a boy with white and green eyes, defending a group of children from some thugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it kid!\" One of the thugs said. \"You're in our way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white headed boy stuck his middle finger out at the thug who spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you make me?\" He said in confident tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cocky Bastard\u2026!\" The thug yelled as he attempted to punch the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too weak\u2026\" The boy said as he blocked the punch. He then threw him to the ground before looking at the others. \"C'mon is that all you guys have to throw at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thugs became pissed at the boy's comment so that all pulled out knives that they had in their pockets. One of them attempted to stab him, but before his hand could come down Takashi grabbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026haven't your mom ever told you that you're not allowed to play with sharp objects.\" The young man said as he tossed the knife away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?\" The white hair boy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi turned to him and smiled. \"The name's Takashi Nakamura and I'm here to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need your help!\" The boy said. \"So stay out of our business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two boys were arguing, the thugs attempted attack them. However both Takashi and the boy saw them and started kicking all of the asses. Once the last thug was defeated a little girl with pink hair walked over to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at her with a confused look on his face. He then started to scratch the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again\u2026?\" He said. \"I don't understand. Have we've met before little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl nodded her head and smiled. \"Yeah\u2026\" She said. \"It was almost 3 years ago. You helped me find my friend Crow when I was lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi thought back to that time and soon realized that the girl was right. She had helped her almost 3 years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saya\u2026?\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then began petting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026I hardly recognized you.\" He told her. \"You've sure have grown up over these last 30 months.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you and your friends doing here?\" Takashi asked. \"Did you all get lost again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya nodded her head in disagreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026\" She answered. \"You see we were out getting some things for Martha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martha\u2026?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's our stepmom.\" A little boy said. \"She's the one who takes care of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" A young woman said from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi turned his head and saw that the woman had long, crimson red hair and purple eyes. He felt like he met her before so he tried his best to remember. As he was doing that, the kids ran up to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly\u2026!\" Saya said as she hugged her. \"Look who I found!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked over to Takashi and tried to remember him. She soon saw the cross-shape on his left cheek and she suddenly realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that guy from 3 years ago!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi scratched his head for a few more minutes realizing who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're that girl from Team Satisfaction!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked over to one another and shook hands before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Lilly asked. \"Did something happen back at your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026you could say something like that.\" Takashi said. \"To make a long story short; I did something and now I'm forced to leave home. I'm planning on riding the pipeline to New Domino City tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Lilly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Takashi replied. \"So what happened here? Satellite looks even worse than it was when I last came here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked down to the ground for a few minutes. Afterwards, she looked towards Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stuff happened.\" She said. \"That's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at her and saw that there was pain in her eyes. Not wanting to bring up the subject anymore, Takashi decided to talk about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you been doing?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked back at the young man. \"I've been perfecting my very own Duel Runner.\" She said. \"With it I plan on leaving Satellite through the pipeline too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you leaving?\" Takashi asked as he scratched the back of his head. \"Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say something like that.\" Lilly replied. \"Let's just say I need to get something back that I lost. And the only way that I can get it back is for me to go to the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said. \"Then how about this. You join me while I head through the pipeline. Once we're out I'll help you get the thing that you lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would really do that\u2026?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Takashi said. \"Remember when Gordon's thugs were about to kill me. You and the rest of Team Satisfaction appeared and saved my life. Since that time I felt like I really owed you something. I'll use that time to help you get it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly smiled at him. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\u2026\" Takashi said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of them were talking, the boy with the white hair and green approached Lilly with a Duel Disk attached to his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly\u2026Duel me!\" He proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked over to the boy and sighed. \"Not now Toshiro.\" She said. \"Besides didn't I beat you already today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was then and this is now!\" Toshiro said as he clinched his fist. \"I'm going to defeat you this time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed again and shrugged Toshiro off. This man the young man angry and he started to demand that she would Duel him. Soon Takashi walked over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you Duel me?\" He suggested. \"I'm a pretty good Duelist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro examined Takashi for a few minutes before replying to his suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you don't seem very strong.\" He said. \"I doubt that you would give me a challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi simply smiled. \"Well, you won't know that until we actually Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked over Takashi and sensed a powerful aura surrounding his body. She could tell from the day that Takashi has grown significantly as a Duelist during these last 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel him Toshiro.\" She said. \"If you beat him, I might just decide to Duel you myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro lit up as soon as Lilly finished her sentence. He would then activate his Duel Disk and insert his deck into it. He then glared at Takashi.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" He said. \"Hurry up and let's Duel!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled comically for a few seconds as he started rubbing the back of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought he didn't want to Duel me.\" He thought. \"Ah well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former resident of Crash Town activated his Duel Disk and inserted his deck into it. Then both he and Toshiro proceeded to step back until they were about 10 feet away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first\u2026Draw!\" Takashi said as he drew a card from his deck. He soon put the card in his hand and pulled another card, which he put on the Monster Card Zone of his Duel Disk. \"I summon; Elemental Hero Ocean, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Ocean: ATK 1500 DEF 1200 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue seaman, who was holding a trident, appeared on Takashi's side of the field. Takashi would then insert a card into the Spell/Trap section of his Duel Disk and the hologram of the card appeared behind Ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set 1 card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn\u2026I Draw!\" Toshiro yelled as he drew a card. He put the card into his hand and proceeded to take out another card. He would place it face-down, in a horizontal position, on his Duel Disk. He would then insert a card into his Spell/Trap section of his Duel Disk and the card appeared behind his face-down monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon a monster card in Defense Mode and set 1 card face-down. With that, I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at both of Toshiro's card before he drew a card from his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026what could his face-downs be?\" He thought. \"Odds are that he's going to use his face-down monster or his Spell/Trap card to either destroy my monster or prevent me from attacking. So I better be cautious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at his cards and began to think of what he should do this turn. Seeing his opponent not do anything really bugged Toshiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you just going to stand there and do nothing or are you going to Duel?\" He yelled. \"In case you don't know, you're wasting time I could be using to Duel Lilly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed when Toshiro said that. She knew that the young 16-year-old was very proud and stubborn. He always tried to defeat her in a Duel, but couldn't do it, no matter how many times he attempted to. It's because of this, that Toshiro sometimes becomes impatient when he Duels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi soon figured out what he was going to do this turn. So the first thing he did was place a monster on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon the Tuner Monster: Dread Dragon, in Attack Mode!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDread Dragon: ATK 1100 DEF 400 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's Dread Dragon appeared onto the field and stood next to E-Hero Ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now Tune my Level 2 Dread Dragon with my Level 4 Elemental Hero Ocean to Synchro Summon; Iron Chain Dragon, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIron Chain Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 1300 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth monster jumped into the air and performed a Synchro Summon. Once they were done, Iron Chain Dragon appeared and flew back towards Takashi. It gave a powerful roar that scared the kids a little. Takashi saw this and turned towards them. He then began to give them a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026I'm sorry if he scared you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids looked at Takashi smiling at them and quickly snapped out of their scared state of mind. They then proceeded to smile at Takashi, which in turn caused Lilly to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy sure knows how to deal with little kids.\" She thought. \"I'm impressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro looked at Iron Chain Dragon and he wasn't impressed on how it looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what\u2026?\" He said. \"You're dragon doesn't scare me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi turned to Toshiro and focused his attention towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see\u2026\" He said. \"Iron Chain Dragon\u2026attack his face-down monster with your Hell Chains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chains around Takashi's monster started to catch on fire and proceeded to fly towards Toshiro's face-down monster. Once it got close enough Iron Chain Dragon started attack the card, causing it to flip up. Soon a monster wearing blue battling armor, and carrying a large sword, appeared and proceeded to block all of Iron Chain's attacks with his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\u2026\" Toshiro said in a cocky tone of voice. \"But my X-Saber Pashuul can't be destroyed in battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX-Saber Pashuul: ATK 100 DEF 0 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it realized that it was pointless to try and attack Pashuul, Iron Chain Dragon flew back to Takashi. </span></div></div>",

When he looked at the card, a smile appeared on his face. He then proceeded to place the card on his Monster Card Zone. \"I summon; XX-Saber Boggart Knight, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXX-Saber Boggart Knight: ATK 1900 DEF 1000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Beast-Warrior with blue armor and a red cape appeared on Toshiro's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Boggart Knight's Special Ability! When it's successfully Normal Summon, I can Special Summon a Level 4 or below X-Saber Monster from my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro quickly pulled the card that he wanted to summon and placed it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon the Tuner Monster; X-Saber Airbellum, also in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX-Saber Airbellum: ATK 1600 DEF 200 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Beast-Warrior appeared on the field and stood next to Toshiro's other monsters. This looked like a lion that was wearing armor and had a pair of wolverine type claws on each of its hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I'll Tune my Level 3 X-Saber Airbellum with my Level 4 XX-Saber Boggart Knight to Synchro Summon; X-Saber Souza, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX-Saber Souza: ATK 2500 DEF 1600 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro's Aibellum and Boggart Knight jumped into the air and performed a Synchro Summon. The monster that appeared was a Warrior, holding twin swords and wearing armor with a red cape. Takashi was impressed by the site of the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice Warrior you've got there.\" He said. \"I haven't had the chance to face a Duelist using X-Saber monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro smirked at Takashi's words. He then inserted a card into his Spell/Trap Zone and soon the card appeared. The card had the image of giant sword, falling towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You haven't seen anything yet.\" He told his opponent. \"I activate the Equip Spell; Legendary Sword! With this card, I can increase the Attack and Defense Points of 1 Warrior-Type monster by 300 points. I choose my X-Saber Souza!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nX-Saber Souza: ATK 2800 DEF 1900<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouza's twin swords disappeared as a giant sword stuck the ground in front of him. Souza proceeded to pick up the sword and point it at Iron Chain Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"X-Saber Souza\u2026attack Iron Chain Dragon with your Legendary Slash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSouza ran over to Iron Chain Dragon and killed it with one swing of his mighty sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card from his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Takashi drew his card, X-Saber Pashuul pointed its sword at Toshiro and slashed him in the chest, before going back to defending him. This shocked Takashi as he didn't expect his opponent's monster to do that to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened\u2026?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my Pashuul's Special Ability.\" Toshiro explained. \"If he's face-up in Defense Mode, then I'll take 1000 points of damage on every one of your Standby Phases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3700<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro: 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Takashi said. \"So in exchange for not being destroyed, your monster takes away part of your Life. It's kinda like a double-edge sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look\u2026!\" Toshiro firmly stated. \"You worry about you and I'll worry about me. Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\u2026fine\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the card that drew and put it into his hand. He then proceeded to take out another card, which he would insert into his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, it had the image of a pot that had a very creepy smile. \"I activate the Spell; Pot of Greed! Now I can draw two cards from my deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pot appeared from the card and started grinning at Toshiro. The kids were frightened by it, but were relieved when it vanished when Takashi drew his two cards. The young man would press a button on his Duel Disk, so that his face-down card would activate. When the card flipped up, it revealed itself to be Call of the Haunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Call of the Haunted. Now I can revive 1 monster from within my Graveyard and the monster I choose is Iron Chain Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of the Trap Card, Iron Chain Dragon appeared on the field. As the dragon roared, Takashi placed a card onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I summon the Tuner Monster; Magma Drago, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagma Drago: ATK 1400 DEF 600 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA medium sized dragon with red scales appeared on Takashi's side of the field and it stood next to Iron Chain Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I Tune my Level 2 Magma Drago with my Level 6 Iron Chain Dragon. Clustering wishes will become a new shining star. Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Take Flight, Stardust Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 2000 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Takashi's dragons flew into the air and performed a Synchro Summon. Soon, Stardust Dragon appeared in a flash of light. The mere sight of this majestic beast impressed everyone; the kids, Toshiro, and especially Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2026dragon\u2026\" She said as she held her right arm. \"It's the same one\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked over to her side as if someone was talking to her. She then began nodding her head for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Takashi continued on with his turn, while trying to ignore the slight pain coming from his right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon\u2026!\" He cried. \"Attack X-Saber Souza\u2026Shooting Sonic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beautiful white veil surrounded Stardust Dragon as it flew over to Souza. Seeing this happening surprised Toshiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are thinking?\" He asked. \"My monster has more Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about that\u2026?\" Takashi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore his opponent could question him more, Takashi quickly inserted a card into his Spell/Trap Zone. The card appeared on the field and it revealed the image of a red boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell; Rush Recklessly! With this I can increase the Attack Points of one monster by 700 points. I choose Stardust Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 3200<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe veil that was around Stardust Dragon glowed brighter as it approached Souza. Soon the powerful dragon ran though the X-Saber monster, killing him instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro: 2600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn by playing 1 card face-down. And since the effect of Rush Recklessly only last until my End Phase, Stardust Dragon's Attack Points return to normal.\" <br>\r\nA face-down card appeared behind Stardust Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026I Draw!\" Toshiro said as he drew a card from his deck. As he placed the card into his hand, the white haired Duelist looked over at Takashi. \"Whoa\u2026this guy is pretty good, but I'll defeat him. I have just the monster to deal with his Stardust Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro pressed a button on his Duel Disk, activating the face-down that he placed on his first turn. The card flipped up and it had the image of a warrior pointing his sword at something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; Gottoms' Emergency Call! Since I have an X-Saber monster on my side of the field, I can Special Summon two more X-Sabers from either of our Graveyards. I choose to revive X-Saber Airbellum and XX-Saber Boggart Knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Graveyard section of Toshiro's Duel Disk started glowing as both Airbellum's and Boggart Knight's cards popped out of them. The young Duelist then placed the cards into his Monster Card Zone and the two monsters appeared next to X-Saber Pashuul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Tune my Level 4 XX-Saber Boggart Knight with my Level 2 X-Saber Pashuul to Synchro Summon; XX-Saber Hyunlei in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXX-Saber Hyunlei: ATK 2300 DEF 1300 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Boggart Knight and Pashuul flew into the air and performed a Synchro Summoning. In a flash of light, a warrior wearing blue and gold armor, wearing a red cape, and holding an energy sword, appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Hyunlei's Special Ability! When he's successfully Synchro Summoned I can destroy up to 3 Spell or Trap Cards. I choose to destroy the one you just placed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHyunlei prepared to fire a beam from out his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Stardust Dragon's Special Ability!\" Takashi countered. \"By sacrificing itself, Stardust can destroy a card that has the ability to destroy other cards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon started glowing as bright as it could. The light was so intense that it consumed Hyunlei along with itself. When the light faded, both monsters were gone. Toshiro though, wasn't upset by this development. He just inserted a card into his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, it was revealed to be Monster Reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card; Monster Reborn!\" Toshiro stated. \"With it, I revive XX-Saber Hyunlei!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Graveyard section of Toshiro's Duel Disk started glowing again as Hyunlei's card popped out of it. The white haired Duelist took the card and placed it on his Monster Card Zone; bring Hyunlei back on to the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard\u2026!\" Takashi thought. \"He anticipated that I would use an ability to prevent Hyunlei's destruction effect from activating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\u2026\" Toshiro said. \"I Tune my Level 3 X-Saber Airbellum with my Level 6 XX-Saber Hyunlei to Synchro Summon; XX-Saber Gottoms in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXX-Saber Gottoms: ATK 3100 DEF 2600 LVL 9<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth monsters performed a Synchro Summoning and Takashi was shocked by the sight of Toshiro's new monster. It was a giant warrior, wearing super high-tech armor, was holding a sword that was about the size of a large building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"XX-Saber Gottoms\u2026attack his Life Points directly!\" Toshiro commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro: 2600 LP </span></div></div>",

Takashi instinctively fell to one knee after Gottoms strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn. Now what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Stardust Dragon's second Special Ability!\" Takashi said while still on the ground. \"If Stardust successfully uses its Special Ability, it can come back during the End Phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Graveyard section of Takashi's Duel Disk starting glowing as Stardust's card popped out of it. The young man then took the card and put it on his Monster Card Zone, allowing Stardust Dragon to reappear back on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the kids were glad that Stardust was back on the field, as they liked how beautiful it looked. Meanwhile as Takashi got back to his feet he glared at Toshiro's powerful Synchro monster. He was amazed that his opponent was able to Synchro Summon a level 9 monster in just 1 turn. But he wouldn't let that stop him from continuing the Duel. He knew the old say; 'The bigger they are, the harder they fall'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" He yelled as he drew a card from his deck. He took a look at the card before closing eyes. He soon imagined a flow chart filled with the cards that he had in his hand. He then began to image several possible moves that he could make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly saw Takashi thinking and knew that he was close to coming up with a strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This Duel is almost over.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi opened his eyes and continued on with his turn. The first thing that he did was insert a card into his Spell/Trap Zone. The card appeared on the field and it was revealed to be a Polymerization Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Polymerization!\" He said. \"With it, I fuse my Stardust Dragon with the Elemental Hero Bladedge that's in my hand to Fusion Summon; Dragon Knight Draco-Equiste, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight Draco-Equiste: ATK 3200 DEF 2000 LVL 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn Elemental Hero incased in golden armor appeared next to Stardust Dragon. The two monsters fused together and a new, more powerful monster appeared to take their place. This monster was a dragon that was wearing blue and yellow armor. It had huge wings, a long purple tail and was holding a lance that was about the size of its own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice play\u2026\" Lilly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro was amazed at what Takashi just did. He thought he did something awesome when he Synchro Summoned his Level 9 XX-Saber Gottoms. But Takashi one-upped him he Fusion Summoned his Level 10 Dragon Knight Draco-Equiste in even easier fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I attack Gottoms with Dragon Knight!\" Takashi declared. \"Go, Dragon's Lance!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco-Equiste raised its lance into the air and started charging energy into it. Once it was done, it charged towards Gottoms and stabbed him in the heart. Once he pulled out his lance, Gottoms exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro: 2500 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God Damn it!\" Toshiro cursed. \"Oh well\u2026I'll just have to play defense until I can find away to destroy his Dragon Knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Toshiro was thinking to himself, Takashi inserted another card into his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field it had the image of one monster splitting into two separate monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell; De-Fusion!\" He stated. \"With this card, I can return 1 Fusion Monster back into my Extra Deck. In exchange I can Special Summon the Fusion Material Monsters used to summon it. So be revived\u2026Stardust Dragon and Elemental Hero Bladedge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Bladedge: ATK 2600 DEF 1800 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight Draco-Equiste split apart and soon Stardust Dragon and Bladedge reappeared on Takashi's side of the field. Toshiro quickly realized that since Takashi summoned monsters during his Battle Phase, he can automatically attack with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon\u2026!\" Takashi said. \"Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mighty dragon opened its mouth and fired a blast of cosmic energy at Toshiro. When the attack hit him, a small explosion surrounded Toshiro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all of the holograms disappeared and both Duel Disks deactivated, Takashi walked over to Toshiro. He then extended his hand out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Duel\u2026\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro looked at Takashi's hand for a few moments before reluctantly shaking his hand. The kids walked over to the both of them and started to congratulate them. To them, it didn't matter who won or who lost. All that mattered is that they both had a great Duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly soon walked up to the both of them and smiled at them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Duel you two.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\u2026\" Takashi replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026.Yeah\u2026\" Toshiro said, not even looking her in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly proceeded to put his hand on Toshiro's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't beat yourself up.\" She explained. \"You tried your best and that's all that anyone can ask of you. I'm sure that you'll win your next Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToshiro looked at her before slowly nodding his head. Lilly smiled at him before walking towards Takashi. She looked down at him and saw that he was holding his right arm again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026can you do me a favor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\u2026\" Takashi answered. \"What would that be\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took off the backpack that she had with her and proceeded to unzip it. She then pulled out a Duel Disk and attached it to her right arm. The children and Toshiro were surprised by Lilly's actions because they knew what would happen if Lilly every pulled out her Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026I challenge you to a Duel!\" Lilly said with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked at her and nodded his head. He then moved his hand from his arm and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Lilly\u2026I accept your challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them made space for each other as they activated their Duel Disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first\u2026Draw!\" Lilly said as she drew a card from her deck. She took a look at it and smiled. \"Hello\u2026Partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Partner\u2026?\" Takashi questioned. \"Who the hell is she talking to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly proceed to insert a card into her Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, it had the image of 2 swords, stabbing the Level Stars of a Duel Monster's card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card; Cost Down! By discarding 1 card, I can lower the level of all the monster cards in my hand by 2 until the end of my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took a card from her hand and placed it into her Graveyard. She would then place a card onto her Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon; Dark Magician Girl, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl: ATK 2000 DEF 1700 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful Dark Magician Girl appeared on Lilly's side of the field and Takashi was amazed to see her. He knew that Dark Magician Girl was an extremely rare card and that only a few Duelists owned one. In truth, he's never face a Duelist who owned one before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Dark Magician Girl's Special Ability!\" Lilly declared. \"For every Dark Magician or Magician of Black Chaos that rests in our Graveyard, Dark Magician Girl receives 300 extra Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl: ATK 2300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute\u2026\" Takashi said. \"You don't have a Dark Magician or a Magician of Black Chaos in your Grave\u2026Shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\u2026\" Lilly said. \"When I played Cost Down, the card I discarded was my Dark Magician!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked on in shock as he saw the spirit of the Dark Magician right beside his apprentice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap\u2026!\" He said, cursing himself. </span></div></div>",

This is going to be so sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at Takashi and saw him smiling, which caused her to smile.

I mean he was able to defeat Toshiro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kids were talking, Toshiro looked on at the Duel with a great deal of interest. He wanted to see how Takashi would stack against Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn\u2026Draw!\" Takashi yelled as he drew a card from his deck. He looked at it for a second before putting it into his hand. He then inserted a card into his Duel Disk and when it appeared onto the field, it turned out to be Polymerization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell; Polymerization!

Soon Elemental Hero Thunder Giant appeared and he stared down Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Thunder Giant's Special Ability! By discarding 1 card, he can destroy 1 monster on the field whose original Attack Points is less than his own. I choose your Dark Magician Girl, whose original Attack Points were 2000!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi took a card from his hand and put it in his Graveyard. Thunder Giant would then prepare to fire a small electric blast from the palm of his hand. Lilly, however, was prepared for such a tactic so she quickly took a card from her hand and placed it in her Graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Special Ability of my Effect Veiler!\" She said. \"By discarding her, I can negate the effect of 1 of my opponent's monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffect Veiler appeared on the field and created a shield that surrounded Dark Magician Girl. Thunder Giant fired its electric blast, but it simply bounced off the shield, causing Takashi to grunt quietly to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well\u2026\" He said. \"I still have Thunder Giant's regular attack\u2026Thunder Beam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder Giant started to charge energy into the little orb that was on his chest. Once he was done he fired a blast of electricity at Lilly's magician. Once again though, she was prepared for this and simply pressed a button on her Duel Disk. This caused her face-down card to flip up and when it did, it revealed itself to be Negate Attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Negate Attack!\" She yelled. \"With it, I can negate one of your attacks and end the Battle Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small warp hole appeared in front of Dark Magician Girl and sucked in Thunder Giant's attack, sending it to another dimension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Takashi said. \"She's thinking 1 step ahead me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man took two cards from his hand and inserted them into the Spell/Trap Zone of his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play 2 cards face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo face-down cards appeared behind Thunder Giant as Takashi waited for Lilly to begin her turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" She yelled as she drew card. She looked at for a second and proceeded to put it in her hand. She would then press a button to open the Field Spell section of her Duel Disk before placing a card in it. She would then close it up. \"I activate the Field Spell; Secret Village of the Spellcasters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA holographic village filled with magical trees and small huts appeared. The kids, Toshiro, and Takashi were amazed on how life like the village actually was, even though it was only a hologram. Takashi refocused on the battle and looked at Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does this card do?\" He asked. \"I'm certain that you didn't play it just for show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right about that.\" Lilly replied. \"Here's how Secret Village of the Spellcasters work. As long as I have Spellcaster-Type monsters on my side of the field and you do not. Then you can no longer activate your Spell Cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck\u2026?\" Takashi said in a shocked tone of voice. \"I can't play any Spell Cards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Spell Cards\u2026\" Lilly replied. \"However\u2026if I don't have any Spellcasters on my field, then I'm not allowed to activate Spell Cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't really help\u2026\" Takashi thought. \"She wouldn't play a card like that if, and only if, her deck wasn't filled with Spellcaster-Type monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll continue on with my turn\u2026\" Lilly said as she pulled a card from her hand. \"I summon Magician's Valkyria, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician's Valkyria: ATK 1600 DEF 1800 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly placed a card onto her Monster Card Zone and quickly Magician's Valkyria appeared on the field, standing right next to Dark Magician Girl. Lilly would then take another card and inserted it into her Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, it had the image of a spell book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Equip Spell; Magic Formula! With it, I can increase the Attack Points of Dark Magician Girl by 700 points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl: ATK 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA book appeared in front of Dark Magician Girl and she quickly started to read through it. As she read, Takashi saw that a pink aura was surrounding her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good\u2026\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Magician Girl, Attack Elemental Hero Thunder Giant!\" Lilly commanded. \"Dark Burning\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beautiful magician finished reading her book and placed it under her left arm. She then flew over towards Thunder Giant fired a blast of pink mystic energy at him. When the attack hit, Thunder Giant instantly exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magician's Valkyria\u2026Attack his Life Points directly with Mystic Scepter Blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl flew back to Lilly as Magician's Valkyria flew over towards Takashi. As she was about to launch a blast of green mystic energy at him, the young man quickly pressed a button on his Duel Disk which activated one of his face-down cards. The card flipped up and it revealed itself to be 'A Hero Emerges'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play a Trap; A Hero Emerges!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A hero what\u2026?\" Lilly questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emerges, you know\u2026as 'emerges onto the field.\" Takashi answered. \"Now you have to pick a card in my hand and if it's a monster I get to play it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi showed Lilly the back of all the cards that were in his hand. The young woman took her time and began to think of which card she should pick. After about 2 minutes, she finally made her decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose\u2026the card on the far left!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked towards the card that she'd picked and smiled. He would quickly place the card onto his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice choice\u2026\" He said. \"I Special Summon; Elemental Hero Neos, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Neos: ATK 2500 DEF 2000 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful Elemental Hero thLP  had white skin, with red and blue highlights, and a muscular frame appeared on Takashi's side of the field. As soon as Lilly saw Neos she knew that she had to pull back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop Valkyria\u2026!\" She yelled. \"Don't Attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValkyria heard her master and proceeded to head back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was close\u2026\" She thought. \"I didn't expect he would have a powerful monster like that in his hand. I have to be more cautious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over her hand, trying to see if there were anymore moves that she could make this turn. She sighed when she couldn't find one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the crowd, Toshiro had a surprised look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026\" He thought. \"I knew that Takashi was good after he defeated me. But I didn't think that he would last as long as he has. Still\u2026I can't see him betting Lilly. I bet that he won't be able to take out 1000 of her Life Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the battlefield, Takashi was busy looking at him hand. He was trying his best to come up with something he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon damn it\u2026\" He thought quietly to himself. \"There has to be a way I can win without the use of my Spell Cards. There has to be a way\u2026there's always is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man closed his eyes and began to imagine a much larger flow chart, than the one he used when faced Toshiro. This flow chart contained all the cards that he and Lilly used during the Duel. Lilly saw him thinking and new that he was simulating several different moves within his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's about to do something\u2026\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi soon opened his eyes and placed his hand on the top of his deck. He then looked at Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my move\u2026I Draw!\" He yelled as he drew the card that he was touching. He took a good look at it and smiled before placing the card onto his Monster Card Zone. \"I summon the Tuner Monster; Flamvell Guard, in Attack Mode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamvell Guard: ATK 100 DEF 2000 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlamvell Guard appeared on the field and started flying next to Elemental Hero Neos. Without even having to think about it, Lilly knew exactly what Takashi was going to do next.</span></div></div>",

Soon, in a flash of light, Stardust Dragon appeared on the field. While all the kids were glad that Stardust was back, they didn't notice something. They didn't see that both Takashi and Lilly were holding their right arms in pain for some reason. Toshiro noticed this, but he thought that they were both holding their arms because they kept them in the air for too long. Soon, Takashi stopped holding his arm and continued on with his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon\u2026attack Magician's Valkyria with your Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust fired a blast of cosmic energy at Valkyria and when the blast hit her, she was killed instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 3100 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Valkyria was gone, Takashi took a card from his hand and inserted it into his Spell/Trap Zone. He would then press a button on his Duel Disk, which activated his other face-down card. When the card flipped up, it was revealed to be Call of the Haunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place 1 card face-down and activate the Trap Card; Call of the Haunted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\u2026\" Lilly cursed. \"Not that\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With this card, I can revive one of the monsters that rests in my Graveyard. I choose, Elemental Hero Neos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a face-down card appeared behind Stardust Dragon, the Graveyard section of Takashi's Duel Disk started to glow as Neos' card popped out of it. The young man took the card and proceeded to place it on his Monster Card Zone. When he did, Neos returned and he took right next to Stardust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that, I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's much better than I thought\u2026\" Lilly thought. \"In truth, I only wanted to Duel him because I wanted to face his dragon. But now\u2026I'm actually having a lot of fun. I can't wait to see what he does next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly took the top card from the top of her deck and drew it. She put the card into her hand and proceeded to look at all of her cards. Once she was done looking, she took one card and inserted it into her Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, everyone saw that it was Monster Reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Monster Reborn, Spell Card! With it I'll revive Dark Magician!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician: ATK 2500 DEF 2100 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Graveyard section of Lilly's Duel Disk started to glow as her Dark Magician card popped out of it. The young woman would take the card and place it in her Monster Card Zone. With that, the Legendary Magician stood right next to his apprentice and the both of them stared down both Neos and Stardust Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing\u2026\" Toshiro said. \"Lilly has both Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl on the field. She must be really enjoying herself if she's using the both of them at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi was looking on with a combination of shock and amazement. He couldn't believe that he was about to take on both magicians at the exact same time. However, he did know that with Dark Magician back on the field, Dark Magician Girl's Attack Points would decrease by 300 points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl: ATK 2700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it\u2026\" He said to her. \"Why bring back Dark Magician if you know Dark Magician Girl's attack power is going to drop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at Takashi and smiled. She would then insert a card into her Spell/Trap Zone and when the card appeared, it had the image of a knight's shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you\u2026\" She said to him. \"I activate the Spell Card; Knight's Title! With it I can sacrifice Dark Magician to Special Summon; Dark Magician Knight, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Knight: ATK 2500 DEF 2100 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician started to glow a bright purple color. When the glow faded, he appeared in a knight's armor and his magic staff was replaced with a magic sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi was amazed by the legendary monster's new form. However that amazement turned into shock when he realized why Knight's Title was played. Lilly saw the shock on his face and already knew that Takashi figured out her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\u2026\" She said. \"By playing Knight's Title to Special Summon Dark Magician Knight, the original Dark Magician gets sent to my Graveyard. And since the original Dark Magician is in my Graveyard, Dark Magician Girl regains the 300 points that she lost earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl: ATK 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Takashi cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets only worse from here Takashi\u2026\" Lilly explained. \"You see\u2026Dark Magician Knight as a Special Ability. When he's successfully summoned onto the field, he can destroy one card that's on the field. I choose\u2026Elemental Hero Neos!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Knight placed his sword right in front of him and began making a chant. As he was chanting his sword started glowing a bright green color. Once he finished, he charged over to Neos and prepared to strike him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Stardust Dragon's Special Ability!\" Takashi yelled. \"I sacrifice it, to negate Dark Magician's Knight Ability and destroy him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust quickly grabbed Magician Knight's sword, by biting it. It then created a glow so massive that it consumed Magician Knight along with itself. Lilly, however, wasn't shocked by the sudden turn of events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that Stardust is out of the way\u2026\" She said. \"Dark Magician Girl\u2026attack Neos with Dark Burning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female magician pointed her staff at Neos and prepared to fire her pink energy blast at him. Acting quickly, Takashi pressed a button on his Duel Disk. This activated his face-down which, when it flipped up, revealed the image of a large kunai knife that was attached to a large steel chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play a Trap; Kunai with Chain!\" He said. \"With it I can either have one of my monster gain 500 extra Attack Points or switch one of my opponent's monsters into Defense Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Lilly said in a shocked tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose to switch Dark Magician Girl into Defense Mode!\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same kunai knife appeared before Neos and the Elemental Hero quickly took it and threw the weapon. The knife knocked Dark Magician Girl's staff from her hand and, before she could react, the chain that was attached to the knife, wrapped around her. Neos would then pull on the chain, so that Dark Magician Girl wouldn't be going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly grunted with frustration as she looked at her hand. She pulled one card from that hand and inserted it into her Spell/Trap Zone. The card appeared behind the chained up Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place 1 card face-down and end my turn.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since it's the End Phase\u2026\" Takashi stated. \"Stardust Dragon returns to the field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of light, Stardust return and it stood next to Neos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit\u2026\" Lilly cursed. \"I thought that I would be able to take out 1 of your monsters by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you thought wrong\u2026!\" Takashi said to her as he drew a card from his deck. \"I'm in control because in case you haven't noticed\u2026Dark Magician Girl is in Defense Mode and all the power ups you gave her only increase her Attack Points. That means her Defense Mode stayed the same since this Duel first began!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark Magician Girl: DEF 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi took the card that he drew and placed it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Red-Eyes Wyvern, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes Wyvern: ATK 1800 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faithful Red-Eyes appeared on Takashi's side of the field and it stood next to Neos and Stardust. All three of Takashi's monster proceeded to glare at Lilly. All of the kids were shocked that she was on the ropes like this, especially Toshiro. None of them expected this to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Red-Eyes Wyvern\u2026attack Dark Magician Girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes opened its mouth and fired a giant fireball at Dark Magician Girl. The attack hit the defenseless mage, destroying her until nothing was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the secondary effect of Magic Formula!\" Lilly stated. \"When it's destroyed, I can regain 1000 Life Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4100 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Takashi said, cursing himself. \"Stardust Dragon\u2026attack her Life Points directly with Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly's arm started to hurt again as Stardust fired a blast of cosmic energy at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3400 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 1600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't fucking believe this\u2026\" Toshiro said to himself. \"Lilly\u2026Lilly is about to lose\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elemental Hero Neos\u2026!\" Takashi yelled. \"Attack Lilly's Life Points directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeos began gathering energy into his body. When he finished he fired an orange energy blast at Lilly. Thinking fast the crimson headed female pressed a button on her Duel Disk. This action activated her face-down card which, when flipped up, had the image of two cylinders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Magic Cylinder!\" She yelled. \"With it, I can negate the attack of one my opponent's monsters and inflict damage equal to that attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap...!\" Takashi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo cylinders appeared in front of Lilly as Neos' attack headed towards her. The first cylinder absorbs the attack while the second cylinder fired that attack back at Takashi!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 1600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" Takashi said, knowing he had no more cards in his hand. </span></div></div>",

She looked at the card and smiled before looking at Takashi. \"Hey\u2026this was one of the best Duels I've ever had. You're incredibly strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Crash Town resident looked at her for a minute before smiling back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\u2026\" He replied. \"You're really strong yourself. The strongest Duelist I've ever fought against. Let's have a rematch again sometime in the near future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got it\u2026\" Lilly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman proceeded to place the card that she drew onto her Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon; Silent Magician LV4, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician LV4: ATK 1000 DEF 1000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small magician appeared on Lilly's side of the field and stared at Takashi's monsters with an emotionless look on her face. Lilly would then insert a card into her Spell/Trap Zone and when the card appeared onto the field, it had the image of a Magician disappearing in one place and reappearing in another place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell; Instant Transmission! With this Spell, by paying 1000 Life Points I can have one of my monsters attack your Life Points directly as long as they have 1000 or fewer Attack Points. Luckily of me, Silent Magician has just enough!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician LV4 disappeared for a second and soon reappeared in front of Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silent Burning Attack!\" Lilly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young magician waved her wand and fired a blast of white light at Takashi, who instinctively flinched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 1600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holograms faded and the two Duelists walked over to each other. They shook hands and smiled. The kids ran over to them and congratulated them both for a great Duel. Toshiro walked over to Takashi and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not angry that you lost?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026\" Takashi replied as he nodded his head back and forth. \"Why would I be? I had a lot of fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had fun? Toshiro questioned. \"But you lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\u2026\" Takashi said. \"I wish I won the Duel, but sometimes you can't win every Duel. Besides, I'll just use this defeat to make myself stronger. That way, I might just defeat Lilly the next time we meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled at Toshiro who, in return, gave a small smile of his own. The two of them shook hands again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I better go.\" Takashi said. \"I got to get back to Blister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya walked over towards him with a sad look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be back?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at her and, for a second, saw Nico right beside her. So he bent down and gently rubbed the stop of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" He answered. \"I'll come back to visit you and all of your friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaya smiled and proceeded to hug Takashi, who hugged her back in return. Once they broke the hug, Lilly walked over to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen\u2026I'm going to be at the junkyard at 11:00 pm.\" She explained. \"I'll be waiting for you there. Ok\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026\" Takashi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the young man said goodbye to his new friends and proceeded to head back to Blister's. Once he got there, he saw him putting some extra things into his Duel Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything ready?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Blister replied. \"You're Duel Runner is ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi smiled as he walked over towards it. He then took of his Duel Disk and hooked it up to his Runner. After that, he pulled out his newly constructed Turbo Dueling Deck and pulled it into the card slot. Young man would then look at the clock and saw that it was 8:47 pm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2 hours and 13 minutes until I meet Lilly.\" He said as he put his helmet on. \"3 hours and 13 minutes until I reach New Domino City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Takashi thanked Blister and activated his Duel Runner. He then rode out of his garage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was 10:55 in the evening and almost everyone in the Satellite were inside their houses either sleeping or preparing to go to sleep. It was during this time that Lilly Muto was waiting for her new friend, Takashi Nakamura, to show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" She said quietly to herself. \"Where the hell is he\u2026? It's almost time to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked all around the area, trying to either Takashi's Duel Runner or see him walking his Duel Runner over to her. However she couldn't find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a guy who wants my help getting to New Domino City, he sure likes to take his sweet time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young, 19-year-old, woman stood by the junkyard's front gate and started to think about to her Duel against Takashi. The main thing that she was thinking about was his Stardust Dragon and how it made her arm hurt. She proceeded look at him arm for a moment before moving her jacket's right sleeve. There, it revealed that her arm had a crimson red birthmark and that birthmark looked like claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did my arm hurt when I saw that dragon?\" She thought. \"Something like this hasn't happen before\u2026so why now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilly stared at her birthmark she began to her someone's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly\u2026\"The voice called.\"Lilly\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly grabbed her deck and flipped through her cards until she found her Dark Magician Girl. Suddenly the card started to glow for a second and when it stopped, the spirit of the Dark Magician Girl appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it\u2026?\" The young woman asked. \"I have a lot on my mind right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\u2026\"Dark Magician Girl said. \"I could hear your thoughts, so I know that you have a lot on your mind right now. I'm here to tell you that I know the reason why your right arm began to throb when you saw that boy's dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really\u2026?\" Lilly said in a surprised tone of voice. \"Then tell me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't tell you everything.\"Dark Magician Girl said to her. \"However what I can tell you is that you, Takashi, his dragon, and several other individuals are connected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other individuals\u2026connected\u2026?\" Lilly questioned. \"What do you mean by that? How are we connected?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't give you all the details now\u2026\"Lilly spirit partner explained. \"However what I can tell you is this. You and other people who have birthmarks similar to yours\u2026are destined to meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Dark Magician Girl vanished as she returned into her card. Lilly would look at the card for a few seconds before putting it away. After that, she looked at her birthmark again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Birthmarks that's similar to mine\u2026?\" She thought. \"The only one who had a mark similar to this one is Alistair himself\u2026., but he had wings instead of a claw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, at 11:07, Takashi found Lilly at the entrance to the junkyard and rode over towards her. Once he got there he took off his helmet, got off his Duel Runner and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late\u2026\" He said. \"I wanted to test out my Duel Runner so I rode around Satellite for a couple of hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly didn't respond to Takashi's statement as she just continued to look at her birthmark. Takashi looked at the mark and was amazed on how it looked because he's never seen a mark like that before in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026cool looking birthmark.\" He said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked over at Takashi for a few seconds before looking down at his right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026\" She said. \"Can I take a look at your right arm? There something I want to confirm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026ok.\" The young man agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi presented Lilly with his right arm and the young woman slowly moved its sleeve. She was disappointed that there wasn't a mark like the one she has on his arm. What was on his arm was a big red rash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did you get that rash?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday\u2026\" Takashi answered. \"It just appeared after I had this strange dream. It was filled with dragons, monsters, and this beautiful red headed girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly blushed for a few moments before pointing at herself. \"Was that girl me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head back and forth. \"No\u2026hair was more of a dark burgundy to a red-violet color. Your hair is more of a crimson color.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Lilly replied in slight disappointment. \"Well let's drop the subject and get ready to head to the pipeline. It's going to take about 30 minutes to get there from the junkyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026\" Takashi said. \"I'm ready whenever you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Duelists walked over to their respective Duel Runners. Takashi was the first to reach his Runner and once he got on he put his helmet over his head and lowered his windshield. He then looked over at Lilly's Duel Runner and saw that it was a bright red color with purple highlights. Takashi could tell that Lilly has been taking good care of her Runner as there were no signs of damage to it. The crimson headed Duelist also wore a helmet that had the same color design as her Runner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice Duel Runner you have there\u2026\" The young man said. \"Where did you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't find it this Duel Runner.\" Lilly explained as she was starting up her Runner. \"I made it by using spare parts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026that's impressive.\" Takashi replied. \"You must be really good with mechanics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get around.\" Lilly said. \"Now let's get going. I have to explain what's going to happen now that we're about to enter the pipeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head and proceeded to activate his Duel Runner. The two Duelists then proceeded to enter the junkyard and as soon as they did, an extremely loud alarm sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" The young man asked Lilly. \"Is that Sector Security?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Lilly answered. \"They don't allow anyone here because they know that people could escape through the city if they used the pipeline. So they set up an alarm so that they could tell if anyone was entering the junkyard without permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Takashi said.</span></div></div>",

Lilly looked back and saw several Security officers' right behind them. She then looked back at Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go on ahead without me.\" She suggested. \"Go straight from here and you'll make it to the pipeline. Once the clock reaches 12 the maintenance will begin. You'll three minutes to make it to the end before trash starts pouring into pipeline again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026, but what about you?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be out as soon as you do.\" Lilly answered. \"Now go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at Lilly for a few moments before moving on ahead of her. One of the security members attempted to follow him, but the female Turbo Duelist started to spin her Duel Runner around in circles. This caused dirt to fly all over the place and it hit most of the officers right in their helmets, blinding them in the process. Once she stopped spinning Lilly looked and saw only one Security officer left. She started to smile as she looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\u2026Daisuke.\" She said. \"Long time no see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe officer, now known as Daisuke, looked at Lilly with a serious look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got you now Lilly\u2026you no good bitch!\" He said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My\u2026my\u2026\" Lilly responded as her smile grew. \"You really shouldn't call girls bitches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon lost her smile and started to glare at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially me\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them glared at each other for a few seconds before they started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna finish where we left off?\" Lilly suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's\u2026\" Daisuke replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Activating Field Spell; Speed World 2!\" The both yelled at the exact same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel Mode Engage\u2026!\" The computer from Lilly's and Daisuke's Duel Runner said as a purple field surrounded the area around them.

The cards appeared on the field for a few seconds before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then place two cards face-down and end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Daisuke yelled as he drew a card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: SPC-3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: SPC-3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silent Magician LV4's Special Ability activates!\" Lilly said as she was trying to reach the entrance to the pipeline. \"For every card that my opponent draws from their deck, Silent Magician receives 1 Spell Counter and for each Spell Counter she gains 500 extra Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician LV4: ATK 1500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That power boost won't help you!\" Daisuke told Lilly as he placed another card on his Monster Card Zone. \"I Summon; Gearfried the Iron Knight, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGearfried the Iron Knight: ATK 1800 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother knight that was completely covered in armor appeared by Daisuke. This knight's armor was almost all black while Blade Knight's armor was almost all blue. Daisuke would then take a card from his hand and insert it on the field. When the card appeared on the field it had the image of an angel that had a pair of cyber wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Speed Spell; Summon Speeder! By removing 2 Speed Counters I can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from my hand. The cost is that the selected monster cannot attack this turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: SPC-1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke took a card from his hand and placed on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon the Tuner Monster; Chaos-End Master, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos-End Master: ATK 1500 DEF 1000 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn angel, wearing white armor, appeared on Daisuke's field and started flying by him and his other two monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Tuner my Level 4 Gearfried the Iron Knight with my Level 3 Chaos-End Master to Synchro Summon; Lightning Warrior in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning Warrior: ATK 2400 DEF 1200 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth monsters jumped into the air and performed a Synchro Summoning. Once they finished, a new Warrior-Type monster appeared and started flying by Blade Knight. This monster had blonde hair and was wearing a shiny white armor. He also had red scarfs around his neck and waist. Lilly looked at Daisuke's new monster, but she wasn't impressed by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bringing out Lightning Warrior already\u2026\" She said. \"You must really be desperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Daisuke yelled as he pressed a button on his Duel Runner. The button activated his face-down card so it reappeared on the field and flipped up. The image on the card was 3 rockets, tied together by some chain. \"I activate the Trap Card; Blast with Chain! When activated, this card acts as an Equip Card that can give one my monsters 500 extra Attack Points. I choose to equip it to Blade Knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlade Knight: ATK 2100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small rocket back appeared on Blade Knight's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blade Knight\u2026attack Lilly's Silent Magician LV4!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rockets on Blade Knight lit up as the Warrior-Type monster headed for Silent Magician. Lilly, acting quickly, pressed a button on her Duel Runner. One of her face-down cards reappeared on the field and flipped up. The card revealed itself to be Magic Cylinder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; Magic Cylinder!\" The young woman yelled as she turned her Duel Runner around towards Daisuke. \"With it, I can negate your attack and inflict damage to you equal to Blade Knight's Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Daisuke said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Magic Cylinders appeared in front of Silent Magician as Blade Knight got sucked into one of them. The Warrior-Type Monster would then get blown out of the other Cylinder and collided with Daisuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: 1900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe collision with his own Monster caused Daisuke to lose his balance for a few seconds. This gave Lilly the chance to widen the distance between him and herself. The young woman would press a button on her computer screen and quickly Takashi's face appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026are you at the pipeline?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" The young man answered. \"It's about to be 12:00 in about 5 minutes. You need to hurry up and get your ass down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that\u2026\" Lilly stated. \"But I'm being delayed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to come over there and help you?\" Takashi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026\" Lilly answered. \"Just stay where you are and wait for the clock to hit 12.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head as Lilly hung up. As soon as she did, Daisuke caught up to her and he was extremely pissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026Bitch!\" He yelled. \"You're going to pay for that. Lightning Warrior, attack her Magician!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lightning Warrior approached Silent Magician, Lilly pressed another button on her Duel Runner. This caused her other face-down card to appear on the field and when the card flipped up, it had the image of a box. Inside this box was the Pot of Greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; The Gift of Greed!\" She said. \"With this, you have to draw two cards from your deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what the hell you're planning.\" Daisuke said as he drew two cards from his deck. \"Are you're doing is giving me cards\u2026.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Security Officer stopped talking when he finally realized what Lilly was up to. She wanted him to draw more cards because Silent Magician's Special Ability allows her to gain Spell Counters whenever Daisuke draws cards. Since he drew two cards, Silent Magician Attack Points increase by 1000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician LV4: ATK 2500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you Lilly\u2026I fell right into your trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did\u2026\" The young woman said in agreement. \"Now are you going to end your turn or what\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026.Shit.\" The officer cursed. \"I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Lilly yelled as she drew a card from her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: SPC-4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: SPC-2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman inserted a card into her Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared it had the image of a ramen cup with the word 'fusion' on the label.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Speed Spell; Instant Fusion! When I have 3 or more Speed Counters, I can give up 1000 of my Life Points to Special Summon a level 5 or lower Fusion Monster from my Extra Deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 3000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: 1900 LP </span></div></div>",

The young woman would then take another card from her hand and would also place it on her Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Normal Summon the Tuner Monster; Arcane Apprentice, in Attack Mode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcane Apprentice: ATK 1000 DEF 400 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small magician, who was covered in purple robes, appeared on Lilly's side of the field and starting flying next to Musician King.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I tune my Level 5 Musician King with my Level 4 Arcane Apprentice to Synchro Summon; Arcanite Magician, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcanite Magician: ATK 400 DEF 1800 LVL 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful Magician with shining blue robes appeared beside Lilly and started flying by her Silent Magician. In the magician's left hand was a staff, similar to that of Dark Magician's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the point of summoning a monster with only 400 Attack Points?\" Daisuke asked as he slowly got closer to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't have 400 Attack Points for long.\" Lilly stated. \"I activate Arcanite Magician's Special Ability! When successfully Synchro Summoned, my magician receives 2 Spell Counters and for each Spell Counter, his Attack Points are raised by 1000 Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcanite Magician: ATK 2400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silent Magician LV 4 attacks your Lightning Warrior while Arcanite Magician will attack your Blade Knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Lilly's Magicians turned and attacked Daisuke's monsters. Silent Magician cut Lightning Warrior's head off with a slash of her magic staff. While Arcanite Magician incernerated Blade Knight with a powerful fire spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 3000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: 1500 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs both of her monsters flew back over to her, Lilly took a card from her hand and inserted it into her Spell/Trap Zone. The card appeared on the field for a split second before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play one card face-down and end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked over at her opponent and saw that Daisuke was glaring at her with a fierce look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DRAW\u2026!\" The Sector Security officer yelled as he drew a card from his deck. \"You're going to pay for this Lilly! I'll make sure you receive a life sentence at the Facility!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause Daisuke drew a card Silent Magician received a 4th Speed Counter, increasing her overall Attack Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent Magician LV4: ATK 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know better not to mention that place to me Daisuke!\" Lilly spat. \"Now hurry up and make your move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\u2026\" Daisuke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: SPC- 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: SPC-3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Security officer inserted a card into his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, it looked like a new version of Monster Reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Speed Spell; Monster Reincarnation! Now by discarding 1 card from my hand to the Graveyard, I can bring a monster from my Graveyard to my hand! I choose to discard my Cliff the Trap Remover to retrieve my Lightning Warrior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke removed Lightning Warrior from his Graveyard and placed it back into his Extra Deck, since Synchro Monster can't go player's hands. He then placed the Cliff the Trap Remover card into his Graveyard instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now remove my Blade Knight and Cliff the Trap Remover from the Duel to Special Summon; Black Luster Soldier - Envoy of the Beginning, Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Luster Soldier \u2013 Envoy of the Beginning: ATK 3000 DEF 2500 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA powerful Knight, wearing dark blue and black armor appeared on Daisuke's side of the field. Lilly looked at it with a shocked expression on her face. She then looked at the clock and saw that it was already 12:00am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026I got to take care of that thing in less in 3 minutes!\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Turbo Duelist reached the pipeline and as Lilly was riding inside of it, she saw that Takashi was already half way through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've have to hurry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke continued on with his by inserting a card into his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field it had the image of monster, covered in a surge of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Speed Spell; Speed Energy!\" Daisuke stated. \"By discarding 1 Speed Counter I can increase my Black Luster Soldier's Attack Points by the number of Speed Counters I have remaining, times 200!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: SPC-5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: SPC-2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Luster Soldier \u2013 Envoy of the Beginning: ATK 3400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Luster Soldier, attack Silent Magician LV4 with your Chaos Blade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Luster Soldier flew over towards Silent Magician and sliced the young mage in half with his sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 2600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: 1500 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Luster Soldier's Special Ability activates! When he successfully destroys one of your monsters in battle, he can attack again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Lilly said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful knight turned his attention to Arcanite Magician and sliced him in half too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 1600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: 1500 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as her mage was killed, Lilly pressed a button on her Duel Disk. This activated the face-down card that she set earlier. The card reappeared and flipped up, when it did it had the image of a shining light coming out of the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Miracle's Wake!\" She yelled. \"When one of my monsters is destroyed by battle this turn, I can Special Summon it. I choose Arcanite Magician!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of the Miracle's Wake card, Arcanite Magician appeared and started flying by her master again. Seeing the monster that he just destroy didn't frighten Daisuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your hopes up Lilly\u2026\" He said in a confident tone of voice. \"Because you didn't Synchro Summon Arcanite Magician to bring him back to the field, his Attack Points stay at the original level.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcanite Magician: ATK 400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine Daisuke\u2026\" Lilly stated as she pointed at Black Luster Soldier. \"But don't forget that when your turn ends, Black Luster Soldier \u2013 Envoy of the Beginning's Attack Points drop down to their original level!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you bitch!\" He said. \"I end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Luster Soldier \u2013 Envoy of the Beginning: ATK 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at the clock and saw that it was 12:02. She then looked over at the end of the pipeline and saw that Takashi was waiting for her to get out. Realizing that it was her last chance to win, she put her hand on her deck and closed her eyes for a few seconds. She then opened them as the clock hit 12:03 and the trash started flowing back into the pipes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" She yelled as she drew a card from her deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: SPC- 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: SPC- 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly looked at the card that she drew and smiled for a second, but before she played it she placed a card on her Monster Card Zone first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Magician's Valkyria, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician's Valkyria: ATK 1600 DEF 1800 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagician's Valkyria appeared on the field as trash started flying past Lilly and Daisuke. The female Turbo Duelist would then insert the card that she drew into her Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, it had the image of Dark Magician, the Flame Swordsmen, and the Dark Flare Knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Speed Spell; Speed Fusion! When I have four or more Speed Counters, I can perform a Fusion Summon. I fuse my Arcanite Magician with my Magician's Valkyria to Fusion Summon; Supreme Arcanite Magician, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Arcanite Magician: ATK 1400 DEF 2800 LVL 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Lilly's Spellcasters fused to form one powerful magician. This magician was very similar to the regular Arcanite Magician in terms of appearance. The only differences were that his robes were blue instead of white and that his staff changed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that thing going to do Lilly?\" Daisuke questioned. \"It's not powerful enough to handle my Black Luster Soldier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that you fool!\" The young woman spat at her opponent. \"But you should know that Supreme Arcanite Magician carries the same ability of Arcanite Magician! He now receives 2 Spell Counters and for each Counter he receives he gains 1000 extra Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Arcanite Magician: ATK 3400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However Daisuke, even though my monster now surpasses you I'm not going to attack you with him yet. I'm instead going to activate his second Special Ability! By removing 1 of his Spell Counters, my Magician can destroy 1 card on the field and the card I choose is Black Luster Soldier \u2013 Envoy of the Beginning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSupreme Arcanite Magician: ATK 2400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026!\" Daisuke yelled in disbelief as he watched Supreme Arcanite Magician blast Black Luster Soldier with a lightning blast from his staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly reached the exit to the pipeline and reached the outside. She then turned around and said one last thing to Daisuke before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Supreme Arcanite Magician, Attack Daisuke's Life Points directly\u2026!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer powerful Spellcaster complied with her order and blasted Daisuke with a powerful blast from his staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly: 1600 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the all the holograms faded, Daisuke's Duel Runner slowed down. This caused most of the trash to crash into him as Lilly and Takashi looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch\u2026\" The young man said. \"That had to hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" The young woman replied. Now let's hurry up and go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi nodded his head as he and Lilly rode towards the city. As they looked on with amazement, Lilly soon realized something so stopped moving. Takashi saw this and stopped too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong\u2026?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026something just came to me.\" Lilly answered. \"Now that we're in New Domino City, where are we going to stay?\" </span></div></div>",

So he quickly went into his backpack and pulled out the letter that Toru sent him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go to Poppo Time.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is a Poppo Time?\" Lilly questioned as she started rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the name of an apartment that my friend Toru lives at.\" Takashi explained. \"I'm sure if we asked we could live there with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" The young woman said. \"That sounds like a plan. So where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi stood still with a dumbstruck look on his face. He then looked over at the letter and noticed that Toru only gave the name of the apartment, not the location of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to have to find it ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly sighed to herself. \"Of course we will\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the two Turbo Duelist rode off, trying to find the location of Poppo Time. Meanwhile, inside one of New Domino's largest buildings, a young woman was busy staring out at the city. Her face body was covered in darkness, due to the fact that no lights were on. Suddenly a man came into the room and like the young woman; he body was also covered in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sayer\u2026\" The young woman said as she looked outside. \"I'm going out tomorrow to cause some trouble\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man, now known as Sayer, smiled as he looked at the girl. He then proceeded to talk to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine\u2026Akiza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally\u2026we're here!\" Takashi said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\u2026\" Lilly replied with a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending most of the day looking around New Domino City, Takashi and Lilly have finally made it to Poppo Time; the apartment that Toru has been living in since he moved to the famous city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So\u2026are you sure that this Toru guys is here?\" Lilly asked as she looked at Takashi. \"I mean it doesn't really look like an apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at the building and realized that her friend had a good point. Poppo Time looked more a like a clock store than an actual apartment. However the young man knew that looks could be deceiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go inside.\" He proposed. \"We can find out if this really is the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly nodded her head and the two Turbo Duelists parked their Duel Runners by the building. They then walked inside and saw an old lady sweeping the floor with a broom. The lady had grey hair, which was tied in a bun, and was wearing glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um\u2026excuse me.\" Takashi said. \"Are you the owner of this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old woman looked at Takashi and Lilly before putting her broom away. She then walked up them and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes I am.\" She answered. \"My name is Zora and I'm the owner. What may I do for you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Takashi Nakamura\u2026\" The young man said. \"And the young woman beside me is Lilly Muto. We're here because we heard that is place is also an apartment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were wondering if we could rent one of the ones here.\" Lilly finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course you can rent one ones.\" Zora said. \"Unfortunately you'll going to have to share it with someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who would that be?\" Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lazy young man named Toru Ishida.\" Zora explained. \"He never pays for rent on time and always seems to be up to something odd. Just today he skipped out on paying rent just so he could Duel somebody called the 'Black Rose'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi remembered that in Toru's letter he mentioned a Duelist named the 'Black Rose', but he also remembered that Toru had never seen this person Duel before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs. Zora\u2026\" He said. \"Do you know exactly where Toru is? You see\u2026he's my best friend and it's been almost 3 years since I last saw him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Zora replied while looking at Takashi. \"I can't be sure where Toru went, but I think he's at the Southern District.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man smiled and gently nodded his head at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\u2026\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Zora led Takashi and Lilly back outside of the apartment. They then walked down a small hill which led to a garage. Zora pressed a switched to open the garage door and when it did open, Takashi and Lilly were shocked by what they saw. The inside was huge and it looked like it could hold about 5 people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two can hold your vehicles in here.\" Zora said to the two of them. \"Your rooms are upstairs and there is a bathroom at the end of the hall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit\u2026\" Lilly thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZora left the two of them to do their own thing while she went back to clean the front of apartment. Takashi was the first to go inside and Lilly soon followed after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026\" Takashi said. \"Toru must have a lot of money to rent out a place like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No joke\u2026\" Lilly agreed. \"But how much do think this place costs? According to Mrs. Zora, your friend has been late on his rent a couple of times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When can ask Toru himself when we meet up with him.\" Takashi replied. \"According to Mrs. Zora he might be at the Southern District. We can go there once I'm finish doing something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\u2026\" Lilly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman put all of her things into the garage and placed them by one of the sofas. She then started to relax on it while Takashi was sitting down on one of Toru's desks. He pulled out his deck and started pulling out cards that related his Elemental Heroes. After he did that he pulled a box from his backpack. He opened the box and inside were the cards that his mother used in her duels. With these cards he built a new deck for his Elemental Heroes and a new deck for his dragons. After he finished he put his Dragon deck back into his deck box while he brought out a new box and put the E-Hero inside of it. Takashi would then begin writing a letter. It read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Klaus\u2026it's me, Takashi. I hope you and the others are doing well. I just made it to New Domino City and I'm staying in the apartment that Toru lives in. I'm sending you this letter just to let you know that I'm ok and that you don't have to worry about me. Also along with this letter is a Dueling Deck. I want you to give it to West. It's my gift to him. Anyway I better finish this before I start dragging on. I hope you have a nice life and I promise I'll find a way to bring you and everyone else here too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished writing, Takashi put the letter and the new E-Hero deck inside of an envelope. He then wrote his house address and Klaus' name before walking towards Lilly, who was busy flipping channels on Toru's big screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\u2026\" She said. \"Over 5000 channels and nothing good is on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi sighed and slapped Lilly on the backside of her head, causing her to grab him by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done Lilly.\" Takashi said calmly as he looked at his friend. \"We can go find Toru now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly continued to glare at Takashi for a few more moments before letting go of him and walking outside. The young man followed her, but before he got back on his Duel Runner Takashi did a couple of things. The first thing was cutting off the T.V., the second thing was closing the garage door, and the third and final thing was putting the letter he wrote into the mailbox. Once he finished those things those things, Takashi got back on his Duel Runner and proceeded to head for the Southern District with Lilly close behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 2 hours of searching, Lilly and Takashi made it to the Southern District. Once they got there though, a large explosion sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell\u2026?\" Lilly said in shock. \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the young woman could say anything else she saw that her birthmark was glowing a bright crimson red color. As she looked on at her birthmark, Lilly suddenly sensed something in the distance and decided to walk over towards it. Takashi saw her walking and decided to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the two of them reached an open space and Takashi saw something that he really wished he hadn't seen. Toru was on the ground and he was in a critical state. In front of him was a black dragon with red rose petals all over its body and beside this dragon was woman with long dark burgundy hair. She was wearing clothes that covered most of her body and was wearing a faceless mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she\u2026?\" A puzzled Lilly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi didn't answer her and just ran over to where his friend was. Once he got there he started to shake Toru slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up\u2026Wake up Toru!\" He said to him in a worried tone. \"Toru wake up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru didn't answer Takashi. So the young man glared at the woman, who was busy looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did this!\" He declared was glaring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\u2026\" The woman said. \"He challenged me and this is the result of his actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the woman say that just made take angrier. As his anger grew, Lilly's birthmark started glowing some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi\u2026\" She thought. \"What are you?\" </span></div></div>",

She's the\u2026Black\u2026Rose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked back at Toru before watching him pass out again. He then looked over at the Black Rose and saw her make her dragon disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter if she is or she isn't!\" He declared. \"I'm going to destroy her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try it.\" The Black Rose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Duelists inserted their decks into their Duel Disks and caused them to shuffle. Once the decks were shuffled, they both drew 5 cards from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first\u2026Draw.\" The Black Rose said calmly has she drew a card from her deck. She put the card in her hand before taking another card and placing it on her Monster Card Zone. \"I summon Bird of Roses, in Attack Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBird of Roses: ATK 1800 DEF 1500 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bird with leafs for its wings and body, along with roses on the tips of its wings and the top of its head, appeared on the Black Rose's side of the field. She then inserted a card into the Spell/Trap Zone and that card appeared behind Bird of Roses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then set 1 card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw\u2026!\" Takashi yelled as he firmly and swiftly drew a card from his deck. He looked at the card for a quick second before placing it on his Monster Card Zone. \"I summon Luster Dragon, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuster Dragon: ATK 1900 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shining blue dragon appeared on the field and it stood next to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luster Dragon\u2026destroy her abomination with your Shining Breath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's dragon shot a blast of shiny blue energy which destroyed bird of roses until nothing was left of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 4000 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose: 3900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Bird of Roses Special Ability!\" The Black Rose stated. \"When destroyed while in Attack Mode, I can Special Summon 2 Plant-Type Tuner monster from my deck in Defense Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mysterious individual's Duel Disk started glowing as a holographic checklist of all the Plant-Type Tuner monster in her deck appeared before her. She would press to cards before the checklist disappeared and her Duel Disk ceased glowing. Then, the cards that she selected popped out of her deck and she proceeded to place them both on her Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon the Tuner monsters; Cherry Inmato and Naturia Cherries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherry Inmato: ATK 700 DEF 400 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturia Cherries: ATK 200 DEF 200 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo monsters appeared on Black Rose's field. The first one was a figure with a cherry for a head. The other was simply a cherry with eyes and a mouth. Takashi wasn't intimidated by his opponent's monsters and simply glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn\u2026\" He said firmly. \"Now\u2026make your move you Bitch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly walked over to Toru and moved him away from the Duel. As she did, Lilly started to have a bad feeling about the Black Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\u2026?\" She asked. \"Why do I sense a strange power coming from her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman looked at her birthmark on her arm and saw that it was still glowing. She then looked at the Black Rose and saw that her right arm also had a slight glow to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could she\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Duel the Black Rose drew a card from her deck and placed it in her hand. She then took a card from her hand and placed it on her Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Botanical Lion, in Attack Mode!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBotanical Lion: ATK 1600 DEF 2000 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lion with a flower petal mane and leafs coming out of its legs appeared on the Black Rose's field and stood by her other monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I Tune my Level 4 Botanical Lion with my Level 2 Cherry Inmato to Synchro Summon; Splendid Rose, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplendid Rose: ATK 2200 DEF 2000 LVL 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of the Black Rose's monsters jumped into the air and performed a Synchro Summoning. When they finished a woman with blonde hair, green and black clothes, and had rose petals on her ankles appeared. The new monster also carried to thorn whips in both of her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid Rose\u2026attack that fool's Luster Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplendid Rose nodded her head and proceeded to whip Luster Dragon repeatedly, causing it to die due to its injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose: 3900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 3700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you foolish boy\u2026you will know pain.\" The Black Rose said to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\" Takashi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you\u2026\" The Black Rose replied as she pressed a button on her burgundy colored Duel Disk. Her face-down card flipped up and it revealed the image of exploding flower petals. \"I activate the Trap Card; Blossom Bombardment. Now, since I just destroyed one of your monsters with a Plant-Type I can inflict damage to you equal to Luster Dragon's Attack Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026?\" Takashi yelled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru slowly woke up as he saw several flower petals surround his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta\u2026kashi\u2026\" He stuttered. \"Watch Out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the young man could react to Toru's warning one of the flower petals exploded by Takashi's arm. Soon the rest of the flower petals exploded all around Takashi and when the explosions finally ended Takashi fell to the ground, bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose: 3900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 1800 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Toru yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi!\" Lilly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black Rose started laughing like she just saw something extremely funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See\u2026.I told you that you would experience pain!\" She proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026witch\u2026\" Takashi said while he was on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing him say the word witch woke something up in the Black Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026the fuck\u2026did you just call me?\" She asked. \"You asshole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi tried his best to get to his feet. \"I called\u2026you a witch!\" He declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BASTARD!\" The Black Rose screamed as a powerful gust of wind suddenly came from her body. \"You're going to pay for that you little shit! I activate Splendid Rose's Special Ability! By removing a Plant-Type monster in my Graveyard I can half Splendid Rose's Attack Points and have it attack again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplendid Rose: ATK 1100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplendid Rose grabbed Takashi with her thorn whip, causing him to bleed more. She then lifts him in the air before slashing him twice in the chest, leaving a giant X-shaped scar on his chest. As he fell to the ground the Black Rose looked at his new scar and the old one that was on his face. She then started laughing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose: 3900 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is she?\" Lilly asked. \"How can she make actual Battle Damage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's\u2026she's a Psychic\u2026Duelist.\" Toru explained. \"A person who\u2026can turn Duel Monster holograms\u2026into real things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\u2026\" Lilly said silently as she watched Takashi slowly struggle to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" The Black Rose said. \"Now Splendid Rose's Attack Points return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplendid Rose: ATK 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Draw.\" Takashi softly said as he drew a card from his deck. He put the card in his hand before taking another card and placing it on his Monster Card Zone. \"I\u2026summon\u2026Red-Eyes Wyvern, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes Wyvern: ATK 1800 DEF 1600 LVL 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes appeared on Takashi's side of the field, prepared for battle. The young man then struggled to insert a card into his Spell/Trap Zone. Once he got the card in there, it appeared on the field and it was Half Shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play\u2026Spell; Half Shut! Now I can cut\u2026Splendid Rose's Attack back in half for a turn, in exchange it can't be destroyed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSplendid Rose: ATK 1100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed-Eyes Wyvern fired a fireball at Black Rose's monster, which easily shook off the attack since it was actually there and Red-Eyes' attack wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose: 3200 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose looked on as Takashi set 2 cards face-down and ended his turn. As he did that, he fell to one knee and started breathing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accept your fate.\" She said to him. \"Stop trying to fight and let me kill you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked at the mysterious woman for a few seconds before giving her the middle finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck\u2026you...\" He said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine!\" The Black Rose yelled. \"I Draw!\" She drew a card from her deck. \"I tune my Level 6 Splendid Rose with my Level 1 Naturia Cherries.

Once they finished the rose dragon appeared again and it roared so loud that the ground started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Black Rose Dragon's Special Ability! When successfully Synchro Summoned, it can destroy all the cards on the field. Go\u2026Black Rose Gale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose Dragon created a giant hurricane that not only destroyed itself and the cards that were on the field, but it destroyed most of the area that was around Takashi. Once the field was empty, Black Rose inserted a card into her Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the destroyed field it turned out to be Monster Reborn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Card; Monster Reborn! So return\u2026Black Rose Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge gust of wind returned as Black Rose Dragon reappeared and stood by its master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been fun fool, but I'll see you in Hell! Black Rose Dragon, end him with your Black Rose Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful dragon fired a huge black flame covered in purple flower petals at Takashi. Acting on his instincts alone, the young man took a card from his hand and placed it into his Graveyard. Suddenly the spirit of a regular Kuriboh appeared in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate\u2026Kuriboh's Special Ability. By discarding it to the Graveyard, I can reduce the damage of this attack to 0.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuriboh took the hit for Takashi, protecting him from Black Rose Dragon's flames. However the shockwaves sent him crashing back down to the ground. The Black Rose would the insert another card into her Spell/Trap Zone and it appeared behind Black Rose Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play 1 card face-down and end my turn!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takashi!\" Lilly called in a worried tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black Rose turned her head towards the young woman and the first thing that she noticed was Lilly's glowing birthmark. The mere sight of it made her arm glow more and it soon revealed a birthmark too. It looked similar to Lilly's but it was a much larger claw mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026you also have a mark!\" She said. \"I'll kill you! Black Rose Dragon, destroy her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the mighty beast prepared to fire its attack at Lilly, Takashi attempted to get back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave\u2026leave\u2026her alone.\" He stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Black Rose yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose Dragon fired its attack and even though Lilly moved Toru and herself from it, the shockwaves sent them flying into a wall. The impact knocked them both out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Takashi screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose Dragon prepared to fire another blast at Lilly; however it stopped when it sensed something powerful. It turned its head and saw that Takashi was on his feet and that his arm was glowing red. Black Rose noticed this too and saw that Takashi suddenly gained a birthmark himself. This mark looked a lot like a dragon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a mark too?\" She said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi didn't answer her. All he did was glare at her while a powerful blue aura surrounded his body. The aura healed Takashi's wounds, shocking the Black Rose even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who\u2026who are you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Takashi Nakamura\u2026\" The young man answered. \"And\u2026I'm your Death!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man drew a card from his deck and placed it in his hand. He then took another card and placed it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, since you have monsters and I don't I can Special Summon my Vice Dragon in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVice Dragon: ATK 2000 DEF 2400 LVL 5<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Vice Dragon appeared Takashi placed another card on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Normal Summon the Tuner Monster; Dragunity Darkspear, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragunity Darkspear: ATK 1000 DEF 1000 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Vice Dragon, a black dragon with a metal spear face appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tune my Level 5 Vice Dragon with my Level 3 Dragunity Darkspear. Clustering wishes will become a new shining star. Become the path its light shines upon! Synchro Summon! Take Flight, Stardust Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 2500 DEF 2000 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of Takashi's dragons flew high into the air and performed a Synchro Summoning. When they finished, Stardust appeared and stood beside its partner. It then roared at Black Rose Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon; attack Black Rose Dragon\u2026.Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust complied and fired a blast of cosmic energy at Black Rose Dragon, creating a small explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose: 3100 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the explosion caused Black Rose's mask to break. As it was falling off of her, she pressed a button on her Duel Disk. The activated her face-down which, when flipped up, turned out to be Call of the Haunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap; Call of the Haunted!\" She declared. \"With it, I can revive one of my monsters and the one I choose is\u2026Black Rose Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again as huge gust of wind suddenly appeared as Black Rose Dragon reappeared. However that wasn't on Takashi's mind. What was on his mind was the Black Rose's face. When all the pieces of her mask fell from her face, the young man noticed something shocking about her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026you're the girl\u2026 from my dreams.\" He said as the blue aura that was surrounding him faded. <br>\r\nBlack Rose: 3100 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi's brain started flickering back and forth in between girl he's seen in dreams and the girl he's looking at now. There were some minor differences, like the Black Rose had longer hair and the girl in his dreams had a metal clip in her hair, but no were mistakes about it. Both the girl and the Black Rose\u2026were one in the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This\u2026this can't be\u2026\" He said in disbelief. \"There's no way you could be her\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man didn't want to believe that a beautiful woman like her, who looked so kind in his dreams, can be causing all this destruction. It was something that he just couldn't comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Black Rose continued to glare at Takashi. Her eyes were solely focused on him and him alone. Someone, in her twisted and corrupted mind, she saw Takashi as an enemy that she must kill. No matter what may happen to her, she must take his life. With that frame of mind her psychic powers created another gust of wind, more powerful than the one before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill\u2026\" She thought. \"Kill\u2026Kill\u2026Kill\u2026..KILL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark aura covered her body as the ground shook beneath her and Takashi's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Takashi yelled. \"If you keep this up you're going to destroying everything and everyone that's around you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't stop!\" The Black Rose replied with an evil tone in her voice. \"I will not stop until your dead!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Black Rose's powers continued to increases as building started to crumble. Takashi saw that some of the debris falling next to Toru and Lilly. Seeing his friends in danger woke something within Takashi as his birthmark started glowing even brighter than it was before. As his mark glowed, the blue aura that surrounded his body reappeared. However the aura was a lot different than before. It started to expand and it kept expanding until it covered both Takashi and the Black Rose. The mere sight of this frightened the all powerful female, as she has never seen anyone with powers like Takashi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026won't.\" Takashi said as his aura glowed brighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't what\u2026?\" The Black Rose questioned as she slowly took one step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\u2026won't\u2026.allow you to cause allow you to cause\u2026.ALL THIS DESTRUCTION!\" The young man yelled at the stop of lungs. A huge energy exploded from Takashi's body and it covered the area where he, the Black Rose, Toru and Lilly were at. When the energy faded, all the damage that the Black Rose caused disappeared and the land was back to where it once was. Also Lilly's and Toru's wounds from before were healed and they started to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha\u2026what the\u2026?\" Lilly questioned as she was the first to open her eyes. She looked around and the first thing she saw was a glowing Takashi. The mere sight of him caused her to blush. \"Takashi\u2026he's\u2026he's beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crimson headed woman looked on with amazement, Toru started to open his eyes and, like Lilly before him, the first thing that he saw was Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome\u2026\" Were the only word that the young man could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the Black Rose wasn't as amazed as Toru and Lilly were. She was starting to become more intimidated the longer she looked at Takashi. Because of her Psychic Powers, she could sense that Takashi's abilities surpassed hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me your name\u2026\" Takashi told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose was shocked a bit as she listened to Takashi's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me your name\u2026and I mean that alias of yours. I want to know your real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\u2026?\" She asked. \"What good will it do you...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi simply smiled at her as the glow around him started to fade. He then started to rub the back of his head as he replied to her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026\" He said. \"You're a beautiful girl. So I'm assuming that you have a beautiful name that matches your appearance. That's the only reason why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lilly cursed the Black Rose, because Takashi called her beautiful, the mysterious woman was hesitant to answer Takashi request. However she eventually gave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza\u2026\" She said. \"My name is Akiza Izinski.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza huh\u2026?\" Takashi replied. \"I was right; you do have a beautiful name that matches your appearance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose, whose real name is Akiza Izinski, started to blush. As he face was becoming red, Takashi continued talking to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Akiza, why are you causing all of this destruction? What did we do that made you want to try and kill us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mark\u2026\" She replied as she looked at hers. \"It's your mark. I was told to stay away from anyone who has a mark similar to mine. That's why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at his mark for a few minutes before looking over at Lilly's mark. Once he was done with that, he looked over at Akiza's for a few before looking back over at his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with these marks?\" He asked himself. \"I mean, I can tell that they have some type of strange power. But where did they come from and why do we have them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back over to Akiza again and noticed that she had a lot of pain and suffering within her brown eyes. For some reason, all the pain and anger that he felt towards her earlier faded. Now\u2026instead of wanting to kill her, Takashi wanted to help her. He looked over at his Stardust Dragon and he felt that he wanted to the same thing to. So, after taking a nice deep breath, Takashi looked over at Akiza once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's finished our Duel.\" He proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza was shocked by his request. \"You\u2026want to continue?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man nodded her head. \"Yes I do.\" He replied. \"I want to help you and\u2026I think I can do that if we continue Dueling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Akiza was shocked by Takashi's words. For something she could tell that he really meant what he said. However she nodded her head from side to side and looked towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't\u2026\" She said. \"You can't help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know that.\" Takashi said to her as he placed the remaining cards that were in his hand into his Spell/Trap Zone. Once he did that, 3 face-down cards appeared in front of him. \"We won't know until I try. Besides, you're the strongest Duelist I ever faced before and I really want to test my skill against yours. So what do you say\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman looked at him for a few moments before replying to his request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Fine.\" She said. \"It won't do you any good, but I'll continue to Duel you. Just don't take it personally when I hurt you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I won't.\" Takashi said with a friendly smile on his face. \"Now\u2026as you saw I placed 3 cards face-down. With that I end my turn and hand everything over to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza nodded her head. \"Draw\u2026!\" She yelled as she drew a card from her deck and quickly placed it in her hand. The young woman would then pull out another card and placed it on her Monster Card Zone. \"I summon; Lonefire Blossom, in Attack Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLonefire Blossom: ATK 500 DEF 1400 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small plant with a glowing plant bulb appeared on Akiza's side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Lonefire Blossom's Special Ability. By sacrificing it I can Special Summon 1 Plant-Type Monster from my Deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akiza's plant disappeared a checklist appeared before her with all the Plant-Type Monsters that she was allowed to choose from. As the young woman was making his selection, Toru was trying to figure out what card that she would choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which card\u2026?\" He thought. \"Which card will she pick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly had the same thoughts as Toru, only she had almost figure out which Monster Akiza will select.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were Black\u2026no\u2026 Akiza.\" She thought. \"If I were her\u2026I already know which Plant-Type Monster I would select. And if I'm right, then Takashi is going to have a tough time on his hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a few more minutes Akiza made her decision and selected the card that she wanted to Special Summon. As she did that the checklist disappeared and the card she chose popped out of her deck. She pulled the card out and had her Duel Disk reshuffle her deck before placing the card onto her Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon; Tytannial, Princess of Camallias in Attack Mode!\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTytannial, Princess of Camallias: ATK 2800 DEF 2600 LVL 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman who looked like a combination of a plant and a human appeared on Akiza's side of the field and stood next to Black Rose Dragon. Seeing this new monster causes Lilly to curse out loud for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God\u2026damn it!\" She cursed. \"I knew it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi wasn't afraid of Akiza's new monster. In fact he was amazed on how she was able to summon a Monster with 2800 Attack Points so easily. But, despite being impressed he wasn't going to let her win. So he pressed a button on his Duel Disk, activating one of his 3 face-down cards. The card flipped up and it had the image of a monster getting its energy drained while an Obelisk Blue Student was drawing a card from his Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; Alchemy Cycle!\" He declared. \"Now, for the remainder of this turn Stardust Dragon's Attack Points are dropped to Zero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly, Toru, and especially Akiza looked on in shock as Stardust's energy was being drained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026Why?\" The Psychic Duelist asked. \"Why did you drain your dragon's Attack Points?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at her before smiling. \"I'll tell you, once you destroy Stardust Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man's words shocked Akiza some more. Why the hell would Takashi want his Stardust Dragon to be destroyed? Does Alchemy Cycle have another ability that requires the destruction of Stardust to activate? Or does Stardust have an ability of its own that can only be activated when its Attacks Points are low. All of this and several other things ran through Akiza's mind and it wasn't until a few minutes later that she decided to make her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tytannial, Attack his Stardust Dragon!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTytannial fired a barrage of razor sharp several razor sharp flower petals at Stardust. However before the attack landed, Takashi pressed two buttons on his Duel Disk. This action activated his remaining face-down cards. The first one that flipped up was call of Call of the Haunted, while the other one had the image of a monster exploding while its Duelist drew a card from his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Cards; Defense Draw and Call of the Haunted!\" He declared. \"With Defense Draw I can reduce the damage I would've taken to zero and draw a card. Then with the power of Alchemy Cycle, I draw a card since you destroyed a monster who's Attack Points were drained by it. Lastly with the power of Call of the Haunted, I can bring back Stardust Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon got hit by Tytannial's attack and fell to the ground, but thanks to Call of the Haunted it was able to get back up. Once it did, Takashi drew two cards from his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice move\u2026\" Toru said. \"Now, Black Rose will have to end her turn since she doesn't have any monsters who's Attack Points are greater to Stardust Dragon's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza looked at the only card she had left in her hand before inserting it into her Spell/Trap Zone. The card appeared behind Black Rose Dragon in a face-down position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I play 1 card face-down and end my turn.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that she's ended her turn, Stardust Dragon's Attack Points return to their original value.\" Lilly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon: ATK 2500 <br>\r\nDraw\u2026\" Takashi stated as he drew a card from his deck. He looked at it for a few seconds before inserting it into his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field it had the image of two men looking up as gold coins were falling on them. \"I activate the Spell; Card of Sanctity. With this, we both have to draw until we have 6 cards in our hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi drew 5 cards while Akiza drew 6. Once their hands were filled, Takashi inserted another card within his Spell/Trap Zone. When the card appeared on the field, it turned out to be Reincarnation of Hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate another Spell Card; Reincarnation of Hope. By discarding 2 Monsters into the Graveyard I can add a new one into my hand during my 2nd Standby Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi placed two Monster Cards from his hand and inserted them into the Graveyard portion of his Duel Disk. After doing that Takashi took another card from his hand and placed it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon the Tuner Monster; Junk Synchron in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunk Synchron: ATK 1300 DEF 500 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small, orange colored, robot appeared on the field and stood next to Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Junk Synchron's Special Ability; when successfully Normal Summoned I can Special Summon a Level 2 or below Monster from my Graveyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA card popped out of the young man's Graveyard and he proceeded to place it on his Monster Card Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon; Sonic Chick in Defense Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic Chick: ATK 300 DEF 300 LVL 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink road runner appeared and stood next to Junk Synchron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I activate the Special Ability of the Quillbolt Hedgehog that resides in my Graveyard. When I have a Tuner Monster on my field I can Special Summon it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuillbolt Hedgehog: ATK 800 DEF 800 LVL 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother card popped out of Takashi Graveyard and like before the young man placed it on his Monster Card Zone. With that a hedgehog with metal bolts, coming out of its back, appeared on the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the\u2026?\" Toru said in confusion. \"I thought Takashi used Dragon-Type cards. So why summon Monsters that aren't related to those dragons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's wait and see what he'll do.\" Lilly said to him. \"Takashi's a good Duelist, so he wouldn't be making these moves unless he had a plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two teenagers looked on as Takashi continued on with his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Tune my Level 1 Sonic Chick with my Level 2 Quillbolt Hedgehog and my Level 3 Junk Synchron to Synchro Summon; Junk Gardna, in Defense Mode!\"</span></div></div>",

When they finished a green machine with two large arms appeared and fell to the ground. It then placed its arms against each other to make a shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now\u2026Stardust Dragon attack Black Rose Dragon with Cosmic Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust complied with its masters orders and fired a stream of cosmic energy at Black Rose Dragon. However Akiza was prepared for it this time and quickly pressed a button on her Duel Disk. This activated the face-down card that she set earlier which, when it flipped up, turned out to be Negate Attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Trap Card; Negate Attack!\" She proclaimed. \"With it I can negate Stardust Dragon's attack and forcefully end your Battle Phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small black hole appeared in front of Black Rose Dragon and it sucked in Stardust's attack. As the hole faded Takashi had a nice smile on his face, confusing Akiza even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so happy?\" She asked. \"Aren't you mad or upset that I block your attack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026I would be lying if I was mad that I wasn't able to destroy your dragon again.\" Takashi answered. \"But bitchin about that isn't going to help me win this duel. So I see no real point in complaining about it. Also\u2026if I get frustrated then I'm bound to make mistakes. It was because of my anger that I let so many Life Points already and at this rate I can't afford to lose anymore. You're too skilled an opponent for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akiza was amazed by Takashi's words, the young man placed 1 card into his Spell/Trap Zone and it appeared, face-down, behind Junk Gardna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I place 1 card face-down and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn\u2026Draw!\" Akiza yelled as she pulled the top card from her deck. She looked at it for a few moments before looking back at Takashi. She then started thinking to herself. \"I don't understand. He's isn't mad or upset like before. Why is that? He's not like the others, he's different. But\u2026but\u2026it isn't a bad type of different. It's a good different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi looked at her and saw that the young woman was entranced by her own thoughts. He wanted to say something to her, but he knew that he should let her be and let her handle it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Akiza made her move and the first thing that she did was place a card onto her Spell/Trap Zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon; Elemental Hero Knospe, in Attack Mode!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nE-Hero Knospe: ATK 600 DEF 1000 LVL 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small plant-man appeared on Akiza's side of the field and stood next to her other monsters. The sight of the creature caught Toru's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\" He said. \"Why summon Knospe? It only has 600 Attack Points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because of Tytannial.\" Lilly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToru looked at her with a confused look on his face. However it didn't take him long to figure out why Lilly said what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tytannial\u2026she has a Special Ability that requires Knospe to be on the field.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo\u2026\" Lilly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Black Rose Dragon's second Special Ability!\" Akiza declared as a card popped out of her Graveyard. \"By removing a Plant-Type Monster from my Graveyard, Black Rose Dragon can switch one of your monsters into Attack Mode and make its Attack Points zero! I choose your Junk Gardna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunk Gardna: ATK 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose Dragon roared, causing the ground to shake a little bit. It then release several vine at Junk Gardna, causing it to forcefully switch into Attack Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black Rose Dragon, attack Junk Gardna with Black Rose Flare!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurple flames started to appear from Black Rose Dragon's mouth and it prepared to fire the attack at the defenseless Junk Gardna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Junk Gardna's Special Ability!\" Takashi yelled. \"Once per turn, I can switch one of your Monsters into Defense Mode! I choose, Black Rose Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so Takashi!\" Akiza responded. \"I activate Tytannial's Special Ability! By sacrificing a Plant-Type Monster on my side of the field, I can negate the activation of a card that targets one of my cards and destroy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnospe disappeared from the field as Tytannial prepared to attack Junk Gardna before it could switch Black Rose Dragon into Defense Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Stardust Dragon's Special Ability; Victim Sanctuary!\" Takashi countered. \"By sacrificing itself, Stardust and negate the effect of a monster that destroys other cards and destroy it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStardust Dragon got in front of Tytannial and wrapped its body around it. The mighty dragon then vanished along with Akiza's strongest monster. And, since Tytannial is gone, Junk Gardna's ability can activate. This action forced Akiza's Ace Monster into Defense Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack Rose Dragon: DEF 1800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it\u2026\" Akiza thought. \"I almost had him that time.\" Soon a kind smile appeared on her face. \"Still\u2026this\u2026this is fun. I can't wait to see what he'll do next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi saw her smiling which, in turn, caused him to smile too. He then pressed a button on his Duel Disk, which activated the face-down card that he set earlier. The card flipped up and it revealed the image of an electric cyclone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Quick-Play Spell; Super Polymerization!\" He declared. \"Now usually, I can only perform a Fusion Summon with my own Monsters. However, with Super Polymerization, I can perform a Fusion Summoning with my Monster and your Monster. All I have to do is discard 1 card from my hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza was in shock as Takashi took a card from his hand and placed it in his Graveyard. Then, a cyclone appeared in the middle of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse your Black Rose Dragon with my Junk Gardna to Fusion Summon; Dragon Knight \u2013 Draco Equiste, in Attack Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragon Knight \u2013 Draco Equiste: ATK 3200 DEF 2000 LVL 10<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Junk Gardna and Black Rose Dragon jumped into the vortex and fused together. In a flash of light, Draco Equiste appeared and stood by Takashi. Akiza was amazed that Takashi was able to outwit her in that one exchange. She looked at her hand and she saw that she had no cards she could play that could prevent Takashi from winning the Duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash of light Stardust Dragon reappeared and stood next to Dragon Knight \u2013 Draco Equiste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stardust Dragon's second Special Ability allows it to revive itself at the End Phase, if it successfully uses its first Special Ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see\u2026\" Akiza said as she had her head down. \"That's an impressive ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man looked at the young girl and didn't feel the happiness that he usually feels win he's about to win a Duel. He felt sad if anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026\" He said. \"Don't feel sad, it was a good Duel and you tried your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just end it\u2026\" Akiza said softly. \"I've lost and you know it\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u2026.I know.\" He replied. \"But, tell me something. During the Duel\u2026did you have fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza's eyes widen as she remember the fun and excitement she felt as Dueled Takashi. She looked at him and gave him a small, but noticeable smile. She then proceeded to nod her head a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good\u2026\" Takashi said with a smile on his face. \"Dragon Knight \u2013 Draco Equiste\u2026attack Akiza's Life Points directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco Equiste threw its lance at Akiza, who didn't even flinch when the virtual attack hit her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi: 700 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza: 0 LP<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe holograms faded and both Duelists Duel Disks deactivated. Akiza grabbed her mask and prepared to walk away. However Takashi ran up to her before she got too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026do you think we'll meet up again?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza turned to him with a shocked look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026you want to meet me again?\" She said. \"Even though\u2026I'm a witch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\u2026\" Takashi said as he recalled when he called her witch earlier in the Duel. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called you that. A beautiful girl like you can't possibly be a witch.\" </span></div></div>",

Takashi looked at her for a few moments before looking at her hair. This caused him to remember his dream about her and how her hair was much shorter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026um\u2026can I give you a piece of advice?\" He asked. \"You should cut your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why\u2026?\" She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\u2026it could get in your eyes\u2026\" He said. \"No\u2026that's not the reason. It's just\u2026I really think that you would look even more beautiful with shorter hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman blushed as she looked at him. She then proceeded to turn his back towards him and started to walk away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\u2026we'll meet again\u2026right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza kept walking as she listened to Takashi's words. She didn't turn to him, but she did raise her hand towards him. As she left, Toru and Lilly walked towards Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man\u2026\" Toru said. \"Nice job!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakashi turned to him and smiled. The two friends then bumped fist for the first time in almost 3 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for saving me Takashi. I owe you one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it\u2026\" Takashi replied. \"I'm just glad you're ok now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old friends smiled, but that didn't last long as Lilly kicked Takashi in the balls; causing to him to pass out in pain. The young woman then grabbed him by the foot and dragged him across the floor. Toru looked on in a combination of shock and fear as she saw Takashi, comically, passed out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What\u2026what did you do that for?\" He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly turned to him and gave him an evil glare. The glare was so fierce that Toru passed out too; So Lilly dragged him across the ground too. As she did, she glared at Takashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bastard\u2026calls her beautiful.\" She thought. \"Takashi\u2026you bastard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, the two boys woke up back at Poppo Time. They looked around and that their Duel Runners, along with Lilly's were there with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ\u2026!\" Toru said as he got to his feet. \"Who is the chick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our roommate.\" Takashi said as he also got to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our roommate\u2026?\" Toru said in confusion. \"You mean\u2026?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\u2026\" Takashi replied as he proceeded to go upstairs. \"We're roommates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man headed to bathroom, but as he went inside the first thing that he saw was Lilly's naked body. This caused him and her to blush a bright red color. The next that happen was Takashi being thrown out of the room and back downstairs to the concrete floor. Lilly, who now had a towel wrapped around her body, walked out and started yelling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME IN AGAIN TAKASHI AND YOU'RE DEAD! YOU GOT THAT, YOU BASTARD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the young woman walked back into the bathroom and slammed the door behind her. As Toru looked at the newly passed out Takashi, the first words that came out of his mouth were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilly\u2026she's scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, in a large building, Akiza was busy cutting her hair so that it would be much shorter. As she did, Takashi's words entered her brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really think that you would look even more beautiful with shorter hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words caused her blush as she continued to cut her hair. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Anyway, my name is Elliot, I know better then to give you my second name. I'm not telling you my age, where I live or any of that, but I will say that I am tall, have dark brown hair and blue eyes, and am so pale I could be 'an extra off of Twilight'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat on my bed and looked at the time, 9:45 PM. 'I guess I'd better get ready for school tommorow...' I dragged myself over to the wardrobe and opened it, shifting through several trousers, shirts and jumpers until I got out one of each, all blue. Hey, I'm not one for different colours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was just about to close the doors when I noticed something, hidden down in the corner. 'Is that...?' I reached in and picked it up, instantly recognizing the rectangular holder. 'This is my Xyz deck! I thought I lost this!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm the kinda guy who constantly shifts what his favourite subject is, and Yu-Gi-Oh just seemed to slip away, but I was happy to find this deck again. I went through the deck, admiring the cards I'd traded to constantly improve, I actually kinda missed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I reached the final card I raised an eyebrow. 'What is this?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe card I was now looking at was unnamed with an Effect Monster border, the picture showed what looked like a blue bouncy ball with white propellor like arms, white feet and yellow eyes, bouncing around with what looked like a light blue clock with black borders and hands in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of card is this?\" I asked myself, I didn't remember it in my deck...in fact I don't know this card at all! And why wasn't it named?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more intently I stared at the card, the more the picture seemd to fade, until it was completely white! \"How did-\" I was interrupted as the card shone brightly. \"Gah!\" I shielded my eyes as the light made even the darkness created by my eyelids brighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the light seemed to fade, and I blinked open, to be met with something I didn't expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was no longer in my bedroom, more rather I was standing on a pathway, looking at a bunch of large buildings. 'Wh-Wha-? Where the hell am I!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt someone bump into me. \"Oh! I'm sorry, young man.\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" I apologised, turning to the voice my jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in front of me looked average, wearing a yellow sundress, nothing special, what shocked me was her face, or more specifically, her eyes. They were huge! She literally had anime eyes! I'm not joking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure your all right?\" She asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...uh...yep, promise.\" I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded before walking off, and I finally noticed other people walking around, and they all looked like people off of an anime! I was seriously doubting my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay...this is a dream!' I rationalised in my mind. 'I obviously just fell asleep, I-I mean it was late and everything. Of course that's it!' I then realised I felt a little different, or rather my clothes did. 'I don't think I'm wearing pajamas anymore...' I walked over to a nearby shop window and looked at my reflection, and I almost screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was looking back at me in the window was someone who was definitely not me! He was wearing a red unzipped no sleeve jumper over a long baggy armed dark blue shirt with a white swirl in the centre, the end having three spikes jutting out of its outer most part. He also wore long black slacks and white slip-on shoes with red edges, also with a white dark blue belt that had some kind of holder attached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the hair! Oh the hair! It had a large spike jutting out the front, with two sweeping down either side of his face with the rest of it being swept back. It was mainly crimson red in colour, but with some dark blue strands for emphasis. And he also had anime eyes, which were sapphire blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No way...' I thought, waving my arms around and jumping up and down only for the person in the window to copy me, and for crossing civilians to give me weird looks. 'Okay...remain calm...this is all just a dream remember...and-hey, hold on a second.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just realised I was wearing some kind of gauntlet on my left arm, reaching into the holder I pulled out a...Yu-Gi-Oh deck? 'A deck?' I fanned out the cards, recognising a few such as Polymerization and Flare Resonator, but most were made up of weird cards I'd never seen before. Most of the monsters seemed to have their names start with 'Timestream'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of an archetype like that.\" I mumbled to myself, before putting the deck back in the 'gauntlet'. I then reached into the holder on my belt, pulling out two Xyz monsters, two Synchro's and two Fusion's, none of which I recognised. \"So this is an extra deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Is that an Extra Deck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked behind me and-oh my god the hair! It was crimson and green! CRIMSON AND GREEN! Sorry...but I had to get that out of the way. He wore goggles with a blue star over one lens, a red vest, dark green baggy trousers and red shoes. He alos wore a white jacket like a cloak One Piece Marines style, which I had to admit, looked pretty damn cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I nodded as I put the cards back in my holder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool!\" He smiled. \"I don't think I've seen you at the You Show Duel School.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\" I asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you haven't heard of it?\" He raised an eyebrow. \"Are you outta town or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that.\" I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool.\" He held out a hand. \"I'm Yuya. Yuya Sakaki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook it. \"It's nice to meet you Yuya. I'm Elliot...Elliot...Zekaki.\" 'Nailed last minute name idea.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to meet you too! So you ARE a Duelist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" I answered as quickly as I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then come on! I gotta show you the school!\" He cheered, seizing my wrist and dragging me along.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hey! I know!\" Yuya smiled, turning to me. \"Let's have a duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A duel?\" I repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I wanna see your deck!\" He smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He certainly has enthusiasm.' I thought. \"Okay! Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" He smiled, before gaining a nervous look. \"Err...I dunno how to set up the holograms, so let's just have a regular duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Was he thinking of a Turbo Duel?\" I thought as we walked into a big dome-shaped room, taking positions on each side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Yuya cheered. \"Elliot, I'm glad to be dueling with you! I hope I can entertain you!\" He said with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...okaaaay.\" I sweatdropped again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held his arm out, with a gauntlet on it just like mine, suddenly it burst out into a Duel Disk. 'This thing is a Duel Disk!? How do you turn it on!?' I pressed buttons randomly until mine turned into a Duel Disk as well. Whilst mine was electric blue Yuya's was yellow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duel!\" We both yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Life Points: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw!\" I quickly drew a card, adding it to my hand before scanning over the cards. 'If this is gonna be my deck, I'd better get used to it...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! C'mon and play a card already!\" Yuma yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Sheesh!\" I called back, already having figured out a strategy. \"I summon Timestream Blob in attack mode!\" I placed the monster on one of my Duel Disk's sections, and a hologram version appeared in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the card came a little ball of blue jelly with white arms and pudgy feet, and two yellow eyes, it looked like an enemy off of Kirby!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Blob, Level 1, Fairy, Light, ATK: 100, DEF: 100.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now his special ability activates! When he's normal summoned, I can special summon a Level 4 or lower Timestream monster from my hand! So I choose Timestream Wanderer in attack mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time what came out was a long cloak, half red and half white, a long blue scarf was around the neck and the two ends extended out each side, acting as arms. A black hat completed the look, with only two red eyes being visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Wanderer, Level 4, Warrior, Earth, ATK: 1600 DEF: 1200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's not all! When Wanderer is summoned in any way, I can special summon a Level 3 or lower Timestream monster from my hand! So here's Timestream Mage in attack mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time a little chibi girl with orange hair, red eyes, and witches clothes too big for her appeared, she carried a golden staff in each hand, which both had large blue orbs on the tips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Mage, Level 2, Spellcaster, Dark, ATK: 600 DEF: 400.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when she's special summoned, I can increase one monsters level by one, and decrease another monsters level by one! So I'll increase Mage's level to 3, and decrease Wanderer's level to 3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMage waved her wands, sending a blue ball of light to envelop her and Wanderer, setting both their levels at 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set a card and end my turn.\" I finished. 'Hey, this works pretty good! Summoning a lot of monsters is my style!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Three monsters in one turn! That's pretty cool Elliot!\" Yuya praised. \"My turn, draw!\" He drew very flashily. \"I summon Performapal Whip Snake in attack mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I was expecting a lot of things, but I was not expecting an Arbok with a bow tie and a top hat. I did notice how it had 1700 attack though. \"Alright Whip Snake! Let's put on a show! Attack Timestream Blob!\" The snake hissed before jumping like a spring towards my cute little blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my Trap! Rallied Forces!\" The card flipped up. the picture showing a huge army of silver knights attacking a small army of very scared goblins. \"I can only activate this card when I have 3 or more monsters and my opponent has less monsters then I have. As long as I have more monsters then my opponent, none of your monsters can attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pink aura bust forth, pushing Whip Snake back. \"All right then, I set two cards and end my turn!\" Yuya finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" I drew my card dramatically. 'This is so cool! I'm in an actual duel!' \"I activate my Spell, Power Shock!\" The card showed itself, depicting Blob and Wanderer generating a giant sphere of electricity above them in the centre of a portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only activate this when I have two or more Timestream monsters on my side of the field, I can select two of them, then the difference is inflicted to you as effect damage!\" Wanderer and Blob began re-enacting their picture, throwing the electricity at Yuya and throwing him back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya LP: 2500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll activate the Equip Spell Darkworld Shackles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the card appeared on my field, a large ball and chain attached itself to Whip Snake, with the ball having devil horns and an evil face. \"When this card is equipped to a monster, it's attack is reduced to 100! And it can't attack!\" Whip Snake flopped with an exhausted face as its attack fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha! Now, Timestream Wanderer! Attack Performapal Whip Snake!\" Wanderer jumped towards Whip Snake, pullingf one of its scarf arms back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate a Spell! Hippo Carnival!\" The Quick-Play Spell flipped up. \"When this card is activated, I can summon three Hippo Tokens in Defence Mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was beginning to become weirded out by his deck, as three hippos in dancers outfits appeared before me. Rallied Froces glowed before shattering, indicating its destruction now that Yuya had more monsters then me. \"And now you can only attack Hippo Tokens for the rest of the Battle Phase!\" Wanderer's attack was quickly thrown at a Hippo Token, easily destroying it due to its 0 defence points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I'll just attack with Timestream Mage and Blob as well!\" Mage whacked on hippo with her staffs, and Blob spun like a spintop to take out the other. \"Now that all of your hippos are gone, I'll set a card and end my turn.\" A card appeared in front of me, signifying its placement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gaaah! You got me!\" Yuya admitted. \"Pretty good strategy! But the fun's not over yet! Draw!\" He looked at his card and smiled. \"Now we can get this party started! I summon Performapal Hip Hippo in attack mode!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was another hippo, except this one was pink and had 800 attack. \"Now Hip Hippo's special ability activates! When he's summoned, I can tribute summon a Level 7 or higher monster! So I'm gonna tribute Hip Hippo and Whip Snake...\" The two monsters turned into pillars of yellow light that joined together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To summon Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green orb and a reb orb flashed through the yellow pillar of light, followed by the body of a huge dragon with 2500 attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" I gasped. \"You summoned a Level 7 so quickly!? And what monster is this anyway!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Elliot! This is where the party starts!\" Yuya cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Crap! I'm in trouble!' I cursed in my head. 'This is one crazy dream!' </span></div></div>",

Spiraling Strike Burst!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe asymmetrical dragon jumped into the air, charging up before unleashing a deadly beam towards Blob, who was panicking a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate a Trap! Impenetrable Shield!\" I yelled, making the standard card flipped up. \"I can choose one of two effects when this is activated, and I choose to have Timestream Blob be unable to be destroyed by battle this turn, yet still take battle damage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA green shield appeared in front of Blob, protecting it from the attack, but the gale force of the impact was so strong it sent me flying back, skidding across the floor until I stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ouuuuuuuuch...' I groaned in my head. 'Where's a Magic Cylinder or Mirror Force when you need one?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn.\" Yuya said. \"Well? What do you think of my deck, Elliot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up and brushed myself down. \"I gotta admit, that was pretty impressive, Yuya.\" I praised him. 'Damnit...now Yuya has a Level 7 with 2500 attack. None of my monsters are strong enough to defeat it, and I've got no cards in my hand.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my deck. 'Well...desperate draws always seem to work in the anime...so here goes!' \"Draw!\" I drew my next card as dramatically as possible, before looking at it. 'Hey! It does work!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the spell Falling Current!\" A card depicting a floating island with several waterfalls appeared on my side of the field. \"With this I can select one monster on my side of the field and declare a number between 1 and 3, then that monster becomes that Level! I choose to make Timestream Blob Level 3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floating island appeared behind Blob as its level increased to 3, I smiled at the results. \"Now I have 3 Level 3 monsters on my side of the field! So I'm going to Overlay them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy three monsters each turned into streams of energy, Mage was purple, Wanderer red, and Blob blue. They all shot up into the sky as a galaxy-style spiral portal opened up in front of me, with all three monsters diving inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the desired Xyz monster out of my holder. 'Think of something cool to say, think of something cool to saaaay! Ah! Got it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sealed within the boundaries of time, emerge from your eternal prison to show your power! Breaking through the cracks in time, come forth! Timestream Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crack in the air itself appeared, and a red eye gleamed through, the crack smashed open to reveal a dragon covered in metallic black armour, with it's underside glowing light blue, as well as the twin spiked tip of its long tail. It stood on its hind legs, it's long claws on its feet and arms strangely resembling clock hands, two long pipes connected to this sides of its jaw travelled down to its chest, attaching to a black clock with jegged edges. It had two black spikes jutting out of its head, with a long jaw filled with sharp teeth, its wings were completely made out of the same blue energy, flickering constantly like fire. To show it was truly an Xyz monster, three light blue comet-like lights orbited around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Dragon, Rank 3, Dragon, Light, ATK: 2400, DEF: 1500.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new dragon gave a deafening roar which made us all cover our ears. \"Now! Call upon the power of time itself to strike your foes! Attack Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Dragon roared again before flying up to the roof of the room. \"Huh? But Timestream Dragon has less attack then Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\" Yuya thought aloud, before his eyes widened with sudden realisation. \"Ah! An ability! I activate my trap! Dividing Wall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new trap flipped up. \"When my opponents monster attacks, it loses 800 attack for each monster my opponent controls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Dragon swayed in its flying slightly as its attack was dropped to 1600. \"Like that'll stop us!\" I yelled. \"Go, Timestream Dragon! Time Breaker Laser!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy dragon charged up before firing a powerful blue laser, which Yuya's dragon clashed with with its own, the two looked evenly matched for a few seconds, but mine was overpowered and the laser smashed into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Yuya cheered, but he stopped when he realised Timestream Dragon was still flying. \"What!? How is it still there!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activated Timestream Dragon's special ability.\" I stated. \"When it takes part in a battle that would destroy it, I can remove 1 or 2 Xyz materials from it to negate its destruction and reduce battle damage to zero.\" To prove my point, two of Timestream Dragon's Xyz materials faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you could only remove 1, why did you remove 2?\" Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of its other ability. I can remove 1 Xyz material to deal damage to my opponent equal to half of his or her's monsters attack, and I can remove 2 to deal damage equal to their full attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? Then that means-\" He was interrupted as Timestream Dragon sent a group of energy streams at Yuya from its wings, creating an impact that sent him flying. \"Aaaaaaahhhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot: WIN<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the hologram showing my win faded along with the monsters, I shuffled my cards back into my deck and walked over to Yuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man...\" He sighed as he placed his goggles over his eyes. \"I can't believe I lost! But your deck is pretty strong, Elliot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, thanks Yuya.\" I smiled before helping him up. \"Your deck is strong too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Both of you were amazingly hot-blooded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Both of us stated, looking around. \"Where'd that voice come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the sound of a powerful slap. \"We're not supposed to say anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still think it was really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His deck was weird, I've never seen cards like that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna see them duel again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" I called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, they're just my friends.\" Yuya reassured me as the door opened to let six people in, all with a large array of hairstyles. Three if them looked like children, one boy having green hair, a girl having red and one boy having dark blue. Another...boy? I think? Had sky blue hair done up in a ponytail, and was eating from a bag of sweets, the girl next to him had pink hair wwearing some kind of uniform, and the man beside her had orange swept back spiky hair, and a bandage on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said no-one was in?\" I asked Yuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought too!\" He laughed it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seriously?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came in and heard a duel going on, so we thought we'd see what's up.\" The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you were pretty into it, we didn't wanna bother you.\" Sky blue boy said before popping another sweet into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm Yuzu Hiragi, it's nice to meet you!\" The pink haired girl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Isn't Yuzu a fruit?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm-\" The man started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Ayu! Nice to meet you!\" The girl with red hair interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Futoshi.\" The green haired kid followed up. \"That duel really gave me the shivers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The...what?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Tatsuya.\" The sapphire blue haired boy finished. \"I'm kind of surprised you beat Yuya-niichan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Nii-chan? Are they related or something?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my name is Sora Shiun'in.\" The sweets eater added. \"Yuya's friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by my choice.\" The goggles wearer whispered to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped back as the man took a dramatic fall to gain my attention, before standing up and clearing his throat. \"And I'm Shuzo Hiragi! Yuzu's father and owner of the You Show Duel School!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice to meet all of you.\" I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who exactly are you, Elliot?\" Yuzu asked with a quizzical look. \"I haven't seen you around before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got into town.\" I thought up on the spot. \"Been travelling for a while now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that deck you use is called 'Timestream' right?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Timestream Dragon of yours was an Xyz monster, so your an Xyz user?\" Shuzo pestered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly, I have Fusion's and Synchro's as well.\" I stated as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All three? That's pretty cool!\" Yuya praised me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nothing really.\" I shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey c'mon! Let's talk over some dinner! Not in the dueling zone.\" Shuzo insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu tic-pulsed. \"Dinner now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time is it anyway?\" I thought aloud before following them out. </span></div></div>",

What's that?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the technology for Action Duels.\" Tatsuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are Action Duels?\" I threw the question out before inhaling another mouthfull, when I looked up they were all staring at me as if I had three heads. \"...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what Action Duels are?\" Futoshi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" No sooner had the words left my mouth before they all fell over comically. 'Woah, that really happens?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you call yourself a duelist and not know what Action Duels are?\" Yuzu sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're the best kind of duels.\" Sora added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They...are?\" I continued dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all huddled up and whispered to each other out of my earshot. 'Did I say something wrong? I wonder if Action Duels are really big here?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all quickly returned. \"Allow me to explain.\" Yuzu said. \"Action Duels are where Duelists roam freely on a duel field whilst a Field Spell is in play, it's all thanks to the Solid Vision with mass developed by the Leo Corporation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Solid Vision with mass? Leo Corporation?\" I repeated stupidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that tower there?\" She pointed to a huge tower with 'LDS' written on it. \"That's the Leo Corporation's headquarters, where they made Solid Vision with mass WHICH-\" I shut my mouth. \"-Is holograms that actually have mass, and can be touched and interacted with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, holograms...you can touch?\" 'This sounds cool! But waaaaay too advanced, ah well, it's anime.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly, an example can be Yuya riding his Hip Hippo.\" Yuzu nodded at the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\" I gaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's really fun being able to fight next to my monsters.\" Yuya grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now back to Action Duels.\" Yuzu came full circle. \"In an Action Duel, the duelists can use the entire field, a Field Spell, to run and dodge attacks until they can play a counter. They can also use this time to look for Action Cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Action Cards?\" I echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spells and Traps scattered around the field. You can only hold one at a time. Action Spells can give you a boost, but Trap cards will be bad for you. Apart from that it's like a regular duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are different kinds of Action Duelists.\" Sora continued. \"Yuya is an Entertainment Duelist, that focuses on putting on a show for the crowd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is that why you acted like that during our duel?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" He confirmed before having another mouthfull. \"If people want to watch me duel, I want them to enjoy it and have fun. Isn't that what dueling is about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right. Still, I don't think I could take anyone laughing at me.\" I admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not laughing at you if you laugh too.\" Yuya reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sooooo Elliot, Why're you here?\" Shuzo leaned forward, creepily close. \"What's the deal with you travelling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a smacking sound and a flash of white, afterwards Shuzo had gained a bandage on the back of his head. '...Teleporting bandages?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you shouldn't get up in his face.\" Yuzu tic-pulsed, holding a smoldering paper fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright.\" I said. 'Convincing story, convincing story! C'mon Elliot, your a fanfic writer!...Ah! Got it!' \"The thing is, I've been travelling all over the place for a while now. I didn't really like the place I came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Was it bad?\" Ayu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an orphanage.\" They all stopped and stared at me. 'I don't wanna lie...but what should I say? 'I come from another world where card games aren't ridiculously advanced?'' \"Don't worry, I never really knew my parents, so I don't miss them. That place was just so down, so one day I packed my stuff and left. Lost my bag along the road.\" Had to think up that last part quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Elliot, I didn't know.\" Yuya apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said not to worry, right?\" I said. \"Besides, I've never really had any trouble before. But I admit this town looks really nice, I'd like to stay here for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like you to stay too Elliot.\" Yuya said thoughtfully. \"...Hey, if you haven't got a place to stay, why don't you stay at my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nearly spat my last mouthfull out at his openness. \"St-Stay at your house? Won't your family mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's just me and my mum, it'll be fine if you stay.\" He smiled. \"Besides, your my friend, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped. I could be a mugger or a psychomaniac or something, and after 3 hours at most of knowing me Yuya was inviting me to stay at his house!? That's just unnaturally kind...now I feel guilty about lying to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to impose.\" I insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, trust me.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay. Thank you, Yuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I knew you'd like mum's pancakes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf your confused, I was currently sitting at the Sakaki families table eating breakfast with them, just Yuya and his mother, Yoko (I thought it best not to ask about his dad). I thought Yuya's home was going to be filled with automatic doors and cleaning robots, but it had <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got to sleep in the guest room, and when I woke up I was freaking out for two minutes until I remembered what happened, guess I can cross this being a dream off of the list. Knowing this is an anime, I knew I didn't have to worry about a different set of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd let me just say...that I think my hair is made of iron. I tried to restyle it, cut it, flatten it, nothing! It's stuck like super glue in this spike/sweep style, and the colour isn't dye, my hair is really red and blue, well, it is anime. And also, if I had to take I guess, I'd say I was 14 now, weird right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mrs Sakak-uhh, Yoko, I want to thank you again for allowing me to stay here.\" I said as I had another mouthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright, any friend of my son's is more then welcome here.\" She nodded, when the phone started ringing. She quickly went over and picked it up. \"Hello? Sakaki residence.\" Feeling it rude to eavesdrop, I finished off my pancakes. \"Yuya! It's for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Okay.\" He stuffed a whole pancake in before walking over and taking the phone from his mum. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" I asked Yoko as Yuya talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's Yuya's manager.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped. \"Yuya's...manager?\" I didn't know Yuya had a manager! It must have SOMETHING to do with dueling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Thanks!\" Yuya said before hanging up. \"Yes! My next duel's been arranged! Listen Elliot, I'm really sorry, but I've got a duel to go to, so I won't be able to stay at the school. Do you need me to show you the way there again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis duel seemed important, I didn't want to drag Yuya away from it. \"Don't worry, I can remember the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? It's no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise, Yuya, I'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'...Crap! I'm lost!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked left and right along the path I was currently on as people walked past me, hopelessly trying to recollect the info to get to You Show Duel School. Maybe I should have asked for Yuya's help, or even Yoko's, but I didn't want to bother them...dammit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\" I talked to the passersby, who promptly ignored me. \"Does-Does anyone how to get to You Show Duel School? Anyone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say you need directions to You Show Duel School?\" A powerful voice said behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I turned and-holy shit! This big bulky guy was standing behind me! He looked like he was wearing a martial artists outfit with...those wooden sandal thingies, you know!...Do you?...Those things. And the hair! Is every single characters hair over the top!? It was one of those...y'know...hairs that look like a missile?...That.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" He asked, I don't think he meant to sound authoritative, but he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes.\" I squeaked, before clearing my throat. \"I-I mean yes. Do you know the way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded, pointing forward. \"If you continue down this path, and take the second left, it is just down the road.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked and saw what he meant. \"Okay, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a student there?\" The guy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, excellent! I'm glad the school is getting new students!\" He smiled, offering a hand. \"Before you is the manly Gongenzaka!\"...Okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Elliot Zekaki, But just call me Elliot.\" I shook his hand (With him almost crushing mine).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gongenzaka hopes he can meet you again, Elliot! Please forgive him, but there is a duel he must attend.\" He bid farewell before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sheesh, everyone's dueling, but then again this is a Yu-Gi-Oh anime. I'd better get to the school.' So I quickly ran down the path Gongenzaka had pointed out for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI successfully found the school and went inside. \"Helloooo?\" I called, if I remembered, it was Sunday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There you are, Elliot!\" Shuzo suddenly appeared at the end of the corridor. \"I heard Yuya got called to a duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I nodded as I walked up to him. \"So, where's everyone else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuzu and Sora just went off to a duel, and Ayu, Futoshi and Tatsuya have gone to watch Yuya's duel.\" He explained. \"But I'm sure they'll be here at some point. So whaddya wanna do in the meantime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do I want to do? Hmmm...got it. \"Can you show me how the Action Duels work? with their Solid Vision with mass?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! It'll be my honour to show you the art of Action Duels!\" He declared with fire in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Annnnd where all the zones are on this?\" I held up my arm with my Duel Disk on it. \"I'm, err...kinda new to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Elliot, how about the next one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, this one is Rugged Castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area I was previously on faded away, being replaced by a surrounding forest with a giant medieval castle in the center. \"All right!\" I cheered before running inside, patting all the walls and furniture just to make sure they really were tangible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still couldn't believe that this was actually possible! But, again, anime. I'd also come to terms with my Duel Disk, I now knew how to turn it on, where the Extra Deck and Graveyard was, and that it was touch screen. TOUCH SCREEN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Elliot! I think someone's back!\" Shuzo called down to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" I called back up, running out of the castle before it faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both went to the door where Yuzu and Sora came in. \"Hello you two!\" Shuzo greeted them. \"How did the duels go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won them both.\" Sora smiled with a lollipop in his mouth. \"It wasn't all that difficult. Oh, hello Elliot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sora. Hey Yuzu.\" I greeted them, though I noticed Yuzu's smile seemed a little forced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about you, Yuzu? Did you learn anything?\" Her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so...\" She said. \"But I still don't know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, you weren't here, where you, Elliot?\" We all took a seat as Shuzo talked. \"A few days ago, the Leo Duel School showed up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, there's another duel school?\" I thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Sora said, sucking on his sweet. \"There are loads of duel schools in Maiami City-\" (That's the name of the city, forgot to mention that.) \"-Each one having a certain rank based on popularity. Leo Duel School is the best, and currently You Show Duel School is the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst?\" I echoed, sounded like Slifer Red off of GX, so that meant it was the best!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahaaaanyway.\" Shuzo interrupted. \"Leo Duel School came to take the school away from us by challenging us to a three round duel match, where three representatives from each school battle 1-on-1, with the best two out of three winning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their school was just barely beaten.\" Sora added. \"The results were Yuya winning against the leader, Reiji Akaba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sounds tough.\" I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a master at Fusion, Synchro and Xyz summoning, so like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a master at them.\" I sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But the thing is.\" Shuzo sounded serious for once. \"Yuzu lost against her opponent, and just seems down about it ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at her. \"Is that why your upset?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not upset!\" She retorted. \"I just...felt like I failed.\" Sounds like she's upset to me. \"The person I battled was a Fusion master, Masumi Kotsu. Her Fusion monsters were just so powerful...so now I want to learn Fusion too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Jeez. Who would've thought a card game could bring someone so down?...What am I saying? This is a Yu-Gi-Oh anime! It happens all the time!...Still, thinking about it, the fate of her fathers school was on the line in that duel, I guess you can't blame her for feeling like that.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot.\" She snapped me out of my thoughts. \"You use Fusions, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...kinda.\" I did have an E-Hero deck back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can you show me how you use them?\" She persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm...\" I opened the Extra Deck on my Duel Disk and took out my two Fusions. I focused on the first one, seeing as it needed a DARK Attribute monster and a FIRE Attribute monster as Fusion Materials. \"I suppose so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ha! This is perfect!\" Shuzo jumped up, startling me. \"You both can have an Action Duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Against each other?\" Yuzu raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Don't you see? It's perfect!\" He said. \"You can see Elliot's fusions, and Elliot can get some proper Action Duel practice in! Whaddya say!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" I rubbed the back of my head. \"That does sound good, but some of the damage you take would really hurt, right? I don't wanna hurt Yuzu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for it.\" She stated. \"And you shouldn't worry about me Elliot, I've been in Action Duels before, I'm fine with them.\" She suddenly gained a dark aura and held her paper fan very menacingly. \"Or is it just 'cause I'm a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono!\" I waved my hands frantically. \"I'll duel you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She returned to her normal self, thank Egyptian Gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Elliot, which Field Spell would you like to battle on? Your choice.\" Shuzo offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny Field Spell? That would be tricky, all of them seemed really cool, but also tricky to navigate and get Action Cards in. \"I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you have a Field Spell?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed at myself stupidly. \"Wait, I can use a Field Spell I have?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't wanna hurt Yuzu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for it.\" She stated. \"And you shouldn't worry about me Elliot, I've been in Action Duels before, I'm fine with them.\" She suddenly gained a dark aura and held her paper fan very menacingly. \"Or is it just 'cause I'm a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nononono!\" I waved my hands frantically. \"I'll duel you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" She returned to her normal self, thank Egyptian Gods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Elliot, which Field Spell would you like to battle on? Your choice.\" Shuzo offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny Field Spell? That would be tricky, all of them seemed really cool, but also tricky to navigate and get Action Cards in. \"I dunno.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you have a Field Spell?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pointed at myself stupidly. \"Wait, I can use a Field Spell I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! We can register it on the system!\" Shuzo stated confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we?\" Yuzu asked with a half-lidded look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got out my deck and fanned it out, skimming over the cards until I found a Field Spell, Time City.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we use this one?\" I showed it to Shuzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" He looked at the card. \"As long as the computer can register it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. I accept your challenge, Yuzu!\" I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Elliot.\" She replied.</span></div></div>",

I took my Duel Disk out of my pocket and attached it to my arm, the screen showed 'Standby' before popping out my deck and the blade (which I was now sure was also Solid Vision with mass technology).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeeey! Go Yuzuuuu! Hot bloodeeeeed!\" Shuzo shouted, whilst Yuzu sighed in embarrassment, before equipping her own Duel Disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how this will turn out.\" Sora sighed, eating a chocolate bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! Field Spell on! Time City!\" There was a beeping sound before the area around us transformed into the Field Spell! It was predominantly made up of tall buildings filled with clocks and pendulums, we were btoh standing on a giant blue clock with grass circling the outer edges. But the most impressive thing in my opinion was the artificial sky, which looked like purple aurora lights with clocks fading in and out of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" I cheered, holding out my arm. \"Let's-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on!\" Yuzu's sudden shout almost made me fall back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What's wrong?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you start an Action Duel, you have to say the oath!\" She told me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's...an oath?\" Seriously!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, repeat after me.\" She said. \"Duelists locked in battle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duelists locked in battle...\" I echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kicking the earth and dancing in the air alongside their monsters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kicking the earth and dancing in the air alongside their monsters...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They storm through this field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They storm through this field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the newest and greatest evolution of Dueling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the newest and greatest evolution of Dueling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTION...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTION...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\" We both yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu vs. Elliot LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snap of the fingers was heard, and the action Cards floating above us burst, falling around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies first.\" I offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She smiled sweetly, somehow making me feel uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Right, now I gotta look for Action Cards!' I thought, before running around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! I summon Aria the Melodious Diva in Attack Mode!\" I looked at her whilst running to see a mainly orange woman with a harp on her back appear, with 1600 attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now that Aria's on the field, I can special summon my two Sonata the Melodious Diva's!\" Now two blue and green woman joined the orange one, both with 1200 attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll set a card and end my turn.\" Yuzu finished, as a card faded in front of her before it disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn!\" I looked at my hand whilst running. Polymerization, a Spell, Timestream Blob, Timestream Mage, and a Trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey, what was that? An Action Card! It's back looked different from other cards. I jumped and grabbed the card wedged into the window, before looking at it. Awesome! \"I activate the Action Spell, Energy Mate! I gain 500 Life Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 4500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I summon Timestream Blob in defense mode!\" The little light blue bubble with cartoonish limbs once again appeared, this time with a faint blue glow to show it's 100 DEF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemptingly, I walked over to the monster, who looked up at me. \"Uhh..hello.\" I greeted it. The Level 1's eyes turned up into a smile, before it jumped onto my shoulder. \"That's so cool!\" I picked it up and tossed it into the air before catching it. \"Your like a bouncy ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem!\"...Oops, I forgot Yuzu was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe...\" I chuckled nervously as Blob got back on my shoulder, before I cleared my throat. \"With Blob's effect, I special summon Timestream Mage from my hand in defense mode!\" Mage appeared next to me, crossing her staffs in front of her with a blue aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo defenses of 100 and 400 didn't seem good, but it was all I could do at the moment. \"I set a card and end my turn.\" I said as the Duel Disk processed the action. \"Now we gotta find some action cards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on request, Blob hopped off of my shoulder and inflated itself to space hopper size. \"...Is this okay?\" The monster nodded, so I shrugged, choosing not to question further, and I bounced along with Blob as my hopper, Mage running along next to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" Yuzu called as she and her monsters chased after us. As she ran she picked up an Action Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I release my two Sonata's to Advance Summon!\" The two identical monsters joined hands, singing in harmony before disappearing. \"Enchanting melody that echoes throughout the heavens! Level Eight! Mozarta the Melodious Maestra!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmerging was a mostly red singer, with two big wings, a large red dress and a conductor's baton, but most worryingly, 2600 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Crud! But it doesn't matter! I still have two wall monsters, plus my Trap Card!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my Action Spell! Holy Lance!\" The Solid Vision version showed a golden, medieval looking lance with a golden trail. \"During my Battle Phase this turn, one of my monsters inflicts piercing damage! I choose Mozarta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Me and my monsters facefaulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase!\" She smirked. \"Mozarta! Attack Timestream Blob! Graceful Wave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's monster spread it's wings and unleashed a burst of music, that knocked me clean off of Blob as it was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Gah!' I thought as I landed with the grace of a rock. 'That impact felt real! How is the health department not on this!?...anime.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Aria! Attack Mage!\" Her other monster blasted Mage (and once again me) away with its attack.\"Now Aria's effect activates! If Aria's attack doesn't do any damage to you, you take 800 points of effect damage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNononono-! I once again got blown away by a blast of music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouchouchouch...\" I groaned as I stood up and rubbed my back. \"Now that the Battle Phase has ended, I activate my Trap! Rapid Rewind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Trap showed an out of control purple clock with black lightning around it. \"After a Battle Phase where a Timestream monster was destroyed, I can special summon it back to my field! I choose Timestream Blob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little blob emerged once more, hopping back onto my shoulder. \"And then, if I lost Life Points in a battle involving that monster, I gain the same amount I lost!\" A warm green light washed over me, and my back pain subsided a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, I'll end my turn at that!\" Yuzu nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All right, let's see if I can find an Action Card. Looking, looking, looking...there!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ran over and picked it up with Blob looking at it as well, unfortunately...\"Huh? A Trap!? Great Misfortune!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning I was suddenly struck by a lightning bolt, losing 800 LP in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uuurgh...\" I stumbled back only to find my feet rest on what felt like a wire. Looking down I saw I was standing on a rail with blue energy running through it. \"What is thi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning I was suddenly launched along the rail! \"AAAAAAHHHH! LET ME OFF!\" I screamed as I grinded involuntarily along the looping rail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Come back here!\" I heard Yuzu call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEEEEELP MEEEE!\" I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frantically tried to keep my balance, all the time my heart pounding like some drummer on steroids, this was too much! \"Elliot!\" I looked behind me to see Yuzu grinding on the second rail. \"Draw a card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight! Right! Draw a card! \"M-My turn! D-Draw!\" I drew a card and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...What the heck?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomentarily forgetting my situation, I squinted at the card I was holding, it was a Monster Card, but it looked...weird. The bottom half was aquamarine, and it had two crystals, a red one and a blue one, either side of it with a 5 underneath both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this really a Monster?' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was interrupted as Blob tapped my shoulder and pointed forward, we were coming up on an Action Card! I reached out and grabbed it just in time, looking at it. '...Wait...with this I can...alright!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as we came close to the floor I jumped off the crazy rail, NEVER to do it again. \"I summon Timestream Trickster in Attack Mode!\" I announced, placing the weird monster on the specific zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA purple cape floated out of nowhere, with a black blob in the center, it seemed to show stars and comets in it, as if it was a part of the universe itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob grew two long clawed arms that also showed space, along with a head with the same background, the cape wrapped around its 'neck'. a black top hat fell on the head, the hat had a face on it, with an 'X' for one eye, a swirl for the other, and a zig-zag mouth. The head gained a smile filled with spiked teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Trickster, Level 3, Fiend, Dark, ATK: 1100, DEF: 700.</span></div></div>",

When Trickster's summoned, A dice is rolled, then I can special summon a Timestream Monster with a Level equal to the result from my deck with its effect negated!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrickster chuckled to itself, before creating a black dice with white spots in its claw, then throwing it forward. The cube hopped a few times, before finally stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! A four!\" I fist-pumped. \"So I'll special summon Timestream Wanderer from my deck!\" The card slid out from my deck and I placed it on the blade in attack position, the monster appearing next to Trickster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu jumped off the rail as well in front of us. \"Okay, so now you have three monsters, but none of them are as strong as Mozarta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They will be soon.\" I smirked. \"I activate the Action Spell Super Shuffler!\" The spell showed the Attributes all spinning around in a whirlpool. \"I can change the Attribute or Type of one monster on the field! I choose to change Timestream Blob's Attribute to Fire!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlob jumped off my shoulder just before it set itself on fire, the flames quickly died down to reveal Blob's colour had changed from a baby blue to a crimson red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate Polymerization!\" The easily recognizable card popped up. \"Now I fuse my FIRE-Attribute Timestream Blob with my DARK-Attribute Timestream Trickster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlob and Trickster both floated up, Blob glowing red whilst Trickster glowed purple, before spinning together in a whirlpool of colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emerging from the fires of hell, incinerate all with your black flames!\" I chanted. \"Fusion Summon! Burn 'em down! Hex Inferno!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom out of the swirling lights burst forth pitch black flames which formed into a lean, humanoid like body with claws. Red armour appeared and attached to it's chest, whilst some more armour attached to its ankles and a helmet fell on top, making it look like an incomplete suit of armour possessed by fire. A single red eye gleamed out of the half smashed helmet completing the monsters look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHex Inferno, Level 6, Fiend, Fire, ATK: 2200, DEF: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate Hex Inferno's effect!\" I continued. \"I can pay a certain number of Life Points to decrease one monsters attack by double that amount! I pay 1300 Life Points...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To reduce Mozarta's attack by 2600!\" Hex Inferno gained a red aura that was launched to and washed over the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mozarta!\" Yuzu gasped as its attack was reduced to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase!\" I cried. \"Hex Inferno! Attack Mozarta! Dark Incineration!\" The 6 star shot a trail of black flames at Mozarta, hitting it with a big explosion. \"Alright!\" But when the smoke cleared, Mozarta was still there! \"Eh? What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activated an Action Spell.\" Yuzu stated, holding it up. \"Avoid negates your attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit...\" I muttered. \"But I still have Wanderer! Attack Mozarta!\" This time the attack connected, and Mozarta gracefully exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's LP: 2400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn on that.\" I said, before running off again with my monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good.\" Yuzu coughed. \"My turn! Draw! I activate my Trap, Beckoning Light!\" The Trap flipped up. \"Now I discard my hand and get monsters from the Graveyard equal to the number of cards I discarded. I discard the two cards in my hand...\" I watched her cards go into the Graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and add Mozarta and Sonata to my hand.\" She showed me the two cards. \"Now I special summon Sonata, then release Sonata and Aria to Advance Summon Mozarta!\" The two joined hands and sung together, fading into the familiar monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I just got rid of that monster!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Mozarta! Attack Hex Inferno! Graceful Wave!\" The blast of sound traveled towards Inferno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Crapcrapcrap!' I thought. 'Hey! An Action Card! And if I know anime this will save me!...Hopefully...' I made a diving leap for the card and grabbed it. 'Yes! Thank you anime logic!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Action Spell Miracle! With it my monster isn't destroyed and the battle damage I receive is halfed!\" Inferno endured the attack, but I still felt the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu jumped up and grabbed an Action Card. \"I activate the Action Spell Shatter!\" The Spell showed glass pieces scattered around a brilliant light. \"With this, the monster with the lowest attack is destroyed, and its controller takes damage equal to half its original attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Wanderer!\" I realised out loud, before my monster was shattered like glass, the pieces shooting at me, making me protect myself with my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end my turn with that.\" Yuzu finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay...I still have Hex Inferno, I just need one good card. Come on deck!' I thought desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" I drew and looked at the card, thanking my lucky stars. \"First I activate Hex Inferno's effect, paying 300 Life Points...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To decrease Mozarta's attack to 2000!\" Inferno's red aura once again covered Mozarta. \"Now! Battle Phase! Hex Inferno attacks Mozarta! Dark Incineration!\" Hex Inferno blasted more black flames, destroying Mozarta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's LP: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate the Quick-Play Spell De-Fusion!\" The card formed in front of me. \"Hex Inferno! Turn back into Timestream Blob and Trickster!\" My only monster turned completely back before swirling around, bursting apart into red and purple swirls that formed back into my previous two monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now I need an Action Card!' I could tell Yuzu was thinking the same thing, so we both ran. 'Can I really beat her to an Action Card?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both ran up a long flight of stairs up to what looked like a clock with a pendulum, where an Action Card was stuck in the swinging pendulum! 'There!' I'm positive both of us thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the card, arching back and forth. 'Wherever it swings will depend on who gets it.' So I had to time this right...left, right, left, right-wait, if I've learned anything from playing timing video games, you have to do it, just when you want it on the time you want! I'm on the right side, so...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nleft...right...left...right...left...right! 'Now!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sprinted forward and reached out just as the pendulum swung over to me, and I grabbed the card! 'Yes!' Unfortunately I forgot about my momentum, and reached the edge! 'NO!' I toppled for several seconds, before falling off! 'Craap!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\" I heard Yuzu call from above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI covered my eyes and waited for the impact, but none came. I peeked between my fingers to see the ground, not getting closer. I looked up to be met with a spiky grin, realising that Trickster was holding me up. \"Wow, thanks Trickster!\" He chuckled creepily before lifting me up and placing me back on the platfrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, Elliot?\" Yuzu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" I sighed, ignoring my pounding heart with the Action Card. \"And I think I can win this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Action Spell Overclock!\" The spell showed several clocks and gears red hot with orange electricity. \"Now all my monsters gain 500 attack until the End Phase!\" My two monsters gained a red aura as their attacks increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Yuzu gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still my Battle Phase! Timestream Blob! Attack Yuzu directly!\" Blob bounced into Yuzu, knocking her onto her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's LP: 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Timestream Trickster! Attack Yuzu directly!\" Trickster created the purple kanji for 'Dark' in his hand, before launching it at Yuzu in a big explosion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuzu's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot: WIN! </span></div></div>",

I had stayed up most of the night with Yuya researching Pendulum Cards, and very little had gone in, but oh well. The next morning I had got an email from Smiley a.k.a Colour Hitler about a duel he had set me up with, and that's how I got on this bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Yuya, he was sitting behind me, along with Yuzu, Ayu, Futoshi, Tatsuya and Sora. \"Thanks again for coming along you guys.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Yuya replied. \"We're friends, so its only fair we come and watch your duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to duel with me sometime.\" Sora grinned whilst eating chocolate (Caramel, my favourite). \"Since we're both Fusion users.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Uhhh...that doesn't make sense.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Elliot! Are you gonna use Timestream Dragon again? It gave me the shivers!\" Futoshi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or that Hex Inferno Yuzu-niichan told us about?\" Ayu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll all depend on how the battle plays out.\" Yuzu told them. \"Just don't lose, that's all that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just gotta stay focused...\" I told myself, before realising the bus was slowing down. \"Oh, this is our stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all stepped off to be met with a large school building, normally proportioned unlike You Show Duel School's. Tatsuya ran up to the sign and read it aloud: \"Tsuyo-sa School.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsuyo-sa?\" I echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means 'Strength'.\" Yuya translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of name is that?\" I sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walked in and I instantly saw why the school was called that, gym and training equipment was systematically placed in every spare space. The students had the build of every character in a teen girl film and the vitality of a horse on viagra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with this school?\" Yuzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's filled with sports stuff!\" Ayu stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So!\" A voice suddenly boomed behind us. \"Which one of you is Elliot Zekaki!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of us slowly turned around to be met with a giant of a man with the clothing's of a stereotypical coach, and black hair spiked up to the point of steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Me.\" I squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bahahaha!\" He laughed, suddenly grabbing me in a hug. \"It's good to meet you! I'm the headmaster, Suchiru!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...to...meet...you...\" I wheezed from the bone crushing greeting before being released.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, I'm sure your excited to be dueling our nominated student!\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes.\" I gasped. \"So, who am I dueling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me.\" Once again we turned to meet a burly boy. This one had wavy dark brown hair, spiked collars around his wrists, and a dark green tracksuit with the sleeves torn off. \"So I'm dueling you? You don't look like you could have an Action Duel to save your life!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'An Action Duel almost killed me...' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Kinzoku, one of our toughest students.\" Suchiru gestured. \"His Spell and Trap Deck has got him his five-win streak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deck with only Spells and Traps? How interesting.\" Sora mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then! Let's take this to the field!\" We all walked into a large room, the students sitting around us with my friends on the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck, Elliot!\" Yuya and Yuzu called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your beeeeest!\" The three kids cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arigatou, everyone!\" I waved.

'Shit! Bad hand!' All I had was Wanderer, three useless Spells and a Trap. 'Guess I gotta go with what I got...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Timestream Wanderer in attack mode!\" My monster appeared floating beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Attacking would be too risky with those face downs, I guess I can't do much for the moment.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set a card and end my turn!\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKinzoku laughed. \"Then I'll activate this! Gravity Bind! Now all Level 4 and higher monsters can't attack!\" Glowing ropes crisscrossed over Wanderer, constricting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Stalling tactics...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" As he rose he snatched a card. \"First I'll activate this fields signature Action Card, Spike Strike!\" The card showed four spiked missiles. \"When this card is activated, you take 400 points of damage!\" The depicted missilesyoappeared and shot right at me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not on my watch! I activate a Trap! Deflect Draw!\" The card depicted a close resemblance to Defence Draw, but with multiple mirrors and reflections. \"This negates effect damage and allows me to draw a card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mirror appeared around me that blocked the attack, whilst I drew a card. 'Star Changer...with this I can make Wanderer Level 3 and nullify Gravity Bind!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate the Spell, Meteor of Destruction!\" Say what!? I looked up and saw he did have that card! \"I can activate this as long as your Life Points are above 3000, you take 1000 damage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put on the brakes as a small meteor appeared and hurtled towards me! '...****' Luckily it obliterated the portion of staircase in front of me instead of myself, but the force still sent me tumbling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouchouchouch...\" I groaned as I stood up and brushed myself down. I noticed a large hanging cage a little back, so I ran down and jumped in with Wanderer, and as if on cue, it began to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How fitting.\" My opponent smirked. \"Trapped in a cage, it's so sinbolic of your fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's SYMBOLIC.\" I sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever, I activate Ookazi! Take 800 Points of damage!\" Suddenly the ground underneath me was set ablaze!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAH! HOT! VERY HOT!\" I panicked as I hopped from foot to foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" He grabbed another Action Card. \"I activate a second Spike Strike!\" This time I couldn't do anything, and simply shielded myself with my arms as the spikes exploded in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set a card and end.\" Zinzoku finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot's already lost more then half his Life Points!\" Ayu panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he can't attack with Wanderer, what now?\" Yuzu thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got up and steadied myself. \"My turn! Draw!\" I drew the card and looked at it. 'Yes! Finally!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Timestream Trickster in Attack Mode!\" The monster smiled mischievously with its 1100 attack. \"Now it's affect activates! I roll a dice, and whatever the result is, I can special summon a Timestream monster with a Level equal to the roll! Go dice!\" Trickster rolled his black dice, unfortunately...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...6?\" I took my deck out and frantically looked through. \"I don't have any Level 6 monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sucks to be you then, doesn't it?\" Zinzoku smirked as I placed my deck back before it was shuffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever! I activate Star Changer! It reduces or increases a monsters Level by one! And I choose to decrease Wanderer's Level to 3!\" With its Level reduced, my monster broke free of its shackles. \"Battle Phase! Attack him directly!\" Wanderer charged upwards to the still rising ball and chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh uh uh.\" He wagged his finger mockingly. \"Activate Trap! Ring of Destruction!\" The card flipped up. \"It destroys one monster on the field, then inflicts damage to both of us equal to half its attack!\" The ring materialised and clamped around Wanderer's neck, exploding shortly afterwards and choking us in debris smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZinzoku's LP: 3200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Wanderer, I was too hasty...\" I mumbled. \"Get revenge, Trickster! Attack him directly!\" Trickster giggled before launching its purple kanji, hitting him head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZinzoku's LP: 2100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't bother me.\" He shrugged it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gritted my teeth. \"I end my turn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally reached the top of the tower, a platform littered with violent weapons from spiked clubs to chainsaws, with black clouds swirling around us we dismounted our modes of transport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a good look around, this is the last place your gonna see before I crush you.\" He grinned maliciously. \"Draw!\" As soon as he did that he ran to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop!\" I cried as I gave chase, but his athleticism was far greater then mine and he easily snatched the Action Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your outta luck.\" He smirked. \"I activate Coffin of Impalement!\" The familiar torture device appeared. \"With this card, I get to destroy one of your monsters, so say goodbye to your little friend.\" The coffin slammed Trickster into it and closed before exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trickster!\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the best part? You take damage equal to your monsters Level x100!\" I cursed in my head as debris fell on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 700<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed another Action Card. \"And now, Spike Strike number three!\" I was once again blasted with spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 300<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother Action Card. \"Looks like your lucky, Needle Pierce only inflicts 100 points of damage!\" A sharp pain shot through me, and I fell to the ground clutching my chest in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's taking too much damage!\" Tatsuya panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like Zinzoku's toying with him, before finishing him off...\" Sora commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just have to keep believing in him.\" Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZinzoku looked around. \"Can't see anymore, aren't you lucky today?\" I shakily stood back up. \"So, no cards on the field, and a useless hand I take it, this is all you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI steadied myself on my knees. \"The Duel's not over yet! I'm putting my trust in my Deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just laughed. \"Really? Still holding onto some hope? Let me show you something.\" He showed me two cards, and my eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mirror Force and Magic Jammer...\" I breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, and now I'm gonna set 'em.\" He placed the cards down. \"You gettit, dontcha? You can't do anything to me this turn, which means I've won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is this really it?' I thought. 'What can I do?' I looked at my Duel Disk. 'Please...if there's one card in here that can help me...I need you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn, make your last move.\" He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shakily placed my hand on the cards. \"My turn...Draw!\" I drew the card in a wide ard, before looking at it. '...Looks like I'm placing my trust in you.</span></div></div>",

When he's Normal Summoned, I can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from my Graveyard with its effect negated and its Attack and Defense reduced to zero, and my choice is Timestream Wanderer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnacord hissed, sending a small bolt of electricity next to me, which burst into a bolt of lightning out of which emerged Wanderer, with 0 Attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Wanderer back, I activate the Spell, Copycard!\" The card depicted a red jelly like hand grabbing a Monster Reincarnation card. \"This card gains the effect of a Spell in my Graveyard, and my only choice would be Star Changer! So I'll use it's effect to change Wanderer to a Level 3!\" Copycard turned into Star Changer, and reduced Wanderer's Level by 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to tune my Level 2 Snacord with my Level 3 Timestream Wanderer!\" The two monsters jumped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it be!?\" Yuzu gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Synchro Summoning!\" Sora confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnacord zapped electricity throughout its body, glowing brighter until he turned into two green rings, which went around Wanderer, who was turned into three orbs of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the dusk of a ruined future, a shining beacon of hope emerges!\" I chanted. \"Synchro Summon! Explode from the future! Valiant G-X!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA column of light burst through the rings, out of which emerged a shining silver mecha. Its body was stocky, and it had green energy zipping through its body via energy cords, its 'feet' were two small thrusters constantly alit with green fire, its visor shaped like sharp sunglasses, with two green streams of energy radiating out of its back like a scarf. And in place of arms were two powerful black cannons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValiant G-X, Level 5, Machine/Synchro, Light, ATK: 2100 DEF: 1500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you Synchro Summoned, big deal.\" Zinzoku spat. \"It's Level 5, which means Gravity Bind's gonna stop it!\" The net of energy trapped the mecha, but it easily broke free! \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valiant G-X's special ability.\" I smirked. \"It's unaffected, and can't be targeted, by Trap cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!? No! My Traps! They're useless!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct!\" I pointed forward. \"Battle Phase! Valiant G-X! Attack him directly! Twin Buster Laser!\" The Synchro monster aimed its weapons, charging up before launching two powerful bursts of green lasers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh!\" He yelled as he was tossed back from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKinzoku's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot: WIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe slowly descended as the tower lowered, fading away. \"Thank you.\" I said to Valiant G-X, who nodded before it too faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\" Yuya ran over to me before everyone else. \"That was amazing! I didn't know you could Synchro Summon too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gave me the shivers!\" Futanashi added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your certainly a special case.\" Sora said, still eating sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that makes victory number three!\" Yuzu added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was worried for a bit, but Snacord won the Duel for us.\" I admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were really awesome, Elliot-oniichan!\" Ayu added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks I-...huh?\" I pointed at myself. \"You just called me oniichan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Iiiis that okay?\" She asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared blankly for a second before smiling. \"Sure, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\" I turned to see Zinzoku walk over. \"It appears I lost...however, I will turn this frustration into redoubling my Dueling skills! So when I have improved, please see if you can Duel me again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled and nodded. \"Sure, hopefully that'll come soon.\" And so we shook on friendly terms. </span></div></div>",

Besides, when was the last time YOU went to school Mr. On-the-road?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...\" I sweatdropped at my fabricated past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\" Sora shrugged it off, with me thanking him in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Yuya-\" I quickly changed topic. \"-how many more wins until you get a 60% win rate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more!\" He smiled. \"Nico spicturin  contact me when he'd find someone 'special' to Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Let's just hope Circus Hitler can get me a battle in time too.' I thought, chomping on my strawberry ice pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, all these duels lately have made it really nice to get a day off.\" Yuzu sighed, making us look at her. \"We should make the most of it, do something fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But dueling is fun.\" Yuya countered with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides that.\" She sweatdropped. \"...I know! Let's go to the beach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beach?\" I echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! The beach! Let's go! Let's go!\" Ayu agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they'll have ice cream...\" Sora wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! It's decided! Let's all have a beach day!\" Yuya announced, making everyone cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Okay.\" I stated, choosing not to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was how I found myself strolling along fine sand next to the gentle lapping seawater. 'Been a while since I've been on a beach.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna build a huge sandcastle!\" Futoshi declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I'll build a bigger one!\" Ayu proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, oi, why's the tide so far out?\" Sora complained. \"I wanted to go in the water...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Elliot!\" Yuya waved me over as he and Yuzu were wielding wooden bats, standing over a watermelon. \"Wanna play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom my consistent watching of anime, I knew of this game, this was truly a test of my skills. \"Okay, why not?\" I picked up a bat and blindfolded myself. Turns out I'm not very good, I managed to hit the sand around the watermelon, and somehow stumbled back into the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually I sat dripping wet on the sand whilst Sora was sitting next to me, licking a chocolate ice cream. \"You want me to get you one?\" He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright, thanks.\" I turned him down. We sat in silence for a bit before Sora spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Elliot, where do you come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I was a bit taken aback by the sudden question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You told us you came from an orphanage, where would that be exactly?\" He continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Far away.\" I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE far away?\" He persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...\" Crap, my fake backstory was in trouble!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot-oniichan!\" I looked up to see Ayu waving at me. \"Please come and help me and Yuzu-neechan with our castle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Okay!\" I took the opportunity and jogged over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" Sora pouted, licking his ice cream. \"I really wanted to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! No fair! You've got Yuzu and Elliot helping you out!\" Futoshi complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll help you, Futoshi.\" Yuya offered, and the two furiously began building...if you can even build furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's the towers done!\" Yuzu stated proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to have a moat.\" I said. \"The best sandcastles always have moats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after several bucket trips down to the sea and back, our castle was complete, as for Yuya and Futoshi...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...doesn't look very stable.\" I sweatdropped looking at the too tall too skinny tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's holding up alright.\" Futoshi stated, just before it toppled over. \"Oh man!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to the drawing board...\" Yuya sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of us just laughed. All of this was really fun! The last time I remember going to the beach was walking along the pier with my fami-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped my train of thought, and a wave of sadness washed over me. I hadn't thought about my family since I came here, what were they doing now? Were they searching for me? Did they just find me gone the next day? Did they even know I was alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot-oniichan, what's wrong?\" Ayu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's-it's nothing.\" I said half-heartedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something on your mind?\" Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...this all reminded me about a group of...people, who I really care about. I got seperated from them, and I was just wondering if they miss me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at each other for a moment, and I could tell that I'd unintentionally brought their mood down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" Yuya started. \"If you care about them, and they care about you, then your bound to meet again someday. I don't know when but...the important thing is you have to greet them with a big smile on your face, like this!\" He pulled a grin almost too big for his face, which sent me into a laughing fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahahahaha! Ha...ha...ho-okay...\" I chuckled. \"Your right, and I'm gonna do just that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the meantime...I had some pretty great friends with me.

Timestream Carer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppearing out of Trickster's hat was a girl with large silver eyes and long blue hair, wearing a simple white gown with blue swirl patterns, and a tiara on her head with a clock-like gem in the centerpiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Carer, Level 4, Fairy, Light, ATK: 1900 DEF: 1300, Pendulum Scale 3<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When this lovely carer here is Special Summoned, I get to draw a card!...If Timestream Trickster's effect didn't prevent that.\" I sweatdropped, remembering. \"Now I shall set two cards and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! He did so much in his first turn!\" Tatsuya praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Carer is so cool!\" Ayu cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to start looking for some Action Cards.\" I thought aloud before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, Draw!\" He drew a card. \"First I activate the Spell Card, Shaddoll Fusion from my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he say!?\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fusion!?\" Yuya breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse the Shaddoll Beast and Shaddoll Hound in my hand!\" The two monsters appeared and turned into black and purple swirls mixing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accursed black puppet, descend upon the foolish under your dark hearted master! Fusion Summon! Appear! El Shaddoll Winda!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creepy looking bird-like puppet appeared being ridden by a sorceress, with a powerful 2200 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That monster gives me the shivers!\" Futoshi shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will now set a monster.\" The card was set, the monster being represented by a blue sphere with chains around it with red eyes. \"Battle Phase! El Shaddoll Winda! Attack his Timestream Trickster!\" The puppet gave a horrid screech before chasing us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh crap!' I thought. 'I need to act!' I quickly spotted something though. 'An Action Card!' I jumped and grabbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Action Spell Miracle! It prevents my monsters destruction and halves the battle damage!\" A bubble appeared around Trickster that shielded it from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3450<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set a card and end my turn.\" He finished calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This guy isn't playing around!' I thought. 'I've gotta get serious!' \"My turn! Draw!\" I looked at the card. 'Perfect! This could let me deal a lot of damage!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Flare Resonator!\" The little monster appeared in a ball of fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Tuner!\" Ayu marvelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean...?\" Yuzu started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Synchro Summon!\" The three kids cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now activate Polymerisation from my hand.\" I showed the card. \"To fuse my DARK Attribute Trickster and my FIRE Attribute Resonator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh!?\" The trio facefaulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is he Fusing a Tuner?\" Sora wondered. \"Did he just need it for a second Fusion Material?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" Yuya mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrickster and Resonator became purple and red swirls respectively. \"Emerging from the fires of hell, incinerate all with your black flames! Fusion Summon! Burn 'em down! Hex Inferno!\" The purple fire and red armour appeared in ATK position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you can use Fusion too.\" Katsu smirked, almost approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it!\" I grinned. \"Now let me show you what he can do! I activate Hex Inferno's effect! By paying 100 Life Points...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3350<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I reduce El Shaddoll Winda's attack by 200!\" The monsters attack dropped to 2000, I didn't want to risk anymore Life Points for fear of a counterattack. \"Battle Phase! Hex Inferno! Attack Winda! Dark Incineration!\" The black flames swallowed up the puppet, making it explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsu's LP: 3800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, Carer! Attack his set monster! Serene Pulse!\" Carer clasped her hands together and created a blue ball of energy which she tossed at the set monster, which revealed itself as a dragon puppet with 0 defence!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shaddoll Dragon's Flip Effect activates!\" Katsu cried. \"It returns one monster on your side to the hand! So say goodbye to your Hex Inferno!\" As Dragon was destroyed, a shadowy aura flew towards HI.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not on my watch! I activate my face down Quick Play Spell, De-Fusion!\" The card flipped up. \"It breaks Hex Inferno back into Trickster and Resonator!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHI split up just before the shadows hit it, back into the ATK positioned Trickster and Resonator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That's odd...\" Sora mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De-Fusion returns a Fusion Monster to the Extra Deck and Special Summons its Fusion Materials from the Graveyard. But Timestream Trickster is a Pendulum Monster, so shouldn't it have gone to the Extra Deck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your right.\" Yuzu realised. \"I wonder why that is...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it your a bit confused.\" I called to them. \"So allow me to elaborate. Trickster has a second ability! When it would be sent to the Extra Deck, it can be sent to the Graveyard instead! The time I Dueled Yuzu I sent him to the Graveyard because I didn't know the rules of Pendulum Monsters, but this time I did it deliberately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's clever, sending Trickster to the Graveyard so he can use De-Fusion.\" Sora praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's still my Battle Phase! Trickster! Attack him directly!\" Trickster launched his kanji whilst laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't!\" He grabbed an Action Card. \"I activate the Action Spell Avoid to negate your attack!\" He quickly jumped out of the way of the kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still got another one! Flare Resonator! Attack directly!\" Resonator launched a fireball forward, Katsu crossed his arms in defence, but he was still pushed back from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsu's LP: 3500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Great job you three!\" I praised them, making them all gather in for a group hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your celebrating a bit early.\" Katsu grumbled.</span></div></div>",

Urgent Tuning!\" The Trap flipped up. \"When this is activated, I can Synchro Summon during the Battle Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what!?\" Katsu gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to Tune my Level 2 Flare Resonator with my Level 3 Timestream Trickster!\" The two nodded at each other before jumping up, Resonator clanging his tuning fork and turning himself into two green rings, whilst Trickster became 3 orbs of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the dusk of a ruined future, a shining beacon of hope emerges! Synchro Summon! Explode from the future! Valiant G-X!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe powerful Synchro monster emerged, with me jumping on its back before it flew up. \"This time I'll put Trickster in the Extra Deck, and Resonator in the Graveyard.\" My Duel Screen showed the action. \"And due to Flare Resonator's effect, it gains 300 attack!\" G-X's attack was boosted to 2400.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Fusion Summon and a Synchro Summon with the same monsters! That's incredible!\" Yuya cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shivers!\" Futoshi commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's still his Battle Phase!\" Yuzu acknowledged<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go! Elliot-oniichan!\" Ayu cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle! Valiant G-X! Attack directly! Twin Buster Laser!\" I held on tight as my monster fired its two powerful cannons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you-!\" Katsu gritted his teeth before grabbing an Action Card. \"I activate the Action Spell Stardust Petals! It halves all damage I take for the rest of this turn!\" He then braced for impact as the lasers hit the ice petals now swirling around him protectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsu's LP: 2300<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe landed in a clearing next to a small cliff encrusted with diamonds. \"Great job, Valiant G-X.\" I patted it on the head. \"Oi! Katsu! Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smoke cleared he was made visible, though now with a more sinister look. \"Heh.\" He grinned. \"It's still your turn, gonna do anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him in confusion before continuing. \"No, I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn!\" He said, drawing. \"It seems I have to get serious! I activate Graceful Charity! With this I draw three cards then send two to the Graveyard!\" He drew three, viewed them, and discarded two. \"The cards I sent to the Graveyard were Shaddoll Falco and Shaddoll Hedgehog! When they are sent to the Graveyard by card effects their effects activate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Effects by being sent to the Graveyard with a card effect?\" I thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Shaddoll Falco is sent via card effect, I can Special Summon it in face down Defence Position!\" The monster appeared as Set. \"And when Hedgehog is sent, I can add a Shaddoll monster except Hedgehog from my Deck to my hand! I choose Shaddoll Squamata!\" He showed the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is he planning?' I thought worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I activate my Trap! Shaddoll Core!\" The demonic looking Trap flipped up. \"This card is summoned as a Level 9 Spellcaster to my field!\" The depicted monster emerged from the card, towering above us with a surprisingly meek ATK of 1450.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" He smirked. \"Shaddoll Core can be substituted for a Fusion Material monster on a Shaddoll Fusion Monster as an Attribute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a Fusion Material!?\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate Shaddoll Fusion!\" He held the card up triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did he get that card back!?\" Yuzu voiced her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When an El Shaddoll monster is sent to the Graveyard, I can add a Shaddoll Spell or Trap from the Graveyard to my hand!\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He already had a counter for losing his Fusion...\" I muttered under my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse my set Shaddoll Falco and my Shaddoll Core as a FIRE Attribute!\" Falco revealed itself and the monsters turned into a swirling mix of red and black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Accursed black puppet, bathe the living in a sea of flames, and turn all to ashes! Fusion Summon! Appear! El Shaddoll Grysta!\" A knight armour puppet with blazing body parts emerged from the swirl, with 2450 ATK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's got more attack then Valiant G-X's!\" Ayu panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle! Grysta! Attack his Valiant G-X!\" Grysta cloaked itself in fire before barreling towards us!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" I yelped as we took off with Grysta in hot pursuit. \"I need to find an Action Card!\" I scanned the trees hurriedly, but to no avail, and as we ascended sharply Grysta smashed into us from the side, destroying Valiant G-X, and leaving me to fall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhh!\" I screamed as I fell, the air rushing past me, but thankfully instead of feeling bone crushing pain I felt an impact and was surrounded by water. I surfaced and swam to the edge of the lake just as Carer arrived to help me out. \"I've had enough of being wet for one day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've lost both your Fusion and Synchro monster.\" Katsu stated as Grysta landed behind him. \"Is that the best you can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not by a long shot!\" I countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I'll just defeat your next strongest monster!\" He proclaimed. \"And the next! And the next! Until your finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't underestimate my monsters!\" I argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, I set a monster and end my turn.\" The holograms showed the actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have faith in my Deck...\" I placed my hand on the top card. \"My turn! Draw!\" I drew my card in a big sweep before looking at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an unfamiliar wave of joy washed over me as I looked at the Pendulum Monster. 'What is this feeling?' Just by looking at this monster, I feel like I can place my unwavering trust with it...this one is special...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI added the monster to my hand before selecting another card. \"I activate a Spell! Clock Maintenance!\" The card depicted a broken and smoking clock being tended to by dwarves. \"By sending up to three cards, including at least one 'Timestream' monster, from my Deck to the Graveyard I can draw one less then the number sent! I send three cards to the Graveyard...\" I sent Timestream Blob, Mage and a Trap. \"To draw two cards!\" I added two to my hand. </span></div></div>",

Its face showed only white dots for eyes and a silly grin in which two clock hand points acted as fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Vamp, Level 2, Winged Beast, Wind, ATK: 900 DEF: 700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now I release Timestream Carer and Vamp to Advance Summon!\" The two floated upward, turning gold and combining into a shining portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great vanguard of infinite power, sealed away for your amazing potential, please appear with your limited strength!\" I chanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Advance Summon! The chained heart of my resolve! Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the portal emerged two long white bandages, followed by a black iron sphere. Followed by the sphere was what appeared to be a giant white body, wrapped entirely in chains, completed with a prominent black 'X' on the chest. The top upturning into a 'collar' to hold the iron sphere (held down by the chains) and the bottom, after coming out of an hourglass middle, formed into a diamond shape, out of the bottom came two more bandages which bent to serve as legs, the other set on either side of the upper portion of the 'body' to serve as arms. Two red eyes flashed onto the iron sphere, completing its look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYavix the Imprisoned Warrior, Level 7, Warrior, Dark, ATK: 2700 DEF: 1800, Pendulum Scale 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...this is your ace.\" Katsu nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sugoi!\" The three children marvelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2700 attack, it's even stronger then Odd-Eyes!\" Yuzu noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot's ace monster...it sure is cool!\" Yuya grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora just smiled as he licked his lollipop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yavix's effect activates!\" I cried. \"When it is Advance Summoned, no card effects can be activated until the End Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!?\" Katsu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Yavix will attack Grysta! Sealed Energy!\" Grysta tried to flee, but Yavix's bandage arms stretched out and wrapped around Grysta, binding it and preventing escape. Yavix then generated a red energy along its bandages, creating a sphere of red energy around Grysta that shortly exploded afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsu's LP: 2050<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since effects can't be activated this turn, you can't recover Shaddoll Fusion.\" I smiled. \"I end my turn. Your move, Katsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the smoke cleared, Katsu looked up, with a sinister grin on his face. \"Heh...it's been awhile...since I've had to go all out...My turn! Draw!\" He drew and continued to play with a mad grin on his face. \"First I activate Foolish Burial to send a monster from my Deck to the Graveyard!\" He did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When the monster I just sent, Shaddoll Beast, is sent to the Graveyard via card effect, I can draw one card!\" He drew again. \"Next I summon Shaddoll Dragon from my hand!\" The familiar monster appeared with 1900 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I activate the Equip Spell Nephe Shaddoll Fusion!\" The card appeared. \"Behold! My ultimate Spell! It is equipped to one of my monsters, and then that monster can be used for any Attribute on an El Shaddoll Fusion that I wish!\" A golden seal appeared behind Shaddoll Dragon, binding it in a powerful aura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any Attribute?\" I repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it can perform Fusion too!\" He laughed. \"I fuse the Shaddoll Hound in my hand with Shaddoll Dragon as a LIGHT Attribute!\" The two monsters jumped up, becoming black and white swirls and fusing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demonic creator of shadows, weaver of forbidden threads, cover all who dare oppose you in darkness, and bind their hearts, lives and souls into your masterful puppetry!\" He cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FUSION SUMMON! Arise! String Puller of the Shaddoll! El Shaddoll Construct!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA humongous figure towered over us, revealed to be some sort of puppet-like female deity with a robotic appearanc, and countless purple Shaddoll threads stemming from it's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What IS that thing!?\" I yelled in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The creator! The controller of all Shaddoll!\" Katsu grinned in mad glee. \"And when it is summoned I can send a Shaddoll monster from my deck to the Graveyard! By sending my third Shaddoll Dragon, it's effect activates, allowing me to destroy a Spell or Trap on the field! Say goodbye to your set card!\" Shaddoll Dragon's black spirit tore through my card, ripping it to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now Flip Summon my Shaddoll Squamata!\" The monster appeared with 1800 ATK. \"It's Flip Effect activates! It destroys one monster on the field! Obliterate that walking mummy wannabe!\" A dark blast of energy fired towards Yavix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you!\" I yelled, rolling forward to snatch an Action Card. \"Activate Action Spell Mirror Barrier! It prevents an effect from destroying my monster!\" A sphere of mirrors appeared around Yavix, defending it from the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've only prolonged your fate! That Yavix's 2700 ATK is no match for Construct's 2800!\" He noted. \"Battle! Construct! Destroy his Imprisoned Warrior! Shaddoll Strings!\" The strings on its back lashed out and skewered Yavix! He disappeared in a burst of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next...\" Construct handed him an Action Card. \"I activate the Action Spell Diamond Sleet!

I looked everywhere whilst running, until I saw a huge group of icicles circling around each other, making the shape of an enormous crown, and there was one wedged in the back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's all I've got!' I made a diving leap for the card and grabbed it just in time. I looked at it...and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquamata rammed into me, smashing me against the diamonds and sending me slumping to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\" Everyone cried as the Action Card fluttered out of my hand and into Katsu's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transparent...bad luck.\" He stated mockingly before tossing the card away. \"Well, your ace monster is gone, no cards on the field and only one in your hand. I've practically won this Duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...Not yet.\" I grunted, forcing myself to my feet. \"Not while, I still have at least one more card in my deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Stop delluding yourself! Don't you get it!? Your strongest cards are gone! Your finished!\" He grinned madly as he talked. \"You can only rely on the strongest cards in the end! And when they're gone your practically finished! To truly be stronger, you have to take everything your opponent can throw at you and crush it! Anything less is a third rate Duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him angrily as he spoke, my rage towards him building. \"...If my strongest isn't good enough...\" I grabbed the card. \"Then I'll just have to surpass myself and try again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" He shrugged. \"Just get your turn over with so I can finish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My turn!...DRAW!\" I drew the card, and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This card...' As I looked at it, it seemed to give off a faint glow, and the card in my other hand seemed to be resonating with it. '...I understand...I know how to become stronger!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may think that the strongest is all that counts.\" I said. \"But I believe in all my cards! I'll show you my trust in them now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cards in my hand now gave off a brilliant, blinding glow. \"Gah!\" Katsu gasped, shielding his eyes. \"What is that light!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's pendant began to glow as well. \"Huh?\" He looked at it in confusion. \"Is this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, using the Scale 1 Lunar Knight, and the Scale 8 Solar Knight, set the Pendulum Scale!\" I declared, placing them on either end of my Duel Disk's blade, causing the word 'PENDULUM' to appear on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar Knight, Level 6, Warrior, Water, ATK: 2300 DEF: 1200, Pendulum Scale 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolar Knight, Level 2, Warrior, Fire, ATK: 1000 DEF: 800, Pendulum Scale 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two monsters rose up either side of me. Lunar knight was in light and dark blue armour with a curving yellow sword to look like a crescent moon, whereas Solar Knight's armour was orange and red, and he was holding a lance and a sun shaped shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I am able to summon Level 2 to 7 monsters simultaneously!\" A '1' appeared under Lunar Knight, and an '8' appeared under Solar Knight. \"In this time of need, I call upon my monsters through this next level of summoning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is!\" Yuya cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monster allies!\" A portal opened above me, out of which leapt three bursts of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Carer!\" The Level 4 smiled upon returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Trickster!\" The Level 3 cackled with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the chained heart of my resolve!

HAHAHAHA!\" Katsu laughed maniacally. \"So you Special Summoned your monsters back! Big deal! El Shaddoll Construct has a second effect!

Attack his El Shaddoll Construct!\" Wanderer nodded before running towards Construct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't do that!\" Tatsuya panicked. \"You'll lose all your Life Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call off the attack!\" Futoshi yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've lost it!\" Katsu cackled. \"Destroy your own monster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no intention of doing that!\" I stated. \"I activate Lunar Knight's Pendulum Effect! During the Battle Phase, I can remove from play one Trap from my Graveyard to activate it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trap activation from the Graveyard!?\" He recoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose the one you destroyed with Shaddoll Dragon's effect! Crescent Reversal!\" Lunar Knight swung his sword in an arc, creating a golden ring out of which emerged the Trap card depicting several Timestream monsters celebrating with confetti, streamers, balloons and cake. \"Party Time! For each Timestream monster on my field, my opponents monsters lose 300 ATK until the End Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" He stepped back in horrid realisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Carer, Trickster, and Wanderer, I have three Timestream monsters! So your monsters lose 900 ATK!\" Construct and Squamata's ATK's dropped to 1400 and 400.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's enough!\" Yuzu cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikkei! Timestream Wanderer!\" Pulling back its scarf arm, Wanderer punched Construct in the midsection, his 'fist' exploding straight through the puppet master and causing it to collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsu's LP: 1850<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Yavix! Wrap up this Duel!\" I cried, pointing forward. \"Sealed Energy!\" Yavix wrapped its right bandage arm around Squamata, holding it up to eye level before encasing it in a red sphere of energy that exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Nonononono!\" Katsu screamed. \"I can't! I can't lose to you!\" The impact blasted him clean off of his feet and sent him crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatsu's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot: WIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew.\" I sighed as I sat down with the Solid Vision around me fading away. \"That was too close for comfort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\" My group of friends ran up to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot-oniichan! That was so amazing!\" Ayu cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gave me such shivers!\" Futoshi added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot, you Pendulum Summoning was awesome!\" Yuya smiled. \"You've really come a long way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks Yuya.\" I said as I accepted his help up. \"But I know I still have even further to go before I can use Pendulum Summoning like you can.\" </span></div></div>",

I looked everywhere whilst running, until I saw a huge group of icicles circling around each other, making the shape of an enormous crown, and there was one wedged in the back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It's all I've got!' I made a diving leap for the card and grabbed it just in time. I looked at it...and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquamata rammed into me, smashing me against the diamonds and sending me slumping to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\" Everyone cried as the Action Card fluttered out of my hand and into Katsu's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Transparent...bad luck.\" He stated mockingly before tossing the card away. \"Well, your ace monster is gone, no cards on the field and only one in your hand. I've practically won this Duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...Not yet.\" I grunted, forcing myself to my feet. \"Not while, I still have at least one more card in my deck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Stop delluding yourself! Don't you get it!? Your strongest cards are gone! Your finished!\" He grinned madly as he talked. \"You can only rely on the strongest cards in the end! And when they're gone your practically finished! To truly be stronger, you have to take everything your opponent can throw at you and crush it! Anything less is a third rate Duel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him angrily as he spoke, my rage towards him building. \"...If my strongest isn't good enough...\" I grabbed the card. \"Then I'll just have to surpass myself and try again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" He shrugged. \"Just get your turn over with so I can finish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My turn!...DRAW!\" I drew the card, and looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This card...' As I looked at it, it seemed to give off a faint glow, and the card in my other hand seemed to be resonating with it. '...I understand...I know how to become stronger!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may think that the strongest is all that counts.\" I said. \"But I believe in all my cards! I'll show you my trust in them now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cards in my hand now gave off a brilliant, blinding glow. \"Gah!\" Katsu gasped, shielding his eyes. \"What is that light!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's pendant began to glow as well. \"Huh?\" He looked at it in confusion. \"Is this...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, using the Scale 1 Lunar Knight, and the Scale 8 Solar Knight, set the Pendulum Scale!\" I declared, placing them on either end of my Duel Disk's blade, causing the word 'PENDULUM' to appear on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar Knight, Level 6, Warrior, Water, ATK: 2300 DEF: 1200, Pendulum Scale 1<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolar Knight, Level 2, Warrior, Fire, ATK: 1000 DEF: 800, Pendulum Scale 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two monsters rose up either side of me. Lunar knight was in light and dark blue armour with a curving yellow sword to look like a crescent moon, whereas Solar Knight's armour was orange and red, and he was holding a lance and a sun shaped shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I am able to summon Level 2 to 7 monsters simultaneously!\" A '1' appeared under Lunar Knight, and an '8' appeared under Solar Knight. \"In this time of need, I call upon my monsters through this next level of summoning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is!\" Yuya cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monster allies!\" A portal opened above me, out of which leapt three bursts of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Carer!\" The Level 4 smiled upon returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Trickster!\" The Level 3 cackled with a bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the chained heart of my resolve! Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior!\" The monster towered over the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Impossible!\" Katsu stammered. \"All those monsters were gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yavix's second effect activates!\" I continued. \"When it is Special Summoned, all monsters my opponents control lose 500 ATK and DEF until the End Phase!\" Construct and Squamata's ATK's dropped to 2300 and 1300 respectively. \"And since Carer was Special Summoned, I get to draw a card!\" I drew one from my Deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Heh...heheh...hahahaha! HAHAHAHA!\" Katsu laughed maniacally. \"So you Special Summoned your monsters back! Big deal! El Shaddoll Construct has a second effect! When it battles a Special Summoned monster, that monster is destroyed before damage is dealt! All of your monsters are USELESS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at him. \"Don't you dare call my monsters useless, I'm going to show you how each one is important! I summon Timestream Wanderer!\" The most frequent of my monsters so far appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1600 ATK? Like that will do anything! Just stop struggling and admit defeat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase!\" I continued. \"Wanderer!

Draw!\" She drew a card and jumped on a rising platform as I landed on a giant cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Now to see what Deck she uses...' I waited in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm going to Special Summon a monster to your side of the field!\" She declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!?\" We all facefaulted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is she giving Elliot a monster?\" Yuzu thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buuut I'm gonna have to release your bat and mage to give it to you.\" My two monsters panicked as they faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mage! Vamp!\" I cried as my monsters disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's my monster! Lava Golem!\" Suddenly a cage formed around me and rose up, as Lava Golem was summoned to my field in Attack Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She just gave Elliot a monster with 3000 attack!\" Futoshi stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...but this is bad.\" Everyone looked at Yuya in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit...Lava Golem...of all monsters.\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Don't you like him? He's a favourite of mine!\" She smiled. \"I'll set two cards and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh...I have no choice...\"My turn! Draw!\" Suddenly magma dripped on the cage, and heated it up red hot. \"Yaaaah! Owchowchowchowch!\" As the cage cooled down, I steadied myself and covered my heat injured face, it felt hot to the touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Forgot to mention, as long as you have Lava Golem, you'll take 700 points of damage each Standby Phase.\" Asako smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot-oniichan!\" Ayu called desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad, as long as Elliot has Lava Golem, he'll keep taking damage!\" Yuzu realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah...\" I looked up. \"I need to win this Duel, so I've gotta get rid of this Lava Golem! Maybe with an Action Card.\" I rattled the cage bars, but they wouldn't budge. \"Hey! Lava Golem! I need you to move so we can find Action Cards!\" But the monster stayed where it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like it's quite happy where it is.\" Asako noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crud...fine, I'll figure out a way without Action Cards!\" I looked at my hand, and noticed the Trap I just drew. 'Wait...this is perfect! But first...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Timestream Assassin!\" A monster with a sphere head, lean body, noodle legs and boot-like feet emerged. It was mostly red in colour, with silver outlines, its blue eyes gleamed under it's black bandanna, and on its back was a clock symbol making it look like a backpack of sorts. But the most notable thing was its arms, from shoulder to wrist they were normal, but where its hand should be was a long silver needle each instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Assassin, Level 4, Fiend, Wind, ATK: 1700 DEF: 700, Pendulum Scale 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssassin looked at my predicament and snickered. \"Hey! What are you laughing at?\" He turned away with feigned indifference. \"Nevermind...Battle Phase! Lava Golem! Attack Asako directly!\" The monster roared before creating a magma meteor between its hands before tossing it at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! He's putting Lava Golem's power to work!\" Tatsuya cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hope it hits.\" Sora reminded them before popping a jelly sweet in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my Trap! Waboku!\" I cursed in my head as the card flipped up. \"Now for the rest of this Battle Phase I don't take any damage!\" Lava Golem's attack crashed into an invisible shield, breaking apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like I don't have a choice...\"I set a card and end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot couldn't do any damage, even with Lava Golem...\" Yuya mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would make sense for her to put down a strong defence right after giving her opponent a powerful monster.\" Sora reasoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" She said. \"Okay Elliot! I'm gonna give you another present!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh joy...\" I said with half-lidded eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Special Summon Grinder Golem to your field in Attack Mode!\" A large heavily weaponised mecha golem appeared next to Lava Golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another monster with 3000 ATK.\" Yuzu stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the catch with this one?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just that I get to Special Summon two Grinder Tokens to my field in Attack Mode.\" Two miniature versions of Grinder Golem appeared next to her, with 0 ATK!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those won't lower damage at all!\" Ayu pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next...\" Asako started running!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going for an Action Card!\" I realised. \"Assassin! Grinder Golem! Block her!\" Assassin nodded and sped off, but GG didn't move. \"You too!? Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Asako ran Assassin ran beside her. \"Your pretty persistent.\" Asako said, and Assassin, lacking a visible mouth, turned its eyes up in a smirk. The two jumped and weaved around each other, chasing nothing, but in the end she grabbed an Action Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try.\" She smirked. \"I activate CTRL Position! It switches the battle positions of all my monsters!\" The two tokens switched to 0 DEF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW she's got a defence.\" Futoshi sighed, causing Ayu to pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end my turn at that. Your move, and you know what that means.\" She winked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in determination. \"Yeah, I do. My turn! Draw!\" As I drew the card lava fell on the cage and superheated it again. \"Gaaaaah!\" The unbearable heat oppressed me and forced me to my knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\" Everyone gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed the cage bars to steady myself. \"B...Battle Phase! Timestream Assassin! Attack that Grinder Token! Quick Cut!\" Surprised by the quick recovery, Asako only stared as Assassin's needle arms shined with energy before cutting the Grinder Token into several pieces.</span></div></div>",

Your attack is blocked!\" The swirling red shield protected her from Grinder Golem's onslaught. \"Phew...that was too close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...I activate my Continuos Trap! Bounceback!\" The card depicted several low-level monsters flailing around in a panic after being bounced off of a huge trampoline. \"Once per turn, during my turn only, I can return a face up card on my side of the field to it's owners hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Asako said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I return Lava Golem to your hand!\" The cage opened and I jumped out just as the monster jumped onto a giant trampoline, bouncing up and turning back into a card that fell into Asako's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! He got rid of Lava Golem!\" Yuya smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's pretty smart, Elliot.\" She praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, thanks.\" I smiled. \"Now I summon Timestream Sprout!\" A little spherical light brown seed popped up, a small green two leaved sprout grew out of its head, two small leaves acted as arms, and it had a small mouth with cute black dots for eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Sprout, Level 1, Plant, Earth, ATK: 0 DEF: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when this little guy is summoned, I can bring out his buddies!\" Two cards jutted out from my Deck. \"I Special Summon two more Timestream Sprouts in Defense Mode!\" Two more appeared, the three happily dancing together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're so cute!\" Ayu approved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is he doing!?\" Yuzu panicked, startling the three kids. \"With those monsters on the field, she can summon Lava Golem again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end my turn there.\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" She shrugged. \"My turn, Draw! Now I'm going to tribute your two Defence Position Timestream Sprouts to Special Summon Lava Golem to your field!\" As two of my cute little sprouts vanished I was once again trapped in Lava Golem's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Elliot.\" She sighed as she picked up an Action Card. \"I'm sorry, but with the card I just drew, I'm gonna have to take those monsters back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, just do what you gotta do.\" I waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Owner's Seal to return all monsters to the correct field!\" I Ianded on my feet as Lava and Grinder Golem disappeared, before appearing on her field with Asako inside Lava Golem's cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now she has the two 3000 ATK monsters!\" Yuzu yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate the Equip Spell Vicious Claw!\" The card appeared. \"Equipped to a monster, it gives 300 extra ATK points! So I think I'll give it to Grinder Golem.\" The new weapon appeared on GG's left arm, boosting it's ATK to 3300.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Lava Golem! Attack Timestream Sprout!\" The Golem roared before hurling it's magma meteor at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that attack hits, it's all over!\" Yuya said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet!\" I proclaimed. \"Activate Counter Trap! Defence Draw! With this I take no battle damage from this attack!\" I shielded myself as the meteor crashed into and destroyed Sprout. \"Then I draw a card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty clever.\" She praised. \"But I can still deal damage to you! Grinder Golem! Attack his Timestream Assassin!\" The two monsters clashed in a frenzied blur of weaponry, but Assassin was overpowered and destroyed, sending me tumbling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Continuous Spell Ally Shield!\" The card showed a red figure and a blue figure shaking hands with a barrier in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised an eyebrow. \"So what does it do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait and see.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I hate it when they do that in the anime.' I sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with that, I end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least he's safe...\" Ayu sighed in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" I jumped on a platform as it hovered past. \"I activate Pot of Avarice from my hand! With this I return 5 monsters in my Graveyard to my Deck, and then I get to draw 2 cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you summon those Timestream Sprouts just to activate Pot of Avarice?\" Asako asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" I confirmed. \"It was a little risky, but I thought you'd find a way to get rid of my monsters. I add Timestream Mage, Vamp and the three Sprouts to my Deck.\" I happily shuffled my monsters into my deck, before drawing 2 cards. \"And hey! Look who I drew! It's Lunar Knight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes!\" The three kids cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, using the Scale 1 Lunar Knight, and the Scale 8 Solar Knight, set the Pendulum Scale!\" Placing the cards on either side of my Duel Disk's blade, the word 'PENDULUM' appeared and the two monsters rose up either side of me. \"Now I can summon Level 2 to 7 monsters simultaneously!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can use that too!?\" My opponent gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this time of need, I call upon my monsters through this next level of summoning! Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monster ally!\" A red streak of light shot out of the overhead portal. \"Timestream Assassin!\" The monster reappeared in ATK position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That's the only monster your gonna summon?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I chose Assassin because of his effect.\" I said as my monster stood gangster style. \"If Assassin is the only monster on my field, it can attack directly! Ikkei, Assassin! Quick Cut!\" the monster charged forward, it's needle arms glowing with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't! I activate the Action Spell Avoid to negate your attack!\" Lava Golem actually moved for once, out of the way of Assassin's attack, who sent a hateful glare it's way before jumping back to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case I'll set a card and end my turn.\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn then. Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now you take damage from Lava Golem's effect!\" I reminded her as lava began to ooze onto the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, not quite!\" She rebuffed. \"Now Ally Shield activates! When I would take effect damage from my own monster, it's reduced to 0!\" The lava evaporated before it landed on the cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she even has measures for Lava Golem's effect.\" Sora noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Grinder Golem! Attack Timestream Assassin!\" The huge metal monster charged once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Lunar Knight's Pendulum effect!\" I pointed forward. \"Once per turn, I can remove from play a Trap in my Graveyard to activate it! I choose Defence Draw to prevent me from taking Battle Damage! Crescent Reversal!\" Lunar Knight created a golden ring out of which appeared Impenetrable Attack, which shielded me as Assassin was destroyed again. \"And now I can draw again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good move. But now you have no monsters! Lava Golem!\" Attack him directly!\" Now close enough, Lava Golem threw its magmary fist at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I activate my Trap, Impenetrable Attack! It reduces Battle Damage I take to 0 until the End Phase!\" An invisible wall blocked the attack, letting me sigh in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set a card and end my turn.\" Asako finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shakily stood up. \"My turn! Draw!\" I looked at the card, examining the rest of my hand and briefly formulating a plan. \"And now, I Pendulum Summon! Return, Timestream Assassin!\" My monster once again returned to my side. \"Battle Phase! Attack directly, Timestream Assassin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssassin nodded as its needles glowed before charging at Lava Golem and swiftly slashing the Asako in it's cage, knocking her to the back of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsako's LP: 2300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! He's finally done some damage!\" Yuya smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's still at a disadvantage.\" Sora pointed out. \"So whatcha gonna do now, Elliot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was pretty good.\" Asako admitted. \"But...\" Grinder Golem then grabbed an Action Card and gave it to her! \"I activate Recovery Disc! It gives me 1000 Life Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsako's LP: 3300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So she makes up for not being able to move with her monsters getting her cards...' I thought. \"I activate the effect of Bounceback to return Lunar Knight to my hand!\" Lunar Knight bounced off the trampoline and into my hands as a card. \"Then with my Scale 3 Timestream Carer, I reset the Pendulum Scale!\" Carer took Lunar Knight's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was the point of that?\" Tatsuya wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I activate the Spell Card, One Last Stand!\" The card depicted a battle weary warrior facing a huge army alone. \"I can only activate this card when I have one monster on the field. That monster cannot be destroyed by battle or card effects, and I take no battle damage involving that monster! However during my next Standby Phase it is destroyed.\" Assassin gained a powerful blue aura. \"I set a card and end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very honourable.\" Asako nodded. \"My turn! Draw! Due to Ally Shield I take no effect damage from Lava Golem!\" The lava evaporated again. \"Now I activate the Equip Spell Cursed Crown!\" The card depicted a black crown with red gemstones on it. \"And I'll equip it to Timestream Assassin!\" The crown materialised on Assassin's head, who tried to prise it off, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A monster equipped with Cursed Crown is moved to my side of the field during my turn, but it can't attack or activate it's effect.\" Assassin's eyes glowed red as it walked zombie-like next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Elliot's wide open!\" Yuzu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Grinder Golem! Attack Elliot directly and end this!\" Grinder Golem charged forward, weaponry ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for Plan B! Activate Counter Trap! Milisecond Save!\" The card showed Destiny Hero Dogma defending a Kuriboh from an attack. \"When an opponents monster attacks me directly, and my opponent has 2 or more monsters, I can end the Battle Phase!\" The card glowed brightly, halting Grinder Golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I can add one monster from my Deck to my hand!\" I drew the specific card. \"I choose Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since I have two, I'll draw two. Now I'll set a card and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now Assassin returns to my field!\" Assassin blinked out of its hypnosis and ran back to my side. \"My turn! Draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Timestream Assassin is destroyed via the effect of One Last Stand!\" Asako said before it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but during the Standby Phase Timestream Carer's effect is activated! I gain 400 Life Points!\" Carer createda a ball of green energy that floated down and burst over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll Pendulum Summon again! Come forth! Timestream Assassin! Lunar Knight! And the chained heart of my resolve! Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior!\" My three monsters appeared, with me jumping on Yavix's shoulder. \"Yavix's effect activates! When it's Special Summoned, all monsters my opponent controls lose 500 ATK and DEF until the End Phase!\" Lava Golem's ATK dropped to 2500 whilst Grinder Golem's dropped to 2800.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...\" I grabbed an Action Card. \"I activate ATK Virus! With this all your monsters lose 1000 ATK points until the End Phase!\" The card took its effect and dropped the two monsters to 1500 and 1800 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Battle!\" The three children cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Timestream Assassin! Attack Lava Golem! Quick Cut!\" Assassin wall jumped between two buildings, falling down and cutting the monster in two, making Asako fall out of its cage before it exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsako's LP: 3100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yavix! Attack Grinder Golem! Sealed Energy!\" Yavix wrapped GG in its bandage arms, encasing it in red energy before making it explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsako's LP: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicious Claw's effect activates!\" Asako cried. \"By returning it to the hand, I can negate a monsters destruction by battle!\" The smoke cleared to reveal an intact Grinder Golem with 1500 ATK. \"Then I can destroy one monster, except the one that attacked, and destroy it to inflict 600 damage to my opponent! I choose to destroy Lunar Knight!\" A razor sharp claw launched towards my monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you!\" I cried, grabbing an Action Card. \"I activate Mirror Barrier to prevent it's destruction by card effect!\" A barrier appeared around Lunar Knight, blocking the claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vicious Claw's third effect! An Evil Token is now Special Summoned to your side of the field!\" a hideous looking monster appeared on my side of the field with 2500 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giving me another monster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. I activate the Continuos Trap Remove Brainwashing!\" A Trap unrecognizable to me flipped up. \"With this card face up on the field, all monsters return to their original owners, and that includes my Evil Token.\" The monster stomped over to her field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crud, I can't destroy that one with Yavix's attack done.\" I mumbled. \"But...now Lunar Knight! Attack Grinder Golem! Moonlight Mirage!\" Lunar Knight drew his sword and dashed past GG, a few seconds passed before the monster burst into pieces and exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsako's LP: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that I'll end my turn.\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" Asako cried. \"I equip my Evil Token with Vicious Claw!\" The monsters attack was boosted to 2800. \"Battle! Attack Assassin!\" Evil Token roared before charging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Solar Knight's Pendulum Effect!\" I pointed upward. \"When an opponents monster declares an attack, I choose the attack target! I switch the attack to Yavix!\" Solar Knight's shield shone like a spotlight on Yavix, catching Evil Token's attention and making it destroy my ace instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be an expert on defence or something.\" she commented. \"I set a card and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn! Draw!\" I looked at the card and smiled. \"Carer's effect gives me 400 Life Points!\" I reminded her as my LP was boosted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate Mystical Space Typhoon to destroy Vicious Claw!\" The Equip Spell was destroyed in a vicious twister. \"Next I activate Lunar Knight's effect! I can remove a Spell in my Graveyard from play to activate it, as long as it's not an Action Card. I remove the Mystical Space Typhoon in my Graveyard to activate it's effect and destroy your set card!\" A second Waboku flipped up before it was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Pendulum Summon! Revive, Yavix!\" The monster appeared once more. \"Battle! Yavix! Attack Evil Token! Sealed Energy!\" Yavix's bandages stretched towards Evil Token.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going down that easily!\" She exclaimed, grabbing an Action Card. \"I activate Firewall to end your Battle Phase!\" A literal wall of fire blocked Yavix's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll end my turn.\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting so intense!\" Sora smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many shivers!\" Futoshi agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's incredible how strong they both are.\" Yuzu noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I love watching this Duel! I just love it!\" Yuya grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!...It seems I have no choice...I switch Evil Token to Defence Mode and set a monster. Then I activate the Continuos Spell Little Miracle!\" The card depicted a Kuribon bathed in a golden light. \"Now I'll end my turn.\" She said, the actions being shown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, my turn! Draw! Timestream Carer's effect activates!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And straight to Battle Phase! Yavix! Attack Evil Token with Sealed Energy!\" Finally, Evil Token was destroyed in a burst of red energy. \"Lunar Knight! Attack her set monster! Moonlight Mirage!\" Lunar Knight slashed through the set card, making it disappear in a burst of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That monster was Miracle Flipper!\" She declared. \"Now Little Miracle activates! When a monster with 500 or less ATK is destroyed, the Battle Phase ends!\" My monsters backed off a bit to show this. \"And now Miracle Flipper's effect activates! At the end of the Battle Phase, it's Special Summoned to your field!\" Suddenly the monster appeared in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But with Remove Brainwashing on the field, it's returned to my side!\" The monster reappeared on her field in DEF Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit...does this mean-?\" I started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. With these three cards on the field, Miracle Flipper becomes the ultimate defence! I'm untouchable!\" She proclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gritted my teeth. \"I...end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine then! Draw!\" She looked at the card and smiled. \"I release Yavix and Lunar Knight to Special Summon Lava Golem! And with Remove Brainwashing it's on my side of the field!\" My two strong monsters disappeared to be replaced by Lava Golem, who immediately went over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Lava Golem! Attack Timestream Assassin!\" The huge magma monster drowned my little one with it's own body, leaving me to stumble back from the intense heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll end my turn.\" She finished, before sighing. \"Well, looks like I've lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh?\" I grunted, standing up. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This turn, you'll Pendulum Summon back your Timestream Assassin, and with it as the only monster on your field, it'll be able to attack me directly and wipe out the rest of my Life Points.\" She said. \"And I can't see any more Action Cards around, so...yeah...but you're an awesome Duelist! So thank you for Dueling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at her for a moment, looking beyond the plastered sense of congratulations in her eyes to see the sense of disappointment at the thought of a...plain...loss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to stare at her, until I nodded. \"My turn...draw. I gain 400 Life Points via Carer's effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will now Pendulum Summon...one more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't feel good anymore...\" Ayu admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it doesn't feel like a proper victory.\" Sora stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Yuya looked on a bit sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall now Pendulum Summon...all of my monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NANI!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA big smile broke out on my face. \"Assassin! Lunar! Yavix! Revive!\" My three monsters appeared once more. \"Plus Wanderer! From my hand!\" The monster appeared and landed next to me. \"And now I can Special Summon Timestream Vamp!\" The little monster appeared and landed on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-Why have you summoned all your monsters?\" Asako said, flustered. \"Y-You could have won just by summoning Assassin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but...\" I smiled at my monsters. \"I don't want you to remember the conclusion of this Duel...as something that bypasses the hard work you've put into your strategies. I'm gonna face them head on and challenge myself! So that you can remember the end of this duel with a smile, knowing it was hard for me to conquer your skills!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot...\" She breathed in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Yavix is Special Summoned, my opponents monsters ATK and DEF drop by 500!\" Lava Golem's ATK dropped to 2500, whilst Miracle Flipper's DEF dropped to 0. </span></div></div>",

So we walked and talked for a bit on how things were getting on, until we sat down on a bench in front of a park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gongenzaka, how many more duels until you have a 60% win rate?\" I asked out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"I, the manly Gongenzaka, have finally gained a 60% win rate already! And how about you, Elliot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need one more win.\" I admitted. \"I'm so nervous...being so close...increases the fear of failure at the last hurdle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you believe in the strength that your deck gives you, then you have no reason to be afraid.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, that's what your Steadfast Dueling is all about, isn't it?\" He nodded. \"There are types of dueling too...your Steadfast Dueling, Yuya's Entertainment Dueling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuya always wants to make the people watching his Duels happy.\" Gongenzaka commented. \"That matches his style of Dueling, the one inherited from his father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His father?\" I echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you have not been told, have you? Then I, the manly Gongenzaka, shall explain. Three years ago, Yuya's father was scheduled to Duel a Duelist known as Strong Ishijima for the Championship Title. However, he did not show up, and has not been seen since, others criticize Yuya's father for being a coward, and I believe that Yuya never got over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, he is still the enigmatic and cheerful friend I shall always remember him as, the Duelist he wishes to be seen as.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that made me think. \"What kind of Duelist do I truly want to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you can only find that out with what style of Duel you wish to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What is it then? How will I know which one is right for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGongenzaka smiled and patted me on the shoulder. \"You will find it, if you believe you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"Arigatou, Gongenzaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both stood up. \"The sun is setting.\" He stated. \"I must return to my Dojo. Elliot, may we meet in the Miami Championship!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\" I nodded as we shook hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked through the harbor on my way back to the Sekaki residence, when my Duel Disk started ringing (Oh yeah, they're phones too.) so I picked up. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Elliot!\" Yuya's voice came down the line. \"Where are you? It's getting kinda late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked over the seawater to the black starry sky, you'd never get stars like that in my world. \"I'm now walking back, I should be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but hurry! Mum made chicken and noodles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chicken and noodles!?\" I gasped. \"I'll be right there!\" I hung up and immediately started sprinting. \"I just gotta get back now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I noticed something out of the corner of my eye and slowed slightly. 'Huh? What was that?' Looking around, I thought I saw it again, in the shape of a person. 'Uh-oh...am I being stalked or something?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefensively, I scanned the area until I saw him again, shadowed inbetween two warehouses. Though I couldn't see his face, I could make out purple hair, a tattered suit, and a black tie.</span></div></div>",

LDS has cameras situated throughout the city, except for this area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Private, huh?\" I crossed my arms. \"Listen, I don't know what your game is, but you being around is seriously messing with my friend Yuzu's head.

That's it? Your just gonna leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped briefly. \"Yes, if you are not my enemy, but if I am unaware if your my friend or not, it's wrong of me to get involved. And by the way, you didn't say 'Nani'.\" He rhen continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it right there!\" I activated my Duel Disk. \"Duel me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped and looked at me. \"Why would I?

I thought, remembering the Wiki. 'If that's the case, he must be wanting to summon Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon...man I wish I had that monster, it looks so badass...on the matter at hand though, maybe I can use his own ace's strength against him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Timestream Wyvern from my hand!\" A spinning circle of blue energy appeared, that burst open into a wyvern with a black metallic body with light blue energy flowing along it, and being used as substitute for the leathery skin that made up its wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Wyvern, Level 3, Dragon, Fire, ATK: 1300 DEF: 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Timestream Wryvern is successfully Normal Summoned, I can Special Summon a Level 3 monster from my Deck in attack position, under the condition that it cannot attack, change it's battle position, or be used as a Synchro Material monster. I choose Timestream Trickster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster appeared in ATK position with a creepy cackle. \"Now I activate Tricksterls effect! His dice roll will determine the Level of the monster I will summon from my Deck! Go dice roll!\" Trickster created his dice before throwing it, boubcing a few times before resting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A 2? Not quite what I was looking for...\" I admitted. \"But I can work with this! I Special Summon Timestream Mage in defense position!\" My little chibi mage appeared crossing her staffs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Battle Phase! Timestream Wyvern! Attack him directly!\" The monster screeched before flying off and divebombing Yuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate a Trap card in my Graveyard.\" I knew it...\"When I am targeted for a direct attack, I can Special Summon The Phantom Knights of Shadow Veil as a Level 4 monster in Defense Mode, I choose all three in my Graveyard.\" The three Traps appeared as monsters with 400 DEF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Timestream Wyvern will destroy one of them!\" I declared as my monster smashed into the first one, destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When it is destroyed as a monster, it is removed from play.\" Yuto stated as he sent the card to his removed from play zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set 2 cards and end my turn.\" I finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn.\" Yuto said as he drew. \"I use my two Level 4 Phantom Knights of Shadow Veil, to construct the Overlay Network!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here it comes...' I thought as the two monsters turned into purple energy and dived into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Formed from pitch black darkness, to fight those foolish enough to oppose with its treacherous fangs! Descend now! Xyz Summon! Rank 4! Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!\" The incredible monster roared as it appeared with 2500 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that monster sure is intimidating up close...\" I admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon! Attack Timestream Trickster! Revolt Lightning!\" The mighty dragon charged with electrified wings and fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you!\" I cried. \"Activate Trap! Rallied Forces!\" The Trap from my Duel with Yuya flipped up. \"I can only activate this when I have three monsters and my opponent has less, but as long as I have more monsters then you, you can't attack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate another Spell in my Graveyard.\" He stated. \"Phantom Des Spear, by banishing it, the activation of your Trap is negated, and it is destroyed.\" My card promptly burst. \"Then you take 100 points of damage.\" The spear appeared and launched itself towards me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" I rolled away, the spear tearing the side of my shirt as it impaled the ground behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the attack continues!\" Yuto said as his dragon charged again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I just smiled. \"I thought you'd do that! I activate my other Trap, Defence Draw! I take no Battle Damage from this attack and I draw a card!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shielded myself as the Xyz Dragon exploded into Trickster, the force of the impact blew past me like a twister, forcing me to establish my ground and dig in my heels until the wind subsided and I could draw. 'What incredible power...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you anticipated my move...\" Yuto noted. \"I set a card and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn!\" I drew and looked at the card to find it was Solar Knight! \"Yes! Now I, using the Scale 1 Lunar Knight, and the Scale 8 Solar Knight, set the Pendulum Scale!\" The word 'PENDULUM' appeared as my monsters rose either side of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can summon monsters Level 2 to 7 simultaneously! Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monster allies!\" Two bursts of light jumped out of the portal. \"Timestream Trickster!\" The mischief maker reappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the chained heart of my resolve! Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior!\" My ace towered above my other three in Attack Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pendulum?\" Yuto echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet! I activate Star Changer to change Timestream Mage to Level 3! And using my Level 3 Timestream Wyvern, Trickster, and Mage, I build the Overlay network!\" The trio turned into three streams of energy, Wyvern red, Trickster purple, and Mage violet, before launching themselves into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sealed within the boundaries of time, emerge from your eternal prison to show your power! Breaking through the cracks in time, come forth! Xyz Summon! Rank 3! Timestream Dragon!\" The mighty dragon emerged and gave a deafening roar as three yellow comet-like lights swirled around it, with 2400 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xyz Summon?\" Yuto gasped. \"If you can use that Summoning, then we have no reason to fight!\" </span></div></div>",

Draw! I activate the Spell card Xyz Treasure, which allows me to draw a card for each Xyz monster on the field. With both of our dragons there are two, so I draw two cards.\" He drew and examined the two cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'C'mon...attack already!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's effect! By detaching an Xyz Material, I can select 1 Level 5 or higher monster my opponent controls and halve it's attack, then my monster gains attack equal to the amount lost, until the End Phase. Treason Discharge!\" Purpke lightning zapped out of Xyz Dragon's wings, binding Yavix and reducing his attack to 1350, whilst boosting it's own to 3850!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon will attack Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior! Revolt Lightning!\" Xyz Dragon charged again, this time at my defenseless Yavix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Solar Knight's Pendulum Effect! It can change the attack target of an attacking monster! Sunshine Shield!\" Solar Knight's shield shone a spotlight onto Timestream Dragon, making Yuto's monster changed direction, and the two monsters clashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now activate Timestream Dragon's effect! I remove 2 Xyz Materials to prevent it's destruction and reduce the Battle Damage to 0!\" The powerful clash broke apart as two of TD's comets disappeared. \"And now my opponent takes damage equal to their own monsters attack! Mirror Stream!\" TD roared as it launched several energy streams from it's wings towards Yuto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my Trap card! Phantom Lake!\" The Trap showed a light blue and violet fog swirling around a lake that looked suspiciously like the one from King Arthur. \"When I would take effect damage, it is reduced to 0.\" The attack just vanished into the Trap as it rippled like water!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then, the damage I would have taken is inflicted to my opponent.\" Suddenly a burst of blue and violet energy exploded out of the card towards me! I could only watch in horror as it slammed into me like a train and turned into a huge explosion. Pain shot throughout my whole body and my skin scraped against the ground as I felt myself get rocketed back from the impact, until I just felt myself lying face down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 50<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, I couldn't move, but eventually I gained feeling in my body again, and I groaned as I shakily and slowly stood back up, staggering around like I was drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your resolve is something to be praised.\" Yuto noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...It...doesn't matter...\" I panted. \"At...the End Phase...Xyz Dragon's...and Yavix's attacks...will return to normal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've still got that fire in your eyes.\" He continued to praise me. \"But that fire could burn you up with overconfidence, so I have to extinguish it, before I have to defeat you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...makes you think you...can do that?\" I demanded rather pathetically in my current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I activate the Equip Spell Rebellion Storm.\" The card depicted his ace monster in a storm of black clouds surrounded by purple lightning. \"By equipping it to Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon, it's ATK cannot be lowered by it's own effect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I end my turn. Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior's attack returns to normal, but Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's effect remains at 3850.\" Yavix returned to normal ATK, but Xyz Dragon did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What do I do now?' I thought. 'Even though I can activate Timestream Dragon's effect again...Xyz Dragon could just crush us next turn! How...can I possibly win in this situation?' I looked at my Deck. 'I have to...bet it on this draw...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My...turn...\" I panted. \"D...Draw!\" I shakily looked at the only new card in my hand. 'This...could it work...?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my Extra Deck, and I could feel something in it, calling out to me. '...Okay...I know what I have to do...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From my hand...\" I breathed. \"I activate the Spell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Polymerization!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!?\" A look I couldn't identify appeared on Yuto's face.</span></div></div>",

The burning soul of my resolve! Level 9! Yavix the Dragon Emperor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA burst of red flames emerged from the swirls. A long red scaled tail with two black spikes curved into a claw emerged, followed by two powerful hunched red scale legs with three giant white claws on each foot. The lean torso appeared next, where the scales turned black and expanded out more to give the appearance of armour, with two spikes jutting out in front of the shoulders just below the base of the neck. Two red scaled arms with five claws emerged, followed by large leathery orange wings with embers constantly flickering off of them. Finally a long heavily scaled neck emerged, followed by a sharp face and jaw filled with razor sharp teeth, three spikes jutting out of the back of the head with orange gemstones on the top of each, almost like a crown. Complete with piercing, emerald reptiliane eyes and a tattered brown cloak barely hanging off of it's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYavix the Dragon Emperor, Level 9, Dragon, Fire, ATK: 2900 DEF: 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Fusion Summon...using an Xyz monster!?\" Yuto cried in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase!\" I cried with renewed confidence. \"Yavix the Dragon Emperor will attack Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!\" My new dragon gave a deafening roar before swooping towards its opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yavix the Dragon Emperor's effect activates!\" I shouted. \"When it attacks, I can activate one of two effects! I can prevent card effects from being activated until the end of the Damage Step, but I'm going for the second choice! Where Yavix gains 1000 ATK points until the end of the Damage Step! Blazing Spirit!\" Yavix roared as it's body was set alight, it's crimson scales glowing brightly with power as it's attack was boosted to 3900.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go! Crimson Hell Claw!\" Yavix flew at Xyz right claw first, fire trailing out of it until it turned into a meteor of fire spearheaded by a crimson red blazing claw, the attack exploded into Xyz, and I shielded myself as the impact resounded for no doubt miles around. When I could finally look again, the very ground was on fire, and the cranes had been partially melted from the heat, yet Yuto stood seemingly unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuto's LP: 3950<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this...your power?\" Yuto asked as Yavix landed behind me, with it's attack back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't know.\" I admitted. \"But, I believe it's helped my monster achieved a new level in strength.\" \"Yavix roared in agreement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I see.\" Yuto mumbled. \"...Do you end your turn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do.\" I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's mine, I draw.\" He looked at the two cards in his hand. \"Elliot...I can't say I've learned little from this Duel, so I thank you for that. And I believe you could be vital to events about to come...but right now, in this Duel, I will only ask one question: will you surrender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" I called over the flickering flames. \"I can't lose! Not now that I have Yavix the Dragon Emperor! You can't make me quit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then please forgive me...\" He whispered. \"I summon the Phantom Knights of Rugged Glove!\" A really cool looking monster with 1000 ATK points appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!

New cards!\" I fanned them out, the majority being Timestream Cards, but with some other awesome Monsters, Spells and Traps as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" I stated to myself. \"With these, I can upgrade my Deck for the Championships! Right! Time to turn Timestream Force into Timestream Storm!\"...What? Oh like YOU'VE never named your Decks!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the first day of the Maiami Championships, me and Yuya got up at 5 a.m to go over each others Decks, before we headed off. We made it to the setting of the tournament where we met up with everyone else, I managed to see a few other people looking around too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all had to go out and wave to the crowd as Smiley introduced us and gave the openings, plus Yuya got to give a speech too! I could tell that he was setting himself a high bar, but I believe that he can make it easy, he's the main protagonist after all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out the Championship is split into three categories: Junior (which Ayu, Futoshi and Tatsuya were in), Junior Youth (me, Yuya, Yuzu and Gongenzaka) and Youth (...I've got nothing.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were each given a tournament ID to register in our Duel Disk's to match us up to our opponents, I was paired up with this guy named Nikara Uhige, but I wouldn't be facing him for a while. In the meantime though I got to watch Futoshi's match which he won, and I went off to get some food for us in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so what do Japenese eat during something like this? Squid? Is that too stereotypical?\" I walked into a corridor as I thought aloud. \"Rice balls? Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You having a fun conversation with yourself?\" I stopped and spun around to see a figure standing in the shadows, his face concealed by a hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Who are you!?\" I demanded. \"How did you get here!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not your problem.\" He stated. \"I'm just here to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can you stop creeping on me?\" I said with a half-lidded look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wamt me to stop 'observing', then no.\" He snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Do you have a grudge against me or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could say that.\" He shrugged, before pulling five cards out. \"Here ya go, early birthday present, catch.\" He tossed the cards at me, and I caught them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the front of the cards, and all I could see was white. \"These are all blank.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit, Sherlock. It's your job to put something worth using on 'em. Your heart will determine what those cards depict.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you tal...king...about...\" As I looked up, he had vanished, I ran forward and looked around both corners, but there was no sign of him. \"Who was that guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the five blank cards. \"'Your heart will determine what those cards depict?', I don't understand. There are so many things I don't understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI placed three of the blank cards in my Main Deck, and two in my Extra Deck, before sighing. \"I just don't wanna be left in the dark...but for the moment, looks like I'm walking blind.\" </span></div></div>",

But in any case, now it was Junior Youth matches! I was ecstatic over Yuzu, Yuya and Gongenzaka's victories, and pretty soon I'd be up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" I shuffled all my cards again. \"I've got a lot of good strategies down, now I just have to put them to use, if I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worried?\" I jumped at the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sora! Don't sneak up on me like that!\" I stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't mean to scare you.\" He smiled whilst eating a chocolate stick. \"Your up next y'know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I nodded. \"I have to get through!\" 'There won't be any safety nets here!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Sora shrugged it off. \"All you gotta do is win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" I said before sighing. 'Just gotta NOT screw up.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The next match in the Qualifiers of the Junior Youth round will now begin!\" Smiley announced to the cheers of the crowd. \"So let's meet our next two Duelists!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First we have another You Show Duel School member! Making it here with an impressive six win streak, user of the mysterious Timestream monsters, Elliot Zekaki!\" I walked out and waved around with a smile as the audience applauded, I tried to pick out any of my friends in the masses, but to no avail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And our second Duelist! From the Strongest Style Duel Dojo, a furious Dueler with mercilessly powerful monsters, winner of the True Duel Tournament, Nikara Uhige!\" A guy wearing neat black clothes and a bowler hat walked out, his red hair stuck out from beneath his hat, his eyes were shadowed by the brim, but I could see his smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm up against a tournament winner first? Greaaaat.' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let us determine the Action Field for this Duel!\" The giant card above us spun around until it stopped, depicting a desert with violet sand and floating pyramids. \"The choice is Psychic Desert!\" The cards depiction materialised around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duelists locked in battle!\" I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kicking the earth and dancing in the air alongside their monsters.\" Nikara continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They storm through this field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold, this is the newest and greatest evolution of Dueling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Action...\" Smiley held his fingers up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot vs. Nikara LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap the Action Cards dispersed and rained around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start.\" I stated. \"As I control no monsters, I can Normal Summon Timestream Guardian without releasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spherical floating rock with yellow energy flowing around it appeared, with an archaic clock symbol on the front, followed by two floating arms with the same energy, as well as four fingers for the ends of each. Another spherical rock with one yellow dot acting as an eye hovered above the main spherical one, whilst yellow crystals floated in a spinning circle underneath all of the components that made up an unconnected, floating body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Guardian, Level 5, Rock, Earth, ATK: 1800 DEF: 2200, Pendulum Scale 6<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then set 2 cards and end my turn.\" I finished, before I hopped on the 'back' of Guardian and clung on for dear life as we floated off to search for Action Cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn, draw.\" He smiled at his cards. \"First, I'll activate the Continuos Spell Card, Spiritual Forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" I gasped as weird looking trees suddenly started popping out of the sand all over the place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as I have Spiritual Forest in play, the first Beast, Beast-Warrior or Plant type monster I control that would be destroyed by battle isn't, every turn.\" He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Beast, Beast-Warrior or Plant?' I thought. 'Then what Deck could he use?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now summon Gazelle the King of Mythical Beasts!\" The recognisable monster appeared in front of him. \"Battle Phase! Gazelle will attack Timestream Guardian!\" The monster roared before it started running towards us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'With only 1500 ATK? He must be planning something!' \"I activate Timestream Guardian's effect! Once per turn, I can change it's Battle Position!\" Guardian's arm parts floated in front of it as it switched to DEF Position, making Gazelle bounce harmlessly off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikara's LP: 3300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh...I guess he didn't...' I sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set 2 cards and end my turn.\" He finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my go! Draw!\" I looked at my cards and nodded. \"I summon Timestream Carer in attack mode!\" The woman appeared, ready for battle. \"I then switch Guardian to attack mode!\" My monster came out of it's defensive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Timestream Carer will attack Gazelle! Serene Pulse!\" Carer threw a ball blue of energy at Gazelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't let you do that.\" He stated as he plucked an Action Card from one of his trees. \"I activate the Action Spell Avoid to negate your attack.\" His monster jumped out of the way of the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I have another monster! Timestream Guardian! Attack Gazelle!\" I held on tight as Guardian dashed forward and hit Gazelle with a palm thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikara's LP: 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Due to Spiritual Forest, Gazelle is not destroyed.\" Nikara reminded me as his monster landed next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end my turn on that.\" I finished. </span></div></div>",

Horn of the Phantom Beast!\" The Trap flipped up. \"Now this card is equipped to Rock-Lizard, giving it 800 additional attack points!\" Two golden horns appeared on Rock-Lizard, and whilst it looked stupid, it boosted it's ATK to 3000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That's not good...but I still have my Trap Card!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe plucked a card from the sand. \"I activate the Action Spell Psychic Suppression.\" The card showed a psychic focusing her powers. \"With this, I can select up to 2 Spell or Traps you control, then you can't activate them until the End Phase.\" My cards glowed before being buried beneath the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crud! I need an Action Card!\" We set off at twice the pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Nikara had got a third one! \"I now activate Mystic Mirage!\" This time the card showed a wobbly vision of an oasis. \"With this I can Special Summon 1 monster from my hand, however it can't attack nor activate it's effect, and it is returned to my hand during the End Phase. I choose my Phantom Beast Cross-Wing!\" A bird-like Beast-Warrior appeared with 1300 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate the Continuos Trap Beast Burst!\" The Trap depicted a red gorilla roaring with a powerful aura. \"Once per turn, I can send a Beast or Beast-Warrior I control to the Graveyard to increase another Beast or Beat-Warrior's ATK by the sent monsters ATK until the End Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!?\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I send Cross-Wing to the Graveyard to boost Rock-Lizard's attack by 1300!\" Cross Wing burst into red aura that was absorbed by Rock-Lizard, boosting it's attack to 4300! \"And whilst Cross-Wing is in the Graveyard, any Phantom Beast or Gazelle I control gains 300 ATK!\" Rock-Lizard roared again as it's attack was boosted to 4600!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible! Nikara has easily brought out a monster and boosted it to an astonishing 4600 ATK!\" Smiley announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Rock-Lizard will attack Timestream Carer!\" Rock-Lizard lowered it's horns and charged at my monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is bad! With my Trap cards out of use...!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attack hit with a tremendous explosion, both me and Guardian were sent flying back, skidding across the sand and rolling back until momentum finally gave in and stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Rock-Lizard's effect will activate now.\" I struggled to even get to my hands and knees as Nikara continued. \"When it destroys a monster by battle, my opponent takes 500 points of damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five...hundred?\" I said as I staggered to my feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it! Stone Storm!\" The stones on his monsters back launched off, and I could only cross my arms in a measly defence as they exploded around me, sending me skidding back once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end my turn at that.\" He finished. \"The effects of Beast Burst and Psychic Suppression end at this point.\" His monsters attack dropped to 3300, and my Traps rose out of the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable! In just one turn Nikara has done over 3000 points of damage to Elliot, AND kept a monster with 3300 ATK on the field! Will Elliot be able to recover!?\" Smiley yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shakily got up again, my limbs threatening to stop working. \"Ugh...I get it...you baited me into bringing out my monsters in attack position...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you fell for it.\" He smirked. \"It's all the same, once people get a little bit of confidence they think they're safe, when in actual fact they're most vulnerable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It's my turn!

I reveal my Timestream Wanderer to boost Guardian's attack by 1600!\" Guardian's attack was boosted to 3400.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's still not enough!\" The two monsters collided, with Guardian getting destroyed and me getting flattened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I still have my Rock-Lizard! Attack him directly!\" His behemoth of a monster charged horns first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my other Trap! Milisecond Save! With this I end the Battle Phase and add a monster to my hand!\" The monster stopped just before it reached me, and I drew. \"I add Lunar Knight to my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got lucky.\" He stated. \"But luck doesn't last forever. I end my turn, with Wild-Horn's attack returning to normal.\" It became 2300.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" I ran over to an Action Card and plucked it out of the sand. \"With this I can...I activate the Action Spell Telekinetic Tomb!\" The card depicted a coffin rising out of its tomb. \"I can now add a monster that is not in my hand or Deck to my hand! I choose the Timestream Guardian in my Extra Deck!\" The Extra Deck opened and I took out my monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I, with the Scale 1 Lunar Knight, and the Scale 6 Timestream Guardian, set the Pendulum Scale!\" The two monsters rose either side of me with the blade on my Duel Disk showing 'PENDULUM'. \"Now I may summon Level 3 to 5 monsters simultaneously!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it comes, folks! A Pendulum Summon!\" Smiley announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this time of need, I call upon my monsters through this next level of summoning! Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monster ally!\" A burst of light jumped out of the portal above me. \"Timestream Carer!\" The revived woman appeared in Defense Position. \"I end my turn at that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all? Fine by me! My turn!\" He drew and looked at the card. \"I summon my Phantom Beast Thunder-Pegasus!\" The two headed lightning monster appeared, it's attack boosting to 1300 due to the two Cross-Wing's. \"Now I activate Beast Burst to tribute Thunder-Pegasus and give its attack to Wild-Horn!\" Wild-Horn absorbed Thunder-Pegasus, boosting its attack to 3000. \"That's more then enough to defeat you! Wild-Horn! Attack his Carer and end this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Timestream Guardian's Pendulum Effect! Once per turn I can negate an attack! Go, Guard Statue!\" Guardian raised its individual arms and fingers, causing a statue of itself to rise out of the ground and shield Carer from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Nikara gaped. \"Why you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, if you had kept your Thunder-Pegasus in, you would've won.\" I noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth his eyes appeared, full of rage. \"Are you...mocking me!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? No I was just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" He shouted. \"Rock-Lizard will attack Carer!\" The result was the same as last time. \"Now you'll take 500 points of damage! Stone Storm!\" The stones launched again, and I was catapulted back into a tree, which i bashed off of and fell into the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikara regained his composure from that. \"I end my turn, now Wild-Horn's attack returns to normal.\" It dropped back to 2300.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to my hands and knees, shaking the sand off of me before standing up. 'If I don't draw the right card now, I'm finished! Please Deck, I need you!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" I drew overdramatically and looked at the card. \"...I see, I know you'll come through for me. I'm putting my trust in you! I set a monster and end my turn!\" The set monster appeared in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my turn! Draw! I'm going to end this! Rock-Lizard! Attack his set monster!\" His ace charged again, exploding into my monster. \"And now, take 500 points of damage! Stone Storm!\" The monster launched its armour parts into the debris smoke. \"I win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Sorry, not quite.\" The smoke cleared to reveal me, still with 100 Life Points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani? But, how!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The monster you attacked, was my Jackpot Vendor!\" The smoke cleared to reveal a red vending machine with wheels, it had two slot machine handles either side of it acting as arms, and its glass dome was big and spherical in order to contain the large array of all colour gumballs inside it. And painted as big as possible on the front of its glass dome was a giant red 7 with a gold edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackpot Vendor, Level 4, Machine, Light, ATK: 1400 DEF: 1500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't it destroyed!?\" Nikara damanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once per turn, Jackpot Vendor can't be destroyed by battle!\" I smiled as my monster did several donuts in celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy opponent gritted his teeth in anger. \"Wild-Horn! Destroy that pathetic excuse of a monster! And wipe out his Life Points!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI held my monster protectively. \"I activate Guardian's Pendulum Effect to negate your attack! Guard Statue!\" We were both shielded from the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you! I end my turn!\" He yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I-Oops! Hold on a second!\" Me and Jackpot Vendor ran up to the top of a pyramid. 'Let's see if this works!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everybody!\" I called. \"Now that it is my opponents End Phase, the second effect of my marvellous monster, Jackpot Vendor is activated!\" The monster next to me spun its handle arms in excitement. \"When a monster attacks it and it is still around at the End Phase, I gain Life Points equal to half the attack of the monster that attacked it first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say!?\" Nikara yelled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ikkei! Wonder Vending!\" Jackpot Vendor's handle turned three times, before its door opened and a red gumball popped out, it glowed briefly before bursting into an array of colours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1900 </span></div></div>",

I fuse my DARK-Type Timestream Trickster and my FIRE-Type Solar Knight!\" The two turned into purple and red fusing swirls. \"\"Emerging from the fires of hell, incinerate all with your black flames! Fusion Summon! Level 6! Burn 'em down! Hex Inferno!\" The intimidating monster appeared in ATK position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now release Timestream Carer and Wanderer to Advance Summon Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior!\" The two monsters disappeared to be replaced by Yavix in ATK position. \"As he was Advance Summoned, you can't activate card effects until the End Phase! I now activate Hex Inferno's effect! I pay 900 Life Points...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To reduce Rock-Lizard's attack by 1800!\" My monster covered Rock-Lizard in a red aura, reducing it's attack to 1000.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you! Youyouyouyou!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Yavix will attack Wild-Horn! Sealed Energy!\" Yavix binded Wild-Horn with its bandage arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arrrgh! I can't activate Thunder-Pegasus' effect from the Graveyard!\" Nikara squeezed his own head in frustration as Yavix destroyed his monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikara's LP: 2600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I attack Rock-Lizard with Hex Inferno! Dark Incineration!\" My Fusion monster made his ace explode with black fire, flooring Nikara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikara's LP: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jackpot Vendor will attack you directly! Super Seven!\" The 7 on Jackpot Vendor's glass dome glowed brightly before it blasted him with a giant 7 laser, sending him crashing back into the sand with just his legs sticking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikara's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot: WIN<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the Duel has been decided! The winner is Elliot Zekaki!\" Smiley announbced to the cheer of the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it! We won our first round!\" I jumped up happily. \"You really turned it around, Jackpot Vendor! Arigatou!\" The monster beeped happily before all the Solid Vision faded away, and I noticed Nikara. \"Nikara! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I lost...\" He muttered into the ground. \"This is humiliating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, oi, was winning really that important to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As it was the first round, yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Listen, I'm sorry you lost, but c'mon, if you feel down about it, it's not gonna get any better.\" I offered him a hand. \"You just gotta pick yourself back up again.\" At least, I think that's something Yuya would say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up at me, and sighed. \"...Fine.\" He took my hand and I helped him up. \"Guess I can try again another time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both waved to the tournament audience, who cheered ferom the result. \"See? With both of us waving, the audience is even happier!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suppose so.\" He gave a hint of a smile, as we both continued waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot-oniichan!\" Ayu cheered as she hugged me. \"You were so cool out there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such amazing shivers!\" Futoshi agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Dueled honourably, and willfully.\" Gongenzaka commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you tried Entertainment Dueling too!\" Yuya smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, did anyone actually here that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...we at the front did?\" Yuya confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it.\" I sweatdropped. \"Sora! You'll be up soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He nodded. \"And don't worry, I'm gonna give you guys an awesome Entertainment Duel!\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Things had really been screwing with me lately. It started when we watched Sora's match against Shun, it was weird enough when the main setting of ZEXAL appeared as the Action Field, but then this lead to those two talking about a war, then everything started going to hell...I can't describe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we waited for Sora putside the hospital, he escaped somehow, and I spent the next half hour running all over Maiaimi looking for him! Yuzu eventually called me to say she had found Yuya passed out, and we all regrouped to help him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe've been waiting two days now, and Yuya still hasn't woken up, I keep telling myself he's the 'main protagonist' and that he'll be alright, but it still worries me damnit!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the two days of waiting for Yuya's recovery, I tried to make heads or tails of the crazy stuff that had been going on through the Wiki, and it just left me more confused! There are 4 dimensions!? What the hell!? Is Synchro and Fusion 5D's and GX or something!? And Fusion, therefore Sora is evil!? It's just so aggravating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in any case, here was my current situation, which I had taken to routine in anticipation for Yoko and Yuzu to walk out and tell me he's finally awake. As I waited patiently, Yoko came out, and I stood up in hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's awake.\" She confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" I cheered. \"That's awesome! I'm really glad, Yoko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's just talking with Yuzu for the moment, I'm sure they'll be out in a minute.\" She informed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, I can wait.\" I said, as she walked to the kitchen I leaned against the door and listened in on Yuya's meeting with Yuto and the 4 Dimensions, when I heard footsteps I took a step back as he opened the door wearing his pajamas. \"Yuya! Your awake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot? Where you waiting for me to wake up?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" I confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot's been waiting either outside or inside your room most of the time you've been out.\" Yuzu informed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Arigatou, Elliot. I didn't mean to make you worry.\" He apologised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled in relief. \"It's alright, I'm just glad your up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Elliot, there's something I need to talk to you about.\" Yuya started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the 4 Dimensions?\" They looked a bit surprised at my knowing. \"I overheard you talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Elliot...\" Yuya mumbled. \"I understand you use Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz, but I just want to clarify. Do you come from a different dimension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course I had been anticipating this, who wouldn't ask with a vague backstory like mine? But I had kept to my thoughts, and decided it would be best just to stay the neutral course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" I lied. \"Trust me, this thing about wars between dimensions kinda freaks me out as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya seemed to sigh in relief. \"Arigatou Elliot, at least your helping to keep my head on straight.\" Oh god my conscious...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everybody else will want to see your okay too!\" Yuzu reminded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right! Let's go then!\" He then began running towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Yuya! Your still wearing your pajamas!\" I called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did a U-turn and ran back into his room. \"I'll be out in a second!\" Me and Yuzu giggled as he shut the door.</span></div></div>",

Turns out that Futoshi lost against Reira as well after he Synchro Summoned, that is one strong little kid. But the three of us looked down when Sora was mentioned...that still got to me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus I got to see that crazy Mieru again, she visited all the time when Yuya was unconscious...ALL the time, I caught her lighting candles round his bed at midnight! As she came in to give Yuya a flying kiss (which was a TERRIBLE idea) he leaned out of the way and made her crash into the ground, I looked where he was and saw the three LDS course people...I'm not good with names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakaki Yuya?\" Xyz guy said. \"You came to watch my match? What were your thoughts after witnessing my full power? I'm on a different level from when we fought la-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to see Kurosaki.\" Yuya interrupted. \"I need to talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talk to him?\" Fusion girl echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something we need to ask him directly.\" Yuzu added as she joined us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are a lot of things I need to ask him.\" Yuya stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not happening.\" Synchro guy flat out rejected. \"Kurosaki-san won't even give you guys the time of day. He hardly even talks to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised.\" I said as I walked over. \"He obviously wants to keep a low profile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, your that new duelist we've been hearing about.\" Xyz guy commented. \"What was your name again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, I'm Hokuto Shijima of LDS' Xyz Summon Course.\" He introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose we'd all better give introductions then.\" Synchro guy sighed. \"I'm Yaiba Todo, Synchro Summon Course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Masumi Kotsu of the Fusion Summon Course.\" The female introduced herself last. \"I saw your Fusion Summon in the first round, and I heard you can use all other types of Summoning as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" I nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To have just one summoning speciality is rare, let alone four, so how did you manage to do it?\" She pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you pick up a lot of things after travelling for so long.\" I sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a slight pause before she spoke. \"I suppose so.\" I sighed in relief inwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since your here, why don't you watch the next match?\" Yaiba suggested as the trio began walking off. \"It's my match against Kachidoki Isao, I won't disappoint!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYaiba's match was...brutal to say the least. It was horrifying to watch him get pummeled by that Isao bastard, his school really pisses me off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's not the most disturbing thing. As we were matched up to our second round opponents (mine was some girl named Suzume Adachi) Yuya was paired up to Isao! It was worrying to say the very least, and then when the Duel came around...it was almost as if Yuya was a different, darker person, it was really disturbing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe obviously seemed down after the way he dueled, but he looked like he cheered up a little after watching Yuzu's match, and mine was coming up shortly, so I sat in the waiting room, hunched over in thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Things are getting messed up...' I thought. 'Yuya going all Supreme King-esque really creeped me out...what was that all about when he summoned Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at my main Deck, noticing the three blank cards all positioned in different places. 'I can't piece everything together yet, and I don't think I want to right now. All I have to focus on is just keep winning, and if some guys are judging me or something, then it looks like I have to meet their expectations, no matter what.' I shuffled my Deck and began my walk out into the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's now time for our next second round match!\" I heard Smiley announce. \"First off, of course you'll remember this You Show Duelist from Round 1! User of the flexible and stretchable Timestream Deck, Elliot Zekaki!\" I put a small smile on my face as I gave a few waves, I was still a little downtrodden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And our second Duelist, hailing from Chain Duel School! She electrified us during the first round, can she dazzle us again? The sparkling user of the Spark Deck, Suzume Adachi!\" The girl who was my opponent walked out with blonde hair tied into a broad ponytail that had lightning bolts down it and on either side of her face, as well as piercing grey eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to select the Action Field! Our choice is...\" The giant card above us spun rapidly before stopping, showing a bronze metallic city covered with twisted pipes, gears, and steam blowing out everywhere. \"Steampunk Citadel!\" The area materialised around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'All I've got to do is win.' I repeated in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" I looked up at my opponent. \"Did you hear me? Duelists locked in battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Right. Kicking the earth and dancing in the air alongside their monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They storm through this field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold! This is the newest and greatest evolution of Dueling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACTION...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot vs. Suzume LP 4000   </span></div></div>",

I thought as I ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll set a monster and two cards, then end my turn.\" She stated simply as the Duel Disk processed the actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" I looked at the six cards in my hand. 'I can work with this...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I was blasted upwards by a powerful, and hot, force. \"Aaaaaahhh! What the-!?\" I crashed down onto the roof of a metallic house. \"Ouch! Damnit! What was that!?\" I looked behind me to see a powerful steam blast shooting up. \"I must've gotten caught in that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI noticed a manhole cover rumbling slightly in front of me. 'But I can use it to my advantage too!' I stamped on the manhole and got blasted skyward, tucking and rolling onto a particularly large pipe. 'Agh! My back! I'm never trying that again!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced as I looked around to see an Action Card burst out of one of the pipes. \"Alright!\" I grabbed it, but immediately retracted my hand. \"Ouch! That's hot!\" I carefully held the card as I blew on it. 'This could work though!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, using the Scale 2 Timestream Assassin, and the Scale 5 Timestream Trickster, set the Pendulum Scale!\" The two monsters rose up either side of me. \"Now I am able to summon monsters Levels 3 and 4 simultaneously! Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monster allies!\" Two bursts of light leapt out of the portal above me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Carer!\" The female monster appeared in attack position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Timestream Recruiter!\" A small domed head appeared, giving the impression of a helmet as two green electronic eyes buzzed on. Following that was a small circular body with a monitor on the front, with a jetpack on its back allowing it to hover, and instead of arms it had two large black cylinders disproportionate to the rest of it's body, with a blue clock symbol stamp on the end of each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Recruiter, Level 3, Machine, Light, ATK: 1200 DEF: 500, Pendulum Scale 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Timestream Carer was Special Summoned, I get to draw a card.\" I did so. \"Battle Phase! Timestream Carer will attack your set monster! Serene Pulse!\" Carer tossed her blue sparkling ball at the target, which flipped up to reveal a black sphere with yellow electricity sparkling around it, and red gangster shades, you know, the ones that point up at the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Assassin's Pendulum Effect activates!\" I gestured to my monster. \"All Timestream monsters inflict piercing Battle Damage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani?\" The small monster exploded with its small 100 DEF, sending its summoner collapsing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzume's LP: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll activate Timestream Trickster's Pendulum Effect.\" I followed up. \"When a Timestream monster destroys a monster by battle, I can flip a coin. If heads, my opponent takes effect damage equal to the Timestream monsters level x100. If Tails, I take that damage instead. Ready Trickster? Coin Toss!\" Trickster created a giant black coin and flipped it. \"Let's see what this lands o-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second!\" I jumped back as she stood back up. \"The monster ya destroyed had an effect ya know. When Spark Cell is destroyed in battle, I can Special Summon a second one from my Deck.\" Number two appeared with 1000 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpark Cell, Level 2, Thunder, Light, ATK: 1000 DEF: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'll just attack Spark Cell after Trickster's effect resolves with Recruiter!\" I rebuffed, the coin still spinning above us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your too impatient pal, I activate my Trap, Sparkalysis!\" The Trap showed a bunch of Spark Cells zapping three powerful monsters into submission. \"When a 'Spark' monster I control is destroyed, the Battle Phase ends, and all monsters my opponent controls lose 500 ATK until my next End Phase!\" My monsters were zapped with bolts of lightning, electricity crackled around them as their attacks dropped to 1400 and 700.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then...but let's see the coin toss result!\" The coin finally landed...with a white lined picture of Trickster's creepy grin! \"Heads! So you take 400 points of damage!\" Trickster blasted her with a small kanji.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzume's LP: 1800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn then! Draw!\" She then immediately started sprinting off! I chased after her and we both got propelled upward by steam blasts onto an entanglement of biant copper pipes. She plucked an Action Card out of between two and held it up. \"I activate the Action Spell Steam Summon, which allows me to Special Summon a Level 4 or lower monster from my hand. I choose my Sparkray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small engine appeared that heated red hot before blasting a large amount of steam out of the funnel on top, out of which emerged a black stingray with flashing lightning bolt markings, it was kinda like a cross between a Mantine and an Elektross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparkray, Level 3, Thunder, Water, ATK: 1200 DEF: 900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Sparkray is summoned, I can destroy a number of Spell and Trap cards equal to the number of monsters with 1500 or less ATK my opponent controls! Since you control two now, both your set cards are destroyed!\" The monster fired two lightning bolts that zapped my cards and burst them into light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Trap cards!\" I gasped. \"So now your gonna attack my Carer and Recruiter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" She smirked. \"First I'm gonna release my Spark Cell and my Sparkray in order to Advance Summon my Spark Sentinel!\" Her two monsters disappeared only to be replaced by a giant spherical mechanical body with electrical discharges acting as mean looking eyes, it's right arm being a giant metal three fingered claw whilst it's left being electricity constantly formed into a human-like hand. It's second component, four mechanical legs, was connected to its head by several more voltic discharges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpark Sentinel, Level 7, Thunder, Light, ATK: 2400, DEF: 2300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Spark Sentinel will attack Timestream Carer! Overcharge Voltage!\" The monster blasted Carer with powerful lightning from its electric hand, making her explode and making me shield myself from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spark Sentinel's effect's gonna activate now!\" She continued. \"When it destroys a monster with 1500 or less ATK, it can attack again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again!?\" I echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast away Timestream Recruiter! Overcharge Voltage!\" This time Recruiter was obliterated, sending me flying back crying out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Damnit...\" I grunted. \"Pendulum Monsters are sent to the Extra Deck...\" I slid my two monsters in before it closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since Timestream Recruiter had only 700 ATK, Spark Sentinel can attack again! Finish him off with one more Overcharge Voltage!\" The monster blasted it's electricity at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet!\" I declared. \"I activate a Trap in my Graveyard! Stop n' Block!\" The Trap card appeared, showing a giant white palm slapping forward into a large fireball, whilst another white glove held up a sign showing the typical red circle with a line across the middle, with a colourful comical background for the rest of the card filled with multicoliured cubes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By banishing this card in my Graveyard, I can shuffle one monster from my hand into my Deck, and negate an attack! I shuffle Timestream Blob into my Deck!\" As my monster was sent back to my deck the same white glove palmed the lightning bolt, shielding me from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you survived, you want a medal or something?\" She shrugged. \"Guess now's a good time to activate my Spark Shot!\" The Spell showed a lightning bolt piercing through a shadowed Duelist. \"This inflicts damage to you equal to half the attack of one Spark monster on my field. So by choosing Spark Sentinel, you take 1200 points of damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaahhhhh!\" I didn't even have time to recover as the lightning bolt blasted into me and pushed me right off the edge of the pipes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily I crashed onto what seemed like a raised platform with steam billowing out all around me, not enough to break any bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll end my turn.\" She finished. \"What are you gonna do now? None of the monsters you've used so far are strong enough to defeat me, so what will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh...\" 'What can I do? I'm really backed into a corner here...and I know there must be something up with that other face down...what can I do?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the top of my Deck, and placed my fingers on the top card. 'What is this?...This feeling...it's a mixture of fear and excitement...' I gripped the card tighter. 'I need to place my trust in my Deck, I'll put my heart and soul into this next card! It's time to believe in the heart of the cards, get my game on, rev it up, and Kattobingu!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! DRAW!\" I drew as dramatically as possible before looking at the card. 'Hey, it's one of those blank cards...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a faint light emanated from the card, before it transformed into a monster card! 'Wait...with this...!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! I'm all for it now!\" I declared. \"Once again! I'll Pendulum Summon!\" Two bursts of light jumped out of the portal. \"Return! Timestream Carer and Recruiter!\" The two monsters appeared in ATK position. \"And now, for my third Pendulum Summoned monster. Parally, Magic Mask!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA red and green jester hat, the two ends being incredibly long, one red and one green, appeared with red orbs on the end instead of bells, followed by a simple white mask with a smile sem-circle and chibi eyes for a face. Following this was a red and green swirled star shaped body with two red orbs acting as feet and a red crystal heart in the chest, floating both sides of it were two red rubber gloves acting as hands without arms.</span></div></div>",

'Perfect!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Parally Magic Mask's effect!\" I continued. \"Once per turn, under the condition that I can't Normal Summon, I can send one Level 4 or lower monster from my Deck to the Graveyard, then I can either change Magic Mask's name to that of the sent monster, or instead its Level!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took the specific card out. \"By sending Timestream Blob from my Deck to the Graveyard, I change Magic Mask's Level to that of Blob's; Level 1!\" As I sent the card a mask resembling Blob appeared in Magic Mask's hand, which he promptly put on, making his Level lower to 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll tune my Level 1 Parally Magic Mask with my Level 4 Timestream Carer!\" Magic Mask took a bow and snapped its fingers before it spun around like a spintop and turned into a green ring that passed through Carer, turning her into 4 spheres of light that created a pillar of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the dusk of a ruined future, a shining beacon of hope emerges! Synchro Summon! Level 5! Explode from the future! Valiant G-X!\" The powerful machine emerged out of the blinding pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you Synchro Summoned, but how is that gonna help with only 2100 ATK?\" Suzume asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Timestream Recruiter's effect! Once per turn, I can change the name of one monster on my field to include Timestream in it's name! I choose Valiant G-X!\" Recruiter floated up and stamped a blue clock symbol onto the Synchro monsters chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I equip Timestream Valiant G-X with Timestream Longsword!\" A blue light enveloped G-X's right cannon arm, transforming it into an incredibly long light blue blade that shone brightly. \"The monster equipped with Timestream Longsword gains 200 ATK for each Timestream monster I control! I currently control two, so Valiant G-X gains 400 ATK points!\" The Synchro's attack boosted to 2500.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Valiant G-X will attack Spark Sentinel!\" The monster charged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try! I activate my Counter Trap, Boltback!\" The card showed Panther Warrior being pushed back by electricity. \"When a monster with 2000 or more ATK battles a Spark monster, it's ATK is reduced to 1500!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so...Valiant G-X is unaffected by Trap cards!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Continue your attack! Timestream Slash!\" With a single overhead swipe, G-X bisected Spark Sentinel, creating a huge explosion that threw Suzume back screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzume's LP: 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I activate Timestream Trickster's Pendulum Effect! Coin Toss!\" Trickster flipped it's giant coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You moron!\" She laughed. \"If it's Tails, you'll lose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It better not be Tails then.\" I shrugged as the coin landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt showed a card backing, Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you've just lost the Duel! So take all that damage!\" Trickster grudgingly fired its kanji at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! It looks like this is the end for Elliot!\" Smiley announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like heck it is! I activate the Action Spell, Steamsplosion!\" A large copper tank appeared. \"This negates all effect damage I take...\" The hatch opened up and swallowed the attack, before turning red hot. \"...Then inflicts 500 damage to the opponent!\" Steam blasted forth and flattened my opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzume's LP: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you had that card all this time!?\" She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" I confirmed. \"I knew it would be handy with Timestream Trickster's Pendulum Effect. Now it's time to wrap this Duel up! Timestream Recruiter! Attack her directly!\" Recruiter charged forward right stamper held out like a battering ram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hold on a second! Let me get another Action Ca-\" Recruiter punched her in the stomach full force, sending her somersaulting back into another pipe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzume's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot: WIN<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible! Thanks to a miraculous turnaround, our winner is Elliot Zekaki!\" The Solid Vision faded as the crowd exploded into cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suzume, are you alright?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...apart from a headache I feel terrible.\" She groaned. \"Aaaah! It's so frustrating that I lost! You'd better not get knocked out easily after beating me, got it!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\" I laughed as I helped her up and we both waved to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked down the corridor on the way up to the stands, looking at Parally Magic Mask. \"I still can't believe this card just came from a blank one...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the card was snatched out of my hand! \"Hey!\" I looked up to see a little girl with long sapphire blue hair, wearing a plain white dress, examining the card intently with a smile on her face. \"Excuse me, but that's my card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it certainly came out very well.\" She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You created this card from your heart, it's pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...you know that guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh! Sorry he's such a grumpy pants, but I TOLD him you could make some good cards and here's one right here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you seem to know some stuff, what exactly happened?\" I questioned. \"I just drew that card and it turned into that monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you drew the blank card, your current feelings were manifested onto it, and it took shape as this card! Parally Magic Mask...I like it! It's a mix of parallel and ally!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I didn't get it.\" I sweatdropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed the card back to me. \"This card really REALLY suits you, and I can tell that Magic Mask is really REALLY happy, so just keep making more cards like that, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, I have some more questi-\" But when I looked up, she was gone. \"Ugh, these people just can't stay still...\" I looked at Magic Mask, who truly did seem happy, before I shuffled him into my deck<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We want to duel each other to see how strong we've become!\" Yuya clenched his fist in determination. \"This way, we'll see if we're truly ready for the Maiami Championships!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point. In that case, you'd both better give us an amazingly HOT-BLOODED duel!\" He almost demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who to cheer for!\" Ayu said, watching from the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh! I can't decide!\" Futoshi said in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's just cheer twice as loud for both of them.\" Tatsuya suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! GOOOOO Yuya-niichan! Elliot-niichan!\" Ayu shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give us some amazing shivers!\" Futoshi added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what its come down to.\" Sora said as he ate his chocolate bar. \"A show to see how strong they've both become...awwwww! Why couldn't I join in!? Guess I gotta settle for watching...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of them...\" Yuzu almost whispered. \"In just the days leading up to the Championships, they've grown so much stronger...have I done the same?...No, I can't worry about that now. I need to support both of them as they show how much they've grown! Good luck! Both of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a Duel like this, we need a hot-blooded Action Field!\" Shuzo stated. \"Action Field on! Mighty Coliseum!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA stone coliseum filled with crevices and boulders surrounded us, lit by gigantic burning torches all around us, completely empty as we activated our Duel Disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duelists locked in battle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kicking the earth and dancing in the air alongside their monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They storm through this field!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Behold! This is the newest and greatest evolution of Dueling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Action...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot vs. Yuya LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll start.\" Yuya nodded. \"I summon Performapal Whip Snake!\" The fabulous Arbok appeared around Yuya's arm. \"I'll set a card and end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" I surveyed the cards in my hand before deciding my course of action. \"I summon Timestream Blob!\" The little blue blobby monster bounced onto my shoulder. \"And with his effect, I Special Summon Timestream Carer!\" The woman appeared next to me in ATK position. \"And since she was Special Summoned, I get to draw a card!\" I did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle! Timestream Carer will attack Whip Snake! Serene Pulse!\" Carer blasted a blue sparkling sphere at Yuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh!\" Yuya panicked as he dashed for an Action Card, only just not making it as the attack destroyed Whip Snake and sent Yuya collapsing back comically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 3800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh...\" Yuya grinned, getting up and rubbing the back of his head. \"Guess I wasn't fast enough, but I'll get one next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can try.\" I smirked. \"This may not do much, but Timestream Blob! Attack Yuya directly!\" Blob bounced off of my shoulder towards the protagonist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trap card, open! Performapal Pinch Helper!\" The Trap flipped up. \"When I get targeted for a direct attack, I can negate the attack...\" Blob was bounced back by an invisible force. \"...and special summon a Performapal monster from my Deck! Take the stage! Thunderhino!\" The burly monster appeared in DEF position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, I set a card and end my turn.\" The card appeared before fading out. \"Your move Yuya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"My turn! Draw!\" He drew flashily and smiled at the card. \"I release Thunderhino to Advance Summon Performapal Drumming Kong!\" A mix of a Donkey Kong and a drum set appeared with 1600 ATK. \"Battle Phase! Drumming Kong will attack Timestream Carer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani? But Drumming Kong has less attack then Carer!\" I thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Drumming Kong's effect! When a monster I control battles, I can increase that monsters attack by 600!\" The monster beat its drum chest, boosting its attack to 2200 before destroying Carer with soundwaves from the cymbals on its shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, Yuya. As expected.\" I complimented. \"But now that the Battle Phase is over, I activate the Trap, Rapid Rewind!\" My own Trap flipped up. \"This Special Summons back a destroyed Timestream monster, and lets me recover Life Points from the battle that destroyed it! Revive, Timestream Carer!\" The monster reappeared as my Life Points were restored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since Carer was Special Summoned, I draw again!\" I increased my hand count to 5.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, all I ended up doing was giving you a card!\" Yuya laughed. \"Oh well, guess I'll end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's my turn! Draw! I'll release Timestream Blob, in order to Advance Summon Timestream Guardian!\" Blob disappeared to be replaced by the floating chunks of rock in ATK position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I equip Timestream Carer with Timestream Longsword! With it, Carer gains 200 ATK for each Timestream monster I control! So Carer gains 400 ATK!\" Carer wielded the sword expertly, her ATK becoming 2300. \"Battle Phase! Carer will attack Drumming Kong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Drumming Kong's effect! It gains 600 ATK!\" Drumming Kong boosted its ATK, and Yuya grabbed an Action Card just as the attack made contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 3700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll attack directly with Guardian!\" Guardian thundered forward with a palm thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Action Spell, Avoid! It negates your attack!\" Yuya jumped out of the way of the attack. \"Phew, that was close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I can't do much else.\" I admitted. \"I'll set a card and end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" Immediately, a spotlight fell on him. \"Ladies and Gentlemen! Behold, as now I'm going to turn this superb Duel into a spectacular one! I, using the Scale 1 Stargazer Magician, and the Scale 8 Timegazer Magician, set the Pendulum Scale!\" The two monsters rose up either side of him with their Scale numbers, and a giant version of his pendant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can Special Summon monsters Levels 2 to 7 simultaneously! Sway, pendulum of the soul. Draw an arc of light across the aether! Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monsters!\" Three bursts of light jumped out of the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Performapal Drumming Kong! Performapal Springoose!\" The two monsters appeared in ATK and DEF respectively. \"And Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\" Yuya's ace appeared with 2500 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned as I looked at the monsters. \"Amazing!

So now that it's happening, I'm not gonna let up!\" Yuya declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, 'cause neither will I!\" I stated. \"Yavix's effect activates! When it's Special Summoned, all monsters my opponent controls lose 500 ATK and DEF until the End Phase!\" All of Yuya's monsters lost that amount. \"And Carer being Special Summoned means I get a second draw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Yavix the Imprisoned Warrior! Attack Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon! Sealed Energy!\" Yavix binded Odd-Eyes in its bandages before cacooning it in a red energy that shortly exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd-Eyes!\" Yuya gasped as his Life Points dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Carer will attack Drumming Kong! Serene Pulse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Drumming Kong's effect to have it gain 600 ATK!\" Kong's attack became 1700 before it was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 2800<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYavix gently wrapped one of his bandage arms around me and lifted me up to get an Action Card. \"I activate the Action Spell Nanana, to increase Guardian's attack by 700 until the End Phase!\" Guardian's ATK was boosted to 2500. \"Now, Guardian will attack Springoose!\" My monster destroyed his with a strong palm thrust. \"And with that I'll end my turn, with Guardian's attack returning to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, looks like I'm falling behind.\" Yuya joked as he stood placed his hand on his deck. \"But then, I'll just have to keep going! My turn! Draw!\" He smiled at the card he drew. \"I banish Performapal Springoose from my Graveyard to activate it's effect, and return Stargazer and Timegazer Magician to my hand.\" The two monsters disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, using the Scale 4 Performapal Trump Witch, and the Scale 8 Timegazer Magician, I reset the Pendulum Scale!\" The two new monsters rose up. \"With this, I can summon monsters Levels 5 to 7 simultaneously! Swing again, pendulum of the soul. Draw an arc of light across the aether! Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monsters!\" Three bursts of coloured light fell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Performapal Drumming Kong! Stargazer Magician! And Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\" The three monsters appeared in ATK position. \"Battle! Odd-Eyes will attack Timestream Guardian! Spiral Stream!\" The dragon launched its attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Solar Knight's Pendulum Effect to change the target to Carer!\" The shield shone a light on Carer, redirecting the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani? Why did you change the attack to Carer when you could have changed Guardian's battle position?\" Yuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Performapal Trump Witch in your Pendulum Zone, I know what your planning.\" I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you got me!\" Yuya laughed. \"In that case, I'll use Trump Witch's Pendulum Effect to fuse Odd-Eyes and Stargazer Magician!\" The two monsters became red and violet swirls. \"Wielder of mysterious powers, become a dazzling light in the eye of the dragon! Fusion Summon! Come forth, arcane dragon wielder of ancient magics! Rune-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\" The Fusion monster appeared with a deafening roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been waiting to see this dragon!\" I grinned. \"Bring it on, Yuya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna! Because with the Level 5 Stargazer Magician as its second Fusion Material, Rune-Eyes can attack three times!\" Yuya jumped onto the back of his dragon. \"Battle Phase! Rune-Eyes! Attack Timestream Guardian! Unending Shining Burst!\" Three spheres of light appeared on the dragons prominent ring on its back, the first firing at Guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Guardian's effect! Switch to Defense Position!\" Guardian changed just as the attack struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have two more attacks, though! And as Rune-Eyes attacks Yavix, I'll activate Drumming Kong's effect to increase my dragons attack by 600!\" Drumming Kong beat its chest, boosting Rune-Eyes to a powerful 3600 ATK. \"Here we go! Unending Shining Burst!\" Rune-Eyes fired again, sending me flying back from the force of the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I still have one more attack, Elliot!\" Yuya reminded me, pointing forward. \"Ikkei, Rune-Eyes! Unending Shining Burst!\" The dragon fired for the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not done yet! Trap, open! Nutrient Z!\" The card revealed itself. \"If I would take 2000 damage or more, I gain 4000 Life Points before damage is dealt!\" The depicted bottle materialised and burst apart to shower me with energy before I got hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 6400-2800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I knew this wouldn't have been won so quickly.\" Yuya said. \"But I'm glad! Because I don't want it to end yet! Now, Drumming Kong will attack directly!\" The Performapal blasted me with soundwaves from its cymbals, flattening me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And next...\" He grabbed an Action Card. \"I'll activate the Action Spell Unstoppable Draw!

The burning soul of my resolve! Level 9! Yavix the Dragon Emperor!\" My powerful new Fusion monster appeared in ATK position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!? You have a Yavix Fusion!?\" Yuya gasped. \"Though, it doesn't really look much like him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I won't mess up with his effect this time!' I thought. \"Yavix the Dragon Emperor's effect activates! When it is summoned, all Pendulum monsters in the Pendulum Zones are returned to the hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the hand!?\" Yuya echoed as the Pendulum Zones vanished, and I added the two knights to my hand. \"To think a monster could effect Pendulum Zones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI too jumped onto my dragons back. \"Now, battle! My dragonic Yavix will attack Rune-Eyes!\" Yavix roared as he charged. \"And when Yavix attacks, I can activate one of two effects! I'm activating the one where he gains 1000 ATK during its battle! Blazing Spirit!\" Yavix's underbody blazed with fire, it's scales glittering to show its power. \"Let's do it! Crimson Hell Claw!\" Yavix dived forward with its flaming claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the second effect of my Continuos Trap, Performapal Pinch Helper!\" The Trap appeared. \"By sending it to the Graveyard, I can half all Battle Damage I take from one battle!\" The card exploded, infusing Rune-Eyes with energy just as the dragons clashed, Yuya's being overpowered and destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 2100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I forgot you still had that Trap!\" I admitted. \"But I'm not done yet! Carer will attack Drumming Kong with Serene Pulse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Drumming Kong's effect to increase its attack!\" The two monsters once again fought, with Carer once again being the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 1900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Timestream Trickster will attack you directly!\" Trickster launched its attack at Yuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trap card open! Performapal Call! If I'm targeted for a direct attack, I can negate that attack, then add two Performapal monsters from my Deck to my hand, with their DEF totalling up to the ATK of your monster!\" Trickster's attack was blocked by an invisible shield. \"I add Performapal Hip Hippo and Trampolynx, with 800 and 300 DEF respectively, to my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd have a defence planned, Yuya.\" I nodded. \"But my Timestream Guardian still has an attack! Attack directly!\" Guardian gave Yuya a palm thrust, sending him tumbling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya's LP: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll set two cards and end my turn!\" I finished. \"And with Yavix's effect, you can't place any monsters in your Pendulum Zone until after your End Phase!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya stood back up. \"Heh...I admit, Elliot...you've pushed me into a tight corner...\" He looked up at me with a smile. \"But I'm still having so much fun! So I'm gonna do my best as your friend, and give it everything I have in this turn! I...DRAW!\" He did his signature overarching Destiny Draw, before running through the seatings to find an Action Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yuya...he's such a great Duelist.' I thought. 'And what sets him apart from the rest of the Yu-Gi-Oh protagonists, is his goal. To make people laugh and smile with his Dueling...I don't know how or why I came to this world but...' I saw Yuya pick up an Action Card and hold it up. 'I'm glad I met him.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Action Magic, Overwhelming Might!\" The card depicted a powerful shadowed figure in a battle worn arena, highlighted by a blazing sunset. \"With this, the effects of all of my opponents cards that effect me are negated until the End Phase! Including Yavix's!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I reset the Pendulum Scale with the Scale 4 Performapal Trump Witch, and the Scale 8 Timegazer Magician!\" The two monsters rose up either side of him. \"Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monsters!\" Four lights fell out of the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Performapal Hammer Mammoth! Performapal Drumming Kong! Stargazer Magician! And Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon!\" The four monsters appeared, staring down my own four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle Phase! Performapal Hammer Mammoth will attack Timestream Trickster! And it's effect returns all your face downs to your hand!\" The stars on the monsters hammer lit up, returning my Traps to my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shoot!\" I said as I grabbed an Action Card. \"I activate the Action Spell Burst Strength!\" The card showed a figure with expanding muscles. \"With it, I increase Trickster's ATK by 1000!\" Trickster flexed his non-existent muscles as his attack rose to 2100.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Performapal Drumming Kong's effect, to increase Hammer Mammoth's ATK as well!\" Drumming Kong encouraged its teammate on, as it crushed Trickster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn...\" I said. \"Yuya...I can't believe how strong you are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, your strong too, Elliot!\" He said. \"We're both down to 100 Life Points aren't we?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nI chuckled. \"Guess so, but I've still got some fight in me!\"</span></div></div>",

I walked over and plucked it out. \"Pendulum Statue Yellow Claw?\" The card depicted a yellow statue with spikes on both sides, and five curved claws spiking out the top, obviously being yellow with white edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPendulum Statue Yellow Claw, Level 9, Rock, EARTH, ATK: 900 DEF: 900, Pendulum Scale 4<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's one. Now I just need one more to start Dueling.\" I shuffled the card into my deck and continued walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrior to the Battle Royal starting, I had watched up to episode 40, and I was thinking about this Selena girl from Fusion, as well as the 'Professor' Reo Akaba. It was obvious that he was the antagonist of this season, and I was also wary of Selena running around during the city wide Dueling spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mind focused on it so much, I only just noticed I had entered the Jungle Area. I walked through the dense greenery, looking around for a second Pendulum monster, eventually finding one in a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now I can bet them in a Duel.\" I said to myself. \"Although...maybe I should collect more as a precautionary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hu-JESUS!\" I jumped back as I had turned to face the voice, only to see two ninjas right behind me! \"Where did you two come from!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gomen, we were just searching and overheard you.\" The blue ninja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, wait a minute...\" I thought for a second. \"Ah! Your that ninja that beat Mieru with an OTK! Er...Tsukikage, wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct.\" He nodded. \"This is my classmate, Hikage.\" He gestured to the red ninja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are both members of Fuuma Duel School.\" Hikage added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuuma?\" I echoed, trying to think of what it stood for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you are Elliot Zekaki, yes?\" Tsukikage asked rhetorically. \"We were both impressed with your two duels leading up to the Battle Royal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Arigatou.\" I smiled. \"Oh, while your here, how about a Duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Duel, hm?\" Hikage stepped forward. \"I have been waiting for those words, would you permit me to be your opponent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" I nodded, holding up the Pendulum Statue card I just picked up. \"We both bet 1, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held up one as well. \"Indeed, let's have a good Duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsukikage stood to the side with his arms folded to watch the Duel, whilst me and Hikage activated our Duel Disks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot vs. Hikage LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may have the first move.\" Hikage gestured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" I agreed. \"First, I activate the Continuos Spell Supply Squad! With this card face-up on the field, I can draw a card once per turn when a monster I control is destroyed! I'll set a monster then end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A small defense?\" Tsukukage murmured. \"What is he planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my turn! Draw!\" Hikage looked at his cards and held out two. \"It is time to use this new skill! I, using the Scale 1 Red Devil, and the Scale 11 Purple Sword, set the Pendulum Scale!\" He placed the two cards either side of the blade, making the word 'PENDULUM' appear and the two statues to rise up either side of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Here it comes...' I thought as Hikage did several hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pendulum Summon! Appear now, my monsters!\" Two bursts of light jumped out of the portal. \"Behold! My two Twilight Ninja-Shingetsu!\" The identical monsters appeared with 1500 ATK. \"And now I shall activate the Pendulum Effect of Purple Sword, to have both my monsters gain 200 ATK!\" The two monsters glowed with energy as their powers were boosted to 1700.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle! My first Shingetsu will attack your face down monster!\" The ninja disappeared in a puff of smoke before reappearing in front of the caged blue sphere with red eyes that was my monster, slicing it in half to destroy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a monster was destroyed, the effect of Supply Squad lets me draw a card.\" I reminded him as I drew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now my second Shingetsu shall attack you directly!\" The copy also puffed into appearance in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the effect of my Timestream Unknown you just destroyed!\" I cried. \"If it is in the Graveyard, I can Special Summon it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very creepy monster appeared in front of me. It had a metal pipe for a body, and a right zigzagged arm with broken steel acting as a claw, and its left arm being a long chain with a machete on the end. It looked like it was supposed to have a lower half, but instead had broken wires at its 'waist', and finally it's head was a clock face smashed in with a single red eye staring out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Unknown, Level 2, Zombie, DARK, ATK: 800 DEF: 300<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it shall still be destroyed!\" Shingetsu slashed through Timestream Unknown, thankfully protecting my Life Points by being in Defense Position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arigatou, Unknown.\" I thanked it. \"Now you've run out of monsters to attack me with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No, not yet.\" Hikage stated calmly. \"I activate the Quick-Play Spell Ninjitsu Art of Covered Tag!\" The card showed two ninjas escaping under smoke bombs whilst a different one charged in. \"By returning 2 Twilight Ninja's to my hand, I may Special Summon a different Twilight monster from my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!?\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would have some kind of secret defence.\" He explained. \"So I kept this monster in my hand as a precautionary!\" His two Shingetsu's disappeared in puffs of smoke. \"Appear now! Twilight Stealth Commander-Nichirin!\" A bulky warrior appeared with a worrying 2300 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Nichirin shall attack you directly!\" The monster dashed over to me with an impressive amount of speed, punching the ground in front of me and sending me flying back from the impact alone and crashing onto my back whilst desperately keeping a hold on my cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With the Battle Phase over, I shall Normal Summon a Shingetsu from my hand, and end my turn.\" The monster appeared once more. </span></div></div>",

I'm going to have to try my hardest to beat you! My turn! Draw!\" I looked at the Trap I'd just drawn, before choosing a different card in my hand. \"I summon my Timestream Jaguar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA yellow and white fured jaguar appeared with a roar, it's black spots looking like clocks and silver armour running from its head to the back of its neck and a long tail. It's shoulders and the top of its hind legs were equipped with circular silver armour, and whilst its back legs were simply armoured, its front legs were heavily armoured at the feet, including having three long white claws on each. It's front legs were initially curved to the side to resemble arms, but quickly its shoulders spun slightly to change the front legs into facing downwards, giving the monster its standard bipedal structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Jaguar, Level 3, Beast, EARTH, ATK: 1000 DEF: 600, Pendulum Scale 7<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time to take a page out of Yuya's book.' I thought before jumping onto the back of Jaguar as it ran throughout the forest, me clutching on for dear life via my legs whilst trying to keep my hands free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll now place the Pendulum Statue: Yellow Claw in the Pendulum Scale!\" The statue rose up to the left of me. \"I now activate Yellow Claw's effect! Once per turn I can increase the ATK of all Beast-Type monsters I control by 200! With this, Jaguar gains extra ATK!\" Jaguar glowed for a few seconds as its ATK was boosted to 1200.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not enough...\" Tsukikage said to himself. \"What will you do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaguar raced around I reached out and snatched an Action Card from a vine. \"I activate the Action Spell Wild Pride! Giving Jaguar an extra 300 ATK points until the End Phase!\" My monster once again glowed to match its ATK with Shingetsu's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Action Cards, huh?\" Hikage mumbled. \"In that case...\" He suddenly dashed off! I immediately knew that he was looking for an Action Card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After him, Jaguar!\" The monster I was riding instinctively gave chase to Hikage, both of us racing towards an Action Card atop a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your determination is something to be admired.\" Hikage praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too!\" I grinned as we both jumped towards it. As Hikage reached out to it, I full on grabbed it from below, slipping it out of his grip as Jaguar skidded to a halt. \"Action Spell, Wild Howl! This reduces an opponents monsters ATK by 300! I target Shingetsu!\" Jaguar roared ferociously, reducing Shingetsu's ATK power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now! Battle! Timestream Jaguar will attack Twilight Ninja-Shingetsu!\" Jaguar jumped high into the air (With me now literally gripping onto it like iron) and shifted its front legs into arms again, in order to give a diving slash to Shingetsu and destroy it, before switching back to bipedal mode and allowing me to relax my grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikage's LP: 3700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must congratulate you for outmaneuvering me.\" Hikage said as he walked back to the opposite side of me. \"I believe I underestimated you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was all thanks to Jaguar.\" I smiled as I stroked the monster, making it growl in a calm manner. \"I'll set two cards and end my turn! As such, Jaguar's ATK returns to 1200.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it is my turn! Draw!\" He looked at the two cards and nodded. \"Again, I shall Pendulum Summon! Appear, Twilight Ninja-Shingetsu, and Twilight Stealth Commander-Nichirin!\" The two familiar monsters appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'A second Nichirin?' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall now activate the effect of Purple Sword to increase their ATK's by 200!\" The monsters glowed, making me face one ATK stat of 1700 and two of 2500. \"Battle! Shingetsu shall attack Timestream Jaguar!\" The monster once again poofed in front of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trap Card open!\" I pointed down as the first card flipped up. \"Across Assist! By revealing a Timestream Monster i in my hand, I can increase the ATK of a Timestream monster I control by that monsters ATK!\" I flipped around one of my cards. \"I reveal the 1300 ATK Timestream Wyvern!\" Jaguar glowed as it was boosted to 2500 ATK, slashing through Shingetsu as if he was made of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikage's LP: 2900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since the battle's over, Jaguar's ATK returns to normal.\" I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, my first Nichirin shall attack Jaguar!\" The monster jumped forward fists first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll use my other Trap, X Reversal!\" Our two monsters clashed with claws and fists as the Trap opened, revealing a large 'X' across the picture with two shadowed red eyed monsters either side. \"When two monsters battle, I can swap their ATK until the end of the Damage Step!\" The clash broke and their ATK's swapped, before Jaguar overpowered Nichirin with a double slash, flooring Hikage from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikage's LP: 1600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch...\" Hikage grunted as he stood back up, brushing off his dirtied mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...why did you attack me knowing I had two face downs?\" I asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is my Dueling style.\" He said. \"I am the blazing sun, throwing forth a blazing onslaught, whilst my classmate, Tsukikage, is the calm moon who defends solemnly whilst waiting to strike back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...that's how you Duel...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interestingly, I feel like I have gotten a sense of your Dueling style as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"You seem to focus on swarming, as evidenced from your Pendulum Summoning, as well as being a strong turnaround maker through your use of Action Spells and Traps. But...during this Duel, I also discovered something else. You place a large amount of faith in each and every one of your monsters, and use them to their full potential. I've clearly seen that just from how you've used your Timestream Unknown and Jaguar. Heh...I'll be honest, I don't think I would have learned that without Dueling you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You learn new things about your opponent through Dueling.\" I proclaimed. \"Friendships are made through Dueling too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled behind his mask. \"True...but back to the matter at hand...\" With ninja reflexes he grabbed an Action Card. \"I activate Wild Pride to increase Nichirin's ATK by 300!\" Nichirin flexed its muscles as his ATK became 2800. \"And now that you have no more set cards, Nichirin shall attack Jaguar!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaahhhhh!\" I cried as my monster was destroyed, sending me sprawling across the dirt. \"D-Due to Supply Squad, I draw a card...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall end my turn, with Nichirin's ATK returning to 2500.\" Hikage said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...\" I struggled to my feet. \"Damn...you really are strong...\" I straightened myself up and smiled. \"But Dueling you is really awesome! So, as a thanks, I won't disappoint with this next draw! My turn!\" I drew the card and looked at it, seeing the other Pendulum Statue. </span></div></div>",

Crimson Wild Hell Claw!\" Yavix slashed through Nichirin easily in an explosion of fire, throwing Hikage back and crashing down from the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHikage's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot: WIN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI breathed a sigh of relief as Yavix faded, before walking over to Hikage and offering a hand. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am alright.\" He confirmed as he accepted the hand up. \"That was an impressive Duel, I am glad to have been a part of it, even if I lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I am glad to have watched it.\" Tsukikage said as he walked over. \"You both Dueled excellently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, thank you, Hikage was a really strong opponent!\" I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Elliot, as per our deal...\" He offered me Red Devil. \"Please take this Action Card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arigatou, Hikage.\" I gratefully took the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we had better move on.\" Tsukikage said. \"We must continue our mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Hikage agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mission?' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot Zekaki, may we meet again!\" Tsukikage bid farewell before they both vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two were pretty cool.\" I spoke to myself. \"And now I have three Pendulum Cards. Better keep looking though!\" And so I ran off in search once more. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I had been walking throughtout the Action Field looking for Pendulum Cards and I somehow found myself in the Ruins Zone, specifically the lower part of it where the stone pathways hung above me and everywhere I looked was tomb-like rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pendulum Cards, Pendulum Cards...\" I mumbled to myself as I looked around, having no luck in finding any. \"No luck...maybe I should try a different Zone, or at least climb up a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I heard the sounds of footsteps. 'Sounds like a group of people are coming. I'll hide for now and see who it is.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ducked behind a rocky wall and listened as I heard a group of people talking. \"Where do you think she could be hiding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In this area? Who knows. All we have to do is accomplish the mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got curious at the voices, and peeked my head around the wall to see three people with blue and white uniforms and strange masks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait...' I thought for a moment on their attire. '...That's Obelisk Force from the Fusion Dimension! What the hell are they doing here!?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't see anything around here.\" The one with a red gem in his mask noted. \"Let's move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Those bastards attacked the Xyz Dimension!' I clenched my fists angrily. 'And now their here!? I can't let them do as they please!' I ran out of my hiding spot. \"Oi! You three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio turned to me. \"Huh? Who is that?\" The one with a blue gem asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A participating Duelist?\" The green gem wearer suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI activated my Duel Disk. \"I know who you are, Obelisk Force! And I'm not gonna let you get away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three grinned maliciously. \"Oh? Seems he's informed.\" Red said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's not from Standard, more Xyz scum?\" Blue questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's the case, we'd better remind him what happens when they oppose us.\" Green chuckled as the three activated their shield-like Duel Disks, swords for blades appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot vs. Obelisk Force Red, Blue and Green (4000 LP Each)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall start!\" Green said as he examined the five cards in his hand. \"I summon Ancient Gear Hound Dog from my hand!\" A mechanical hound appeared with 1000 ATK and a nasty snarl. \"I end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" Blue followed up. \"I also summon Ancient Gear Hound Dog!\" A second one appeared. \"Battle! Attack him directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nani!?\" I didn't even have time to react as the dog threw itself into me, sending me skidding across the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 3000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh...the hell was that?\" I groaned as I stood back up. \"No player can attack first in a Battle Royal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue laughed cruelly. \"Your taking rules into account? This is a battle! No room for sympathy here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...\" I growled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" Red continued. \"I summon Ancient Gear Hound Dog!\" A third one appeared. \"Battle! Attack directly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh!\" I cried out in pain as it slammed into me, making me fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn!\" He chuckled. \"Are you going to lie there all day? Or are you actually going to Duel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got back up and glared at them. \"My turn...Draw!\" I drew as hard as I could and examined the cards in my hand before making my move. \"I, using the Scale 2 Devil Knight, and the Scale 8 Angel Knight, set the Pendulum Scale!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two monsters rose up either side of me. Angel Knight was female, and wore a long flowing white gown with a golden sash down the front, plus two angel wings on her back. Her face had silver markings on it with two curves under her eyes and a dash across her forehead, as well as a golden halo floating above her head of golden hair. At her waist was a rapier with a golden fancily designed hilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel Knight, Level 3, Warrior, Light, ATK: 700 DEF: 1400, Pendulum Scale 8<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevil Knight was male, and barechested as he wore baggy dark brown trousers with white fur around the edges and viking-esque boots. He had a muscular build and flaming black hair with golden wristbands and a coat of red feathers hanging off of his back, the left side of his grim face was covered by a demonic red mask, and he carried a giant black battleaxe on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevil Knight, Level 8, Warrior, Dark, ATK: 2750 DEF: 1600, Pendulum Scale 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Infinite power of unknown origin, bestow upon me the chance to shape my own future!\" I chanted. \"Pendulum Summon! Come forth, my monster ally!\" A burst of light fell out of the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Appear! Timestream Carnotaurus!\" A large carnotaurus appeared with a deadly roar, its rough skin was cobalt blue with a silver underbelly, its claws were deep black, and it had metal armour on its back and sides, extending up to its head where a clock face was attached to its forehead with a single minute hand at 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Carnotaurus, Level 7, Dinosaur, Wind, ATK: 2500 DEF: 1900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pendulum Summon!?\" Red gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle! Carnotaurus will attack Hound Dog!\" I thrust my open palm forward in declaration. \"Savage Hunting!\" My monster roared before charging and biting down on Green's monster, causing it to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen's LP: 2500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the effect of Timestream Carnotaurus!\" I followed up immediately. \"After it attacks, by discarding a card...\" I sent the Rallied Forces in my hand to the Graveyard. \"It can attack once more! Savage Hunting!\" The clock on its forehead rewound itself back to 12 before charging again, swinging its tail into Green and sending him flying back with a cry of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen's LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impossible!\" Blue gasped in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not...going to show you assholes any mercy!\" I hissed. \"To return the favour from the Xyz Dimension! I end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he does know about Xyz!\" Red snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" Blue shouted. \"I activate the effect of Ancient Gear Hound Dog! If my opponent controls a monster, I can inflict 600 points of damage to them!\" A nozzle emerged out of the monsters mouth to shoot a burst of flames at me, I cried out as I was sent flying back from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn! Draw!\" Red followed. \"I too, activate Hound Dog's effect to deal 600 damage!\" I'd only just gotten back up to be floored again by another burst of flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Damnit...\" I grunted from the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set a card and end my turn.\" He finished. \"To think this brat would take one of us out! Unforgivable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled to my feet, having to endure the burning feeling over my body. \"M-My turn...draw!\" I looked at the card to see Timestream Sprout. \"I summon...Timestream Sprout!\" The little monster appeared with 0 ATK. \"I then activate its effect, as it was summoned, to Special Summon two more Sprouts from my deck!\" Two more Sprouts appeared next to their buddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Pendulum Effect of Angel Knight!\" Said monster drew her rapier as it glowed with a golden light. \"Once per turn, I can change one monsters Level to any Level from 1 to 7! I change the first of my Timestream Sprout's Levels to 3!\" Angel Knight threw her rapier downward, making it pierce the ground and create a golden glow that enveloped the first Sprout, increasing its Level to 3. \"However, Angel Knights Pendulum Scale becomes that Level, therefore, 3.\" Angel Knights Pendulum Scale counted down to 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I then activate the Spell Mirror Levelling!\" The card showed the Level symbol reflected on a group of surrounding shimmering mirrors. \"If I control a monster with a Level different to its original, all monsters with the same name gain that Level! I change my two remaining Sprouts' Levels to 3!\" A mirror appeared in front of the first Sprout, before dividing into two and enveloping the remaining two Sprouts, boosting their Levels to 3.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3 Level 3 monsters!\" A recovered Green realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overlay my 3 Level 3 Timestream Sprouts!\" The three identical monsters turned into different shades of orange energy streams that all swirled together into the galactic portal. \"Dragon soaring across the vast timeline! Xyz Summon! Arise! Rank 3! Timestream Dragon!\" My Xyz monster appeared in ATK position with a mighty roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he IS Xyz!\" Blue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle! Timestream Crnotaurus will attack Hound Dog! Savage Hunting!\" Carnotuarus ferociously bit into Blue's monster, cuasing it to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue's LP: 2500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again, I activate the effect of Carnotaurus! By discarding a card...\" I slid in Bounceback. \"It can attack you directly! Savage Hunting!\" Carnotaurus swung its tail info Blue, sending him flying back and crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlue's LP: 0 </span></div></div>",

If I control no monsters, I can Special Summon an Ancient Gear monster in my Graveyard and increase its ATK by 200! Revive, Ancient Gear Hound Dog!\" The monster reappeared with 1200 ATK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Using it to bring back that monster? What are you planning?' I thought, before sighing knowing I couldn't do anything else. \"I end my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn!\" He drew. \"I activate Hound Dog's effect to inflict 600 damage to you!\" I once again was blasted with flames, getting sent flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I activate Polymerization from my hand! With it, I fuse the Hound Dog on my field with the two in my hand!\" The three monsters swirled together as red, blue and yellow. \"Fusion Summon! Appear! Level 7! Ancient Gear Triple Bite Hound Dog!\" A three headed version of hound dog appeared with an animalistic roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you managed to Fusion Summon, that monster only has 1800 ATK points!\" I exclaimed. \"It can't beat either of my monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not finished.\" Red regained his disgustingly joyful smirk. \"I activate a second Polymerization to fuse the Triple Bite Hound Dog on my field with the monster in my hand!\" His monster and a card became a red and blue swirl of colours. \"Fusion Summon! Appear! Level 9! Ancient Gear Ultimate Hound Dog!\" A cerberus like mechanical monster appeared with a horrible roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2800 ATK points!?\" I mentally cursed as I spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The effect of Ultimate Hound Dog now activates!\" Red laughed sickeningly. \"When it is Fusion Summoned, my opponents Life Points are halved!\" The monster howled, launching multiple blasts at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaarrrrrgggghhhh!\" I screamed as I was sent flying back and crashing into a wall, collapsing to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 100<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gack! U-Ug-gah!\" I squirmed around on the ground as I endured the pain of the repetitive attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Obelisk Force members laughed. \"How fitting, to see you squirming around on the ground like the pathetic scum you are! Just like those from the Xyz Dimension, who couldn't even put up a half decent fight! All of you are nothing but worthless trash!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at them with pure rage. \"Rrrrgh!\" I grabbed an Action Card and forced myself to my feet despite the pain. \"I activate the Action Spell Important Preservation!\" The card showed a chest full of gold in a museum surrounded by a thick glass casing and a laser defence. \"This prevents me from taking any further damage this turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Is that your defence?\" Red chuckled. \"But it won't save your monsters! Battle! Ultimate Hound Dog will attack Timestream Carnotaurus! And with its effect, no card effects can be activated until the end of the damage step!\" His monster roared before viciously biting into Carnotaurus, destroying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C-Carnotaurus!\" I gasped before the impact once more floored me after smashing me into the wall. \"Gaaaaah! Ack! Guh...\" I clutched my side in pain from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now activate Ancient Gear Sealing!\" The Spell card showed a mechanical prison suit of some kind being crafted. \"A monster equipped with this card cannot attack, nor activate its effects! I'll target your Timestream Dragon!\" Said suit suddenly appeared and clamped around Timestream Dragon, causing it to cry out in rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Timestream Dragon!\" I once again cursed mentally with Dragon's effect gone, as well as my chance of beating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set a card and end my turn.\" Red finished. \"What will you do now? Your monster cannot attack or activate its effects, and I highly doubt you'll be able to summon a monster strong enough to defeat Ultimate Hound Dog this turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh...\" I gritted my teeth as I struggled to my hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you Xyz scum are so pathetic.\" Red taunted whilst smiling. \"You just get in the way. But then again, it is pretty fun to hunt you down and prove just how useless you really are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had had enough. I couldn't stand this cocky son of a bitch talking for one more fucking second! \"You...\" I staggered to my feet. \"Fusion Dimension guys...think you can do...whatever the hell you want...That you have some sort of RIGHT...to hunt down innocent people, parents, families! And take them away from each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark aura grew around me. \"I hate you...with every fibre of my being...and I WILL make you pay...FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!\" I roared in anger as the dark aura exploded outward and completely enveloped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make them pay...for their sins...make them pay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark aura slowly faded away, revealing me. The red and blue parts of my hair had changed to black and dark purple respectively, flaring up and jagging out more then before, as a faint dark aura surrounded me, and my eyes now were a crimson red. </span></div></div>",

I couldn't stop smiling! \"Draw!\" This card, why's it blank? So stupid! Wait, darkness, infecting the card! Yes! It's a Spell now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate the Spell Rank-Up-Magic Hatred Force!\" Such a pretty card! The mixture of red and black and purple, all forming into a demonic face! Beautiful! \"With it, I take Timestream Dragon, and Rank it up!\" Yes, dragon! Turn into yellow energy and dive into that black portal! \"Rank-Up! Xyz Change!\" I couldn't stop laughing! Couldn't stop my eyes from bulging! So much fun! And that Ancient Gear Sealing is gone too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rage filled monster, wrongly sealed for your glorious power, be released from your prison!

Timestream Destruction Dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rising! Out of the dark portal! Magnificent! First the wings! Yes, they were mechanical, looking like two sides of a clock face! The left being 1 to 5, and the right being 7 to 11! And from each point potrudes a giant black minute hand glowing red with energy! Expulsing red energy to act as jets for flight! Then the tail! So long! It was as if thousands of steel rings had all joined together! And at the end, a black curved twin claw to rip apart enemies! But the main claws...it was if five giant steel scythes had all joined together on both hands! Feet were not needed, replaced with giant diamond shaped metal blades with red energy in each of them! But the creature itself! Its body was a fantastic metal mix of black and red! The chest was eight black spikes curving in to resemble a ribcage, to contain a large glowing red sphere of destructive energy! It's neck was long and metallic, with a pipe running up the middle to the head! Oh the head! It had curved red steel blades sticking out of either sides, almost like demonic horns! Its huge jaw was filled with steel sharp teeth! And its eyes were the deadliest, most piercing red ever conceived! Incredible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimestream Destruction Dragon, Rank 4, Dragon, Dark, ATK: 2600 DEF: 1800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rank-Up?\" Green gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with this kid?\" Blue asked no-one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehehe! Pathetic! So pathetic!\" I laughed. \"Noooooow the second effect of Hatred Force activates! I can attach a card from YOU to it as an Xyz Material!

When it battles a monster, by detaching an Xyz Material, I can reduce that monsters ATK to 0! Go! Drain Annihilation!\" The energy blades on its wings! Shooting forward to stab and impale that monster! It's very life energy being absorbed by my dragon as its ATK becomes 0!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-Impossible!\" Red gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Resume battle!

Just looking at the three cards I had gathered depicting the Obelisk Force members. What compelled me? Guilt. Simple as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had practically killed three people. Did they deserve it? I didn't know. I didn't know SHIT! That urge...the urge to just...punish them. It felt so sickeningly right in that mindset, everything I did felt so right! Why!? Why did it feel right!? What could possibly justify what I did!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...\" I clutched my face as I stifled a sob. It was a horrible feeling that didn't stop gnawing away at me. A constant reminder of what I did. What a horrible person I had become in that final turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Agh!\" I growled in frustration as I thrusted the cards in my pocket and took Rank-Up-Magic Hatred Force and Timestream Destruction Dragon out of my Duel Disk. I wanted to throw them away. Tear them apart. Burn them to ashes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I couldn't. As much as I wanted to I couldn't. Was there a little niggling in the back of my mind? No. Just clutching them made me want to use them again. To hurt more people. And I was scared. My hand froze just trying to throw them away. And if I would go to rip them apart, the urge to place them on my Duel Disk's blade would become overpowering. So, powerless, I put the cards back in my Deck and Extra Deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I can't do anything!' I thought in frustration. 'As long as I have these cards...I can't...I can't...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recognised the voice and turned towards it. \"Gongenzaka?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burly teen ran towards me...carrying Yuya who was screaming in a mix of pain and rage. \"Y-Yuya!?\" I gasped in shock. \"What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" He replied as Yuya thrashed around madly in his grip. \"Yuya seems to be affected by something that is making him go beserk! We must go to the Jungle Zone! A girl has gone ahead to find someone to help us, but we need to get there quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" I agreed as we began running. \"Yuya...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe managed to make it to the Jungle Zone, where I got acquainted with Mieru, Michio and Teppei (Didn't like him very much) and we all held Yuya down as he continued to scream in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get why I have to do this.\" Teppei complained. \"I don't even know the guy.\" Yuya responded by biting his hand. \"Aeeeeeiiiii!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your doing it because Yuya is in a lot of pain right now!\" I yelled angrily. \"And we can't let him continue like this in case he injures himself further!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this have happened to Yuya-kun?\" Michio thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall mperform a divination on Darling.\" Mieru said as she held her crystal apple out, making the rest of us hold our breath as she concentrated. \"...There...there are two souls inside of Darling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two souls?\" Michio echoed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yuto...' I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not only that...\" Mieru continued. \"There is a deep darkness, that is trying to swallow them both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A deep darkness?\" Gongenzaka repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot tell what it is.\" She admitted. \"But it is the thing that is causing Darling so much pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sentence echoed in my head. 'Guess we're on the same boat, huh, Yuya?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHhhhhhh...\" With one last scream the dark aura around Yuya faded, and he fell unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuya!\" \"Darling!\" All of us cried (except Teppei).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat next to Yuya, looking down at him whilst Mieru fed him the soup that Mitchie had made. It had now turned to night, and all we could do was try and help Yuya wake up. Unfortunately for me, all I could do was hope, which made me feel...useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Yuya's eyes fluttered open. \"Yuya!\" \"Yuya-kun!\" Me, Gongenzaka annd Michio said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've has enough of scary occult things!\" Teppei cowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot...Gongenzaka...Michio...\" The protagonist weakly spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling!\" Mieru gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...Mieru?\" Yuya managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's back!\" She rejoiced before embracing him. \"Darling is back to the usual Darling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe sat around the fire explaining what happened to Yuya, me specifically listening to how he summoned Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon. Michio handed us a bowl of soup each, and whilst I'd lost my appetite, I didn't want to seem rude, so I ate nonetheless, and I'm sure glad I did! It was delicious! No wonder Michio was such a renowned chef!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it was nothing, the reason you turned back to normal was because of my help!\" Oh great, Teppei was talking again. \"By the way, the soup you just drank was made with fish I caught from the sea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it was made by Michio.\" I muttered under my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need your thanks, but, if you insist, you can give me all the Pendulum Cards you ha-HEY! Are you even listening!?\" This is what I hated about him, his selfishness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued eating, not really paying attention to any small talk until I finished, I didn't feel like talking anyway...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elliot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" I looked up as Yuya spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" He asked. \"You haven't said anything for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" I forced on a smile. \"Just...taking it all in, it's dangerous stuff to think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Yuya agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, we settled down to sleep, though I couldn't, and I'm pretty sure Yuya couldn't either. I somehow knew that if I fell asleep I would have nightmares, so instead I just took out the three cards and looked at them in secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have to do something about this...even if there's the slightest hint of being able to reverse this...I have to find it! Or this just won't leave me alone...' I stared up at the sky. 'The darkness that I have, and the darkness that Yuya has...are they the same? Or different? And where did they come from? Too many questions...not enough damn answers...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYu-Gi-Oh<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, we all got up and had breakfast, I couldn't resist Michio's morish sandwiches, and admittedly ate several as everyone else spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious! Your cooking really is the best, Mitchie!\" It was good to see Yuya back to his old self again, and I was glad that he was pressing forward with such a strong belief in himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a simple little something I put together from what we could find.\" Mitchie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it really is impressive!\" Teppei agreed. \"You're strong at Duels and your cooking is delicious! You really are the best partner, Mitchie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Seems like a one-sided partnership.' I thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuya being able to regain his spirit is also thanks to your cooking.\" Gongenzaka added. \"I, the manly Gongenzaka, must express my thanks. Arigatou, Mitchie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, it's helped get our strength back after yesterday.\" I complimented before eating another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck!?\" We all jumped at Mieru's outburst, me almost choking on my sandwich. \"You all keep talking about Mitchie this and Mitchie that! Even I can make delicious food for Darling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'J-Just how much does she love him!?' I thought just before she bolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, what's with her?\" Teppei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she went to search for ingedients.\" Mitchie suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep an eye on her.\" I offered as I got up. \"Can't have her doing anything rash. Oi, Mieru! Wait up!\" I then proceeded to give chase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow she managed to run all the way to the Iceburg Zone, where I lost her. 'Geez! How can you lose someone on a flat block of ice!?' I looked mainly through the crevice pathways, with no luck. 'Maybe she went to a different Zone...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I journeyed to the Volcano Area. \"She must move fast...\" I thought aloud as I continued walking, I was checking a more out of the way area, a street with spiked rocks jutting out of the sides and lava flowing along next to me. \"...Okay, this is ridiculous. I've obviously just missed her, so I'm heading back to the Iceburg Zone.\" I turned on my heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your Elliot-kun...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI froze at the voice and spun around to see a cloaked figure who moments ago hadn't been there. \"It's so nice to finally meet you.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you!?\" I still wasn't over the shock of him randomly appearing. </span></div></div>",

Though...\" He chucked the three cards forward, and I looked at them to see three Obelisk Force members. \"...some haven't been doing so well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knelt down to the cards. \"Did you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why though!?\" I looked up in anger. \"They're YOUR allies aren't they!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph. Three soldiers who can't handle one Duelist aren't fit to live let alone serve. Which led to their current state.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had no right to do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you criticising me on cardifying Obelisk Force members? Ellix-KUN?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy heart skipped a beat. \"You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know about your little episode back then. You were in quite the different mindset then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up. \"Y-You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled. \"Elliot...I came here specifically for you...because apparently your someone very...\" He grabbed his cloak. \"Important!\" And threw it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes were a piercing crimson red, and his dark pink hair, exactly like that of a Chaos Xyz, slid down either side of his forehead and spiked out, whilst the rest of his black hair was slid back neatly. He was dressed in a formal red and black outfit with toggles, boots and a collar, and his Duel Disk was obviously around his left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...No.\" I stepped back, as if he was a ghost. \"No...no...no, no, no, no, nononononoNO! You...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong? Ellix?\" He stroked his face as if he was rubbing it in. \"Does my face...bother you at all?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You CAN'T!\" I shouted in a vain attempt to make him disappear. \"You CAN'T! I-I don't originate here! YOU...CAN'T EXIST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How rude.\" He feigned being offended. \"Saying I can't exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because you CAN'T!\" I grabbed my head in frustration. \"You can't...you can't...I don't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I was really frustrated about, was how more and more relentless, massive questions were building up that I had no clue how to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't make this...anymore complicated then it is...\" I practically begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you quite finished?\" He asked, as he activated his Duel Disk, the sword blade being a dark purple. \"I came here looking to Duel you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaned against a wall, taking deep breaths to calm myself down, before I straightened out and looked at him. \"I don't know who you are...and you are really making things hard for me to understand...but...\" I activated my Duel Disk. \"Why the hell think about questions you don't have the answers to...when I can just kick your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wise choice of words.\" Hotaru grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DUEL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot vs. Hotaru 4000 LP Each<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go first?\" He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just glared at him. \"Fine. I set a monster and a card then end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" He sighed. \"Is that all? I was hoping for something interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draw your card.\" I hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touchy, touchy.\" He smirked. \"My turn. Draw!\" He looked at his cards, causing a devilish smile to appear on his face. \"Now then...I'll start by summoning my HorReaper ScareClaw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was disgusted by the monster that appeared. It was a twisted mess of red blue and brown patches with a sewn-up creepy smile and a mangled straw hat, with two giant black claws on the end of each arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorReaper ScareClaw, Level 4, Fiend, DARK, ATK: 1600 DEF: 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kekekekeke...\" The monster chuckled creepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is wrong with that monster?' I thought. 'Just looking at it is unnerving!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then...I activate the Spell Foolish Burial. With it, I shall send my HorReaper KnighTrap from my Deck to the Graveyard...\" He slid the monster into his shield shaped Duel Disk. \"...and now its effect activates. When it is sent to the Graveyard, other then being destroyed, I can destroy one Spell or Trap you control.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Since you only have one, I think it's obvious what my target is, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Graveyard portal opened up as HorReaper KnighTrap emerged from it. Like ScareClaw, it was a grotesque mix of parts, although these were of armour, its right arm being a huge and bulky steel gauntlet with spikes wherever possible, whereas its left one was skinny and skeletal, with a bulky black chest and legs, a tattered and torn blood red cape, and a deomin looking helmet which had two mean red eyes gleaming out of it. Complete with steel chains wrapped around its body connected to sharp animal traps near its fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorReaper KnighTrap, Level 4, Fiend, DARK, ATK: 1400 DEF: 1300<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'knight' spun its trap over its head before throwing it at my face down Sakuretsu Armour, biting down on it and destroying it before the monster returned to the Graveyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's begin.\" Hotaru smirked. \"Battle! HorReaper ScareClaw! Attack his set monster! Black Sickle!\" His monster cackled maniacally before jumping forward claws first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The monster your attacking has a Flip Effect!\" I shouted. \"Flip up! Stone Urchin!\" The monster revealed itself to be a spherical rock with a hole in it for two yellow eyes to see out of, with small stone spikes on top, it reminded me of a Bony Beetle in Mario.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStone Urchin, Level 3, Rock, WATER, ATK: 400 DEF: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Via the Flip Effect of Stone Urchin, it's ATK, DEF and Level are all doubled until the End Phase!\" My monster grew to twice its original size whilst its spikes tripled in length, ramming into ScareClaw and throwing it back at Hotaru's feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHotaru's LP: 3200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh? So you CAN fight.\" He mocked. \"Well, 800 damage is no skin off my nose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched my fist tightly. 'What is it with his smug attitude? What is he hiding?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed. \"Seems I'm only left with one choice. I'll activate ScareClaw's effect.\" The monster got up and giggled creepily. \"By sending this monster from the field to the Graveyard, I can inflict 800 damage to my opponent.\" He pointed forward. \"ScareClaw, Sickle Slice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monster laughed as it swung its claws, sending a small slicing airwave that hit me across the chest and sent a searing pain through me. \"Gaaaaaaaaah!\" I felt myself get launched back and crash to the ground. </span></div></div>",

'I can't afford to take any more damage!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall set a card and end my turn, therefore your Stone Urchin's ATK, DEF and Level return to normal.\" He finished. \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My turn, Draw!\" I looked at the cards in my hand before making my move. \"I summon Timestream Wanderer!\" The loyal monster appeared. \"Battle!

Horrible Rebirth!\" The card showed a deformed shadowy monster climbing out of Bottomless Trap Hole. \"By activating this Trap, I may Special Summon a HorReaper monster from my Graveyard and increase it's ATK by 500, as long as it wasn't sent there via destruction. Now, be reborn!

Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes? What is it?\" There was that voice again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears...he's not cooperating. Can I start going serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can stop you anyway. Do what you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent.\" He grinned as he lowered the Duel Disk, and looked at me with a darkened expression. \"Now the real fun begins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flinched slightly. 'The feeling of foreboding he's giving off...it suddenly felt like it doubled!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, draw!\" He looked at the card with a grin. \"I summon HorReaper FiguRobe from my hand!\" A dark purple cape with red outlines appeared, the only thing that could be seen from the shadowed hood was a gleaming red eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorReaper FiguRobe, Level 3, Fiend, DARK, ATK: 1200 DEF: 600<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When FiguRobe is Normal Summoned, I can Special Summon a Level 4 or lower HorReaper monster from my Deck by making its ATK and DEF 0. Appear, HorReaper MadMace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA monster in a white straightjacket suddenly appeared. Its skin was a sickly purple and its eyes and head were bandaged with nails sticking out of them. Its sleeved arms carried a black mace each which it swung around wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorReaper MadMace, Level 4, Fiend, DARK, ATK: 1800 DEF: 1200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" His grin widened as much as possible. \"I activate the Spell Horrible Fusion from my hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked on in horror as the card appeared.

It was like a portal to hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fuse the HorReapers FiguRobe and MadMace on my field!\" The two monsters turned into a black and purple swirl that absorbed all the spirits of the Fusion portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cloaked figure of deceit, drown in the madness of man, and arise to tear down all who appose you! Fusion Summon! Emerge now! HorReaper BeserKatana!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant, bulky, grey-skinned monster appeared with horrible stitches and scars all over its body, with black claws for both finger and toenails. A giant black and red katana case was strapped to its back, and the only thing it wore was tattered red shorts, whilst its facial features were stern and hard, and it had two giant spiked teeth rising up out of its jaw, like a demon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorReaper BeserKatana, Level 5, Fiend, DARK, ATK: 1900 DEF: 1700<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Only 1900 ATK?

Naturally, I choose HorReaper BeserKatana.\" A dark purple aura looking like MadMace surrounded BeserKatana, causing it to bulk up further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Battle! BeserKatana!

If he had the piercing effect, why didn't he attack Stone Urchin?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since BeserKatana destroyed a monster, its effect activates!\" He declared. \"By banishing a HorReaper monster in my Graveyard, it can attack once again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" I gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By banishing ScareClaw, BeserKatana will destroy Stone Urchin! Beserker Bisection!\" The monster roared before slashing Stone Urchin multiple times, causing it to explode and knock me back from the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElliot's LP: 2200<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I shall set a card and end my turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shakily stood back up. \"I won't...let you win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Words are meaningless.\" He waved them off with a smile. \"Talk with your cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...my turn!

Yavix will destroy HorReaper MadMace!\" Yavix binded MadMace before encasing it in a sphere of red energy that promptly exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...end my turn.\" I admitted, I was so frustrated that I couldn't deal any damage!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, it is my turn. Draw.\" He saw the card and chuckled to himself. \"Well now...Elliot...it seems that it's time for this little Duel of ours to end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about!?\" I snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon HorReaper SpecTome!\" Ignoring me, he summoned another awful monster. This one had a long ghostly tail, and a skeletal upper half which looked like it was taken out of a junkyard randomly. Its ribs were either far too big, too small or broken, its arms were too long, many of its fingers were broken, it skull was filled with sharp, human and broken teeth, and it had a ghostly blue fire blazing out of its left socket and mouth, whilst its right socket had a small blue fire in comparison. A black book with purple mystic ruins engraved on it constantly floated in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorReaper SpecTome, Level 3, Fiend, DARK, ATK: 1100 DEF: 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When SpecTome is successfully Normal Summoned, I can Special Summon a HorReaper monster from the Graveyard, as long as it wasn't destroyed, with 0 ATK and DEF!\" SpecTome opened its book and created a hex seal on the ground. \"Revive! HorReaper KnighTrap!\" The monster clawed its way out of the ground like a zombie, standing up at full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...I activate the effect of the Horrible Fusion in my Graveyard!\" Hotaru declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the Graveyard!?\" I thought aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By banishing this card, I can perform a Fusion Summon using HorReaper monsters on my field!\" He laughed. \"I fuse the HorReaper FiguRobe, SpecTome, and KnighTrap on my field!\" The three monsters swirled together in the horrible portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunter of the dead, eclipse the red moon with your black scythe, and reap the seeds of death from the field of bones! Fusion Summon! Appear! HorReaper CronuScythe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark fog filled the area as a monster rose out of the ground. A black cloaked figure rose out of the ground, wearing a necklace made of bones with red, blue and green slitted eyeballs in them, whilst two demonic red eyes flashed out of its cloak. It wielded a long scythe with a thin grey handle and an oversized black blade, the back having three blood red spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorReaper CronuScythe, Level 7, Fiend, DARK, ATK: 2200 DEF: 2000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This monster...' The evil aura it was giving off was staggering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since KnighTrap was sent to the Graveyard without being destroyed, I am able to destroy your Angel Knight treated as a Spell Card!\" The monsters trap snared Angel Knight and destroyed her, much to my anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now...\" He laughed. \"I activate CronuScythe's effect...when it is...successfully Fusion Summoned...I can banish...any number of HorReaper monsters from my Graveyard...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...To destroy that number of cards on my opponents field, minus one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-What!?\" I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I banish HorReaper FiguRobe, KnighTrap and SpecTome from my Graveyard! To destroy your Devil Knight and Yavix! Life Reaping!\" I could only watch as the monster slashed through my only two cards, destroying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that...your field is bare.\" Hotaru's words barely rose above a whisper. \"This is the end. HorReaper CronuScythe, attack Elliot directly. Grim End.\" The monster raised its scythe against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, I thought 'I need to run! I need to find an Action Card! I need to stop this! I need to win!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body refused to listen to me. Every muscle, every bone, frozen in place by the sheer force of this monster, as its scythe arched over its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the scythe fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm going to die!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up! The Battle Royal is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything faded, the zone, the monster, everything. And we were left standing on a regular old street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh...\" Hotaru said. \"Seems like my Duel Disk was linked a little too closely to the Solid Vision. Shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter.\" The Duel Disk voice told him. \"We got what we came here for, return to the Fusion Dimension.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I came here for to get for YOU.\" Hotaru corrected him. \"Well Elliot it seems we couldn't conclude our duel. Such a pity...but let's finish it again sometime, shall we? Ciao.\" He then pressed a button on his Duel Disk, and he was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stood there, staring dumbly at where he previously was, until I fell to my knees. Everything...everything was just so fucked up...and I couldn't do a single thing. Not even win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMNIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!\" I screamed towards the sky. </span></div></div>",

They say he's won a lot of Tournaments!\" Caswell said to Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, well I am the first one to win the World Duel Carnival!\" Yuma said in a confident tone in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Class, take your seats!\" said the High School teacher, Mr. Kiriboku. \"Today we have a Transfer Student joining us today. The reason he has transferred from his previous school is because his father got a new job here in Heartland City.\" Mr. Kiriboku said to the now seated students. \"All right, you may come in now Mr. Tatsuhiko.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Door opened revealing a young man with a scar going right down his right eye. It had a white eye symbolizing that he was blind in that eye. His other eye was a dark red, his hair was black with streaks of red and a bit of green in it. He wore the High School clothes. On one of his arms there was a tattoo. It had a dragon head with fairy wings coming out of the back of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please write your name on the board for us Mr. Tatsuhiko.\" Mr. Kirboku said to the young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young man just walked over to the floating board and wrote in Japanese Ryuu Tatsuhiko and the meaning of his name. The meaning of his first name was quite explanatory. It meant Dragon. His last name was another story though. Tatsu had two meanings one was dragon and the other was accomplished. Hiko had two meanings as well. One meant boy and the other lad which was circled. Judging from the way it was circled it meant lad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now if anyone has questions please raise their hand and he will answer the question if he wants to.\" Mr. Kiriboku said to the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne student raised his hand. Ryuu pointed his finger to that student. \"Aren't you the reigning champion of most of the tournaments?\" the student asked Ryuu. Ryuu just nodded his head to that person. Everybody in the room were wide-eyed at this new development. Here in their class was a famous person. Another student raised his hand. Ryuu just looked at the student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you consider yourself a pro duelist?\" Ryuu just shook his head answering the question with a no. Everybody was just dumbfounded that he doesn't consider himself a pro duelist. Yuma at this point raised his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you want to duel me? I bet I can give you a run for your money.\" Yuma said with confidence in his voice. Ryuu just glared at him with venom. \"Fine.\" Ryuu said with venom in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Yuma, you made him mad.\" Anna said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Tatsuhiko you can sit right next to Ms. Kastle.\" Mr. Kiriboko said to Ryuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu made his way up to Rio(as we all know her from the anime.) and sat down right next to her. Shark from above them just stared at him with disdain for being next to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you make any moves on my sister you in a world of hurt.\" Shark whispered in Ryuu's ear venomously. Rio at this just looked at Shark angrily. He always did this to a male student who sat next to her making them leave to go to a different seat. Mr. Kiriboku was just waiting for Ryuu to raise his hand so he could move. Ryuu rose his hand. Sighing Mr. Kiriboku asked Ryuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am supposing you want to move, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, no. I was hoping you could tell Mr. Kastle here not to threaten me and make me move. I find it bothersome for a brother to be overprotective of his sister and it might serve as a distraction to me in the midst of class.\" Ryuu said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody in the classroom had their mouths hanging open at this. A transfer student not even scared at the threat Shark made. Mr. Kiriboku was wide-eyed at this. And Rio\u2026well she was just amazed at this person for standing up to Shark, but even more for her, The Ice Queen of the school. Shark was infuriated at this,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me. We'll duel during Duel period. Let's see if you can talk to me like that again.\" Shark said to Ryuu angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's his name over there?\" He said to Rio pointing over to Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Yuma Tsukumo.\" Rio said to Ryuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Yuma is it okay I duel you after this stubborn fool.\" Ryuu said to Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody gulped at what he said about Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhh, sure.\" Yuma said to Ryuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuel Period<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, so do you have a deck worthy of facing me.\" Shark said to Ryuu angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu just inserted his deck into the slot, activated his duel disk, and put on AR visor on his blind eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you going to see anything with a dead eye?!\" Shark yelled to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This eye isn't dead, it works perfectly fine.\" Ryuu said to Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark just activated his duel disk and put on his AR visor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAR Link Established<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDUEL!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go first, Draw. \" Ryuu said to Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Set Two cards face-down, End Turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hand Trouble, Draw\" Shark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Big Jaws in Attack Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Jaws (!800/300)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I Special Summon Shark Stickers in Attack Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark Stickers (200/1000)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overlay Big Jaws and Shark Stickers creating the Overlay Network.\" Shark said. \"I summon Submersible Carrier Aero Shark In Attack Mode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAero Shark (1900/1000)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate his special ability, you take 400 points of damage for each card in my hand. I have four so you take 1600 points of damage.\" Shark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu LP: 2400<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I direct Attack you with Aero Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu LP: 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I end my turn. You're all talk.\" Shark said to Ryuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Turn, Draw.\" Ryuu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I special summon Cyber Dragon in Attack Mode, I can special summon him when there is a monster on my opponent's side of the field and not mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Dragon (2100/1600)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next I activate the spell card Lightning Vortex from my Hand. I discard one card from my hand and I can destroy all the cards on your field.\" Ryuu said while paying the cost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sky got dark and Lightning shot from the sky and hit Aero Shark destroying it from the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I attack you directly with Cyber Dragon, Go Evolution Breath\" Ryuu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu LP: 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark LP: 1900<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I End my Turn.\" Ryuu said to Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Turn, Draw.\" Shark said to Ryuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set one monster Face-Down. End Turn.\" Shark said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, Draw.\" Ryuu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set one card face down, and attack your face-down with Cyber Dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face-down monster was destroyed and nothing was left except for steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"End Turn\" Ryuu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, Draw\" Shark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set a monster face down. End Turn.\" Shark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, Draw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Pot of Greed, letting me draw 2 cards.\" Ryuu said. \"Now I activate Magical Mallet, putting 3 cards into the deck, shuffling and drawing 3 again.\" Ryuu said while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set on card face-down. This duel is over Shark.\" Ryuu said to Shark making him chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and how do plan on doing that Ryuu. You only have one pathetic Cyber Dragon on your field and nothing else.\" Shark said while laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu angry for calling his card pathetic gritted his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU CALL MY FAMILY, KASTLE!\" Ryuu yelled at the top of his lungs making everybody around them shake out of a bone-chilling sensation even Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one thing I cannot tolerate, and that is somebody calling my family pathetic.\" Ryuu said with malice in his voice. \"I banish The Agent of Force \u2013 Mars from my hand to summon my Ace Card, Master Hyperion.\" Ryuu said to Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlames erupted from the ground and to form of a Grand being who held the Solar system in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Hyperion (2700/2100)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Banish one LIGHT fairy monster from my grave to destroy your face-down monster.\" Ryuu said to Shark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you don't have a monster like that in your grave!\" Shark said to Ryuu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you not remember Lightning Vortex, I had to send one card from my hand in order to use it.\" Ryuu said to Shark. \"I banish Mystical Shine Ball from my grave.\" Ryuu said to Shark. Master Hyperion's eyes glowed and the sun in his hands grew until it was the size of a mountain. Master Hyperion launched the sun onto the designated card destroying it into nothing but ash. \"Now Master Hyperion attack Shark Directly. SOLAR STORM\" Ryuu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Hyperion's eyes glowed once again, enlarging the solar system in his hands. The planets within them all burst creating a gigantic Solar storm. Master Hyperion launched the massive storm at Shark bringing his life points to zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu LP: 500<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShark LP: 0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe display above them stated that the winner was Ryuu and the AR Link was disengaged thus ending the duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu turned around to Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Yuma, but I can't duel you today, may be tomorrow.\" Ryuu said while walking back to the school. </span></div></div>",

Suddenly a blizzard came out of nowhere and in the middle of it stood a white being with a blue cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMobius the Frost Monarch (2400/1000)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate his effect, when he is advanced summoned successfully I can destroy 2 spell or trap cards on the field. I choose your two face downs Yuma.\" Ryuu said while Mobius extended his arm and hand making a blizzard come out of nowhere freezing and shattering his two face-downs. \"Now Mobius attack his face-down card.\" Ryuu said with determination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMobius launched itself forward creating an ice sword in one of its hands and a shield in its other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMobius: 2400 ATK vs. Gogogo Golem DEF 1500<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks to my Golem's effect Ryuu you need two monster in order to defeat him.\" Yuma said triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I set one card face down.

The Golem raised its rock fist and brought it down, pummeling Mobius into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu LP: 3600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate my face-down card Call of the Haunted, this card lets me special summon a monster from my grave in Face-up Attack position.\" Ryuu said to Yuma earning a shocked expression from the sound of the card Ryuu used. From the impact of the hit a blizzard formed in the middle of it. In the middle of the blizzard Mobius was kneeling on one leg, slowly rising to both feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMobius (2400/1000)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turn End.\" Yuma said while gritting his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it took me forever just to take out that monster, now it's back on the field.\" Yuma thought in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, Draw,\" Ryuu said to Yuma while drawing a card from his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Nova Summoner from my hand in attack mode.\" Ryuu said to Yuma. A bright light flashed right next to Mobius. The light died down to reveal a orange circle with wings floating next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNova Summoner (1400/1000)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, I activate the spell card Terraforming from my hand allowing me to get a field spell from my deck and add it to my hand.\" Ryuu said to Yuma making him think what field spell he was going to choose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I choose The Sanctuary in the Sky and play it,\" Ryuu said while the field around changed into clouds having a Sanctuary behind Ryuu. \"Now if I take battle damage that involved a Fairy type monster in it, I take none. Nova Summoner attack Gogogo Golem!\" Ryuu said earning a shocked glance from Yuma. Gogogo Golem blocked the attack with a giant rock hand and proceeded to swat Nova Summoner to the Ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGogogo Golem ATK: 2800 vs. Nova Summoner ATK: 1400<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuu LP: 3600<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma LP: 4000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Nova Summoner is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard by battle, I am allowed to summon a LIGHT Fairy type monster with 1500 or less Attack in face-up attack mode. However, if Sanctuary in the Sky is in play, I can summon Airknight Parasath instead.\" Ryuu said to Yuma, who was now understanding what he was actually planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blinding light took place on Ryuu's side of the field. When it died down It revealed a man with four horse legs and a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAirknight Parasath (1900/1400)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I set one card face-down, Turn End.\" Ryuu said to Yuma who was shocked at seeing 2 high-leveled monsters on his side of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My turn, Draw,\" Yuma said at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGogogo Golem ATK 2800 \u2013 1800<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I summon Zubaba Buster In Attack mode.

I increase my Parasath's level to 6. I now overlay them to create the Overlay Network. I XYZ's summon Elder Mobius the Blizzard Monarch.\" Ryuu said while a giant white being came out of the ground with a tattered white cloak. The cloak receded into a regular cape and showed a more menacing Mobius. The armor was now made out of pure ice. It had Icicles coming out of the shoulder pads, and the fingers were now pointed claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElder Mobius (2800/1800) OLU: 2<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I activate Elder Mobius the Blizzard Monarch's effect, by detaching one overlay unit and paying 2000 Life points, he makes the ATK of all your monsters 0. And for each one affected by this he gains an extra attack during this turn. I count Maestroke the Symphony Djinn. So Elder Mobius can attack you twice.
