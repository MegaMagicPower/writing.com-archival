You half heartedly batted it away, only for the same thing to happen. Suddenly, your eyes shot open when you remembered Emily had left last night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shot right up in your bed, only to be enveloped in a cascade of long, straight, ginger hair, unmistakably dissimilar from your usual coiffed brown hair. You brushed it away from your face and darted to your mirror to see that you now had a silky, but unbrushed mane of fiery hair parted down the middle, which fell to a couple inches before your shoulders. Instinctively, you grabbed your hair by the roots and grabbed... Hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately regretted it as you reeled from the dizzying pain of pulling your hair. As you regained your composure, you disbelievingly sputtered to yourself \"What the hell?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd had enough. Emily left last night, you don't need this. You grab your clippers and shear off most of your girly hair, until your hair resembled your previous cut as much as possible, before massaging in some pomade and styling it as usual. It looked fine enough, albeit red, and you decided not to think about it, since you still had so much to do to get all of Em's things out of your apartment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You brushed you hair aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes that you loved seeing her wear, and loved even more crumpled on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dishes that she brought over when she had too many, and you didn't have enough. You whipped your hair away from your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at the empty half of the vanity, which minutes before was covered in various lotions, and containers of makeup, wondering what was going to fill the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one, you gathered the items and stowed them in any container you could find. When all was said and done, her existence was packed into a cardboard box and 2 trash bags.As you went to clean yourself up, and not look like a dumped wreck when you met her at the Cafe, you noticed that your hair had gotten longer than where you had cut it. Your product was still holding, but it seemed like there was more hair than before. Disregarding it, you showered and got dressed. Red hair be damned, you were going to be there, and you weren't going to look like you'd just removed a half of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yeah, little careless there.\" You answered snidely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't give me that. I know it wasn't the best time, but I didn't do that. I told you as quietly as I could, and you repeated it like a megaphone to make me look bad in front of everyone. It worked by the way. Some of my friends won't even talk to me now, so thanks for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dropped your belongings. \"I was surprised!\" You said with a raised voice. \"I thought everything was great between us, then you blindsided me at a party with wanting to end our relationship. We were engaged for God's sake, Em!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we'd both had too much to drink, and it slipped out. But honestly,  we ripped off a band-aid. Would you have rather had our relationship wither and die over the course of months, maybe even after the wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have liked the chance to stay and try to fix it!\" You yelled, feeling a persistent itch on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't fix everything, Hal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you were drawing stares, so you picked up your bags and started to walk back to your car, but when you turned around, Em said: \"What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair had returned to its length from this morning and now reached halfway down your back. Hurriedly, you threw the bags into your car, and sped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way back to your apartment, you brushed the hair behind your head and put off your eyes. Finding relief when you got home, you slumped up against the door and pulled your knees to your chest, only to let out a quick yelp on contact. Suspicious, you pulled out the collar of your shirt and looked down to find 2 A cup breasts, just barely poking out of your chest, but unmistakably present. Shuddering, you raised your hand to the left one and have it a pinch, which again, resulted in a yelp of pain. You felt woozy and decided to lay down. You crashed onto your bed in a flourish of fiery auburn hair, and immediately fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up to\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or is sprouting a foot of red hair normal for you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hung up. She knew. Of course she new. You felt a swelling in your chest, which you mistook for a panic attack, but in reality, was your bumps becoming boobs; Round, firm, C cups. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm's name flashed on the screen once more,  with text under her name reading \"Okay, I'm getting to the bottom of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wouldn't read this text until much later, as you were currently top less in the bathroom, staring at the freckle-dotted tits on your chest, disbelievingly running your fingers over the curves and cleavage of your new assets, each caress feeling almost electric in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you paced around your bathroom, you felt your breasts bounce with the movement, causing sharp, short pains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing to adapt, rather than panic, you opened your laptop and searched \"How to measure bra size.\u201d Quickly, you mimicked the instructions you found as you wrapped a tape measure around and under your new bust and found your size to be a 38C. Still stupefied about how our why this was happening, you managed to push past it. In your closet, you covered up a best you could by putting on a tight shirt, a sweater, and covered it up with a baggy jacket, as you made your way to the store. </span></div></div>",

First the hair, now this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches out with both hands to grab the bra on your chest. Being unable to dodge her, she manages to grab both of your boobs.

When she realizes they're real she jerks her arms back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow embarrassed that you\u2019ve been discovered and groped by your ex, you pull your arms up to your chest to cover your boobs.

I don\u2019t know what is going on. Quite frankly, since you left, it\u2019s none of your damn business anyway. Now can you please step out of the way so I can enter my apartment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm looks mad. She continues to stare at you. Darting her eyes back and forth from your hair to your chest, she's still in disbelief. Finally she storms off, but not before shouting back at you from your car \u201cYou can\u2019t hide this from me! I\u2019m going to get to the bottom of this, one way or another!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she peels out in her car, you\u2019re entering your apartment. You shut the door, and lean back against it. Closing your eyes, you try to calm your heart rate, taking slow and steady breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've calmed down, you throw down your keys and bag of random things from the store on the counter and go to the bathroom. You take your shirt off and adjust the straps on your bra until it\u2019s comfortable. Then you reach in each cup, adjusting your boobs. Looking in the mirror, you see quite the reflection, your boobs look strange on your still wide torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy is this happening to me?\u201d You say to yourself as you put your shirt back on. Your long red hair is still falling in your face. Realizing that cutting it off again is pointless as it will just grow back, you get out your laptop and look up how to do your hair. After a few tutorials, you pretty much have it down. You tie it up in a decent bun with a rubber band and lie down on your bed. You make a mental note that you'll need hair ties if this hair is going to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think back the events over the past few months, you try to figure out what may be causing this to happen. It's unheard of... sprouting boobs, hair changing color and growing so rapidly. Will there be more changes? What could possibly next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour phone vibrates. Em texted you. You open the text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201dI want to know what's going on. You have to talk to me. Please.\u201d you roll your eyes and toss your phone on your nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had woken up earlier it was just past 12 AM. After your trip to the store, it was already 3 AM.

It's already one in the afternoon. You don't usually sleep so late but being out so late last night had its consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head to the bathroom, you take your hair out of its bun. Pulling your hair from the rubber band causes you to let out a small yelp of pain from a few hairs being stuck and pulled out with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou twirl your finger through the long red strands as you turn on the shower. You remove your shirt and bra. There are imprints around your chest from leaving your bra on overnight. Groaning, you rub the red marks and hop in the shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile rubbing the bar of soap across your chest, your fingers graze your soapy nipples, sending a shiver of pleasure through you. Curious about the feeling, you put the bar of soap down and bring both hands to your chest. Starting slow, you begin caressing your boobs. You start massaging your nipples, causing you to get hard almost immediately as you explore the new pleasure you're feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue feeling yourself up, more and more vigorously as you go, it only takes about a minute for you to finish. It comes as a shock to you as you experience your typical orgasm along with the newfound feeling coming from your chest. You're amazed that only touching your chest had such an amazing effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn. Now <i>that</i> I could get used to,\" you say to yourself, trying to catch your breath. You finish washing off and get out of the shower. You attempt to dry your hair by quickly rubbing the towel over your head, but only manage to tangle it up. You look around your apartment for a brush or comb. Emily had left one there, but you just gave that back to her yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's just another thing I need to get now,\" you mutter as you run your fingers through your hair, untangling it as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your bra back on, followed by a shirt and your baggy jacket, trying to cover your boobs as much as possible for your trip to the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrive at the store, you head straight to the hair section, keeping your head low to avoid potentially being recognized by somebody you know. You remember the hair ties you bought for Emily before the breakup. They had a knot rather than the metal piece. Something about hair not getting stuck when you pull it out. She always said those were the best ones. You find them as quick as you can. Moving on to the brushes, you grab a red and black one that looks decent and go to counter to pay. The cashier gives you a judging look. Hopefully it's just from the hair and she doesn't notice your breasts too. Fortunately, it's quickly over with and you decide to...</span></div></div>",

This is just my luck. Whatever, I guess I'll go inside then.\" you mutter. You pull your car into a spot. After making sure your jacket is still zipped up and covering your boobs, you tear out one of the new hair ties from the pack you just bought. Remembering the tutorials you watched last night, you do your best to tie it into a bun. Hopefully that will deter any funny looks. You manage to do a little better than you did last night with the rubber band.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting out of the car, you fold your arms over your chest, covering your boobs as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand in line to order, you see a familiar face sitting in a booth against the wall.

You order a big mac meal with a coke, trying to keep it as simple as possible. They get your order to you a few minutes later.

Heck, you didn't even understand it yourself. First this mess of red hair, then rather large breasts, and just now there were your hands. It was all so bizarre, almost supernatural in a sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the very least, Em was willing to wait until you had put the food away before doing anything. It only took a little while to do so, leaving a little of an awkward silence as you both were in the family room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....\" Em sighed as she looked at you. \"I guess I should ask.....what's up with....all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe made a vague motion, likely referring to all of you right now. She even seemed to have noticed your hands as well, with how much smaller they were with longer fingernails. Not that it made you feel much better about it. Well, guess you had to start somewhere at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.....I'm not really sure how to put it...\" you started. \"But since you're probably wondering, I have not been taking any drugs or whatever. This....just started happening out of the blue...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning.....?\" Em asked, crossing her arms a little. \"At the very least, I don't think you're lying or joking. This would be a little too far for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you said, smiling just a little. At least you knew you could trust Em. Some spats and a messy break-up wouldn't take that away. \"And so.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you began to explain things as best you could. Basically, something has changed everyday. A little while ago, there was your hair, turning red and getting longer, not to mention rapidly growing back every time you cut it. Then, there were the breasts, starting out small before growing to 38C.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Bigger than mine.....\" you could have sworn you heard Em whisper to herself at that remark. Admittedly, that was a little funny. Em was always quick to notice differences between herself and other girls...not that you were one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, you told her about shopping for bras afterwards, and actually paying for them. This got a little laugh from Em, the idea of you really paying for these items without trying to shoplift. In good humor, you actually smiled a little, saying that this was enough problems. Breaking the law wasn't exactly something you wanted to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, that lead you to today. Nothing had changed until your hands had just changed a little while ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you're saying you've had a change everyday?\" she asked. \"And you're sure you haven't been taking anything weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, nothing like that,\" you said. \"It just....started happening out of the blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm nodded a little. With that though, she looked at your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see your chest then?\" she asked. \"I just....want to see for myself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell...it wouldn't be the first time she had seen you in less clothing, though this seemed to carry a different weight. It was exposing something you were pretty sure you weren't supposed to have. Then again, as weird as it may seem, having an actual girl see this might be better than any alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure....\" you mumbled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you eventually took your top off, exposing your 38C breasts encased in a white bra. Suffice to say, Em was quite surprised. With your permission, she touched them a little, making you feel a little weird at the sensitivity. One thing was clear to her though, they were certainly real, and no medicine could make such huge breasts in such a short time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unreal......they're not fake at all....\" she mumbled, coming to grips with it herself. \"And.....you actually put on a bra all by yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I had seen you do it plenty of times...\" you actually smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got her to smile a little too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure if I should be proud of that...\" </span></div></div>",

Or if this speeds up more changes?\u201d Em said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess you have a point...\u201d You said frustrated.

Some doctor?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot...exactly.\u201d Em said as yawned and waved goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawned and waved back falling back into your bed to sleep. At least trimming your hair and nails made sleeping easier. Despite your breasts getting in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014-Next Morning\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning you slowly awoke as the sunlight woke you up. You felt nature calling you to the bathroom as you stood up slowly rubbing your eyes. Taking a step forward you suddenly stepped on something. A sudden immense pain hit your head as you suddenly tripped and fell face first....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwww!\u201d You cried out grabbing your head as you opened your eyes trying to see what you stepped on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second it became clear the culprit here as you walked to the mirror slowly as your eyes widened...apparently Em might have been right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour red hair had grown back as excepted but longer than before....much longer....It now cascaded all the way down your back and legs with the tips touching your ankles. It was also fuller, straighter, and well groomed. It looked like the kind of hair a princess would have in a fairy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse your nails had followed suit. Your fingernails were now over an inch long and now well manicured with cute French tips... </span></div></div>",

I probably would be too if it was me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two just stood there, silently giving each other some comfort in this trying situation.

Otherwise I guess it'll just get even worse than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean even.....\" you mumbled before looking at your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah probably those too. Unless you want those to get bigger too, might be best to not fondle them too much. There's still so much we don't know,\" she said, before realizing something else. \"Not to mention, you said something new changed every day right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...so something else is going to change today if this is any thing,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....so just get ready as you usually do. I can start some breakfast while you're doing that,\" she said. \"Also....perhaps a little tip...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiven Em knew a thing or two about long hair, she gave you some tips on how to wash and dry it. Granted, even this length was a little much even for her, but she did her best. Once you felt like you got it, she left to get things started. You showered as you usually did, feeling the heavy weight of your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly....I'd find this hair really nice if it just wasn't on me,\" you grumbled. It did look like something a princess would have. Funny thought there.</span></div></div>",

She was a friend of my parents when they were young and I\u2019ve known her since I was a little girl.\u201d Em explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you think she can help me?\u201d You asked prying more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe...sees things...has really good insights.\u201d Em said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were getting a bit suspicious as Em pulled into a driveway of an old looking house. Above the house was a sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMadam Serena, fortune teller.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? A fortune teller? I thought you were serious. Come on Em.

She is an actual gypsy! She immigrated here when she was a child, her mother was a legit holocaust survivor.\u201d Em said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you telling me you think this...condition is magic?\u201d You said sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...don\u2019t know what to think.

I\u2019m willing to take something on faith...How about you?\u201d Em asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no other real options you sighed and followed Em inside. Waiting for you was an older woman dressed in old gypsy clothes sitting at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEm....Harold. So glad you came to see me.\u201d She said in a soft tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh...thanks...did Em mention my name to you?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...She called and said a friend was in trouble. I looked into the beyond and the spirits gave me your name.\u201d Madam Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes a bit. It was more likely Em just mentioned your name in passing but whatever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease...sit...\u201d She said offering you chair as you and Em took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI believe the best course of actions is to use my special Tarot Cards here. They will guide me to the special nature of your affliction.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy...\u201d You said sarcastically as Em gave you a quick elbow in the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Serena pulled out a black deck of cards and began to shuffle them in an impressive and fast manner. The design was unique and old looking on them as she began to lay out the cards face down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow...child...pick three. Do not think which ones. Let your heart guide you.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh....okay....those three.\u201d You said point at three random ones you saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadam Serena flipped over the first card. On it was an image of a beautiful woman. She looked like a goddess or princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeauty...This is spirit of physical perfection. She is the sister of Vanity and Desire. She represents the ideal version of ourselves we all wish to see.\u201d Serena explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping over the next card revealed an image of man. He was dressed in fine clothes but had a large whole in his heart and before him was a line of women. He seemed to be dismissing them all like none were worthy of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...Perfection...This is spirit of perfectionism. He resembles the feeling when nothing is ever good enough. Born with a hole in his heart nothing can fill he passes every suitor looking for someone greater.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerena flipped over the final card. On it was a picture of the sun and moon. They were overlapping each other and each had a different face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...Harmony...This spirit represents the duality of all things. Two sides of the same coin. How two halves come together to become a greater whole.\u201d  Serena explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo...what does this tell you?\u201d Em asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt...It is difficult...These spirits rarely come together in this specific order...\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see! She doesn\u2019t know anything! Come on let\u2019s go...\u201d You said standing up to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung man....have you been gaining female body characteristics?\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped dead in tracks...\u201dHow...did...?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm swore she never mentioned anything of your condition to anyone and you had yourself covered in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYoung man...this is no joke. If the spirits are true you have been cursed by the dark Madien.\u201d Serena explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d Em asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe curse of the dark Madien in a legend of old. When a man who is never satisfied with anyone, always finding faults of everything in his life. He is cursed to take on the form of perfection he most scorns. In your case...Women...\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...I have never....\u201d You began when Em gave you the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have never been satisfied with anyone! Every one of your exes you nit picked out of your life...including me!\u201d Em said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve been cursed because I\u2019ve got high standards?\u201d You said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...you have been cursed because someone cursed you...I have no idea who or why...However in your case you are doomed to change until you become the perfect example of female beauty and sexual perfection. The more you fight it...the faster it spreads.\u201d Serena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we reverse it?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do not know...I shall call you once the spirits have given me an answer...\u201d Serena said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe this...This is all just....Whoa!\u201d You said as you took a step but suddenly tripped and fell on your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down you saw the reason for your fall. Your feet had slipped right out of your shoes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down your eyes widened. The feet you were looking at attached to your ankles were not yours...They were smaller...dainty, cute, smooth, female feet with well pedicures toenails...</span></div></div>",

She thanked Madame Serena for everything, hoping that this may be resolved sometime soon. With that, she helped you get your now oversized shoes back on and gingerly walked back out to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have an answer now as to what might be happening,\" Em said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seriously believe all that hocus pocus?\" you asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you deny it?\" Em retorted. \"You're clearly transforming. It's definitely no product of medicine or whatever, so supernatural is pretty much the only path left. Everything she said was true, more or less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou opened your mouth to retort yet found that you couldn't. She was right after all about one thing. You had been overly picky regarding....well, a lot of things to be open. Your exes were just one aspect of that, though it didn't really feel all that bad until it was put out in the open like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere you really that self-centered about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you guessed you'd have some time to think on it, as Em drove you both back to the house. Nothing else strange happened on the way back, which made sense given the current trend of a change per day. Once you got back to the house, Em helped you inside, to which you were able to take off your shoes that were practically hanging from your feet now. You shed the hoodie too, allowing yourself to rest somewhat, even with seeing your large breasts through your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what now? Just wait until she calls?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Not much we can really do at this point,\" Em sighed as she sat down. \"Might need to get you some new shoes now, at least for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.....\" you sighed, leaning back on the couch a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all so bizarre....though you supposed it did bring things into perspective just a little. You had never thought much about having high standards. Just felt like that was natural. And yet, trouble did seem to come as a result. Em was perhaps the most understanding girl you had ever met, and even that ended up turning sour in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were going to be like that, when would it end....</span></div></div>",

Not to mention your annoying breasts pushing back into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning came you slowly awoke yawning as brushed the hair out of your eyes. Heading to the bathroom to take care of business you noticed your clothes seemed really baggy for some reason...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at yourself in the mirror you had to cover your mouth from screaming...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver night it seemed your figure had changed rather dramatically...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far the changes had all been present on your rather large male body. Being 6\u20192 and 200lbs meant you were pretty masculine and overall proud of your figure. Well that time had officially passed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now stood 5\u20196 and weighed in at just over 110lbs. You looked like you did back in grade school...Save for the female features. All your muscle and body mass had vanished over night along with your body hair. Save for the ankle length red mass of hair you now possessed. The rest of your body was now totally smooth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust looking at you it was getting harder to tell you were actually a man. Just at first glance you looked like a girl now. You didn\u2019t have the curves, hips, butt, or thing that counted most yet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic was setting in now....Your heart was pounding..This couldn\u2019t be happening! There was no curse...This was just a dream...a bad dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the scissors you couldn\u2019t stop yourself. You began to go to town on your hair cutting it as short as possible. The red locks falling as you grabbed the clippers and began to buzz the rest of it off. The nail clippers came next as you took off your long nails taking in a deep sigh of relief...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never seen yourself bald and totally hairless before....It honestly looked rather weird. However at least you looked like a guy again...Well...sorta. The boobs were still a bit of a give away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a noise behind you as you saw Em standing there. She was standing in just her tank top and panties. She had been sleeping over since your condition started. In normal circumstances you had to admit she looked rather hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell have you done?\u201d She asked looking at you upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at me! My body barely looks like mine anymore! It\u2019s my body I can do what I want!\u201d You said angry. Not so much at her but your situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the hair and nails? What happens when they grow back longer than before? What if this triggers another change? You heard Madam Serena. Fighting only makes it worse.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care! I\u2019m not going go out without a fight!\u201d You said in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm could only give a facepalm expression at your stubborn and defiant attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...I know this isn\u2019t what you want to hear but...we need to come up with plan when...you...know...\u201d Em said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you change into a woman...What are you going to do for work? Who are you going to be?\u201d Em asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still me...no matter what...\u201d You said storming out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed a Moment to think and figure out what to do next...Go see a doctor? Buy testosterone or steroids? Nothing seemed like a good option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen...We don\u2019t have much time before you are going to need a new identity and wardrobe. I have some friends in local government. I can ask them help us forge you a new ID, social security card, and birth certificate. At least it would allow to make up a new identity until we figure out how to reverse the curse.\u201d Em said trying to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen I just want to......\u201d You we\u2019re about to say something but a sudden massive pain hit your body. It was unlike anything you had ever felt as you collapsed holding your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently this curse was no joke and you were about to learn a valuable lesson in not taking it seriously...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Ahhhhhh!\" you cried out loud, not even caring if anyone else heard you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was by far the largest you've ever been in pain, even more than that one time you broke your arm way back in middle school. This....was indescribable, and it shot throughout your whole body, up and down your spine and through each limb. It was painful to the point where it was hard to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harold!\" Em cried as she came over, wanting to help as best she could although there wasn't much to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could barely hear her over your own cries, and suddenly, you could feel a fierce transformation beginning to happen, starting from the bottom up. Your legs, which had been left smooth and thin by now, began to fill up, particularly in your calves and thighs, filling them out to luscious proportions. However, that was the easy part. Right after that, another shot went through you as your hip bones began to crack and reshape, forcing your legs apart. Your hips began to fill out at that, growing out to that of an ideal woman's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.....\" Em said, her hand over her mouth as she did. You were naked throughout all of this, so there was nothing to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, your butt began filling up to match with your hips, ballooning out to probably one of the biggest you had ever seen. Even Em was amazed as she watched it grow right in front of her. It was so alarming to see this, particularly growing on a man. It was something any woman would want frankly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhh!\" you cried out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason this time was a shot to where your groin was, and one of your hands went down there. Your manhood was actually beginning to shrink, rapidly reshaping back inside your body. Almost simultaneously, female reproductive organs were now growing inside of you, full functional as a symbol of womanhood was forming in your groin. It was probably the most painful part, both physically and emotionally as your lower half was transforming into that of a sexy woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving further up, your waist began to twist, shrinking to help form an hourglass figure and forcing your back to curve as well. The shift to your spine hurt as much as anything else by this point, not that you had time to think about it. Furthermore, the tingling moved up to your breasts. You had hoped nothing would happen there, but you were pretty much the unluckiest person at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, you felt a shortness of breath, as your breasts began growing on your chest, ballooning out from their former 38C size. Em was just as shocked at this, and helped to try and sit you up as to let them hang a little and hopefully relieve some pressure. However, one of her hands was on one of your breasts as it happened, letting her feel exactly how big they were getting. They had to be at the limit of what was naturally possible, if not even beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding more, your arms remained as slim as they did before, but your fingernails began growing again, to at least the length they were before. You even felt an itch as you knew hair had to be growing again, and soon enough, long red hair was beginning to flow from your head, cascading all around you. If you were standing up, it would likely be extending beyond your height now.</span></div></div>",

Hiding under your bedsheets refusing to look at yourself as the final changes ravaged your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm waited patiently outside your door for hours. She heard your sobbing, your anger, your yelling in frustration. Finally you passed out from exhaustion so Em decided to let you rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later the sun was already setting. You had spent the better part of the day locked away in your room. Finally Em came back as she knocked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarold...I\u2019m coming in...you can\u2019t hide forever I have to see...\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a clicking noise as the door unlocked as Em slowly opened and walked in. You were standing there wrapped up like a mummy in your covers hiding yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a freak...I\u2019m not just a woman...I\u2019m a total sexual nightmare...\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on...It can\u2019t be that bad...\u201d Em said as she slowly pulled off the covers letting them drop as Em finally got a look at your naked new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look on her eyes said it all. She was shocked and stunned looking at you. It was far more thay she expected...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say you were by far the sexiest woman either of you had ever seen. Your hair had turned from a light autumn red to a deep crimson red. It was the length of your body now, the tips just barely hovering above the floor. It was full, wavy, luxurious, and seemed to glide seamlessly behind you as you walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour skin was now flawless, smooth and tanned perfectly. It looked like you spent a fortune to make your skin so perfect. Not a single body hair anywhere, other than your eyebrows. Which were trimmed perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour nails were long, perfectly manicured, and very feminine. Along with your gorgeous hands they looked like they could be on the cover of a magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour face was stunning. Perfectly shaped feminine features with pouty and soft supple lips. This along with your new higher and softer voice made you quite the stunning beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breasts had also grown several sizes larger. However more importantly they had also changed shape and dimension. They were now perfectly rounded, perky, with no sag at all. They looked like the kind perfect breasts women would have to pay the highest price for, yet they still looked natural hanging from your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hips were much wider and your stomach was flat. Your legs were longer and your butt larger and perfectly tear drop shaped. Your perfectly smooth and hairless slit was the final sign you were now fully a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god....\u201d Em said stunned while looking at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you...what am I supposed to do now? What am I going to do with a body like this?\u201d You said trying to hold back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm was trying not to stare at you but it was obvious your new body was making her sexually aroused. You could see her nipples hardened as she crossed her legs a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Said covering yourself again with a blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry! You know that I am Bi-sexual...You made it clear that it made you uncomfortable when we were dating. You are just so freaking sexy now....\u201d Em said shaking off those feelings for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...I just feel like a freak now. Everywhere I go people are going to stare at me.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that was the cursed intent. Remember Serena said it was to turn you into the thing you had the highest standards for. Listen I will give you clothes but we need to get some new clothes and work on building a new identity for you. From now on I think for safety Harold is gone....Hannah has taken his place.\u201d Em said to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't have too much on hand, and what little she did was hard to adjust to your dimensions. For now, she grabbed some sweatpants she had, for her jeans wouldn't fit too well on you. For a top, she just gave you a normal t-shirt, though even the baggiest one she had would still expose a little bit of skin beneath by virtue of your large breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't I have a bra?\" you asked, groaning a little that you actually have to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you barely even need one,\" Em sighed a little. \"Your breasts look so perky and don't sag at all. They practically hold up on their own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like you're checking me out,\" you retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just making an observation. I know more about these things than you do after all,\" she said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, at least things had calmed down just a little bit. The only positives here were that it was Sunday so still no work, and the fact that you didn't have to try to appear as a guy like this. People could think you were a woman with no problem. So, you didn't have to hide in plain sight, even if the current result heavily irked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe I'm actually somewhat looking forward to more clothes,\" you said as you went alongside Em to her car. \"At least then they won't itch as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax princess, you'll be fine,\" Em smirked a little. Perhaps it was a little in bad taste, but then again you were like this because you disregarded the warning. \"Just be happy I know how to work hair even when it's that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue. Em had actually managed to work your hair into something rather nice, easy to move around in. Guess it was a good thing you had someone as capable as her to help out with this. Better choice than many others. In any case, the drive to the mall was mostly silent except for the radio. The clothes were really uncomfortable, given how they weren't fitted to you. Plus there was the general fact that you were a woman to begin with. The void between your legs was almost maddening in itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you both made it to the mall, with Em taking notes on what to look for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...looks like you're about 5'6\" now...and your breasts are E-cup at least...\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this even natural?\" you said, feeling a little awkward with your arms crossed underneath your chest. Em was right about how they held right up even with no bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it definitely is. I could notice if you somehow got any enhancements in there,\" she said. \"From what I can tell, you're just as far as anyone could possibly go naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unreal....\" you said. You were quite surprised at the idea that anyone could be like this naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut seriously, even walking was so weird. Your legs kept rubbing against each other a little, with your hips and butt kind of doing their own thing as well. Even with the mismatched clothes, you were clearly getting some eyes on you as well, which you tried to ignore. You kept your mind off of it until you reached the clothing store, where Em got to work lining out a wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't need too much, right?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we don't know how long you'll be like this,\" she said. \"Sure, we don't need to get you a full closet but at the very least some to get you through a week.\"</span></div></div>",

Even the other panties seemed perfectly normal so far. You sighed at that, thankful that nothing else was different, although the fact that you had clothes transform at all made you wonder if they were going to change eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Em's voice from behind you. She was standing right there, getting a perfect view of your butt in the thong under the nightie. Great, exactly what you needed, were your thoughts. Shaking your head, you turned to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I need to explain,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....guess so,\" Em said, wearing her usual sleepwear right now. \"Well, think you can get ready yourself? We'll meet my friend at 11.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think I can do it myself,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that you liked it, but you had practice with getting your long hair done in the shower, as well as putting on the feminine clothes. Em suggested a simple blouse and skirt combo, though she also recommended the heels for a good professional look. That didn't sit right with you at all, but you supposed you might as well get used to it for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShowering was still an adventure, dealing with your larger than life breasts and hair. Even your butt's size meant a fair bit of time spent on it. You had to wonder if this was really the \"perfection\" you were looking for. You didn't really think things were that bad......eh, you could think about that later. There were things to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you got prepared as best as you could, sharing breakfast with Em, waited for her to get ready, and then were ready to get going in her car again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you almost have the heels down,\" Em giggled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If by that you mean falling down 5 times, than yeah I have them down,\" you groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, it was in good nature. You knew Em was just messing with you, but it kept things from getting boring.</span></div></div>",

It was just so bizarre. And you probably had the worst luck ever for Steven of all people to be the one seeing you like that and hitting on you.

You also didn\u2019t protest when Em made you wear heels today. In fact your feet weren\u2019t really sore either. In fact...deep down you kinda liked how they felt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been testing you this whole time...You are still slowly changing.

That meeting Steven had come in during was with one of Em's friends who gave him ID's and other materials to at least pose as a woman until things got cleared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know it's crazy,\" you said, sighing. \"But you don't think I'd make up something this convoluted just to prank you right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....I can agree with that,\" Steven said. This was not exactly the kind of prank he'd expect from Harold. \"Admittedly....all this supernatural mumbo jumbo sounds stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you there,\" you nodded. \"Still.....just keep it between us and Em.

Hey, it was progress, better than nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all this made Steven sigh and lean his head back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So basically....I just hit on my best friend which means my charms still don't work as well,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that did lighten things up a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not something I can help with,\" you said, smile still lingering slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the least, it made eating the ice cream easier.</span></div></div>",

You really don\u2019t know a way to reverse it?\u201d Steven asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...The gypsy Madam Serena is looking into solutions but who knows how long thay will take. In the mean time I\u2019m stuck as Hannah.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to get you a job.\u201d Em said back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere can I work with a body like this? I don\u2019t have a resume or any history to go on.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...There is always The Oasis.\u201d Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean that sleazy dance club down town? Are you serious?\u201d Em said to Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey all I\u2019m saying is they hire prettt girls on the spot. You remember my ex-girlfriend Rachel? She has been working there for like six months. She makes way more than me now and I have a regular office job, she only works part time too.\u201d Steven added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about working there?\u201d You asked having never been there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing...unless you have dignity. It\u2019s a water lounge and club. They have a pool and hot tub, and sauna there. It also means all the girls working there have to wear bikinis all the time. Guests also have to change into swimwear upon arrival.\u201d Em said a bit upset at this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it was a permanent option. Just something to get back on her feet.\u201d Steven replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it...In the meantime I need to go lie down.\u201d You replied feeling a bit exhausted today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven left shortly after as you changed into a pair of your old male gym shorts and t shirts. One of the nicer things about being a female now was all your old clothes were huge and baggy on you which made them very comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slept you kept trying to ignore these new feelings you had thinking of anything else but it was getting more difficult now...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Me being a girl now?\" you sighed, still not liking the sound of that of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....a little of that.....but also.....you really look like you're beginning to crush on Steven...\" Em said, sounding very hard to spit that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stiffened a little at the mention of such a thing, though thinking back on how you acted did seem to imply Em was right. You really didn't want to go into details, but some of the things you were feeling did seem to confirm that idea. Such a thing really made you groan. The idea of you liking other guys just felt.....eh, and the idea of you being changed into essentially someone else mentally definitely didn't sit right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I can't...deny that...\" you said that last part slowly. \"I don't like it but...this body just keeps doing it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's exactly what I'm worried about,\" Em said, sitting at the edge of your bed as you were still laying. \"It just....really feels like we'd be losing you in such a case...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, don't tell me you have a crush on me too,\" you replied sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really didn't mean anything by it. That was just you being kind of a jerk. However, Em didn't really reply to it. You could just tell from her posture that she felt just as weird as to this whole situation as you did, but whatever she was thinking was indescribable to you. That's another thing about Em, that you could never really tell what she was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just.....please be careful,\" she said as she got up. \"I feel like you could really lose yourself in a place like The Oasis....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she left, leaving you just to your thoughts.

You were about to knock on the door when you heard an odd noise coming from inside....It sounded like moaning....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm...oh Hannah...Yes...Yes...You are so much better now...\u201d You heard inside as you covered your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed Em really did have a crush on you...To make it worse it even seemed she preferred you in this new body she just couldn\u2019t admit it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading back to bed you curled up not sure what to do with this information. You thought Em wanted to help you get back to normal however if she liked you more like this now was she really trying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou forced yourself to go back to sleep deciding to deal with this another time.

Getting up you went over to your wardrobe and saw all your conservative clothes had changed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPants were now short shorts. Skirts were now mini skirts.

The g-string rode even more up your butt than the thing did. Heck, your butt was essentially naked for all intents and purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pressure of it all alnost made you want to rebel against it like you did before, but you were able to put that aside this time. You didn't want even longer hair and even bugger breasts if that were to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah?....you okay? You heard Em say from your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yeah.....come in....\" You replied slowly. Might as well do it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm came inside, wearing her usual sleepwear. Her eyes visibly widened a little at your sleepwear, and even more so when she looked at your closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is....bizarre,\" she said. \"Just to be sure, you didn't do another rebellious act right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".... No....I just woke up like this...\" You said, not wanting to say more about last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....then you really are slipping into this role.....\" Em sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed at a loss and so did you. You really didn't want to confront her about last night, especially since you kind of eavesdropped on her. Still, it was vivid in your mind, and you still feel your body reacting a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling you had with Steven was still there a little too. Did gender even matter anymore as far as this body was concerned? It worried you to think about such things. Drama was something you were terrible with after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you didn't want to think badly about Em.

What you saw caused your eyes to widen massively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm was there on the phone right outside the shower. She was listening to the water to make sure you were still \u201cgetting ready.\u201d However there was something wrong with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily\u2019s blonde hair was down to her ankles....She never had it that long in her life. She was desperately cutting it with a pair of scissors and throwing the extra hair in the garbage. She was really upset and angry on the phone as you listened in as best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo....You Listen to me Serena! I asked you for a curse to teach my son of bitch Ex-Boyfriend a lesson in humility. You told me the curse would turn him into his own perfect image of a woman. You didn\u2019t say anything about it being transferred to me....My hair is growing back longer every night and my clothes are changing too. I\u2019m only days away from more physical changes than what I am I going to say? Sorry I cursed you for leaving me? She still thinks there is a curse and you are looking for one. Yes yes I know the plan was to make her embrace this new body and give in completely to her new life but she is still resisting. I\u2019m running out of time here! You better find an answer to this or everyone will know there is a witch living upon them!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou backed out slowly...The news hit you like a ton of bricks. All along it was Emily who cursed you. Madam Serena was a witch who gave her the curse to do this to you...However something went wrong and now the curse is slowly spilling over to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went back quickly and turned off the water and came out of the bathroom. You tried to pretend like nothing was wrong for now. You slipped into your room and began to get dressed. Due to clothing issues you had to wear a skimpy mini dress today along with heels. That with a thong underneath it really showed off your figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing out you saw Em standing there smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there.

Hopefully it won't take too long,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably won't. They hire any good looking woman pretty quickly,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose words seemed to have a different meaning given your new knowledge. Honestly, you couldn't help but wonder. Assuming everything was true, could....there be other people cursed like you were? What if The Oasis was full of changed women like you were? Okay, that seemed a little more paranoid the more you thought about it. But still, you couldn't ignore the implications.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you wanted to be really angry at Em for this. It hurt a lot to know she would go this far. Still, you were more confused than anything else. Why was she being affected too? Would her feelings and yours still be the same after the change? What would she even look like.....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, you had a brief image of Em with her long blonde hair, sporting breasts, curves, and a butt as big as yours were. For that second, that actually seemed pretty hot, making your breasts tingle a little. You shook your head of the thoughts though. Couldn't let anyone know what you knew for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, time went by easily and Steven soon came by as agreed. He seemed a little easier now thanks to being more acquainted with the situation, even though it was still weird. You certainly noticed his little blush at your choice of clothing. Great. Seemed like feelings of attraction between the three of you were getting real awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess you better hope Steven didn't get cursed too. Actually......you were kind of worried of that possibility. What would happen if all three of you got caught up as women like this? Perhaps it was just the paranoia, but at this point, anything seemed possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Steven drove you the little distance to The Oasis. It actually had quite the bit of space to itself, having a rather sizable amount of land to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....actually looks nice on the outside,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's nice on the inside too, though....there's well you know,\" Steven said after a little pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I get that,\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you got out of the car, with Steven right behind.

Upon entering Men and Women have to go to a separate locker room and change into swimwear. Normal Shoes were not allowed so everyone walked around either barefoot or in flip flops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the club was a bar, restaurant, pool, jacuzzi, and spa. The was one pool which was shallow and meant for lounging and drinking. There was also another which was deeper and had water slides attached to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an entry fee for anyone to enter it gave them access to all the pools and water areas. Drinks and food were all paid for separately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe decor of the inside was made to look like an exotic island get away. Fake palm trees and beach chairs. Everything to make you feel like you were at a real Oasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing into a sexy black bikini you met up with Steven and for the first time since the change happened you felt....empowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew how sexy you looked and everyone\u2019s eyes were on you as you walked with him. He was trying to act cool but it was obvious he was struggling not to look down your chest or at your butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe owner is over there. Ask for Gary.\u201d Steven said pointing to the Jacuzzi. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath you walked over to the Jacuzzi and asked for Gary. A man looked up to you. He was at least 300lbs and very hairy all over. He was golden chains around his neck and golden rings on almost every finger. He was balding but had a full beard. He seemed to be the kind of rich creep who loved taking advantage of people. There were also two girls around him who looked like they had bodies similar to yours...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d He said looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Hannah. My Friend Steven said you might hire me here.\u201d You said trying confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Sweetie...I have to say you have the hottest I may ever seen. Those tits look fake but who am I to judge. I pay for most of the boob jobs for my girls anyway. That\u2019s just one last thing you would owe me. Hmm...turn around a bit let me see you. You are hot but I\u2019m not sure you are cut out for here. You seem a bit....inexperienced...\u201d he said skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou did as he said and turned around. He got a look at you but he seemed unconvinced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure sweetie...You got the goods but I don\u2019t think you know how to use them...You brought a friend with you?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah...This is my friend Steven.\u201d You said introducing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm....seems like a nice boy...Also a bit inexperienced...Tell you what sweetie. I\u2019ll give you the job when you prove to me and the girls here you have what it takes. Follow me.\u201d Gary said getting out of the tub as he directed you to a private room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary pointed to Steven to sit on the couch in the corner as he stood opposite and watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive your friend a lap dance. Use everything you have. Tits, ass, all of it. I want him begging to take you right here and now. I want him practically ripping through those swim trunks. You convince me you got what it takes the job is yours.\u201d Gary said as he snapped his fingers as some seductive music started playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Steven said looking up to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of giving your friend a strip tease and lap dance made you somewhat sick at first however you needed the job...You also felt a surge of pride and anger at this jerk Gary who had done nothing but doubt you.

You had always had a sense of competitiveness and this was really bringing that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll show you then,\" you said, actually able to straighten yourself up and wiggle your hips and butt a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary just chuckled, backing up a little to give enough space.

Sure, he enjoyed a woman's attention as much as the next guy, but you weren't exactly an ordinary woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again.....that was true. You weren't ordinary. Not just a guy a while ago, but also far hotter than most other women. Granted, those other women you saw that worked here looked very similar to you, but what did that matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I come, Steven....\" you said, trying to sound as seductive as possible, not like you really knew how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, it felt like a rush of emotion. You went right to Steven, sitting on his lap with your legs open, showing off that bikini bottom fully. Truthfully, you had no idea what you were really doing. You were pretty much just going with the flow, going with whatever came to mind that showed off your body. You showed your large breasts right to Steven's face, and even followed by showing the same with your butt. You even reached down a little to show what was underneath said garments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging from Steven's pants, it was having the right affect. You smiled through it all, trying to put on the best front you could. You just doing this little routine throughout the whole music</span></div></div>",

You weren\u2019t sure if it was because of how good you were or how bad you were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad kid....but...I still don\u2019t believe you want this.\u201d Gary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean? I just did everything you asked!\u201d You said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have got the body...but not the spirit. My girls are sex incarnate. They know what men want, they know how their bodies work, and they know how to use it, to get what they want. That\u2019s why my girls can make 1000 dollars a night....\u201d Gary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYours eyes widened a bit. \u201cA thousand a night?\u201d You asked. You had never made that kind of money as Harry in your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo...do they sleep with clients?\u201d You asked. While you were interested in the money you were not going to become a prostitute...You had your standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGary seemed to laugh at the question. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in Vegas very long if they did...No, they dance, talk, party, tease, they put on the show everyone loves. The tips flow like waterfalls around here...hundreds each night for the best girls.\u201d He said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease I need this...what do you want from me?\u201d You said asking for the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm...You are too innocent. Too afraid of your own body. When was the last time you got laid?\u201d Gary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked at the very personal question....how could you answer that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...well...\u201d You started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...You haven\u2019t....You are a swan!  I\u2019ve heard about! Aren\u2019t you?\u201d Gary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....what?\u201d You asked not sure what he meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god...I never thought I would meet one in real life....Sometimes they are called ugly ducklings but when they mature we call them Swans. So there is like a one in a million chance if this happening. Let me guess....In middle school you never developed...You were flat and looked like a boy all through high school...You were the nerdy girl, the band geek, whatever. Then all of a sudden one day you start growing like crazy....boobs start getting bigger your body getting more and more feminine every day...You developed so quick and so fast before you knew it you were sexier than you knew how to handle? Now you are struggling to adjust and desperate for a job that fits your new body right?\u201d Gary said all excited rubbing his hands together in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm....yeah....you got it!\u201d You said looking back to Steven shrugging your head. He wasn\u2019t 100% wrong right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is amazing I never thought I would have my very own Swan come to work for me. Men go crazy for Swans, incredibly sexy but shy, horny as hell but inexperienced. Gives them great power fantasies. Oh...you are gonna make so much money here....\u201d Gary said with the greed in his eyes so bright you could practically see the dollar signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe here at 8pm tomorrow on one condition....\u201d Gary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t hire virgins. Gives off a bad image. Girls here need to know their way around a man. Get laid tonight. Take your friend home and screw his brains out, or somebody else...I really don\u2019t care who. If you don\u2019t I will know because it will show in your training.\u201d Gary said shaking your hand as he left you there with Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUmm...Congrats?\u201d Steven said with a smile a little worried about your next reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back in his car you were silent and wide eyed for most of the trip. You got the offer just not how you expected it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Steven pulled up to your house you had to make a decision. Invite him in or bail on the job....</span></div></div>",

Eh, maybe she was in the bathroom or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.....I feel exhausted just from that alone,\" you said, plopping onto the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watching it was kind of exhausting too,\" chuckled Steven a little, perhaps trying to lighten the mood a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both hadn't really talked about the lap dance you just did on him, although maybe it was because you both knew you were forced into it. You had to admit that....it was kind of strange. You wouldn't say you liked it, though it wasn't too bad either. You weren't sure what to think, but you guessed you'd figure it out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, aside from the looming thought that you'd need to have sex with someone, apparently anyone judging from Gary's words, the news you discovered about Em was more troubling, with her having been behind this and apparently starting to transform herself. You still couldn't help but wonder what else might happen with that. Heck, what if it was some kind of virus-like thing and Steven caught it and all three of you were caught up looking like busty women? Yeah, that didn't sound fun.

However it wasn\u2019t golden blonde anymore...It was a bright platinum blonde. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse her nails, which she always kept very short and never painted were well over an inch long now. They were also painted a very bright pink color...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you opened the door and saw Emily, Steven cake too and gasped as the two of you stared at her as she looked back at the both of you with a look of shock and horror...</span></div></div>",

You didn't want to be mean-spirited about it, but this was rather fitting given Em's guilt into the situation. \"You know more about this than you've let on, haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm's eyes widened a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....were you...listening?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't intend to.

It seemed like nothing other than her hair and nails were different, given her usual clothes still fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm proceeded to walk down to the family room, with you and Steven trailing right behind. Steven in particular looked like he was going to have a headache, not that you could blame him really. This was so messed up, and got even more so with Em's role in it coming to light. Eventually, you all sat down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a little bit, Em eventually started talking. For the most part, it was stuff you already knew, with the intention of the curse being to teach you a lesson. You still wondered if this meant Em liked you more as a woman, but you couldn't tell for sure. Steven's head really looked like it was spinning at the idea of so much coming to light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you really thought that was the best solution?\" you asked, raising your voice a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I had to! You can't deny the fact that you've been an ass in regards to women and just about anything else,\" Em said, obviously still feeling justified in that regard. \"I didn't want that to continue, so I found Madame Serena to help fix it, and the rest is history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet it's also happening to you now, and you don't know why,\" you stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I still don't. I don't get it at all,\" Em said, sounding sadder. \"I'm not sure how I got the curse, or if it can break out some how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.....then what does that mean for me being with the two of you?\" Steven asked out loud, finally getting his head on straight. \"You trying to tell me I might end up like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....maybe. I don't know,\" Em said. \"Maybe nothing will happen. Serena is just as cryptic with me as she is with everyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god.....\" Steven groaned, really not sure where to go with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that note though, someone else came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Em, I'm pretty sure a couple of the women at The Oasis looked very much like I do. Similar bodies and hair and everything,\" you said. \"Anything up with that?\"</span></div></div>",

Just honesty and revealing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSerena is a witch. She is much older than she looks. Some say she is hundreds of years old but nobody knows for sure. After our break up she found me...I\u2019m exactly sure how. However she promised me sweet vengeance against the one who broke my heart. She told me about this curse that  would turn you into a beautiful woman against your will. She handed me a small vial and I spiked your drink that night at the party...\u201d Emily admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe you agreed to all this...\u201d Steven said in a judgemental tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen I made a mistake....A big one...I\u2019m paying for it now I realize it.\u201d Em said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when did you start experiencing changes?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery recently...not until after you had finished.\u201d It started slow like yours but got worse and worse each night. I eventually called Serena and...well...she betrayed me...This was her plan all along...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI finally got my answer last night. Serena keeps her youth but draining...innocence from her victims. Her curses turn her victims into most over sexualized versions of themselves. Eventually changing their minds into nothing more than sex crazed dumb bimbos...Those girls you saw at the Oasis...Those are the previous victims once the curse had taken hold. Gary got all that wealth and power to open the Oasis from his deal with Serena. He finds young girls willing to anything to be prettier and has Serena curse them. She stays young while he inherits another girl for his business. This evil scheme has been going on years now...\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen you were planning on telling me? Or you were you just waiting for my mind to change?\u201d You said a bit angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first...Yes...Serena normally doesn\u2019t curse men. It doesn\u2019t work the same way on them. Normally you should have already lost your mind by now. Serena told me if you fully embraced your body and gave in and worked for Gary she would remove the curse from me....You two were supposed to have sex tonight and once you admitted you preferred being a woman and you liked it better this way I was free...\u201d Emily said with guilt and shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I was just your pawn in all this? A dumb guy used to bang his friend and make him a woman?\u201d Steven said in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt first...Yes...I thought you were the perfect tool. Young, horny, and willing to anything for a pretty girl. That\u2019s why I called you and had you come over. I needed you to see what Harry had become.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah and Steven were furious. They had been used, lied too, and manipulated. The trust they once had in their friend Emily was gone...However They knew there was no going back from here...The real trick was fixing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo how do we break the curse?\u201d You asked Em.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know...Only Gary and Serena have any knowledge about that. Gary has work contracts for every girl who works for him. It is another kind of curse. It prevents them from saying anything against him and binds them to him like<br>\r\nSlaves...You were going to sign one tomorrow...Serena probably knows the counter-curse, but she would never tell us. She would only make this curse worse...\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we have to get information out of one of them, but how?\u201d Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...I could...go to work for Gary. I could try to fake my contact and not sign it? Maybe buy myself some time there and look for answers...\u201d You suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s incredibly risky...You are still at risk with this curse. If you start giving in to your desires you will lose yourself..\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could try and sneak into Serena\u2019s? Try to find some answers in her shop after hours.\u201d Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s even riskier. If she catches you, there is no doubt she would curse you like us....Maybe even worse.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about you? The changes are obviously affecting you.\u201d You said to Emily...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know...they are much worse for me. You had the luxury of having the changes only affect you during your sleep. I am the opposite. I only experience them when I\u2019m awake and they are agonizing and I feel everything....Punishment for my betrayal...She told me.\u201d Emily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we don\u2019t have much time...It could take Hannah days or weeks to find anything at the Oasis. I could sneak in tonight to Serena\u2019s...\u201d Steven said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it is a good idea. I can stay here with Em and help her with any more changes.\u201d You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright...I will be back tonight.\u201d Steven said as he left the two of you to be alone for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down to her chest And than yours Emily was obviously scared. She had small B-cups and your massive perky E-cups or even worse were in her future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you...for not abandoning me to my fate. I know I don\u2019t deserve your friendship after what I did to you but this means the world to me.\u201d Em said crying in your arms a bit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your face softened a little, sighing to yourself as Em wept in your arms. Honestly, you couldn't bring yourself to let go, even with everything that had just happened. You were angry, and certainly wanted to be, and yet something inside you just...couldn't completely hate her for it. Honestly, you think you just wondered....why?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to know.....why?\" you asked. \"I mean.....I know you've had boyfriends before and I'm sure you didn't go this far on them....right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No....\" Em hiccuped a little, tears still evident on her face. \"No I never did this for anyone before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why me?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well......it was because I honestly liked you,\" she said slowly, still breathing deeply. \"You may have not thought so, but I thought we had something special, and then you left just like that. It was the first time I had felt so angry at a break-up...and I guess Serena just happened to prey upon that this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a little taken back by that. Did you really mean that much to her? So much that she was that distraught over the break-up? You weren't sure if that was flattering or still kind of creepy. Maybe both for all you knew. To be fully honest, the idea that she held such love for you at that time did bring a little warm feeling inside you. You had to fight to not show it though, with your body being as sensitive as it was now to any sort of attraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me when I say I wish I could take it all back. It's not worth changing someone over,\" Em said sadly. \"You didn't deserve to have your life torn up because of me.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough of that....\" you said maybe a little forcibly, but you didn't let go of her. \"That's not going to get us anywhere. Let's just hope Steven gets somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so too,\" Em said. \"There's already too many victims....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stayed like that for a few more minutes, just comforting each other. It was only midday after all, and Steven wouldn't do anything until tonight. That left you wondering just what you could do. Perhaps best to not do anything too hasty. You did however wonder the frequency of how often Em would transform. It started slow and then sped up for you, and it seemed like Em was experiencing the same thing. Plus there was that whole thing of it happening when she was awake, which was more often than being asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair and hers really were about the same. Different colors yet vibrant all the same. Your nails were both long too, and you figured the other things would come pretty soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....anything else you know?\" you asked while Em was still in your arms. \"Anything else about those fully-changed women?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really beyond what I already said,\" Em said softly. \"There are small variances between them, like some have larger breasts than others. Some still natural like yours but others grow beyond into enhanced territory. I even know that some can't even wear flat shoes anymore, with their foot muscles only accepting heels so they walk on their toes without them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God....that sounds horrible...\" you muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....and I wouldn't be surprised if I got all of that stuff,\" Em sniffled a bit. \"It's just so-UGH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly cried out, grabbing on to you a little more fiercely. You held on tight, making sure neither of you feel over in the effort. You wondered just what was happening. Okay...her face was the same, as were her breasts......however, right at that moment, she arched her back, thrusting her butt out a little more. Looking over and past the pain on her face, you could see the shorts she had on beginning to stretch. Your eyes widened at that. Her hips and butt were getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.....it's.....tight!\" she grunted. \"H-Help.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it!\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped to get her shorts off, which were still the same by the way. That allowed more freedom for the growth occurring underneath. She gasped out in pain and discomfort as it happened though. Clearly she was right about it being much worse for her than for you. Her hips were reaching even curvier levels, with an ample amount of fat building in her butt as a result. It was becoming just as tear-dropped as your own, and a little bigger than your own too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, you had to admit it was pretty hot. Seeing her enlarged lower half in the open like that was making your nipples stiffen again. Getting your mind off that though, you continued comforting Em, holding her close as she grimaced and cried a little. You could swear even her legs were looking a little different now. They were as long as your own and just as smooth. Her enlarged butt made her panties look like a g-string with how tight they were now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huff.......huff......huff.....\" Em tried taking in deep breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I got you. I got you...\" you said, trying to calm her down. It seemed to work a little bit as she started to calm down just a little, holding on to you all the tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting faster....I just know it....\" she squeaked, fear evident. \"At this rate.....I won't be able to think about much else.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped before talking further, too afraid to speak it. You had no reply, since you couldn't do anything about it anyway. Still, you had to admit you felt kind of sorry for her. I mean...yeah she screwed up big time, but this didn't feel like justice. Condemning her to something worse than what you had just didn't feel right. You could only wonder when the rest would come. Surely, larger breasts than your own weren't too far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Em looked up at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Wha,\" you started to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then though, Em gave you a full kiss on the lips, not so different from the many you both had when you were dating. Suffice to say, you were shocked at that, unable to react while she kept her lips there for a good few seconds until she pulled off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What was that?\" you asked out of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry....I just....acted instinctively....\" she said, fear still there. \"It's just.....I still love you, even after everything that happened....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Em....\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....just indulge me a little bit,\" she said softly. \"If I'm just going to live a sex-crazed bimbo life.....can I at least spend my time with someone I actually love?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a lot in her words. Fear. Desperation. Love. A whole bunch of things going on. You weren't quite sure what to do. It was all so much to take in.</span></div></div>",

You nodded and embraced Em as she suddenly pushed you down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat...what are you doing?\u201d You asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShowing you that being a woman isn\u2019t all bad...\u201d She said with a seductive smile as she began peeling your clothes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily traveled down between your legs as you suddenly let out a loud moan of pleasure. The things she was doing with her fingers and tongue were things you used to do to her as a guy. You had no idea the pleasure it gave however as you gripped the cushions panting as you felt your first female orgasm hit your body like a tidal wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh....OH GOD!\u201d You cried out as it hit you. The pleasure far more intense than when you were a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere...where did you learn that?\u201d You asked panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrom you silly....You May have been a jerk sometimes but you were skilled in the bedroom.\u201d She said back to with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you embraced each other that. Taking turns making each other Cum several times. It was a blissful night of passion the two of you shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slept together on your bed cuddled up in each other\u2019s arms. Your breasts pushed up against each other\u2019s as your long hairs covered your like a Crimson and platinum blanket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slept soundly for the first time since this whole thing happened. Not once did your body bother you. You let your mind clear itself as you just lived in the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014The Next Morning\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunlight gave you a rude awakening as you yawned and looked over seeing Em had already gotten up. From the smell of things she was making coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out you smiled at her. She was standing there naked her new perfect and sexy butt staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there sleepy head...\u201d She said looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey yourself...\u201d You said back to her. Giving her a bit of a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny word from Steven?\u201d Em asked tapping her coffee cup a bit impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo...nothing yet. Hopefully by tonight.\u201d You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine...it\u2019s just I\u2019m getting a bit worried about how much time I have left before.....before....before....OH MY GOD!\u201d Emily said crying out as she dropped her coffee cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm fell on her back as she looked down to her chest. Her modest B cups were beginning to pulse and swell....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo....not yet....Not now!\u201d She cried out for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Em take my hand!\u201d You said rushing over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts wasted no time in getting bigger. They were pulsing and growing with each breath she took. Quickly going past Cs then Ds then Es. They were even bigger than yours now and not naturally looking at all...Perfectly rounded huge porn star tits now hung from her chest. Massive heavy G or H cups now. Far beyond natural growth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou helped Em stand up as her new balance took some getting used to. She began to feel and grope her new chest as she looked back to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much time left...by tonight my body will changed...My mind maybe a few days after...\u201d She said with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me...we will fix this...\u201d You said trying to calm her down. </span></div></div>",

The anticipation of some kind of news from Steven was hard to grip with, and you wondered why he hadn't sent any sort of news yet. To be honest, the fact that he had said nothing so far was worrisome. You'd think he would have replied by the time he had finished last night. So why......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at the least, your primary concern was helping Em. Much of your anger had subsided by this point, perhaps as a result of last night's love making. That didn't mean everything was forgiven, but....you could at least acknowledge how sincerely sorry Em was for making this whole mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer new transformation made it impossible for any of her old clothes to fit as nothing she owned could cover her breasts and butt now, leaving her just naked in the house. You'd be lying if you said you didn't enjoy the view though, and kept gently embracing her through her occasional sobs. Her new breasts truly were massive and heavy, making you wonder just how she was going to be able to walk with them. Heck, you were surprised breasts even could get that big without exploding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEm continued to say she was sorry over and over, truly feeling a sense of hopelessness. You tried to help encourage her a little. Heck, a little after breakfast, the two of you shared a shower together, which did help to alleviate the tension somewhat. Living in the moment did have its perks after all. Heck, having her helping out got stuff like your hair done much quicker, and you could even help her with yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after you had gotten casually dressed for the day, which meant little given how much had transformed by this point, the little bit of clothes Em had looked like they were transforming, pretty much into what you'd expect. At the very least, it allowed her to somewhat cover up, even if it was just a bra and g-string. Good thing you guys didn't really need to go anywhere at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Em rarely if ever left your side. She was determined to spend every last minute with someone she truly loved before it didn't matter anymore.</span></div></div>",

Throwing yourself angrily onto the sofa, you fold your arms in front of your chest, as you bounce into the comfy seat. As you feel your sharp nails digging into your flesh, you unfold them. Regretting cutting them so haphazardly, you look at the sharp edges and uneven cuts. Sure you've just given yourself scratches on your tits you scowl at the outstretched hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the remote, you turn on the TV. Eager for some noise just to drown out the changes, you don't listen to it, or even glance in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of a manicure to even them out, and make them look better comes to mind. As you hold them out, you glare at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longer you stare, the longer they seem. Sure it's a trick of the light, you turn your hands back and forth, examining them from different angles. It feels like forever, as you weigh up whether they are growing, or it's just your fear or imagination. Dismissing the thought, you turn your attention to the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to throw the remote through the screen, as you see everyday daytime BS, being broadcast. Two hosts raving about the latest beauty 'breakthrough'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScowling, you try to ignore their voices, their advice. But the model they're working on does look good. As the camera cuts away from her manicure, it quickly passes over her beaming face. Erupting from the seat, you recognise her face. Standing up, you point to the screen, as if there was a witness to the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no mistaking it now. Those nails are longer. In fact, they're back as if they were never cut. Hell, longer than before. The shade of bimbo pink another humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat triggers another thought, and you pull your hair around to see it's returned with a vengeance. It flows richly through your fingers glossy and long. The curse fighting back against your resistance, and it's working. Further thoughts of repeating this dwindle in your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlumping back to the sofa, the familiar bounce, feels different. Heavier? More painful?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see your top straining. More flesh contained in the same clinging top. Your ripe nipples rudely press against the fabric visible to everyone. More fleshy supple goodness driving them forward too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to wail at the unfairness of it all. Wail or weep, you aren't sure which would feel better.</span></div></div>",

As you begin to step out of your car, you hear a <i>BEEP BEEP.</i> You jump as you hear a loud honking coming from behind you. You turn around, ready to yell at whomever it might have been. To your surprise, it's Steven. He pulls into a visitors parking spot and quickly hops out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man! Did you not hear me back there? I was shouting your name but you didn't respond.\" Steven shouts from the other side of the parking lot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as you would like to avoid somebody seeing your boobs and strange hair, there's really no way out of this current predicament without being a total asshole. You respond, \"Nah, I guess I didn't. Were you at the restaurant too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was shouting your name but you seemed like you were ignoring me.

You steal something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven reaches his hand up to the zipper on your jacket. You know what he's about to do and you try to stop him, but fail horribly due to the bag in each hand.

You watch his face turn to a bright red as he discovers the reason you had the jacket on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Sorry man, I uh... I didn't expect you to be wearing a bra. By the way, I meant to ask sooner, but what's up with the long red hair? Did it grow overnight or something?\" he asks, trying to turn the subject away from what he believes is just you cross-dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it did actually.

He accepts it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain everything as you eat your food. Answering questions along the way. You even lifted your shirt up to show him that your boobs are real. Of course, he wanted to feel them, but that wasn't going to happen. You include all of the details of your breakup, to get that out of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you're finished explaining and answering all his questions, you're both several beers in and a couple of hours have passed. You sit quietly as Steven stares out the window. He appears to be thinking about everything you've said. Maybe he's just absorbing it, it is a lot to take in after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he speaks, \"So, these changes have been happening each time you fall asleep right? Could it be that sleep is what triggers the next change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible, but nothing changed when I went back to sleep after buying a bra last night. Granted, I had just woken up with these on my chest just a few hours before that,\" you reply, pointing at your boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe appears to be thinking again. While you wait for him to respond, you grab your empty beer bottles and take them to the kitchen. \"You want another beer? I still have a few more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I'm good for now. So it probably isn't sleeping that triggers a change then. So could it be on a timer? You said that you woke up last night around what, just after 12:00 AM? it's now almost 6:00 PM and nothing new has happened. Unless you're not going to change at all anymore, something else might happen between now and midnight, right?\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you think about it, what he's saying does make sense. Not that it really helps with figuring out the why, but figuring out when it happens is a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense, I guess. So we have six hours to kill before we might see the next change. Do you want to stay here tonight and see what happens next?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteven replies....</span></div></div>",

As you open your mouth to speak, Steven holds up a finger, to tell you to wait. He hands you his phone, with the front camera open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly take the phone from his hands and hold it up to your face. You don't even recognize yourself anymore. Your eyes are bright green. You have light freckles from one cheek to the other. Your facial hair is completely gone. Your eyebrows match your red hair, are thinner, and have a more pronounced arch. Your jawline is much softer and more feminine. Your skin is perfectly smooth. Your eyelashes are longer. You look like a beautiful Irish girl. After staring at yourself for several minutes, you finally put the phone down and look back to Steven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw this happen? What did it look like?\" You ask. You note that your voice is still the same, which probably sounds weird coming from your beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was pretty cool. There was a ripple effect over your skin, and suddenly it started rearranging itself. It only took a few seconds, as I said. It's kind of hard to explain. It definitely happened at midnight though, so you've got just under 24 hours before the next change happens.\" He replies as he sits down on the other side of the couch again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. What are you going to do? It's going to be impossible to go out like this. On the bright side, Em probably wouldn't recognize you, so you don't have to worry about that for now. You lay your head back and quickly fall asleep again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, Steven is still in the same place he was when you fell asleep. He's still sleeping. You get up and head to the bathroom. You stop at the mirror and examine your face. You bring a hand up to feel your face. You slide your fingers over your cheek, still having trouble believing that it's your own face. It feels so smooth. Although it looks weird on your still mostly male body, it really is a beautiful face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your done admiring your new face, you take a shower. You head to your room and put your bra back on. You're getting better at putting it on without struggling. You should probably get a couple more of those eventually. When you return to the living room, you see Steven's awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, man. I'm still not used to you with that face. I thought you were a girl for a second there.\" He says, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Very funny.\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm about to head out. It was good seeing you. Also, keep me updated on what's going on.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do. It was good seeing you too, thanks for helping me figure out when the change happens.

You can see your family through the window, sitting at a booth, waiting for you. You've been trying to figure out what to say all day. So far you've come up with nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a couple of quick breaths to try and get yourself ready and push your way through the doors as fast as you can. You pass the hostess who gives you a strange look and you continue to the booth where your family is sitting. You sit down next to Lindsey and look at each of your family members. They all look terribly confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong table.\" Your mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is the right table... Mom.\" She furrows her brows as she tries to make sense of what's going on. Your father and sister both look at her to see what she says next. You continue, \"It's me, Harold. I know this is weird, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know my son, and you're not him. I think you have the wrong table, <i>miss</i>.\" your father interrupts you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys, don't you recognize my voice?\" you ask, hoping that it's enough to convince them. \"I swear, it's me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like him, but I'm sorry I just don't believe you. Is Hal trying to play some sort of prank on us? Is that what this is? It's not funny if so.\" Your mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not a prank. Please believe me, isn't there something I can do to prove it?\" You ask, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter both of your parents ask a series of questions about your life, and you answer them all correctly, you feel like you've proven your identity pretty well. \"Do you believe me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey still don't seem convinced. You turn to Lindsey who hasn't said anything the entire time. She stares into your hopeful eyes and then leans in, putting her mouth up to your ear. She whispers \"Where's the scar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes grow wide. Of course! When you were 8 and she was 7, you were out in the woods by yourselves. You climbed a tree and Lindsey tried to follow you. She fell out of the tree and a branch cut a large gash in her right hip. You weren't supposed to be out there by yourselves and neither of you wanted to get in trouble, so you cleaned up her wound and bandaged it up. Somehow your parents never noticed it and so you never got in trouble. The two of you swore to never tell them about it. You're the only two people that know about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move your hand down to your right hip and point your finger at it while nodding at her own hip. She looks back to your parents and says \"It's our Hal alright!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo they believe it or are they still skeptical?</span></div></div>",

I still don't believe it,\" your dad says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom crosses her arms and nods her head to say no. \"Yeah, I'm not buying it. Are you in on the prank too, Lindsey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, you get up from the table. \"Fine, don't believe me! But when you suddenly can't find 'Harold' as you know him, don't be surprised because it really is me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou storm out of the restaurant and head home. You can feel your phone being blown up with calls and texts the whole way. When you arrive, you go straight to your room and fall face down in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this happening to me? What do I do?\" You say as you roll over and pull your phone from your pocket. Five missed calls from Mom, two from Dad and three texts from each. They're demanding to know what's going on, why you didn't show up for dinner, and what is with the prank. You toss your phone to your side. You can deal with that later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of sulking in bed, you hear a knock on your door. You get up to investigate. It's Lindsey. As you open the door she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... I thought you might need some company? Just so you know, I totally believe you. I don't think you would ever make up something as bizarre as this.\" She says, she has a very kind voice and hearing it makes you feel a little better about what transpired at dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Come on in.\" You say as you beckon her to come inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing? I brought some wine if you want some!\" A drink sounds great right now. You take two glasses from the cabinet as she sets her things on the counter. She pours the wine into each glass and the two of you move to the couch to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see it's not just your face, huh?\" She says as her eyes move down to your breasts. You sigh and pull your hair down from the bun you put it in before dinner. You explain what change has happened each night for the past three days. Then you move on to how Steven helped you determine that it happens at midnight each night. You explain the events of each day, and how you had to go out and buy yourself a bra in the middle of the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter explaining the changes, you move on to talking about the breakup, explaining all the details as you know it. Lindsey gives her sympathy, she knows how much you cared about Emily and how much you liked her. She thinks that you could still work things out with her. Maybe you can, but it's going to be hard when you look like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you ask how the rest of dinner went after you left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Lindsey starts, she seems like she doesn't know how to put it. \"I'm not going to lie, it was awkward. They were mad, and they think you flaked on dinner or that you thought you were funny pranking them like that. Mom did remember something interesting before I left though. Her sister's natural hair color is the same bright red that yours has become. She also has green eyes. She has a lot more freckles on her face than you do, and I think on her chest too, but still. I just thought it was interesting. You may have some recessive genes from mom's side that are being brought out by the changes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is an interesting thought. You wonder why those genes weren't showing when you were completely male. Maybe your Y chromosome contained the dominant genes.  \"That would explain a lot. So this is what I might have looked like had I been born a girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. At least, that's my hypothesis, it would explain why you look so much different than how you did as a guy.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the remainder of the night, you catch up with Lindsey about what's going on in her life and eventually lose track of time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen midnight rolls around, you're caught off guard when suddenly your...</span></div></div>",

You've both lost track of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you think your next change will be?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I mean, it could be anything, you know? My feet, my hands, my legs, hell I could shrink down a few inches.\" You laugh as you try to imagine what you would look like with all the different changes. You already look strange enough, having a body shaped like a man, but with a feminine face and hair and boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if your penis... disappears?\" You had been avoiding thinking about that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's hope that doesn't happen for a while,\" you don't notice that the clock just changed to 12:00 AM. Your throat starts to feel a little itchy. \"Hopefully it will be something small this time. I don't know if I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cut your sentence short. The itchiness has subsided, but your voice suddenly sounded like it was significantly higher. Like your vocal folds have shortened, making your voice sound softer and more feminine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" Lindsey exclaims, \"Did your voice just change? Talk again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, well I guess it's better than losing my dick.\" Your voice is kind of sexy. Lindsey's jaw drops. It's not surprising, she was there to witness one of the changes first hand, which probably helps relieve any doubt that may have remained about your changes being real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! That's unreal! You know, you kind of sound like Margot Robbie but without the accent.\" She would say that. As a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan, she's seen The Wolf of Wall Street too many times to count, so she's definitely familiar with how her voice sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although it sucks for you that this is happening, this is kind of exciting for me. You know you're the best brother I could ever ask for, but I always kind of wished I had a sister.\" She suddenly jumps from her spot on the couch and runs to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask. The sound of your own voice is still weird. She doesn't respond. You roll your eyes and check your phone for the first time all night. Weird, you missed a call from Emily about an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey suddenly returns with the remaining wine, a small notepad, and a pen. She splits up the wine into both of your glasses. You take a sip as you watch what she does next. She begins quickly scribbling on the notepad. When she finishes, she hands it to you and asks: \"Is this accurate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the notepad, it reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nCurrent Changes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    1. Hair<br>\r\n    2. Boobs<br>\r\n    3. Face<br>\r\n    4. Voice<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, they've happened in that order.\" you say, handing the notepad back to her. She begins scribbling again. You continue to sip your wine and watch. She finally finishes and hands it to you again. Now she's added an additional list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nNext Changes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    1. Hands<br>\r\n    2. Feet<br>\r\n    3. Body Hair/Skin<br>\r\n    4. Penis -&gt; Vagina<br>\r\n    5.

Chest size - Part of shoulders?<br>\r\n  13. Will your head get smaller with height, keeping it in proportion to your body?<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, unless your bone structure is going all change at the same time, it looks like it could be up to two more weeks before all of the changes are complete.\" You nod in agreement. That makes sense. You stare are the list wondering what will change tomorrow night.</span></div></div>",

You don't have much of a choice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou each put one of her arms around you as you carry her to your bed. As soon as you lay her down and move her into a comfortable position, she seems to fall asleep immediately. You check her pulse just to make sure she's okay. Upon confirming she is, you return to the living room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should probably sleep here tonight too,\" you say to Lindsey. \"I'll get some blankets from the closet for us. The couch should be long enough that we can sleep on opposite ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey agrees. You say goodnight and you both pass out pretty quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The next day -</i><br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you see Lindsey is already awake. She on her phone, scrolling away, probably on Instagram or something. She looks to you when she notices that you're awake. She smiles, \"Good morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, did you sleep okay?\" Your voice takes you by surprise. You had almost forgotten about the change last night. You yawn and brush your bright red hair out of your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your voice is just so cuuute!\" Lindsey says, giggling as she teases you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, ohhh my god, isn't it just the best?\" You say, nailing a perfect valley girl accent. Lindsey brings her hand to her mouth as she tries not to burst with laughter. You chuckle at how surprisingly good you are at the accent. \"Anyway, how's Emily? Has she woken up yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she's still out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, glad you don't have to deal with that just yet. You and Lindsey go about your morning. You take a shower first, she takes one after you're done. She pokes her head out of the bathroom after she's finished her shower<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... We really need to have a serious discussion about your hair care,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask, completely unsure of what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well for starters, what in the world is this?\" She holds up your $0.99 value-sized bottle of shampoo. \"Second, where's your conditioner? Please tell me you have some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with my shampoo? And no, I haven't been using conditioner, why does it matter?\" you ask, still confused about what the issue is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harold! Look at your hair. You have beautiful, thick hair that flows down past your shoulders. You have to take care of it. You can't let it dry out and get damaged by only using this cheap shampoo. It was fine when you were a guy. It's fine in an emergency type of situation where it's your only option, like for me right now. However, using it every day? That's not going to work. You also <i>NEED</i> to get conditioner, like today. Think about it. You're putting this shampoo in your hair, removing all the oils. How are the ends supposed to stay healthy? They're going to dry out without conditioner. You'll have split ends galore!\" She says all this as if you should already know by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea. Will you help me out then? I have no idea what to get.\" You ask, genuinely needing some help with all this new stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will, that's what sisters are for!\" She closes the door and finishes up in the bathroom. While you wait for her to finish, you make breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do I smell pancakes?\" Lindsey asks as she puts on a shirt she borrowed from your closet. You nod and start putting food on each of your plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on? How did I get here?\" You hear Emily's voice coming from the doorway to your bedroom. Your eyes grow wide. You set the pan down and start walking over to her.</span></div></div>",

She stares for what feels like an eternity before finally speaking again. \"Put that thing away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou button your pants and bring the other two plates of food to the table for you and Lindsey. The three of you eat in silence for a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you were telling the truth before you showed me your penis just so you know. I was curious as to how far you'd go to prove that it was you.\" Emily says, almost with a smug tone of voice. Like she just won a battle or something. \"You're very pretty, by the way.

Emily explains that she was upset that you weren't talking to her, and so she went out drinking last night. She remembered calling you but she had no memory of coming to your apartment. You tell her that you and Lindsey are planning on going to the store to get some better shampoo and conditioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I come?! I always told you that shampoo you use is crap!\" Emily says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess that's fine.\" You say, suddenly feeling like the trip to the store is going to end up being more than you originally thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily puts her dish in the sink and runs to the bathroom to get ready.

Lindsey and Emily lead you around the store, explaining the benefits of each brand of shampoo and conditioner. Finally, you decide on one. You're blown away by the $18.99 price of each. Having felt like you were getting weird stares since you walked in, you're ready to leave. You begin to walk toward the front counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ah-ah, where do you think you're going? We're not done here!\" Emily says. As she drags you back, you see Lindsey smiling. What are they up to? Were they planning something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lead you to the hair tools. First Lindsey picks up a hairdryer and hands it to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just let it air dry all the time. It takes way too long. Plus if you blow dry your hair, it will be easier for you to style it for the day. It gives you more control, really.\" Lindsey says. Emily nods along with what Lindsey is saying as she picks up another box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll probably want to straighten your hair eventually, so you may as well get the straightener now,\" she says as she places the box on top of the blow drier in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While you're at it, here's good curling iron. I have the same one.\" Lindsey places the curling iron on top of your stack. Emily comes up from behind you and puts a bottle of something on top of the stack. You hadn't even noticed she had walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here's some heat protectant spray. You'll need that.\" Assuming you're done now, you once again start heading towards the registers. Before you make it, Emily comes up from behind and turns you down an aisle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast.\" Lindsey and Emily walk you down each aisle, now adding different makeup products to your growing stack of items. Why did you agree to this? They pick out several different sets of eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, every color of eyebrow pencil, foundation, a bag to hold all the makeup, etc. They move on to different kinds of skin care products for your face. Finally, they look through everything in your stack one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's everything you need,\" Lindsey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can't think of anything else.\" Emily agrees. \"I think we're finally done, Harold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you finally head to the counter. You see the total rising exponentially every time another product is scanned. The cashier finally finishes scanning everything. The total comes out to just over $600. A lot more than you were planning on spending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's getting late, so you pick up some food on your way back to the apartment. When you get there, Emily and Lindsey help you bring in all the bags and organize everything in your new makeup bag. When you finish eating, Emily and Lindsey give each other a look. They both turn to you, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's going on? Is there something on my face?\" You ask. What's up with them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Lindsey starts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were hoping you would let us do your makeup!\" Emily interrupts Lindsey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just so pretty, and we want to see what you look like,\" Lindsey says.</span></div></div>",

You hadn't seen her this excited since her birthday last year when you took her to Disney World. It's nice to see that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go take another shower. Use the new shampoo and conditioner you got,\" Lindsey says as she pushes you toward your bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a quick shower, making sure to use the conditioner this time. You get out and wrap the towel around your waist. When you walk out of the bathroom using your hand and arm to cover your breasts, Emily jumps off the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" she asks. Not sure what she's referring to, you furrow your brow. She grabs the towel from your waist. You instinctively use your other hand to cover your groin. \"This needs to go much higher. Move your hands. I've seen you naked before, it's really not a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rewraps the towel around you so it covers your boobs and your manhood. It feels weird having the towel so high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't really matter around us, but this is for future reference,\" she says as you turn and walk to your room to put on clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw on some gym shorts and a t-shirt before returning to the living room. They already have everything set up on the coffee table. They've been patiently waiting for you to come back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ready?\" Lindsey asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I'll ever be,\" you say as you sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour and a half later -<br>\r\n\"I think that's it,\" Emily says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" is all Lindsey can manage to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to see the fruits of our labor?\" asks Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, \"Let's see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes,\" Lindsey says. They each grab one of your hands and lead you to the bathroom. \"Okay, you can open them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see the most beautiful red-head you've ever seen staring back at you. No, wait, that's your reflection. That's you! You're the beautiful red-head. You lean forward and bring your hand to your face. You can't believe that you're looking at your own reflection. You can't get the shocked expression off your face. Your hair is tied back in two perfect Dutch braids, the ends of which are falling down onto your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean you like it?\" Emily asks, she's clearly very happy with how good of a job they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he does,\" Lindsey says, smiling at you. \"don't worry, we'll teach you how to do it yourself. It's nothing too difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look incredible...\" you say, still in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finally get over the shock of seeing your reflection like that, Emily and Lindsey spend the next few hours teaching you how to do your hair. From different kinds of braids to space buns and loose/messy buns &amp; braids for quick hairstyles when you're feeling lazy in the morning. They make you repeat each one they show you until you're able to do it well. It's a lot to remember but you're thankful to have them both there to teach you these types of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they're done showing you different hairstyles, they decide to spend the night at your apartment again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow we teach you how we did your make up so be ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all sit on the couch, you can't help but enjoy the girl talk. Something you might usually find obnoxious, you suddenly found yourself very interested in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You slowly start to move, putting your arm under Emily to stop her from falling over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you manage to slide off the couch without waking anybody, you make your way to the bathroom. You use the wall to guide you in the dark. Walking feels weird for some reason. You can't quite put your finger on it though. You make it to the toilet and pull down the front of your shorts to pee. You close your eyes, leaning your neck back as you wait for the pee to start splashing in the toilet. Except... It never does. There's a warm feeling running down your leg though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that your aim was just completely off, you open your eyes to look down and adjust. That's when you see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aim wasn't off. Your dick is just gone. You knew it was going to happen sooner or later, but you were really hoping it would be later. You quickly spin yourself around and sit down on the toilet seat to stop the pee from continuing to run down your leg. Holding your head in your hands with your elbows resting on your thighs, you sigh. That's it. You can't really consider yourself a man anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish peeing, you grab some toilet paper and wipe your vagina before flushing. You move to the sink to wash the pee from your leg and hands. After leaving the bathroom, you go to your room to change shorts before you make your way back to the couch. When you get there, you move Emily back to her spot on your shoulder to fall back asleep.</span></div></div>",

You still have another 60 some odd hours of PTO to use up, so you may as well wait until then to make a decision on what to do about that. You shake off those thoughts and grab a bottle of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome alone time after last night's discovery sounds kind of nice actually. You take a quick shower. You skip washing your hair today, as you don't want to take out your braids. You get out and look at your reflection in the mirror. It's pretty weird looking. You have a male figure, but female parts and a beautiful face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing on some sweats and a t-shirt, you fall face first into your bed. It pushes against your boobs, causing you to yelp in pain. You can't help but feel bad. Why is this so hard for you to accept? It's happening, the sooner you accept that the easier it's going to be. At this point, you really may as well accept it. You keep thinking about it, as you try to come to terms with everything and accept what's happening. You fall asleep without even meaning to.</span></div></div>",

You can't sleep all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open you're eyes and see Emily sitting next to you on the bed. She's smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God,\" you think, \"I really miss waking up to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't even mean to fall asleep. What have you been up to today?\" you ask, rubbing your eyes as you sit up in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much. I ran by my place, showered, and changed clothes. I went by my parent's place to talk to them for a little bit. I brought you lunch. It's a chicken sandwich. I thought you might be hungry. I also grabbed a couple of changes of clothes... I was thinking about staying here for at least the next few days to help you out with this stuff. I mean, if that's okay with you, that is.\" She says with hopeful eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'd be great. If I'm being honest, I've really missed having you around. Plus, you were a huge help yesterday. You and Lindsey both were.\" You try not to tear up, thinking about how great they've both been. It's not like you to be so emotional. Maybe it's from the female hormones rushing through your body, now that you're officially a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Lindsey mentioned she might stay here a little longer too. I know she's been really enjoying spending time with you.\" Her eyes grew wide as she realized she hadn't noticed anything different about you today. She begins examining you, from your hands to your feet to your legs, everything. Finally, she only has one thing left to check. She reaches her hand out to see if your member is still there. The feeling of her touching your new vagina tickles, making you fidget. She pulls back, \"No way. It happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, laughing a little as you recall what happened when you discovered the change, \"Last night actually, I woke up to pee. It was kind of a mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to be taking it better than I would have expected,\" Emily says, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking about it earlier, and I don't know why I'm fighting it so much, you know? There's nothing I can do about it, and while I would really like to know <i>why</i> it's happening, there's no point in being so against it. I mean, I'm not, like, happy about it, but at the same time, I think I'm finally coming to terms with it.\" You scratch your head as you talk, finding it strange that it took you this long to get to this point even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily seems happy that it's not bothering you so much anymore. She goes to the other room and gets the food she brought home and brings it to you. You eat and continue talking for a while. You joke around and talk about random things, just like you did before the breakup. She shares some gossip about some of her friends. After an hour and a half, you're both getting tired of sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you ready to learn how to do your makeup? I brought some extra makeup from my place for us to use so we don't waste the stuff you just bought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do it,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the remainder of the day learning how to do your makeup. Finally, after hours of practicing, you get it perfect. Of course, there was a lot of time spent in those hours where you and Emily were distracted by either the TV or making fun of each other for whatever nonsense you came up with. You proudly walk around the apartment with your makeup on, making weird faces like you're modeling for pictures, making Emily laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround 8 o'clock, Lindsey returns. She has a large backpack on. \"Hey guys, sorry I'm getting here so late. I had to run by my house and get some things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in the bag?\" Emily asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, some clothes for myself, and I brought a few things that I thought Harold could use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" you ask, your interest piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeelll,\" she says, setting her bag down and unzipping it. \"Here's a sports bra. It was a little big for me, but I thought it might fit you. Here's a pair of jean shorts, and some yoga pants. The jeans might fit you weird until the changes are finished. The yoga pants should fit now, and when the changes are done, unless your ass ends up huge. I also brought a pair of cute sweatpants. They're pink! Well, like a blush pink. That's all for now. I might have more stuff, but I'd have to dig for it. We can all go shopping together when the changes are finished so we can get you the right sizes.\" You hug your sister, thanking her for thinking of you and giving you some new clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Emily do your makeup today?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! I did it all by myself!\" you say, still proud of how good of a job you did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, did she teach you without me?\" she's disappointed. She wanted to be a part of it. \"Well, you did a good job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hands you the stack of clothes she brought for you and you take them to your room. You return to the living room and Lindsey and Emily want to...</span></div></div>",

That doesn't seem like such a good idea with the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be fun,\" says Lindsey. You reluctantly agree. You put on the sports bra that Lindsey gave you, hoping it might make your boobs more manageable. You put a t-shirt on over it and a pair of jeans. Emily and Lindsey don't look particularly thrilled with your outfit choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, it's hard to pick something out for this body,\" you say, defending your outfit. They seem to be slightly more understanding now. You notice their outfits. Emily is wearing a pair of short black heels, a tight black skirt, and a white cropped halter top. Lindsey is wearing slightly higher heels than Emily. She has on a tight army green long sleeve shirt that hangs off of her shoulders, and a pair of black skinny jeans with tears scattered up the legs. They both look fantastic compared to you. \"At least you two look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>30 minutes later</i><br>\r\nYou arrive at a bar. Emily leads you inside, pulling your hand as she walks. You follow her inside and find a spot at the bar. You order an appletini, figuring you may as well take advantage of being able to order fruity drinks without feeling less masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sip your drink, you notice different men looking your way. Each one looks at your face with interest, but you can see that interest fade as their eyes make their way down your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,\" you think, \"Not like I want their attention anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to face Emily and see that she's talking to a guy. You catch the last part of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, why won't let me buy you a drink?\" the guy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, man, I'm interested in someone else. It's not going to happen.\" That's weird. Who's she interested in? Or was she just saying that to get rid of him? You watch the guy walk away, moving on to the next girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody should kick him out. What a pest,\" Emily says. You're still wondering who she's interested in. Is she really over you so soon? \"Hey, Harold, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap back to reality, \"Yeah, I'm fine. What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some asshole that wouldn't leave me alone. He didn't seem to understand that I already have somebody else that I like.\" She looks at you seductively as she takes another sip of her drink. Could she be talking about you? You finish your drink and ask the bartender for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, it comes time to leave, Lindsey has to help you and Emily to the car. It's a good thing she was being responsible. During the drive back, you and Emily drunkenly sing along with the music playing on the radio, laughing the whole time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to the apartment, you lean on each other for balance as you walk into the apartment, still laughing the whole way. Lindsey rolls her eyes at both of you. You make your way to the bedroom with Emily and crash into the bed. Both of you continue giggling as you lay there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to remove your shirt, whining \"I'm hoooooot\" as you do. Emily laughs and rubs her hands up your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your skin is so smooth now... Hey, why didn't I ever notice you have freckles?\" she asks, pointing to the light freckles on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have freckles,\" you laugh, before realizing what was going on. You reach into your pocket and pull out your phone. Holding it up to your face, you squint to read the time. \"12... 38, I guess that was tonight's change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drop your phone next to your head as Emily rubs her hand up and down your arm.</span></div></div>",

Em, what are you doing? You broke up with me, remember?\" you say, feeling unsure about what's happening. She pulls down your jeans and boxers along with them, revealing your new vagina. You can feel yourself becoming more and more turned on by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do remember, but I think that it was a mistake. I've never been as happy as I have these past couple days with you. I've missed you so much. I still love you,\" she pauses as she strips out of her clothes, \"plus, look at you. You're turning into one of the sexiest women I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her call you sexy turns you on even more. She spreads your legs apart and gently rubs her fingers over your labia. When she hears you beginning to moan, she moves her head down sliding her tongue inside of you. You cry out as you feel a new type of pleasure. As she feels you getting wetter she moves up to your clitoris. You scream in pure ecstasy as you feel your first orgasm from your new equipment. She continues to pleasure you, causing orgasm after orgasm. You pant as she lies down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn,\" she says seductively. You move your body on top of hers, starting by imitating everything she just did to you. She cries out your name as you find her g spot with your finger.

Spotting your gaze, he nods beckoning you over. He recognises you, even if you don't recognise your own name in that damned language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your luggage from you, he wheels it towards the exit. His babbling conversation switching to English, after a sentence or two. Blank incomprehension on your face, enough of a clue for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking business with him on the journey reveals he doesn't understand English well, or perhaps it's your aspect of business consultancy that he can't grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the luggage, you wonder what you'll find when you open it. Will it still have your former clothes, or something that suits your new body. The thought makes you queasy in either case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he leads you to the reception desk of the hotel and books you in. A strange country has never felt more terrifying than now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaves you alone, with a promise to pick you up, tomorrow morning at 8:00. With a friendly wave, he leaves you alone in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPouring yourself a drink, you need something to calm your nerves. The glass of Red, feels bigger than normal. But your head spins as you think of that, is it bigger, or does it just seem that way from your new vantage point. In either case, you quickly down half.

Damn, but she's busty, an uncomfortable realisation that you aren't sure what that means now. Whether you're jealous, or still enjoying some residual masculinity. It's a short, dress she's wearing or perhaps just a long jumper.

Squeezing your eyes shut against the glare, you patch together the oddities.... Well, the ones beyond your constantly changing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping your eyes closed, but not screwed tight shut helps. You think of Hank, and his likes and dislikes... You think of the smirk as he handed you the address... But today, you think about the things that have happened since you arrived.... about the people you've met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes flash open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in a brothel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">\"I'm in a friggen brothel.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"I'm in a friggen brothel .... and I'm a woman.\"</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Watanabe...

The creak of leather as they slowly strut closer, confidence oozing from them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third domme catching your attention, with the harness around her hips... Or rather the strap-on jutting proudly forward. It sloshes heavily left and right like a metronome. It's size surely for jest, you lick your lips as you try to imagine it fitting. The damned thing is as big as her forearm, and almost as thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you aren't her target.

A mewling quivering cry joins her, as she too is controlled by a firm hand at the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnwilling, and unable to meet the eyes of your domme. Your gaze demurely lowered to her leather clad chest, her target is too, too clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddressing the floor, you try to talk your way out of the room. A babble of excuses, apologies, and stuttering does no good. A swift glance upwards only shows her angry expression. The contempt at hearing you speaking English etched onto her face. With a swift slap, she knocks your purse to the floor. Her free hand taking your arm, stopping you bending to retrieve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't ignore the cruel smile that spreads over her face, as you meet her penetrating gaze. Your past, your identity, everything that ties you to the past, lies at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHumiliatingly, the same mewling squealing squeak bursts from your lips, as you are taken by the scruff of the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Catching your backward glance, she gives you a cutesy wave as you're driven from the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo mortified, your stumbling shuffling parade through the corridor is public and humiliating. The other kimono clad women being taken to separate rooms. You hope that once you're alone... well just you and your domme, you can explain things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheeks burning, your first time in a brothel... and it's as a woman. You know what men get from these visits, your stomach squirming at the idea. It certainly seems the others were here for some humiliation. A relief from the high-pressure life of a female executive, a chance to indulge their feminine side. A relief valve of submission that they dare not reveal in their professional lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom door slams behind you, the groping hand briefly vanishing from your hips.

Wishing you hadn't wanted to recoil, you suspect that's what she wants and expects. But she slips her hand inside your open kimono. Squeezing one full breast as if checking it's ripeness, you gasp. Cheeks flushing, her finger brushes back and forth across your nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please....\" you gasp, unsure if you want her to stop... or continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile vanishes instantly, your use of English returning her sour commanding expression to her face.

The stabbing, insistent finger needing no translation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recall the look on her face, as you worked out '\u60c5\u5987', 'Q\u00edngf\u00f9' meant mistress, rather than simply boss. Your hand trembled as you pointed back to yourself, '\u5974\u96b6', 'N\u00fal\u00ec' still confused whether it meant slave, servant, or simply submissive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sits on the edge of the bed, you shuffle forward at her command. Nearer and nearer, until you dread what's coming next, know what's coming next. The knowledge doesn't stop it happening, as her hands wrap together and lock behind your head, as she drives you forward, until your head is buried in her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barked commands smothered by the thighs pressed against your ears, but you know what's required. Telling yourself it's not the first time you've eaten a woman out, there's still a difference. Your submission making it more degrading, more humiliating, but you obey, your tongue going to work, as her voice continues to rail against you. Thankfully, you hear the change in tone as you continue, the scent of her fills your lungs, as you work away. Her thighs tremble against your skull, until she finally cums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer juices smeared all over your face, as she casually pushes you away. You collapse into a tangle of limbs, an odd sense of satisfaction and completion give you a warm feeling in the pit of your stomach. Her smile is the ultimate reward, so rare but yet so beautiful it's worth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the heat fades, the joy wanes you realise you're just another naked woman in a brothel. Your ID in another room, your clothes gone...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven your borrowed kimono is ripped and destroyed beside you. The relief from a stressful life undeniable, your cheeks colour at the enthusiasm you showed, the eagerness to please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were a high-powered woman... You half-snort, half-giggle at the idea, as you take in your body. <i>If?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly an experience you'd pay for... an experience you have paid for.</span></div></div>",

It takes you a while to orient yourself, as your head hangs off the bed, and the tattered kimono fills your vision. It's only as you turn your head, that you see a wall and the room starts to make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, the soft creak of leather warns you of Mistress' approach. Not wanting to show your surprise, or act startled, you keep your gaze averted. Even as you feel the mattress shift as she sits down, a soft moan spills from your lips. The warm and pleasure of last night suffuse your body. A unique experience, and a painful and humiliating one at turns, but you can't deny the release, or how relaxed you felt or how joyous the whole thing was.... Your cries echo in your memory, ecstasy and pain making your cheeks warm and flush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft lips brushing your ass, as Mistress kisses those ripe, full cheeks. One soft peck on each, you wonder with a smile if there'll be lipstick marks there now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling her rise from the bed, you turn to watch her magnificent ass, as she struts away. So firm, so determined, it's movement a symphony of perfection, tightly contained by her stiff leather skirt, your eyes wander up her spine, savouring her narrow waist, and the shape of her hourglass body. The swell of her bust visible in the reflection from her fitted wardrobe. The creak of suede, making you ache with need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if it were sexual, she pulls open the wardrobe. Panel after panel sliding aside, the whole wall revealing a range of outfits. And, oh boy, what outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see some of her restrictive domineering clothes, and other outfits that can only be for the bedroom. A bikini that looks to be little more than string, makes you blush. Imagining yourself wearing it, filling it, overflowing it's meagre material, you dismiss it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf2a487cdbc4fa044dfc49991b9d1ab4/tumblr_pro512qlxj1whx09oo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/cf2a487cdbc4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting an abbreviated maid's outfit, the skirt, with it's ruffles too short, and too revealing. The attached top, comes with a neckline that feels like it's cut almost to the waist. Again, you're powerless to stop your imagination running wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e030201997003d029bbaa4fc432d6e3/tumblr_pr3pnjKT1T1r5ijn7o1_r1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e0302019970...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more options are revealed, each making you want to squirm. The other items... the non-clothes items keep you from running. The selection of paddles, gags, whips, dildos and other paraphernalia makes you stay. Partly from fear, and partly curiosity, whether they too can be discovered, even though a new day has dawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding your embarrassment, you turn away not willing to give her any more excuse to humiliate and degrade you. So, you don't see as she plucks them from her wardrobe. Only squeaking, and squealing as you feel them land on your naked body. Squirming around to face the assault of items, your bust shifts heavily, as you turn. Your rump feeling a mile wide too. Despite yourself, you tug the corner of a sheet to cover you... well, your womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt draws an amused smile from her. Dropping your gaze, you see it's leather wear that lies atop you... atop the bed. Mind racing you wonder if this marks the end of your innocence, the end of your submission, does she see you as a woman like herself... or is this the final degradation, forcing you to dress like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoosing the first option, and eager to wear something, anything, you slip them on. Her smile widens with approval, at your speed. You find yourself growing happier with it, too. Dismissing the other options, you don't want to be passive, appreciated for flaunting your body. The bikini, the maid costume. You'd rather be in charge, proudly embracing your sexuality... like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skirt is barely longer than the maid's one, but it feels right as you pull it into place. It's almost painfully tight as you pull it over your hips, creaking in protest. Mistress tugs the thick-toothed zipper up, and pats your well-displayed bum with a happy smile. She helps you into the top, too. Her assistance, not really something you can refuse. It crushes your bust, minimising it. At the same time, it's undeniably going to draw attention to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twirling finger, she gestures for you to turn on the spot. You oblige, appreciating your reflection as you catch it. Patting a nearby stool, you hop onto it. Raising a hand, she gets you to close your eyes, a final command. Stifling a giggle, you obey. It's a struggle to keep them closed, as you feel her caress your long bare legs. You never realised legs could feel so erotic, but despite fluttering eyelashes, you keep them closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on the sensation, even the boots she slips on feels like a tease. Whimpering, lips trembling a soft mewling spills from you. A stiff finger crosses your quaking lips, and you swallow them. The leather creaks as she laces the boots into place. The laces criss-cross all the way up... higher and higher, until mid-thigh they reach the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final tugs, as she knots the laces seem rather too long. Resisting the urge to caress the knots, you know you'd only get you fingers smacked, you force your hands to your lap, restlessly knotting your fingers together instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pats your restless hands, and with her free hand resting on your shoulder has you open your eyes. She gestures for you to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising to your feet, you tower over her. The sensation is dizzying, and wrong, almost immediately you feel like Bambi. So unsteady on your feet, and so vulnerable. The extra height adding to the whole wrongness of the situation. Dropping back onto the stool, it's only when you cross your legs that the wrongness solidifies, and makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9a07fbd8a86b715ee8f7ad2acf2a528/tumblr_prhqrjH4bD1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9a07fbd8a86...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feet feel leaden and too heavy, you see the immense platform, and worse stiletto heel you're wearing. Mistress' final joke!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your upper arm, she lifts you from the stool. Resisting not an option, her hands forcing you to your feet, and stopping you from a humbling fall, and probable broken ankle. Reluctantly, you walk from the bedroom. The sight that greets you in the hallway makes you want to recoil a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other 'guests' are there, with their dommes. You recognise their flushed cheeks and averted gazes, even if they too lack any hint of their former kimonos. One walks with an awkwardness that suggests she was filled with that strap-on, all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir clothes just as garish and sexual as yours. One in a pale bikini can barely meet your gaze, clearly terrified that you've joined the dommes yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/db0b02551e81f18bcbd4b1b44607def9/tumblr_prukjhXtON1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/db0b02551e81...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next could be called a one-piece swimsuit... if you felt generous.

The moment barely last before the four of you are taken to the front door, and put out without further ceremony. Only a chauffeur waits, and one car for all of you to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the door for you, she gives you a salute. You aren't sure whether she's mocking you all, or completely unaware of who any of you are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0dcdedc9f02fd01f96b235eae1c5a88/tumblr_pm9np8LXFV1w2lwkto3_640.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/b0dcdedc9f02...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shows you a piece of paper, and each of them nod.

These give the pedestrians a chance to see the passengers in the car. The chauffeur smiles and nods back at any glances. But the rapid elbowing between men, and the stiffly pointed fingers tell you in no uncertain terms, this is humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPassing back into a more suburban neighbourhood. The streets become quieter again, until you pull up to a massive, mansion. The crimson cheeks of the woman in the beige bikini refuses to meet any of your gazes. She fumbles with the door handle. It refuses to open for her. Adding to her humiliation, the driver toots the horn, and gets out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe passenger doors only open from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a salute, the driver opens the door. Head low, hair hiding her face, the woman scurries back to her home. Her identity no longer secret to anyone who can look up a simple address. The remaining passengers exchange looks, knowing your secret is going to be shared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteadfastly, you stare at the floor of the car. Unsure whether this fetish is more embarrassing, or if it's worse that you fell into it by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car only goes a few streets, until it pulls over again. This time, the woman in the barely there sling-bikini is restless. Her hands fidget restlessly in her lap. Knowing not to even try the door, her cheeks burn beetroot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the same pattern is repeated, this time the horn draws curious glances from the house. A large man appearing at the main window. You have to guess her husband, and from her quick glance, and quicker flinch back away, you guess correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more, she lowers her head in shame hiding her face in the long flowing mane of hair. But in the rush for cover, she slips out as she races for the front door. A front door that opens to reveal a tall, powerful man filling it. The aghast expression on her face, you watch her ass ripple as she picks up the pace, squeezing past him to vanish inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling away, it's only you and the other<i> 'domme' </i>left as passengers. You head back through the busier sections of town. She straightens, as if proud, sitting upright. Anyone looking in, is stared down. Her fierce expression something you wish you could manage. The only concession she makes, is to fasten her jacket. The zipper remains low, displaying her firm, full bust, and the black bra encasing the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the car pulls over, again the horn sounds alerting the neighbours. But she emerges with stately grace, projecting a confidence with a strutting grace, she heads towards her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car feels empty with only you and the driver.</span></div></div>",

Partly in suppressed anger, and partly in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing some clothes onto the bed, you scramble to get dressed. Anything is better than your current nudity. A humiliating familiarity ensures you pull on panties, suspenders, stockings and bra with speed. Standing dressed in just them, you feel more naked than before. The femininity of your body, a body on display, a body made to be displayed sends a twinge of jealousy through your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShy glances to her stiff leather skirt, and top. The stern look on her face, all project confidence and power, making the whip she's holding so casually completely unnecessary. She looks sexy, but in control. You know you'd look meek, even if you were dressed in the same clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bashful, cowardliness in your eyes shames you. You! You a powerful woman who runs an office, who's over here to inspire another office, is too fainthearted to wear those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTugging on a blouse, you catch your reflection.

It feels temptingly close to what can pass on the street. With a gasp, you listen to the domme's voice. Not just what she's saying, but how she's speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realise with a gasp, that she's still speaking Chinese, but you now hear it, understand it like a native. Even her accent, you can pin down the accent from Shanghai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u64cd\u6211\u3002\u201d,\u201cC\u0101o w\u01d2.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to recall the same words in English, but 'Fuck Me.' feels closest. The predatory smile on the domme's face widens at your words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just did. Come back tonight for another session, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words traumatise and entice you at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes pass in a daze, as you finish getting dressed. Even the return of your purse doesn't rouse you from this fugue. Each moment feels like a challenge, as you struggle for the English word, for ...<i>dress?</i>... Then ...<i>Taxi?</i>... The hideous neon signs make perfect sense, and the ugly English letters make you struggle, too simple, and too similar to mean much of anything. Whizz past the car's windows before you can work out their meanings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you realise, you're back at the hotel, and still reeling as you head up to your room.</span></div></div>",

As you rolled over, you checked your phone and saw that you had a text from Jennifer that read <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be by to get my things at 11. I'm bringing everything you left at my place.

Full-grown boobs, about a D cup if you had to guess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, these can't be real.\" You say, squeezing them hard enough to cause yourself pain. \"Oh god.\" you say as you continue bouncing them in your hands. \"Wow, this might feel good if this weren't so terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden, you hear a knock at the door. Looking at the clock, you realize it's a little past 11. Sure enough, Jen has come to get her things.</span></div></div>",

I'm going to unclip your bra to take some measurements okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine, and yeah. I woke up like this this morning and it hurt to walk,so I grabbed one of Jen's.

The first one since the change. He kisses back. One thing leads to another, and the two of you start making out. He starts grabbing you by your hip and pulling you into a deeper kiss, while your hand makes its way to his bare chest, and starts squeezing, causing him to let out a quiet groan of pleasure. After a few minutes, you hear a voice say \"Am I interrupting something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was standing in the door holding 3 large bras. The first set was <br>\r\nlacey and black, the second pair were silky and blue, and the third pair was a sports bra. Seeing the awkward smiles facing her, she hands the bras to Jen. \"Alright, lovebirds. I'm just gonna hand these off to you because you two definitely can't keep your hands off of each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheepishly, you slid the straps of the first one up Hal's shoulders, and clipped it in the back. He fidgeted for a second and scooped his boobs into the cups. Seeing his breasts held up in a black, lacey bra made you want to kiss him right on the spot, but Melanie being in the room definitely took some of the wind out of your sails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that fit?\" Asked Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, really well. I was surprised you could find something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get all kinds in here. There's not a lot we don't carry.\" She replied. \"You want to try on the other ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, will they both fit the same way?\" Hal asked. He never liked trying things on at the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They should,\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I think I'm good. Thanks a lot for your help today, and I really appreciate you not making a big deal about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, I hope everything goes back to normal for you soon, but there's no point in being uncomfortable while you're like this, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess not.\" He replied, as he paid for his new underwear. \"Thanks again for you help, Melanie. It was very nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after, two of you walk to your car. \"Hey, hon. Thanks for making me do that.

Eventually, you can't take anymore and you start to cum.

Seconds later, he's finished, and you start to help him clean up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD! That was awesome, he says as he cleans himself up.

After he cleans himself off, you join him and start rubbing his boobs with your soapy hands, feeling his nipples run through your fingers as you caress and kiss them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you really seem to like them.\" He says off handedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never told you this while we were dating, but I'm bi. I've had people stop listening after I say 'I like girls' because they automatically seem to think that I'm seeing other people without realizing I only cared for them at the time.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well. That's not a big deal, I guess. We're still exclusive though, right?\" He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, with those sweater puppies on you, I've got everything I could want on one person. We're definitely exclusive, and I'm not going anywhere.\" You reassured him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to hear that. I promise I'll only use these things for good.\" He replied as you both walked into bed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One that he hadn't brought, and didn't belong to you. Curious, you gently shook him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hon?\" You ask as he fell back into consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sweetheart. What's up?\" He asked groggily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much, I just have no idea where your shirt came from. It's not mine and all of your stuff that was here is still in the breakup box from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird.\" He said as he sat up to inspect the shirt that seemingly appeared from nowhere. \"I'm not sure where this came from, it's not mine either.\" He said, as he pulled it off. \"Ah well, my shirt should still be over where I took it off yesterday, so it's not a big deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIntrigued, you walk over to his pile of clothes from yesterday on the dresser and see a pair of his jeans, his boxers, his new bra, and a blouse. \"Hey, Hal. Let's drive over to your place. I think something's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't your shirt either. Come on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter showering and watching Hal get dressed in his new blouse. You hop into your car and head back over to his apartment. You make a beeline for his closet and are surprised to see hanger after hanger of girly clothes. Bikini tops, blouses, dresses, and even more bras have all manifested themselves in Hal's apartment. \"Hal! Come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.\" is all he can muster as he steps into the closet with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try this on.\" You say, handing you a party dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?

It takes you a second to see that he's lost about half a foot of height, and has rounder hips. You pace around him and see that he also has a larger, softer butt, closer in shape to yours than his used to be. Finally, you notice that his feet are much smaller, and his toenails are painted red. You have to admit, you like the way he looks with his new boobs and hips, and you can't wait to grab it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You ask, as you touch his butt to see if this is actually real. \"Oh my god.\" You say, trying to hide your cautious excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right?

I can't even get them over this thing.\" He says, pointing to his new ass, as he pulled on a pair of his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I've got an idea. It looks like we're about the same height and build now. \"You want a pair of my shorts?\" You ask grabbing a pair of tight shorts out of your drawer \"I'd offer you some jeans, but they're all back at my place in my closet for when winter rolls around again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I'll give 'em a shot.\" He says, as you hand them to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal slides the tight denim shorts up his new legs. Surprisingly, from behind he looks great in them. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the front. Not only are his boxers sticking out of the legs of the shorts, he also can't close the zipper because his bulge is in the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, take those off. We've gotta fix a few things.\" You say as you walk to the dresser and pull out a pair of panties, and some shorter compression shorts<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not doing that.\" He says as he sees what you're bringing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, Hal. Do you really think people are going to care how you look? You have tits that are bigger than mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to wear panties. Can't I just wear my boxers under the them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wearing a bra right now. You're already wearing women's underwear!\" She says, incredulously before calming down and continuing. \"Look,You need these if you're going out in public. Your dick is hanging out of your pants. Your jeans don't fit, so you can't wear those. My shorts will fit if you use the compression shorts to hold down your junk a bit. Your boxers won't work because they'll bunch up under the shorts and be really uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's vain and stupid, but I don't want to be seen like this. What if I run into my friends?\" Hal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, it's either this, or you go naked. And I don't think the receptionist would appreciate that very much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" He relents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just try it. You might even like the way it feels. I mean, you like your bras, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like is a strong word.\" He jokes as he pulls off your shorts and steps into your panties. After pulling them up his waist you see that the coverage, while impressively thorough, doesn't cover everything, and some parts of his balls and the head of his dick still spill out over your lacy, blue boyshorts. \"Okay, these are pretty nice.\" He admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just remember, this is a temporary loan.\" You say. \"I want those back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once he pulls the compression shorts over the underwear, causing his cute new butt to bounce a little, the bulge is much less noticeable. Finally, he pulls the shorts over the undershorts and is able to close them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know that would work?\" Hal asks, genuinely surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to work on my college's drag show. I had friends that would enter. Tricks of the trade, I guess. Gotta say though, you look good, honey. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're pretty tight, but good enough for an hour or two. Seriously, sweetheart. Thank you for this, and for calming me down.\" he said, giving you a kiss, which you surprisingly didn't have to look up towards for once. You could get used to this. \"Anyway, you ready to go?\" He asked as he put on some flip flops, not wanting to contend with finding shoes for his smaller feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you got in his, you realize that he has to readjust his seat to compensate for his new height. After a few minutes, he pulls out of his complex's parking garage, and drives to the closest general practitioner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few uncomfortable minutes of you and your boyfriend being gawked at by children in the waiting room, you hear the lady at the front desk say \"Dr. Kapeniac will see you now.\" You walk back with him, and meet with the doctor in the hallway of offices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. That's sex flu.\" He says without a second thought, as he gathers you into his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sex flu?\" Hal asks, as he sits down on the doctor's couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Dr. Kapeniac begins. \"Interesting little virus that's come about recently. It's only spread once through direct contact with the opposite sex, then it gets into your cells and switches your second sex chromosome, so X to Y, or Y to X. It lasts 2 weeks after all of the changes are completed, then you start to revert to your original sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Direct contact?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, skin to skin touching of the person after their first transformation, so I'm assuming that that's probably you.\" He asks, pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" You say. \"But I haven't changed at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's an incubation period of a few days, but if you were the first person he touched, you're going to start changing soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into who?\" Hal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you if you touched her first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'll look like he does now?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Let me explain. The virus doesn't overwrite your original DNA, let's call that your base code, because you wouldn't turn back afterwards, it just overexpresses the complementary chromosome, resulting in a sex change. But that base code is still there, and that's what's used to inform the changes in the second person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who is he turning into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presumably whoever touched him after they expressed their first chain. The good news is, this is a disease that spreads in a straight line, one receipt to one transmission and after it works its way out of your system, you've got long term immunity. Like chicken pox. Now, treatment. There's 2 options. There's a drug that's hormone based and it'll stop the changes, and leave you where you are right now until your immune system beats this thing. now, that costs money, and no offense, leaves you looking silly for 3 or more weeks depending on the progression of the changes. The other option is to just wait it out and become that other person for 2 weeks. This option's pretty popular with some couples, because I mean, how often do you get the chance to be the other sex, let alone experience it on the other side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Hal says, still processing what he's just heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what do you want to do?</span></div></div>",

You counted yourself lucky because you already had a steady supply of clothes you could wear once you started to change. After trying on several pair of pants with the compression shorts still on to minimize the effect of his bulge on the fit, he buys a pair of flats, a pair of skinny jeans, and shorts of his own. On the way out of the second store he went to, the surprises you and says he wants to try on a dress. Turning around, he goes up to the clerk and requests a changing room. You hear them fight briefly, and hear some slurs coming from the clerk before he is taken aside by an older guy, probably the manager, and sent into the back of the store. The manager then hands Hal the dress, and directs him to a fitting room. You wait on the bench outside the fitting room and see that your phone is buzzing. Hal is sending a series of pictures of himself to you as he strips down into his (and your) underwear. Even though it still looks weird, you can't help but be turned on by the visual of your boyfriend with girl parts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou text him back \"Keep going, hon. Just wait until you see what I'm gonna do to you tonight.\" He responds with a picture of himself sliding off his bra, and squishing his boobs together. \"God, I'm dating a male fantasy.\" You think to yourself. Finally, Hal opens the door and you see your him looking weirdly good wearing a loose fitting dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I really like it. I'm going to wait until everything else changes to get it, but I think I'm going to come back and get it afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should. It looks pretty good on you. Also, keep in mind you can wear my stuff while you're a girl. Least I can do if I'm going to be wearing yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" He replies. \"Also, I think I'm going to hold off on underwear today. I want to get it when my dick isn't in the way, you know?\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, it's weird to hear you say that. I get it though, and that's fine.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way out, you see the guy who was giving Hal a hard time has come back to the register with a sour expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on one second.\" You say as you go over and tell the guy off for treating your SO that way. At the end of your speech, you make sure to poke him in the chest to emphasize your point. As you arrive back by Hal, you say to him \"Well, he won't be treating people like that anytime soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Hal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just touched him. He's going to turn into me after a little over a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, you did that for me?\" He asks in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. No one talks to my boyfriend like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, sweetheart. That means a lot to me.\" He says, hugging you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you wanna come back in a few days to see how he's doing?

It sounds gross as hell.\" You reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you rather me call it? 'Vagina' doesn't sound great either.\" He says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you just say 'Let's have sex.' when you want it, deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. So, I know we're not there yet, but you want to right now?

Next you wrap your lips around it and start sucking on it as you grab onto his ass. With his free hands , he holds your hair back to keep it out of your face. Unfortunately, just as you were starting to make him moan for more, the clocks passes midnight, and you feel less in your mouth with every passing second. After a minute or so, you see that there's nothing left of his penis, but without skipping a beat, you flip him over, push him onto the bed, and start eating him out, as he lets out a moan and grabs the sheets, you start to go faster as you hear his breath quicken. You squeeze his hims with your hands and pull him towards your mouth. The shock of this puts him over the edge as he starts to have his first female orgasm. Shortly after, he pulls you away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man,\" he starts, out of breath. \"That was so awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you like having a vagina?\" You taunt him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yeah.\" He replies. \"Can we do that again in a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely, sweetie. Let me just get something while you cool off, okay?\" You tell him, as you leave him breathless on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into his closet and find a box that you had kept stashed away for a long time. Out of it, you pull an admittedly small strap-on with a clit stimulator for you, that you put on before walking back out to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, honey? Yes or no?\" You ask, sporting a black rubber cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh. Why do you have that?\" He asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only person I've been with, Hal. I got this just before I broke up with my last girlfriend, but I never actually got to use it.

I want you to fuck me hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking that as a go ahead, you finally plunged in all the way, feeling it get easier as Hal got wetter and wetter with each thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he surprised you, and flipped you over onto your back. \"You really think I'm going to let you lead the whole time?\" he asked, as he steadied himself by putting his hands on your chest, and started riding your strap on, and rubbing your clit with the motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled him down on top of you and slid out so you could make out with him. You were really getting into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, after about 5 minutes, Hal came, and you slid the now dripping-wet rubber cock from between his legs. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"That felt amazing, but I am not used to that. Guess I'm a little sensitive to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right, honey. I'm glad you were even able to get off.\" You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm really surprised, but I could get used to that feeling. I can't wait to see how it feels with a real dick.\" He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're already wanting to try it with a real one?\" You asked, in disbelief<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can do that again, I can't wait to try it with a real one.\" He says, as he undid your strap on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he starts to run his fingers over the lips of your wet lips, in the sexy, breathy voice that you knew he liked, you asked \"So, if I had a cock right now, what would you do to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he started rubbing your clit, he whispered in your ear. \"First, I'd start to touch it to get you nice and hard. Then I'd tease you by cupping your balls. If you're really getting it from me, you'll love that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What next?\" You asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, I'd start kissing my way down your chest, all the way down to your dick. Then, I'd put you in my mouth and start working my way down your shaft.\" He said, as you cooed at the idea and started to really feel him teasing your clit. \"Next, I'd start wrapping my lips around your hard cock and I'd keep going until you couldn't take it anymore. Then I'd stop.\" He said as he took his hand off of you. \"Finally, I'd put a condom on you and let you finish inside me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe this was the same Hal you'd been dating for all this time. \"I can't believe you'd do that\" you say, as he put his fingers back on your clit, and sped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say, I think this body's changing how I think. I'm still me, but I'm not as put off by the idea of being sexually active on the other side anymore.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, with his talk and the idea of being able to make his idea a reality soon enough, you were ready to cum. Finally, he kissed down your chest and started licking your clit to finish you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even 30 seconds later, you finished and pulled his head up to kiss him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really want to try what you were saying when I have a dick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, as long as it's you, I'll try anything once.\" He responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll hold you to that.\" You told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after that, you clean yourselves up and go to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Something felt weird, but you couldn't place it. Deciding not to worry about it, you lay next to him in bed while you both woke up. Once you were ready to start the day, you asked if he wanted to shower with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" He said, rising from bed, still naked from the night before. You did the same, but realized something had happened when the room seemed smaller to you. You had woken up with Hal's legs, and we're now about half a foot taller than him. \"Wow, you started strong.\" He said as he walked over to take a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you. You started with a pair of big tits.\" You fired back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. You're just jealous. So, still want to get a shower?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely.\" You said as you turned your head down to kiss him, which was definitely new for you. Getting into it, you used one hand to grab his butt, and pulled his hair it's your other. You both really started to get into it, but eventually he decided to move it to the shower, and led you into the bathroom by his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after turning on the shower, you both hopped in, and after you washed your hair, Hal lathered up some soap and started rubbing your body from your head to your toes. Taking the hint, you began to do the same, running your hands over his boobs and his ass, as you felt the curves of your boyfriend's new body that was now almost entirely female. Once you washed the soap from your hands, you teased him a bit by playing with the lips of his vagina, just enough to get him excited. He responded by pulling you into a deep kiss by your waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, you turned off the water and hopped out of the shower. When you turned around to look at Hal, you saw him wrapping the towel around his waist. In response to this, you giggled \"You know, with those boobs, you might want to start wrapping the towel under your shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Good call!\" He said. \"You know? You're enjoying teaching me how to be a girl just a little too much...\" He joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it's like having a little sister I can teach things too.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have sex with all of your sisters?\" He asked, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, ok. I could have worded that better.\" You responded, flustered and embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I know what you mean.\" He responded. \"To tell you the truth, I'm looking forward to teaching you about guy stuff in a week or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like what?\" You challenged him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you have to know,\" he began smugly. \"The waistband trick for hiding boners, because if I'm right, you'll be popping one every minute since you're new at this. Also, how to masturbate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like valuable information.\" You said sarcastically as you pulled a pair of his boxers and jeans over your new legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's other stuff, I just can't think of anything right now.\" He replied as he put on your former black skirt, and stockings with his button down, which hung loosely over his thin frame. He tucked in the shirt as you pulled on a bra, a tank top and a blouse. \"So,\" he asked. \"What do you want to do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his phone went off, as if in response to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom's in town.

My wife Jan and I live on a farm together, and her not having her breasts for a little while makes it easier for her to get work done outside, so she had handed them off to me while I cooked our dinner. We've both been doing this for so long now, it's not even weird anymore, all of our friends already know, so I'm really not self-conscious about it anymore, but as I write this, I have my own chest back, I just like that picture of me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my girlfriend and I aren't the ones changing, that doesn't exactly sound appealing.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well, neither were Jan and I when this started. Matter of fact, we were both dating other people, but our significant others both cut out around the time we switched chests.We were the ones to console each other, and eventually it turned into something more as we spent more time together. That picture you mentioned of me in the bikini we taken a couple days after the breakup. You can't see it in the picture, but I also have her feet and her hair color at that point. When this first started, we thought it was going to be a forever thing, so we decided to just make the best of it and go to a friend's pool party and just get it out of the way. We kissed for the first time that night. But I'm rambling; sooner or later, you'll probably run into whoever you're switching with, and if you don't want to be with them, I guess just make an arrangement not to switch with them.

Thank you, honey. I love you.\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too, and no problem. I just wish this wasn't happening with some stranger.

You tried shorts too but since you liked them short and well fit before the change, they're also too short on you. As a last ditch effort, you go over to the pile of spare clothes your ex-girlfriend hadn't picked up after the break up. There were 1 or 2 outfits worth of clothes, but your only choices were a longish skirt and short shorts.  To your credit, you tried both, but neither fit, since you were a good deal thicker than your ex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know you needed clothes that were actually wearable, so you decided to call your good friend and neighbor Marta Solado who was your age. You put on a pair of your looser sweatpants and roll up the hem until they're wearable,  and after calming down, you called her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hal, what's up? I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.\" she said, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me both. I know you sound stressed, but do you mind if I come over real quick? It's really important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that'll be okay, but just promise me you won't freak out, okay?\"<br>\r\nShe replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freak out about what?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me.\" she begged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but you have to promise me the same thing.\" you replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you headed next door to her apartment and she let you in. She's wearing a maxi dress you've never seen before, which still ran pretty short, because as you look at her, you recognize that she's about the height you used to be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next words out of both of your mouths are a stream of sputtering interrogatives, loosely conveying that you were both very shocked that you had both swapped legs. After getting a handle on the shock in about 20 minutes, you asked: \"This is crazy, but can I look at your legs?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" she replied tersely, still very upset.\" On further inspection, scar for scar, hair for hair, they were certainly your legs, and your new legs were absolutely hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, this is unbelievable. I'm so tall.\" Marta said as she held her head in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that's bad?!\" you complained. \"I'm absolutely tiny tight now and my hips are crushing my balls!\" You yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell are you laughing?\" You asked, utterly dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween tears of sorrow and laughter, she replied \"You said 'Your hips!' You're already getting used to them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she laughed, you found yourself getting less upset, Marta always did have that infectious kind of laughter. As you both started and continued to laugh, she told you to follow her. She took you to be room and pointed you to her dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take whatever you want.\" She said. \"If you need panties, there's a couple new pairs on top of the dresser. I bought them yesterday, but they don't fit your narrow ass,\"  she said as she smacked her new butt. \"So I don't need them anymore.\" she said as she closed the door, so you could change in peace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the laughter subsided, you thanked her and tried on a pair of panties, just to see if they fit you more than your now poorly fitting boxers. As you walked in front of her mirror to look at your new body in a floral lacey, black pair of panties. Your actually looked pretty good in them, except for your dick and balls, which you had to push to the side, but all things considered, they fit better than your boxers, so you decided to take Marta up on her offer of underwear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing that, you tried on a pair of jeans,which almost fit, except you couldn't button them, or zip them up, due to the dick between your thick thighs. You moved on to a looser pair of shorts, but ran into the same situation. You ran through whatever you could wear, skirts, shorts, pants, but it didn't seem like anything was working. Until eventually you came across a pair of looser jeans that fit you. You put them on and are able to zip and button them. As you left the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You opened the door to your living room to see a multitude of red solo cups covering every horizontal surface in the apartment, the glass surface of your coffee table shattered onto the floor below, an overturned lamp currently illuminating the floor, and a trash can overflowing with cans, bottles, and cups. You think you're definitely going to need a shower before you can deal with this, so you headed to the bathroom. Strangely though, once you look in the mirror, you notice something strange. You're still wearing the shirt you had on last night, but instead of your boxer briefs, you're wearing a pair of purple panties. \"That's weird. I know I blacked out last night, but I don't think I'd get <i>that</i> crazy.\" \"Wait, Melissa and John brought me to bed. This has John written all over it.\" You thought as you grabbed your phone and called John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man. Good prank. Did you actually take my pants off?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, obviously, when else am I going to see that Adonic dick?\" He replied \"Yeah, but no. You were too fucked up to mess with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it wasn't you? I guess I really got messed up last night because umm. I'm wearing panties at the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why exactly are you wearing panties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell if I know, man. I woke up like this. I blacked out last night, and I guess drunk me likes to sleep in ladies' underpants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know what they say. 'In vino, veritas.' Maybe your innermost wish is to be a crossdresser by night. Anyway, I gotta get going. Melissa and I are heading out to get lunch with her parents. So, I'll talk to you later. Have fun with your panties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Have fun, dude. I'm gonna try to figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your phone away, stepped out of your new underwear, turned on the shower, and washed off a mixed layer of sweat, alcohol, and regret. After a relaxing 15 minutes, you headed back to your room to get dressed and start cleaning the mess that was your apartment. After you toweled off and did your hair, you went to your first drawer and found that all of your underwear had been replaced with a selection of panties, thongs, and boyshorts. \"Well, this is elaborate. Guess I'll just wear my bathing suit and pick up some new underwear later.\" You opened your last drawer and, found that your swimsuit was replaced by a red bikini bottom. \"Fine, if I can sleep in a girls' underwear, I can clean in them. I'll just wear them under my pants and pick up some guy's underwear later today.\" You thought, as you grabbed a pair of navy boyshorts and stepped into them, pulling them up your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you finally managed to pick everything up and take out all of the trash. \"Alright, time to go.\" You said as you got in your car and went out to the department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you did that yesterday morning though, you'd have seen how great my ass looks in boyshorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they are boy-shorts, so how bad could a boy look in them?\" She said as she pulled you in for a hug. John filed in after the display and hugged you as well, with your pants still around your ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, man. How you holding up?\" asked John<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since yesterday, I've gotten a big shoe collection that's three sizes to small, so I'm good? I guess?\" you said as you pulled your pants back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right? So, I'm staying in for the day, since I can't really do much without shoes that fit. I've got Dana bringing me a pair tomorrow though, so it'll be fine. So, what movie did you bring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we just stopped by a Redbox on the way over and got the worst reviewed one. So, I present to you: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, that sounds horrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"35% on Rotten Tomatoes, man. We're in for a treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys! Come on!\" Shouted Melissa from the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\" John called back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey, Hal\" Melissa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" You replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we start this trainwreck, do you think I could check out your new wardrobe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" you said, as you led her into your room. \"Yeah, so here are my panties.\" You said as you pulled open the drawer where your underwear used to be. \"And here are my shoes.\" you said as you pulled open your closet door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Hal. Whoever's doing this to you has pretty good taste. I'm seeing some Michael Kors, Betsey Johson, and Coach shoes in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw those. Better than my ratty shoes at least. If only they fit, huh. And also I had girl feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want girl feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'd be nice to have shoes that fit again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I could see that\" She said as she walked to your underwear drawer. \"Ha, you've got some lingerie in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" she said \"Check these out!\" She exclaimed, as she held up a lacey thong with garter straps still attached. \"I'm not seeing any stockings though. Guess you don't have those yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet?\" You ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you seem to be getting new clothes every day, so stockings have to come eventually, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" you replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'll give you 100 dollars if you wear them for the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1. I think it'd be funny. 2. You've got so many pairs of girls underwear that you should probably get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. 100 bucks?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, right here.\" she said, pulling it out of her wallet</span></div></div>",

I was starting to feel trapped without shoes to wear.\" You said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" replied John as he got up to put in the DVD \"it's always a fun time over here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple hours of mediocrity, the movie was over and it was getting late, and while tomorrow was a work day for you and Mel, you decided to stay up and talk some more anyway about the future and making plans to do more stuff in the future. Time flew while you guys were talking and before you knew it it was past midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Hal?\" asked Melissa \"It may just be the booze, but I'm just noticing this now. Were your toes painted all night long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Of course not. I've been barefoot the entire time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, man. She's right. They're pink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you exclaimed, pulling your feet to your chest. They were right, not only had your toenails been painted, your feet were also a lot smaller. Once you looked up after the shock had worn off, you saw that Melissa had gone to your closet and brought back a pair of high heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you weren't crazy about the thong idea before, but come on. It looks like you have girlier feet now. What if they fit?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, here give them to me.\" You said as you grabbed the red heels and pulled them onto your feet. They fit perfectly. You got up to walk around, but you stumbled around in the effort, not used to balancing your weight this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, what's happening to you?\" John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. This is freaking me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should make a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Does it hurt at all?\" Asked Melissa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it doesn't hurt, but you're right. This definitely isn't normal\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel really crappy saying this, but are you gonna be okay, man? We've gotta get going. I've got a meeting with my publisher tomorrow and Mel's gotta cover a shift.\" Said John<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess so. At least I kind of know what's happening now.\" You said \"And hey, I'm not crossdressing or stealing shoes in my sleep at least. Gotta take the positives where you can find 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but Hal? If you need anything, please let either of us know. We're here for you.\" assured Melissa. She was always good about being supportive to friends in need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I'll let you guys know, but that shock took it out of me. I think I should get to bed if I want to be ready for work tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, later Hal.\" said John. \"We'll see you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they're out the door, you numbly walk to your room, with thoughts racing through your head. How could this happen? Why is this happening to me? Haven't I felt shitty enough lately? I wish I knew why this was happening. Eventually though, you calm down and decide to get a shower. Admittedly, the sensation of the water hitting your new feet feels nice. You wrap up and try to get to bed.</span></div></div>",

The hot water felt nice as it ran over your body. Once you got out, you got dressed in your room, making sure to avoid your collection of panties, you stepped into another pair of boxers, got a collared shirt on and a pair of nice pants. You actually had about an hour until work, so you decided to get some practice with your new feet, and slipped on a pair of the shoes that kind of went with your work clothes. Fortunately, you picked up the skill of walking in heels pretty quickly, and only stumbled a few times while you made yourself breakfast, when all of the sudden, the doorbell rang. You walked over quickly and opened the door to see Dana with a box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hey. Couldn't wait?\" She asked, pointing at your heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no. Not exactly.\" You replied. \"A lot's changed since you saw me last. You know how I got underwear and shoes that don't belong to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" she replied confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is going to sound crazy, but check this out.\" You said, taking off your shoes to reveal your new feet. \"Dana, I- I think was turning into a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was?\" She asked, her head cocked to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the feet happened last night, and nothing happened since then, like it has, so I think I might be done, which is good. I can always get more shoes and underwear, and I can live with small feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hal, this is really fucking weird.\" she said, her head cocked to one side. \"Anyway, it doesn't look like you need these anymore, so you want to pay me back and  return them later?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hell, I forgot I asked you to pick up shoes for me. I'm really sorry, D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no problem. I just kind of want my money back ASAP.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no problem. Wait just a sec.\" You said as you got 60 dollars out of your room and gave it to Dana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Wait, you work today, don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do.\" You replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do about your shoes?\" she asked \"You can't exactly wear heels to your office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, I hadn't thought about it. I guess I'll find the most mundane pair in my closet and wear those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good luck. I gotta get going to my shift, so I'll talk to you later tonight? I want to hear all about your stories as the new girl.\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a call. Have a good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\" She called back <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost time to go, so you went back into your closet and found a black pair of boots that looked slightly like your dress shoes from the cuff down. Somehow they fit over your calf, and except for the 1 inch heel, they looked relatively normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It starts up with only a little trouble and you start to drive to work. After a 20 minute commute, you arrive at your job as an IT tech for the advertising firm you work for. You'd only recently started, so you still had to sit in a cubicle like everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waltzed into work at a little before 9 in the morning and promptly made a beeline for your cube, so you could spend the rest of your day without getting up. After all, you were still a bit nervous about people seeing you like this. You made a mental note to buy a pair of smaller shoes later that looked like a pair of your old ones eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, on the way to your cubicle, you were stopped by your office crush Caroline: a dark haired girl only a few years older than you with long legs wrapped in a pencil skirt, who was the project manager for your department. \"Hey, Hal. Nice boots.\" she chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like them? The heel makes me feel sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you look great.\" She said sarcastically, as a small crowd started forming around you. \"But, why are you wearing them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my therapist thinks I care too much about what people think of me, so they recommended I wear something that would catch a lot of eyes and raise a few questions. Sort of a baptism by fire kind of thing, so I'm going with it. I'm starting small though.\" You always were good at lying on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay. I guess that's cool. Um, if you do decide to go further, just remember the company dress code.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do. Thanks, Caroline.\" you said as you headed back to your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a few more conversations like that over the course of your day, but eventually, it was time to go home. You walked out and down to your car and drove home. Once you got home, you kicked off your shoes and poured yourself a big drink and sat down with your laptop and googled \"Feet changed into a woman's? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsurprisingly, you didn't find much besides foot fetish stuff and fan fictions. \"Man, it'd be crazy if I was into this. I mean, I actually <i>have</i> a woman's feet.\" After a little more looking, you're feeling a bit horny, so you reach into your pants, jack off, clean up, and go to bed.</span></div></div>",

Guess I'll have to wear a pair that fits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to figure it out after you get cleaned up, you take a shower, and 15 minutes later, you get dressed for work. You start with a button down shirt and a black tie. Pretty standard office fare, really. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you pull on a pair of boxers, you pull open the drawer you keep your pants in. Unsurprisingly, none of your pants are there. Instead, you see several skirts, jeans, dress pants, and a few pairs of balled up stockings. Since you're kind of out of options and you need to leave for work, you grab a matching pair of dress pants and try them on. They only make it up to the top of your hips before getting too tight to move any further. You try again with a pair are of a larger size. They make it all the way up your legs, but the zipper won't close, and the button won't button. You look in the drawer, pulling out pair after pair of pants. None of them fit. Eventually, you're down to skirts. Jokingly, you unclasp the skirt and step into it. To your surprise, once you pull it up your legs and zip it up, it fits. It's a bit too tight, but it fits. Unfortunately, you can see a sizable bulge poking out of the front of the fabric, and the thick stitches on your boxers are creating very unflattering lines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've got some time before work. Might as well try this out.\" You think to yourself, as you slide your boxers out from under your skirt and replace them with a pair of silk panties. \"Wow, these actually feel pretty nice.\" You say aloud as you slide the sleek fabric back up your legs. Next, you grab a pair of tights, which you hope will reduce the bulge of your cock. You gather as much of the sheer fabric as you can in your hands and lay on your back in your bed, as your ex used to when she would get dressed at your place. One leg at a time, you pull the tights up your leg, feeling the embrace of the elastic fabric as it clings to you. Surprisingly, the fabric makes it all the way to the top of your legs. \"I guess whoever's stuff I'm getting was pretty tall.\" You remark to yourself as you remove your skirt to fix the tights, which you bring up past the top of your hips. Once you finish, you put the skirt back on and catch a glimpse of your new self in the mirror and noticing that the large bulge, while still there, is much less noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, you don't look half bad for a grown man wearing a skirt, and under the excuse that you fed your boss yesterday, you decide to go to work as is. After all, you're still following <i>a</i> dress code. But, you notice that you're running late for work, so reluctantly, you step into a pair of heels, since you couldn't get away with the boots from yesterday again and stumble out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half hour later, you roll up to work, and despite getting a few looks for wearing heels and a skirt. No one really says anything, at least until Caroline catches you on the way in. She takes you aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Of course, that meant your job had to account for more of the price tag, but you could get by. You weren't sure how things were going to be with your ex, whether or not you could still be friends or not. That was probably an entirely different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, on this one day, you couldn't help but feel this strange feeling all day long. Even your fellow co-workers commented on it, but you chalked it up to nerves given the recent state of affairs. You felt you were close to fully moving on from this so you weren't too concerned as you finished your job for the day and went home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got back to your apartment, getting some dinner and finishing some things up as you usually did. Once you did, you went straight to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, tiring day,\" you grumbled, getting in to your usual night clothes and stumbling into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you did though, you blacked out completely, oblivious to anything else going on. As the clock struck midnight, a mysterious mist began to fill your apartment, and you not having a clue as to what was happening.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><b>The next day</b></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the sunlight come through the windows as usual, signalling the beginning of another day. You yawned as you got up, though it didn't take long to notice something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....what?\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour room seemed much smaller, and different for that matter. A lot of your stuff was still there, but somewhat rearranged given the smaller size of the room. You began to wonder if you were still dreaming, but a quick light slap kind of took that out. Curious, you went over to the window, looking outside as best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second...that wasn't the downtown you were used to seeing. And...why could you see signs that looked Japanese? Okay, now you were a bit more wide awake. wondering just what was happening and if you were really awake or not. Curious, you turned your phone on, getting your GPS to tell you where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result it brought up: Tokyo, Japan.</span></div></div>",

And why is the floor creaking like this? In fact, why do your bare feet feel gritty right now? Your floors were never this dirty before? There's a pervasive feeling of things being misplaced right now. It's like your floors, walls, ceiling, everything in the room is somehow \u2026 not quite right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is like something from a dream,\u201d you mutter to yourself, finally reaching the alarm clock and switching it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking the sleep from your eyes, you glance more closely at your surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you really were just dreaming before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's clearly the same bed, same dresser, same alarm clock, same photos on the walls, same dirty clothes hamper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmm, but there's still something <u>off</u> about everything. It's as though someone sneaked around in the middle of the night and replaced all your possessions with exact duplicates. Or maybe there was still something subtly different about the floor, wall, or ceiling? You know something isn't kosher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll figure it out after breakfast,\u201d you mumble to yourself, shaking your head and stepping out into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hits you \u2013 this isn't your apartment at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone moved all your belongings (and your unconscious body) in the middle of the night from your apartment to \u2026 to \u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is this?\u201d you say, looking around a cramped, poorly lit wooden hallway. The place had all the rustic charm of an unfinished attic, replete with rafters above and cobwebs lining the unpainted wooden walls, slanting inward at a steep incline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the hall, there was a large square hole cut in the floorboards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards it and peer down into the cheerful light coming up from below. A rickety, wooden ladder leads down into what appears to be a kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI must be dreaming,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou contemplate returning to bed in the vain hope that you'll simply wake up back where you belong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you climb down the ladder and step out into a warm, cozy kitchen. A sleepy looking, half-dressed family is crowded around a small, wobbly table. An iron, wood-burning stove sits in another corner of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarold, you're finally up!\u201d says a burly, muscular man with a thick, curly black beard. He's wearing nothing but a pair of dirty overalls that reek with the earthy stench of manure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe six \u2026 no, make that seven children clustered around the table cheerfully greet you with a chorus of good mornings as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh \u2026 hello,\u201d you say, too stunned to think of anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bearded man pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot warming itself on top of the stove. Everyone in the room seems to accept your presence here in a simple, matter of fact way \u2013 nothing unusual about a strange man appearing in the attic with all his furnishings overnight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly shuffle sideways out of the kitchen, keen to get your bearings on what exactly is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you're in a dirty living room, furnished with broken, badly scuffed antiques. On top of a badly scratched desk sits a pile of old, yellowed farming magazines. Next to that you recognize a scrap of paper with <u>your name</u> printed on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d you say, picking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an old address label that long ago dried out and peeled off something. It clearly reads: \u201cHarold Finnegan, Rural Route #17, Weevil Township\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby on the desk you spot a newspaper with an empty rectangular patch that neatly fits the address label you found perfectly. You pick up the newspaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe Spittle County Gazette?\u201d you say aloud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never heard of this place before! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice the date on the paper: spring of last year?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d you ask of no one in particular.</span></div></div>",

Opening your eyes fully you took a step back shocked to find yourself in a completely different place to where you had fallen asleep. <br>\r\nGone was the big King sized bed with the thick foam mattress, now you had a simple single bed tucked into the corner of a small room. There was a small, moth eaten armchair next to it with a basic bedside table with an old fashioned lamp atop it. There was also a table, it didn't look fancy, almost like something from a school cafeteria. The wardrobe was a hideous 'Ikeaesque' design, looking cheap and small, your wardrobe was much larger and obviously modern. In fact everything about the room felt old, the furniture looked at least ten years out of date, the carpet was stained and dusty, showing its age. Your belongings were scattered around the place, you saw a picture of you and your ex-girlfriend is on the bedside table, documents from your work scattered across the table and a pair of your trainers are on the floor. You don't know how you got here, but you're weirded out by the sight of your own possessions here.<br>\r\nBut there was something else, there was a musky odor in the air, the place stank of old people, you recognised it from when you used to visit your grandparents. You open the door and peak out seeing a nurse wheeling an elderly man the other way. The hallway was large, with about 6 or 7 other doors, probably all opening up into similar rooms to the one you were in. A door opened and an ancient looking woman stepped out with a zimmer frame in hand, and then opposite hers another woman, slighly younger lokking, probably in her 70's stepped out. <br>\r\n'Hello Mabel' The 70 year old said. 'Getting out of your room today I see, any reason?' <br>\r\n\"Well my dear\" Mabel croaked back, \"My daughters family will be visiting today, it'll be the first time since they omitted me to this wretched place.\"<br>\r\n\"Mabel, its a Retirement Home, not a prison, its not all bad.\" <br>\r\nYou creak your door shut, 'Christ, how did I end up in a retirement home' you panic. <br>\r\nDo you hide in your room and try not to get found out or do you get dressed, attempt to sneak out and try to get back to your own home.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps if you can wait them out until nap time, you'll be able to sneak away and get back to your own downtown apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's baffling to you how someone sneaked your unconscious body along with most of your belongings in here overnight.

You'd been out all night drinking, calling your ex, leaving slurred messages, and stopping by several of your friends' apartments to knock loudly on their doors. None of them came to let you in. Their neighbors came out instead, hurling obscenities and threatening to call the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been about three weeks since you'd broken up with your long-time <i>amour</i>, Samantha. Things had gone back to normal. You recognized that the relationship had been doomed from the start. Samantha was bossy; you were submissive. It was for the best that you moved on and found a more perfect match. There were some nights, though, where the pain of loneliness got to you, and you retreated into your worst vice, alcohol, to purge the lingering attachments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned, expecting to feel the brutal hangover that always followed wild nights, but you were surprisingly clear-headed. Not used to this level of lucidity in the morning, regardless of whether you woke up drunk or not, you continued to lie in bed, waiting for the inevitable grogginess, the early-morning Monday blues. It failed to materialize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" you thought. \"Maybe today won't be so bad after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned over to switch off your alarm clock, sensing that you'd woken up earlier than was your custom, and as such making sure the alarm wouldn't go off at 7 AM, when you'd probably be in the shower or kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand went through where your nightstand should have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you said out loud. You pawed at the alarm clock a second time, thinking that maybe you'd missed it, but again, your hand traveled through empty space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat up swiftly, rubbing your eyes before looking over to your right. Where the nightstand once was, there was nothing--only dirty socks on the floor, piled up on top of brightly colored blouses and wrinkled skirts. A few feet past them was a laundry basket, and beyond that, you saw a plain-wood desk with a Macbook Pro, writing utensils, a mess of paper, perfume, a vase of plastic petunias, and stuffed dolls--Beanie Babies, Olaf from <i>Frozen</i>, county-fair prizes, and the sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt went without saying that none of these had been in your apartment, so far as you could remember from the previous night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked around you, spotting a cosmetics mirror, a beanbag chair, and a walk-in closet overflowing with female apparel. Behind you, just above the headrest, was a giant <i>One Direction</i> poster, amidst a collage of magazine clippings and male celebrity photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell am I!\" you exclaimed. You rolled out of bed and ran to the window. Lifting the blinds, you saw a residential street flanked by identical houses. There was no city in sight... You'd somehow ended up in the suburbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside a teenage girl's bedroom,\" you added. You'd been pretty drunk last night, but not drunk enough to run out to the suburbs and break into a house you'd never been to.</span></div></div>",

And how can you not recognise her? She's gorgeous, shorter than you and Ren but assertive in family affairs and overprotective of her younger brother. You met her briefly last year along with the rest of Ren's family who live out in the suburbs. She didn't say much, and Ren gave you the impression she couldn't speak English very well (unlike Ren, she spent her formative years in Japan, not your country).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaring at each other face to face, Akane's confused expression gives way to surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Dareda? Chotto matte... anata wa Ren no tomodachi?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod excitedly, glad to finally understand someone. \"<i>Hai! Boku wa Harold Finnegan desu!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Masaka...</i>\" She trails off, not believing one of her brother's friends can speak fluent Japanese. She grabs you by the arm and drags you outside, where you sit down at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain everything to her, beginning with waking up and hearing gibberish on the radio, then not being able to read the words written on Facebook, to not understanding anything anybody else is saying. You conclude by showing Akane the Japanese language books you purchased from the bookstore while she tries to make sense of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Yet you say you've never been able to speak Japanese until this morning? &gt; Akane speaks to you in Japanese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; I can't even think in English right now. It's really freaking me out! &gt; You reply. &lt; I tried calling Ren but he didn't answer. &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane nods, &lt; That's because he's on vacation right now. You saw his post on Facebook, right? &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that was what Ren was talking about in his post to his family. He'll be out of this country for a few weeks, and that means he'll be keeping his cell phone off for the duration to save on roaming charges. In other words, he won't be any help to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Listen Akane. You've got to help me get through this until... whatever condition I have goes away. &gt; You plead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane smiles, &lt; Of course I'll help you Harold. I don't know how this happened, but it'll be nice to speak to someone besides family in my native language. Though... I wonder what caused this to happen? I've heard people under a lot of stress wake up with amnesia and might even speak in another language. But usually they know that language and recall it from memory. &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriefly you wonder if this effect is stress related. You did just break up with your long-time girlfriend, after all. But if anything you feel relief about moving past that relationship. Not stress. Everything was getting back to normal when this weird change happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane's lips curved, &lt; Wait a second. Did Ren put you up to this? Oh, I'll get that little brother of mine if this is some kind of elaborate joke! &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a group of people walk by. A few of them had overheard your conversation with Akane, and while you can't understand their babbling you think it might have something to do with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Okay, Harold. If you really forgot how to speak English, then what did those girls just say about you? &gt; Akane asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. &lt; I have no idea! Besides, if this were a joke what makes you think I would tell you anyway?? &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane giggles. &lt; Are you <i>sure </i>you don't want to know what they said about you? &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Well, when you tease me like this... &gt; You grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane folds her arms over her chest. &lt; Okay. I'm convinced you can't speak English. I'm not even that good of a speaker and I know they weren't talking about you at all. Something to do with... what do they call it? That film everyone's talking about? Anyways, judging by your panic you can't be making this up. &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a sigh of relief. &lt; Now that you believe me, what should I do? I can't go to work like this! &gt; Thankfully it's the weekend, so you don't have to return to your boring office job until Monday. But if this effect holds over until then, you may have to call in sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; You can come to Ren's apartment with me for the afternoon. He entrusted me with the keys until he returns from vacation. &gt; Akane takes a set of keys out of her purse and jingles them. &lt; That way you don't have to deal with other tenants in your apartment. Plus, &gt; She winks. &lt; If anyone sees us you can pretend to be my boyfriend! &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah! You didn't expect her to say that. She notices you blushing and elbows you playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; I can't believe how fun this is going to be. Come on, let's go! And don't forget your books... sounds like you'll need them! &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumbling lowly in Japanese, you grab your books and follow Akane to her car. &lt; So in other words, you're inviting me to stay at your apartment? &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Don't be cute, &gt; Akane pouts. &lt; This isn't a date. &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt; Hey, weren't you going to get something at the bookstore? &gt; You remind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane simply hand waves it off. &lt; Oh, I was just looking for a birthday gift for a friend back in Osaka. She's always wanted to visit this country and asked me for something special. So I was doing some shopping... but her birthday isn't for another month, so I've got plenty of time. &gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting into Akane's car, you are amazed at how thorough the change affected your perceptions. Any road signs that have text on them look like gibberish. Bumper stickers are indecipherable, as are the various markings, pamphlets, and user's manuals in her car. What you can understand is one of Akane's J-Pop discs, having popped that into her CD player to listen to her music. Ren's sister can't help but laugh at your frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she comes to a stop. Where are you two now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Getting out of the car, you thought about just what was going on. Why did such a sudden change happen? It didn't seem natural in the slightest. You didn't really think that stress or anything of the sort was at play. Heck, things were kind of getting better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever in your 24 years of life had you experienced something like this. Ren was about the same age as you were, with Akane perhaps a year or two older. At least it helped to have someone close enough in age to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat beside the point, Akane took the lead walking up to Ren's apartment a couple floors up. Using the key she had from him, she opened the door, allowing you both inside. Much like the outside, the apartment was fairly typical, a little small but not uncomfortably so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;Thanks for the ride,&gt; you thanked her truthfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n&lt;It's no problem,&gt; she smiled back.

There's a spring in your step, a smile on your face, and a song on your lip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird, because you never sing! You've never in your life been able to carry a tune. But who cares: you're feeling great, so why hum a catchy little ditty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the elevator, you start tapping you toes a bit to the music in your head, even swiveling your hips and pivoting about in a bit of a pantomime dance movement. Mmm you've got rhythm right now, like you've never had before. You're feeling lithe and graceful and incredibly well coordinated. It's as if the music was just flowing through your body, directing your legs and arms to echo back the perfect dance moves to compliment this song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't notice the curious looks from the other people in the elevator until you actually burst out singing aloud again:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you liked it, then you should have put a ring on it!\u201d you softly croon, in perfect pitch. \u201cDon't be mad once you see that he want it. If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it! I got gloss on my lips, a man on my hips, got me \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you suddenly snap out of it as the elevator chimes and the doors swing open. The others all snicker a bit at you, but they say nothing as they exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you'd have been pretty embarrassed. But today you just blush a little and then laugh it off with a girly giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGawd, I can't believe I was singing in front of all those people,\u201d you whisper to yourself, heading out into the parking lot. Again without being consciously aware of it, there's a rhythmic sway and graceful, dancing bounce to even the simple way you move, navigating through the parking lot. Something about your body language has become delicately artistic, like the controlled professional steps of a trained dancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing into your car, you start to pull out of the parking lot when you realize something is wrong. Not with yourself this time, but with the music coming from your stereo speakers! What's this garbage on the radio station this morning? You've always loved this station. Why are they playing such loud, uncouth trash now? Sure, you always listen to classic rock, but today \u2013 blech! These songs are horrible. Fiddling with the dial for a moment, you come up with some female artist singing an utterly unfamiliar pop song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd before you even realize what you're doing, you've pulled out of the parking lot and starting to sing along with this tune you're hearing right now for the very first time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe scars of your love remind me of us,\u201d you sing melodically. \u201cThey keep me thinking that we almost had it all. The scars of your love, they leave me breathless. I can't help feeling: we could have had it all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breakup with your girlfriend was completely mutual. You agreed it was the best thing, and although you were a little glum about it at first, you welcomed the new freedom you'd enjoy once she moved out of your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, something about the words to this strange woman's song on the radio was really tugging at your heartstrings in a surprisingly effective emotional storm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe a tear from your eye, still a bit surprised about this sudden flood of maudlin emotions that swept over you. Somehow, you manage to hold back the floodgates of tears until you can pull the car up to a red light and take a moment to compose yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe raven himself is hoarse that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan under my battlements,\u201d you whisper to yourself to calm your rattled nerves. You're not sure where these unfamiliar words come from, but suddenly you know them by heart for some reason. \u201cCome, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, and fill me from the crown to the toe topful of direst cruelty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird, you think. That sounds like Shakespeare or something. You've never liked plays or the theater. Why would you suddenly have a passage from some moldy, old play memorized? And why would your mind reach for some weird lines about \u201cunsex me here\u201d to find the calm, steely resolve to soothe your frail, womanly nerves?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, the trick works. You drive off from the intersection feeling much more yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you arrive at work, you're feeling pretty normal, which is a good thing. You're Tech Support at a prestigious law office of computer illiterate nincompoops. The attorneys here all earn ten times what you do, but they can scarcely check their own email without you gracing them with your divinely technical intervention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, they've already got a major SNAFU under way when you arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist, two of the paralegals, and one of the junior partners at the firm are all clustered around a printer/copier cursing and loudly berating the inanimate lump of plastic and circuitry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wish these foolish people would treat the equipment a little more nicely! Half the troubleshooting you do around here is just repairing damage done from impatient, frustrated users who think they can fix computers with their fists!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, hold on, let me in to fix it,\u201d you say to the crowd of anxious wage slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need these documents printed out ASAP,\u201d growls Mr. Hoskins, the attorney. \u201cYou've got to get this blasted machine working now, Finnegan! Without these printouts, I won't be able to nail that miserable bastard to the wall in court today. Oh, and I've got him trapped like a rat too. It's going to be so sweet watching him squirm when he spots the legal technicality I've got him cornered into!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTsk, Tsk, Mr. Hoskins,\u201d you reply with absent minded casualness. You're already on your hands and knees, with your head stuck deep into the mechanical guts of the printer. \u201cThe quality of mercy is not strain'd. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about Finnegan?\u201d roars Hoskins. \u201cI didn't ask for any damned poetry. Just fix the stupid machine, and fix it now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis should be an easy, routine repair. This particular model of printer/copier is a lemon. It's always breaking down, and you're always fixing it. Consequently, you've acquired a lot of experience with this specific unit. You can do this type of repair in your sleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, now is different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't recall where the network cables go, to connect with the \u2026 the \u2026 other machines and stuff?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird. You can recall all these Shakespeare quotes and crazy song lyrics, but you can't recall how to plug a printer into a computer network? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these computers and wires and cables and passwords and lines of code \u2013 it's dizzying and confusing. You know if you concentrated really hard, you could probably bring these memories back to the surface. But right now, none of your old job skills are flowing naturally to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, you struggle to remember how to do this very basic part of your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd much to your chagrin, the only thing that immediately pops into your head are more song lyrics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDammit not right now, you tell yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there it is: the proverbial song stuck in your head. You can hear the melody, you know the words to this unfamiliar song, and you know you can hit all the high and low notes with perfect pitch if you wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, almost without realizing you're even doing it, you find yourself bursting into song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am free again,\u201d you sing, the sound echoing pleasantly about the cramped plastic and metal chamber of the printer where you've got your head still crammed into. \u201cWhenever I'm alone with you, you make me feel like I am clean again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI give up!\u201d roars Hoskins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear him stomping away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist and paralegals are softly giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's happening to you today?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite the boss angrily stomping off in irritation at your incompetence, you resolve to stay put and finish the job instead of just making an excuse and going home. Sure, it's true you're not really feeling 100% yourself this morning. But you can hardly justify a sick day on the basis of having some weird, girly songs stuck in your head or suffering a bit of a mental block on how to resolve a tech problem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone has off days, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes you about twice as long as normal to revive the dead printer/copier. Your mind feels a bit numb when you try to remember how to perform your usual tech skills, so you essentially wind up re-teaching yourself how to solve this particular problem. Fortunately, you've always been a pretty sharp person. But it's still damned odd that you should draw a complete blank on how to effect repairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finally complete the repairs, you start walking back to your office again singing a strange little ditty \u2013 utterly unfamiliar to you, but now fully implanted in your mind somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo shine bright, tonight you and I we\u2019re beautiful like diamonds in the sky,\u201d you sing softly, in perfect pitch. \u201cEye to eye, so alive, we\u2019re beautiful like diamonds in the sky. Shine bright like a diamond!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the nearby reception desk, the receptionist and a passing paralegal giggle at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d you call out to them, blushing a bit and laughing yourself. \u201cIt's a catchy song, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's okay, Harry,\u201d says Susan, the receptionist. \u201cI just didn't know you could sing so well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, sorry!\u201d you laugh again. \u201cI won't spare you any more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really,\u201d says Melanie, the paralegal. \u201cWe weren't being sarcastic. You've got an amazing voice, Harry. How do you do it, exactly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo what?\u201d you ask without a clue. \u201cSing? I just open my mouth and \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not that,\u201d Susan says. \u201cHow do you sing like a woman? You sound normal when you're talking, but every time you start singing your voice like, I don't know, becomes different. It sounds like you're a professional vocalist \u2026 only a female one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d you laugh. \u201cThat's crazy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan is right,\u201d adds Melanie. \u201cWhen you sing, your voice gets a little higher pitched. But it also sounds way more polished. You could sing professionally, Harry! Though it is a little creepy the way you sound all girly when you sing. You can't sing in a man's voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought I was,\u201d you say. \u201cLet me try again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou belt out a few more lines of the same song you'd just been singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan and Melanie exchange looks of awe and amazement before finally applauding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou sound <u>just</u> like a woman when you sing,\u201d says Susan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe's right,\u201d Melanie says. \u201cOnly you don't just sound like a woman, you sound like a professional female singer. That's a really weird talent you have Harry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never knew I could do that,\u201d you confess to the girls. Nonetheless, you have to admit they're right. You'd been listening more consciously to yourself this most recent time, and when you started singing it really was the voice of a woman who'd devoted countless hours of practice to honing her musical skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you ever thought about being a female impersonator?\u201d Susan asked with a straight face. \u201cNo offense, Harry. It's not that I think you're gay or anything. But with that voice, well \u2026 you could really fool some people if you got all dressed up in drag and did some singing at a night club or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's ridiculous!\u201d you laugh. \u201cI don't want to dress up like a girl and sing at gay bars!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, really!\u201d pressed Susan. \u201cYour singing voice is dead-on for a girl. You should go on stage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe?\u201d you say, again quoting strange theatrical words from some unfamiliar play whose dialogue just mysteriously springs into your head from nowhere. \u201cCall me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls exchange amused looks at giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere's that from?\u201d asks Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHamlet, I think,\u201d you say, a bit surprised that you know the answer to Melanie's question. You've never been interested in theater or acting before. But then again, you've never been able to sing like a female pop star before this morning, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou obviously have a secret flair for the dramatic,\u201d Susan says. \u201cWhy have you been hiding this side of yourself, Harry? You really should totally be on stage, singing or acting or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not going to be a drag queen!\u201d you say again, blushing with embarrassment at the persistent suggestions of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could probably make some pretty good money on the side,\u201d Melanie adds. \u201cPlus, Susan and I could do your hair and makeup, maybe lend you some clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d you sputter with laughter at the ridiculous suggestion. \u201cI'm not going to start doing drag acts, you two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's a shame, because you really do have such a pretty voice when you sing,\u201d Susan said seriously. \u201cI'd kill to have your singing voice, Harry. I really think you should reconsider. You have a gift that needs to be shared with the world. You could be <u>amazing</u> on the stage!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two girls continued to playfully tease you about your inexplicable new talents throughout the rest of the morning. You put up with their attentions with good natured humor. Although in the back of your mind, you're still a bit worried where these strange theatrical quotations, newly found sense of rhythm, and sonorous soprano singing ability sprang from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, after the recent breakup with your girlfriend, it's nice to have some attention from two attractive, available girls \u2013 even if the attention you're receiving comes in the form of friendly teasing over your strange, gender-bending vocal abilities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry, you want to come with us for lunch?\u201d asks Melanie, glancing up at the clock. \u201cSusan and I just pop around the corner to that little restaurant down the block each day. You should come with us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, come on and join us, Harry!\u201d says Susan, putting on her coat and grabbing her purse. \u201cYou always eat lunch alone and look so sad and dreary. Come out with us for a change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, it's nice to have the friendly attentions of two pretty girls, so you find yourself obliging them and heading off down the street to the corner restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'll bet Harry orders a light salad and a diet soda!\u201d giggles Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha,\u201d you reply ironically. Inwardly, you're relieved though that your appetite hasn't been changed into sometime more delicate and feminine though. You order a big, greasy cheeseburger with extra bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHarry, you know I wasn't just joking before,\u201d Susan says as the three of you dig into your food. \u201cMy cousin works at a gay bar \u2013 it's a really trendy, hot, upscale place. Anyhow, they do drag shows there all the time. I could get you an audition, if you're willing to strut your stuff up there on stage?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you, no!\u201d you say in between bites of your hamburger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust do an audition,\u201d persists Susan. \u201cYou don't have to wear a dress for that. Just come with me after work. Melanie, you come too. We'll all go down there together. You just sing a little bit for them, and then hear what they offer you. It might surprise you to learn how much money a good female impersonator can earn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not a female impersonator,\u201d you laugh. \u201cI just a freakish talent for singing like a girl. A skill which, I might add, remained completely undiscovered to even myself until this morning. I have no interest in wearing a dress and wig. And even though I can contort my voice into sounding like a woman, my body doesn't look remotely passable for a female. I'd make a lousy female impersonator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan and I would help you,\u201d said Melanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe point is moot, because I'm not interested in even trying,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo several hours later, <u>why</u> is it you find yourself walking into a place called The Polo Club with Susan and Melanie on either side of you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my friend Harold Finnegan,\u201d Susan says, introducing you to a thin, pale man with dark hair. \u201cHarry, this is my cousin Brian. I already texted him about your singing ability. Is there a place we can go to \u2026 like \u2026 audition, I guess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrian laughed and shook your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon't mind Susie,\u201d he tells you. \u201cShe thinks that because our moms are sisters that she knows everything I do about showbiz. It's nice to meet you Harold. If you want to go up on that stage tonight, I'm happy to give you a chance. Whether or not you get a return invitation to go back up tomorrow, well that part is up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm really not into all this,\u201d you protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSing for him!\u201d says Susan, kicking you in the shin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the club. They're open for business right now, but as most offices have only just closed for the day there isn't much traffic yet. A few solitary drinkers at the bar and a lone table with three men and a woman quietly nursing their drinks. Otherwise, there's just the bartender, Brian, and the three of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrawing a deep breath, you resign yourself to the inevitable. As much as you're really uninterested in becoming a female impersonator at a drag club, you find yourself strangely enthralled by the prospect of singing again. It gives you so much joy and sense of purpose to belt out a song. You can't pass up the chance to sing again, even it means absurdly auditioning to be a female impersonator at a drag club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEver wonder about what he\u2019s doing, how it all turned to lies,\u201d you start singing. \u201cSometimes I think that it\u2019s better to never ask why. Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame. Where there is a flame, someone\u2019s bound to get burned. But just because it burns doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gonna die. You\u2019ve gotta get up and try, try, try \u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words are alien to you, but somehow they spring into your mind and slip out your lips without the slightest bit of conscious effort. You're singing right now, with the clear professional voice of a woman. The song is you, and you are this woman singing. Right now, you just let yourself fall naturally into the music and it takes away to a place where you aren't a measly little computer tech \u2013 you're a diva in the limelight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish the tune, and the entire club sits still with stunned silence for a moment before suddenly bursting into applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBravo,\u201d says Brian quietly. \u201cThat stage is yours tonight, if you want to work it? We can fit you with a wig and a pair of falsies, and Susan already mentioned she's got some clothes you could borrow. She and Mel seem quite overzealous about wanting to do your makeup, though if you'd like I've got a guy who'll do it professional for you. No offense sweeties, but stage makeup is different from what you gals wear at the office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa!\u201d you say. \u201cLook, I'll admit that I really get a kick out of singing. But I'm not gay, I'm not a cross-dresser, and I seriously have zero interest in doing a drag act here on stage tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you're good,\u201d Brian says softly. \u201cI'll pay you a hundred-fifty for tonight, plus free drinks. Let me see you en femme, and we'll work out a deal for regular appearances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? You're crazy. You're all of you crazy!\u201d you laugh. \u201cThis has to be a joke.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, Melanie, and Brian all look at you with expectant and utterly serious expressions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn't a joke, is it?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiles and shakes her head.</span></div></div>",

You don't have to be gay to perform at a gay club,\" says Susan. \"It's camp! Theater. Showbiz. You've got an incredible female singing voice. Combine that with the image of you in a dress and wig, and it's pure entertainment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still feel conflicted about all this,\" you admit. \"There's something troubling about what's been happening to me today. I never even knew I could sing like this before this morning. Now, less than 24 hours later I'm talking about wearing a dress and performing at a gay club? It's nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you enjoy singing,\" pointed out Melanie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" you confess. \"I get this weird buzz \u2013 a thrilling sense of elation when I'm singing ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... or, you silently add, when you're dancing or quoting obscure lines from plays only a true-blooded thespian would know. Just what is happening to you these days?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, we're going to have a blast,\" says Susan. \"Now stop whining and pouting about something you just admitted you enjoy doing. If you like singing, then why fight it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you caught a taxi back to Susan's place. Before you left the club, Brian had loaned you a professional theatrical wig and a pair of false breasts. They sat in two large boxes on your lap during the trip. The weight of the foreign items seemed to solidify the reality of your unearthly situation. You were really going to wear these things tonight and sing in front of people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought terrified you ... and yet, you had to admit, it also sent ripples of enthusiastic delight throughout you. The girls were right: you really did want to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that fact alone scared you more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Susan's place, you open the boxes Brian gave you and look quizzically at these alien accoutrements of false femininity. You've worn a grand total of one wig in your entire life up to this point, and it was a silly hairpiece for a werewolf costume you wore for Halloween once as a kid. Now this strange, silky soft mane of blond curls sitting in the box was going to be attached to your head for the night? It was a beautiful wig, delicate and feminine. And just like your hauntingly alluring voice, these golden tresses would soon be jarring juxtaposed with the crude, hairy lump of blocky muscle that was your normal, masculine body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow strangely fascinating, the contrast of these disparate, polar qualities \u2013 man and woman, all rolled into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll rolled into you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Marilyn Monroe,\" says Melanie. \"That wig Brian gave you: it's a Marilyn Monroe wig. Can you sing like her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know anything about her,\" you shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a dress I wore for a costume once,\" says Susan. \"I went as Marilyn Monroe. It's going to be tight, but with that wig you'll be riot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squint and frown, imagining yourself squeezed into one of Susan's tight, little dresses. Ridiculous!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading your thoughts, she answers: \"It's camp, Harry! You're just supposed to look entertaining. Nobody expects you to actually become the spitting image of Marilyn Monroe. Don't take everything so seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to shave his legs,\" Melanie adds soberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And armpits,\" Susan says somberly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said it's not so serious!\" you wail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grow up, Harry!\" laughs Susan, dragging you into her bathroom. \"Let's have some fun with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls have you strip you down to your boxer shorts, and then set to work shaving your body with an electric razor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to do your bikini region yourself?\" grins Susan, eying your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" you snap, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't have to shave everything,\" giggles Melanie. \"I think he's passable now, in a dress. It's a long dress, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let me show you,\" says Susan running off to the next room and returning with the garment in question: a strapless, floor length satin dress in shocking pink with a big cheerful looking bow in back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the sort of thing she wore in ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,\" you answer correctly, without ever having watched a Marilyn Monroe movie before in your life. But just as the strange Shakespeare quotes kept flitting into your mind throughout the day, this new bit of film trivia somehow wormed its way into your memories as well. It's as though you've not only gained the ability to sing as a woman, but also gained the knowledge of stage and film trivia that a real life professional actress/singer might possess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got the gloves, diamond earrings, bracelets, and choker around here somewhere too,\" Susan calls out, digging through old boxes of stuff in her bedroom closet. \"The earrings are even clip-on, Harry. So unfortunately, we don't have to get your ears pierced!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you find yourself wearing one of Susan's bras fitted out with big, bulging falsies, then the pink dress, the blond wig, the matching pink elbow-length gloves, and finally the faux diamond bracelets and necklace and earrings. Then you strike a pose in front of the bathroom mirror ... and grimace in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like a drag queen!\" you moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to,\" laughs Susan. \"It's camp, silly! Now, there's no way my shoes are going to fit you, so just wear your regular ones until we get back to the club. Brian will have some heels in men's sizes for you to borrow I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to do your makeup?\" Melanie asks you. \"Or do you want Brian's people to handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're running late already,\" answers Susan. \"Plus, Brian was right: stage make-up is different from what we were Mel. Harry will be better off letting Brian's guy do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp nervously at the reminder that you're going up on stage like this: as a grotesque she-male parody of a pop culture icon of femininity. How did you ever get talked into this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taxi ride back to the club is surprisingly low key. The driver makes no comment about your odd appearance in this tight, pink, formal dress. You figure cab drivers must see everything, over the course of a career ferrying weirdos like yourself around. It must take something truly bizarre to rattle one of these unflappable chauffeurs of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you arrive back at the club and receive an animated and eager welcome from Brian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look smashing, love!\" he says, clapping his hands together. \"You need shoes though. I have just the right thing in pumps that hopefully are your size. Oh, and I'll send Kenny out. He's our make-up wizard. Once he's through with you, honey, your own mother wouldn't recognize you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm hoping,\" you grumble while manually adjusting the heavy new false boobs jutting out from beneath your bold pink dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're afraid to do this, then just don't,\" Brian says sagely. \"Harry, I really think you've got that magic spark only true theatrical geniuses possess. You'll make a great drag queen. But don't go up onto that stage unless it's what you really want to do. If there are any reluctant, lingering doubts you have about this, then it's best you remain a face in the crowd instead of a queen under the spotlights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really do enjoy singing,\" you confess to Brian. \"But this is all happening so suddenly. I never even knew I could sing until this morning. Now, I get this amazing thrill when I'm singing. It's addictive, and I want more. I just don't know about wearing all this girly stuff and performing for a bunch of gay guys ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, you're looking at me, Susie, and Mel like you want us to give you permission to go on that stage tonight,\" Brian says gently. \"We can't give you permission. You have to do that yourself. Do you want to sing or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, there's nothing gay about performing at a gay club,\" Brian continues. \"This is the twenty-first century, hon \u2013 get over your homophobic hangups. Sexuality comes in all shapes and sizes. It isn't a rigid This or That, Black or White kind of deal. There's a whole rainbow, if you'll pardon the cliche: a spectrum that ranges from masculine to feminine, encompassing every delicious little quirk in between. We're all just people, looking for a good time. Now, you've got a gift of song to share. Does it matter what sort of costume you wear while you sing? Does it matter whether your audience is comprised of boys who like girls or boys who like boys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not,\" you reluctantly admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the big hang up?\" smiles Brian. \"This isn't about gay or straight, or whether you're wearing pants or a skirt. This is about singing, putting smiles on people's faces, making folks you've never met before happier than they were when they came into the joint. If that's good enough for you, then you're good enough for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if there's any hesitation,\" continues Brian. \"If you've still got some hang-ups or cold feet about our stage feeling less than warm and inviting to you, then don't go up there. You won't be true to yourself, and you won't be true to us. The audience will know. Look, Harry: I respect a hard-working janitor who's passionate about cleaning a hell of a lot more than I respect a lazy stock broker who doesn't really care about his high-paying job. Anything you do, do it grand. Don't go out on that stage if you're going be scared, skittish and only do a half-assed job. Are you willing to try something new, Harry? It doesn't have to be perfect, but I don't want a lackluster, indifferent attitude. I want to see passionate effort, not reluctant cowardice. Can you shrug off those doubts and be enthusiastic about something you just said you really enjoy?\"</span></div></div>",

With feminine grace and elegance, you move fluidly across the stage in the two inch heels now on your feet, the long pink evening gown flowing along about your legs. The music begins faintly, and you start to sing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe French are glad to die for love.

The smoky air, the hot lights, the enraptured crowd \u2026 they all seem to melt away as your new theatrical skills take full possession and you become a drag queen prima donna, first lady of female impersonators, and celebrity of the moment. You're still you, only now you're so much more, using your powerful new artistic proficiencies to turn on all the acting, the charm, the singing, and the grace of Marilyn Monroe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut stiff back or stiff knees,\u201d you continue to sing. \u201cYou stand straight at \u2026 Tiffany's!
