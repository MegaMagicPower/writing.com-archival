Some that watched over the slayers or trained potentials. Some that researched magical weapons or new types of demons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut him? He was the Watcher in charge of going through ancient texts and recording what they were about. No one knew about boredom until they were stuck in a dry library for 8 hours straight, making notes about a Podunki Demon Cook Book. Most of the books were tiresome little things that other watchers had collected during their travels and expected him to read and document.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich is why today was a bit more interesting. During his examination of a set of older tomes, he had stumbled upon a diary of a Watcher from the 1830s. Inside had been the man's research into the Slayer Line, to determine its origin and source.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the book, Thomas stopped at page 43<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>-runes can not be wrong. I have translated them 15 times, and they remain saying the same thing. This will surely be a breakthrough in the source of the Slayer's power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was originally thought that the Slayer was created by binding the soul of a girl with the essence of a demon similar to a vampire. However, this artifact states a dark truth, one the Watchers didn't even know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to my findings, there is a race of demons known as the Gigatiati. Children of the Old Ones, these demons were truly monstrous in size. Though they appeared to be human, they possess more sexually defined bodies and a desire for sexual release like a vampire does blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gigatiati, when born, would appear to be the size of a standard human, but have the features of a vampire. This allowed them to dwell among their demon brothers in safety until they discovered a mate. Mating would, it seems, trigger their maturity, causing them to grow larger each time they mated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is my belief that it was a Gigatiati child, misidentified as a vampire, that was used in the creation of the Slayer. The runes I have discovered where created by a Watcher from 1143 AD. He states that his Slayer, on her 20th year, without his knowledge, mated with a vampire from the Line of (The words become faded...unable to read)...when he discovered them the next day, his slayer had grown a foot taller, as had her vampire mate. Both showed examples of larger, stronger bodies with more pronounced sexual organs. The creator of the runes also states that the vampire gained the ability to move about in the sun! Most horrifying, the Slayer and Vampire, as time went on, could not control their urges, and soon grew to 30 feet in length and were only focused on filling their bellies and slating their lust. In the end, the Watcher was forced to open a dimensional portal and banish the two. Fate would be kind, and another slayer would be called. It was stated in the runes that the Watcher of the poor cursed Slayer believes that she was transformed from human to demon, and thus why a new Slayer was called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore research must be done. It is my belief that the Gigantiati have been wiped out from most Vampire families, but their genes may still reside in the Order of Aurelius- </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas through the diary down in disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Slayers turning into giantesses...Gigantiati Vampires that can walk in the sun...rubbish!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Sunnydale...</span></div></div>",

It was really pathetic, the way he was hugging her big toe, trying to sink his teeth into her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, knock that off!\" Buffy boomed, raising her foot up and bringing it down, crushing the vampire to dust. She gave herself a happy nod before scanning the town around her. Dozen of car alarms had gone off as she had made the earth quake with her massive footfall. \"oops...guess that will wake someone up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping through...or more correctly, on, the graveyard, Buffy let her mind wander to what she could do today. She was getting hungry, so she could go over to the mall and grab a handful of late-night shoppers. They always tasted good sliding down her throat. Or she could take a trip to the ocean...it was only about a 5 minute walk for her. Go splashing about, using whales as bath toys...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers slide along her nude body, her pussy growing wet as she realized there must be hundreds of people staring at her, gazing at her perfect body.  She was rapidly loosing all sense of modesty, and found that she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe REALLY liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, I know just what to do!\" Long legs covering ground quickly, she soon reached Sunnydale High.

While she wasn't in the mood to take on a vampire that would leave her bloody and broken, it would be nice if at least one of them put up a fight. Make things a bit more entertaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFate, it seemed, was in a humorous mood, for no sooner did Buffy think this than Drusilla emerged from the shadows, her long white gown glowing in the moonlight. Buffy sighed once more, now annoyed that she would have to deal with the loony toons vamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, your boyfriend isn't around here, so could we not do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrusilla smiled at her, fingers twirling her long black hair. \"Mummy doesn't want her naughty boys just yet. She is looking for the sunshine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy smirked. \"Well then, lets stand out here and greet it together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrusilla laughed. \"Silly Sunshine, speaking to her new mummy with such haughty tones. I'll take you over my knee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy twirled her stake. \"Just try it, Morgana.\" She leapt towards the crazy vamp, sending a flurry of punches at her head. Drusilla weaved back and forth, dodging each hit before grabbing Buffy by the hair and sending her flying into a gravestone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Slayer slowly rose up, she noticed something different about Dru. She seemed...bigger. The hem of her dress, which normally brushed the ground, now revealed her bare feet, bits of ripped cloth wrapped around her toes. Her pale wrists stuck out from the sleeves of the dress, and the front had been cut open to reveal more of her breasts, which seemed to be trying to escape. In fact, from the looks of it, Dru was now at least 7 inches taller than Buffy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You go through a growth spurt?\" Buffy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrusilla smiled at her darkly, still remaining in her human form. \"Mummy tasted power...it flows through her, making Mummy the strongest in the land. Soon even the sun won't hurt, and all the baby fishes will be too small to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy rolled her eyes. \"You know what...forget I asked!\" Drusilla merely smiled as Buffy rushed her, stake raised. But at the last moment, the vampire shuddered, and with a cracking of bones gained another 4 inches on the Slayer. Buffy was so startled she flattered, and Dru grabbed her by the throat, lifting Buffy up higher and higher, till they were face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty girl...all alone, so small. Mummy will make you better.\"  Dru's eyes went golden and Buffy struggled to fight the thrall she felt coming over her. \"Give in...give in for Mummy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"n...ne...nev...ne....\" Buffy stammered, feeling weaker. \"N....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give in for mummy. Give in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...ng..ng...gi...give...give in.\" Buffy whispered, body limp. Dru settled herself on a tombstone, rocking Buffy back and forth, the Slayer weakly trying to bat her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give in...give in. You are mummy's little girl now. So small, so weak...you need your mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep in Buffy's mind, a part of her screamed in horror as she softly reached up, stroking Drusilla's face. \"Weak...small...need you...mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrusilla cooed gently as she pulled open her shirt, revealing her large pale breasts. She ran a finger along her left breast, her blood oozing out a strange, glowing green. \"Drink, baby sunshine...drink and become big like mummy...strong like mummy...become like mummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big...strong...like mommy...\" Buffy whispered as she began to suckle Dru's breast. Drusilla lifted Buffy up with ease as she carried her back to the lair, feeling Buffy's body tense as it replaced her own blood with the strange glowing blood Dru had drunk from the size changing demon...Buffy's body twitching as she began to change...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had pulled out of her normal grocery story with her mini-van packed full of bags, only to realize half way home that she had forgotten the milk! The whole reason she had gone to the store. Buffy and Dawn were due home in a few hours after their own shopping trip, and Joyce had been hoping to surprise them with sugar cookies.Both girls had school off for the rest of the week, and Joyce had decided to take off a few days herself and bond with her daughters. The cookies were suppose to be the start of their Mother-Daughter week...  but that wasn't going to happen without milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce had thanked her lucky stares when she had seen the mini-mart. She knew the prices would be high, but it was better than driving all the way back to the store. Hurry past the clerk sitting near the register, Joyce made her way to the cooler, throwing open the door and grabbing the first milk she could find.  Slamming a 5 on the counter, she made her way back to her mini-van. She never noticed that the warning label was torn from her milk, nor heard the call from the half-hogub demon at the register that she couldn't take that milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she bothered to see or hear either warning, she would have known that the milk she was carrying was not fit for humans. The label stated clearly that side affects of drinking the milk from a golblash demon cow included everything from an increase in size (both of the whole body and parts), a loss of sexual restraint, sudden lactation, personality changes, decrease of mental abilities to the point of becoming what humans termed \"a bimbo\", increased libido, chaffing skin (to the point that clothing could not even be worn) and a desire to be near family all the time (varying from simply being in the room together to spooning at night to full on incest). Consult your doctor if you grow so big you end the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe half-hogub cursed and picked up the phone, calling his wife and telling her it was time to leave this dimension. The one without shrimp was lovely this time of year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the best cookies you've ever made, mom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoyce laughed as she watched her daughter pop her 10th cookie into her mouth. She wanted to complain, telling the teen that the cookies had been hard work and were suppose to last more than a day, but who was she to argue? Buffy and herself had eaten 10 themselves. In fact, it had become an unplanned game, the three Summers women competing to see who could eat the most cookies. Right now, it was a three way tie, and thanks to Buffy's quick reflexes, Joyce had no choice but to admit defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I am glad you enjoyed them.\" Joyce raised her glass of milk, Buffy and Dawn doing the same. \"Here is to a week of just us girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy grinned. \"hear hear!\" The three women knocked back their glasses, the milk sloshing down their throats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No, now there was something so desirable about being that huge...showing off for the world...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe few times she had been left alone in recent months, she had reenacted those childish games, only this time naked and bringing herself to orgasm, imaging Barbie was Buffy, helpless to stop her as she shoved her tiny face into her giant pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, a new world had opened up when she had found her new favorite website. Now, more than ever, she longed to not only be bigger, but to have someone with her...someone to join her in her rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed when he mind flashed to her best friend, the vampire Spike. She wondered if he knew all the times she had spied on him sleeping, commiting the image of his nude form to her memory. If he had any idea that she had begun to dream of them 50 feet tall, laying on top of Sunnydale, him making her a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's body quivered as she plunged her hand down her pants, stroking her clit. 'If only...if only...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might be able to help,\" A voice declared.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn let out a scream, making away from the strange woman that had appeared in her room. The woman was wearing a plain dark business suit, her hair pinned up in a bun and little black glasses perched on her nose. Dawn all at once felt a bit silly for yelling...the woman looked more like a librarian than a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am a threat.\" The woman said, setting her briefcase down on Dawn's bed and gathering her papers. \"But not to you.\"  She paused for a moment. \"And please don't scream again, I've made the room soundproof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...wha?\" Dawn asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman frowned. \"This must be your first time. Come, sit.\" Dawn sat down on the bed, the woman pulling out some forms. \"I can assume, since you are the sister of the slayer, that you know about vengeance demons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn gulped. \"Uh...yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now then, my name is Titana, the Patron Saint of Sexually Repressed Women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn blinked. \"There's such a thing?\" She paused. \"And if you are really...that...why do you look like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take this form to put women more at ease. I appear just as repressed as they are. And of course there i such a thing. Since the beginning of time there have been women forced to hide their sexual desires. It is my job to ensure they are able to exact vengeance on those that repress them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn shook her head. \"But...but no one is repressing me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there is. You live on the Hellmouth and have access to magic tomes and spells. It should be easy for you to find the correct potion to make your dreams of growth come true. But fear of your sister and her friends keep you from doing so. Thus, I am here to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn began to scoot away. \"I don't know about this.\" The woman gave her a smile before taking out some powder and blowing it on Dawn. The teen blinked, sneezing once, before she felt her stomach flutter.  \"What was that?!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a spell that allows you to feel freely. It removes your fears and doubts and allows you to focus on your desires. Don't worry, if you choose not to have the spell casted, it will wear off in a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn smiled, feeling her body react to the freedom the spell provided, all sorts of deeply hidden naughty thoughts coming to the surface. \"Cool.\" She murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, according to my records, you are repressing your desire to become a giantess, while also allowing a man in your life, a certain William the Bloody, to be your giant lover. Is that correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn nodded, squirming as the image of her sucking Spike's cock while clutching a tiny Willow and Xander between her bare breasts appeared in her head. \"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, most vengeance demons would only grant one wish. But I have found that in such cases that what is needed is a multi-headed wish.\" The woman smiled. \"I am very professional.\" Pulling out some documents, the woman laid them out for Dawn to see. \"I have created several packages for you to take a look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Packages?\" Dawn asked, forcing herself not to think of a certain blond vampire's package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitana nodded. \"Yes. First is Package One. It is your standard growing wish. You and your lover, Spike, will grow slowly over the course of time. You will have the ability to stop at any time, then resume growing as you desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn frowned, seeing several problems. \"Spike...uh...isn't exactly attracted to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that is easy to fix. You see, he does desire you, he just refuses to acknowledge it. This wish will cause him bring that sexual desire for you to the surface, while repressing all other desires. You will be the light of his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn grinned at that, loving the idea of her sister's shocked face when she realized Spike had chosen Dawn over her. \"Wait...if we grow, Spike will be out in the sun...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, don't worry about that.\" Titana pointed to another point in the contract. \"This is your standard protection clause. It will ensure that you and your vampire can not be harmed once the spell is casted, be it by physical actions or magical...it will protect you from your red-haired witch's need to fix things. I assume you'll want an eternal youth spell added to that, so that you and Spike may grow together forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn bounced up and down. \"Oh yeah, need that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. I will also throw in a 30-day spell-support clause. For one month, if you desire to change the spell, remove it, or add to it, you may contact me. Now, would you like to sign the contract now, or see some of my other packages?\"</span></div></div>",

This is a fun one for a person looking to be naughty but also keep their normal life.\" Titana spread out the new contract. \"This one, like the one before, contains the same protection clauses: No physical harm, no magical tampering, eternal youth, and of course William embracing his sexual desire for you.\" The woman paused. \"Are you familiar with werewolves, Dawn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn nodded. \"One of Buffy's friends was one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" The woman said with a laugh. \"So, I won't need to do much explaining for Package B. This one will turn you into a Weregiant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A weregiant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded. \"Yes. A weregiant is a human that, when they become sexually arosed, will rapidly transform into a giant or giantess. There are bodily changes besides growth...for example, you will have longer hair, much bigger breasts and ass, as well as some demon aspects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Demon aspects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you will technically be a demon once the spell takes form, you just won't look like it until you are sexually arosed. It tends to be different, person to person, with anything from skin pigment changes to horns and tails, but you will remain for the most part yourself, just a much bigger version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn considered this. After seeing so many demons in her short like, as well as strange things...it was surprising she wasn't a demon already. \"Ok...but you said only I'll be a weregiant...what about Spike?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitana laughed. \"Dawn, a werewolf makes more werewolves by biting them. Weregiants are similar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to bite him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. You will need for him to taste your cum. One sip, and he will become just like you.\" Titana nodded to herself. \"Of course, that means you will have the power to turn others into weregiants, should you choose...friends, family, your sister, your teachers...anyone you desire. And just like werewolves or master vampires, they will be loyal to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's eyes closed, imagining herself 100 feet tall, forcing Tara to lick at her gigantic pussy, then watching the little witch turn into a weregiant herself, Spike standing behind her with his cock buried up her ass, while Buffy kenlt at her feet, crushing City Hall with her ass at Dawn's command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...sounds fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. And because of the transformation, you will be able to lead a normal life, with no one knowing you are the giant destroying the town. It has a certain naughty aspect you might enjoy.\" Titana smiled. \"So my dear...do we have a deal?\"</span></div></div>",

I am ready to be a weregiant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good!\" Titana said, handing Dawn the pen. \"Now, allow me to explain a few ground rules as you (initial here) take care of the paperwork. You will grow whenever you are sexually aroused. At first, you will have little control over this, so I suggest you be ready. As time goes on, you will be able to control yourself and only grow when you are ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next, how big you get and how long that lasts is entirely up to you. It could be a few minutes or whole years, if you have the willpower. Next (And sign this line there) as I said your cum will be able to turn any person that tastes it into a weregiant as well; it will also cause any feelings they have towards you to become full blown love.\" Titana paused. \"And there we go!\" Remember, you have 30 days to call for me to change or alter the spell. Standard protection, immortality, youth and other clauses are already written in.\" Titana stood up, adjusting her glasses. \"I will check in from time to time to see how you. Enjoy yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that , Titna was gone in a flash of light, leaving Dawn alone...her body trembling. She could literally feel the new demonic aspects of herself clawing at her from the inside, begging to be let out. Her hand drifted to her pussy, as she dreamed of her wildest naughty thoughts coming true. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted slightly as her finger fingers began to tease her swollen lips, feeling her skin become almost electric as her new powers began to manifest themselves. Suddenly realizing that it might not be the best idea to grow here, in here room, with all her favorite things just waiting to be smashed (better to wait till she was used to this before she began damaging her own things), Dawn threw on some flip flops and hurried out her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy would have been proud of her little sister, seeing how she moved with stealth through the house (well, atleast until she learned WHY Dawn was being so crafty, then proud might go out the window). It was really hard, considering Dawn's hand kept wandering down the waistband of her pants, touching and flicking her clit, making her bite back moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally, at long last, Dawn made it to the backyard. She looked around quickly, ensuring there was no one to watch her, then looked up at the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A full moon...how poetic.\" Dawn giggled at the thought before her throbbing pussy took control, her new demonic privates demanding attention. Dawn thrust her fingers into her dripping snatch, letting out whimpers and moans as her body began to tingle and her bones began to pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God...it's happening!\" She squealed, her pants becoming tighter around her expanding thighs. Titana had been right about there being more changes than just growth, as Dawn found herself rising up more from her ass inflating and her view of her pussy blocked by her swelling titties. Nipples the size of saucers began to tear through her thin t-shirt while her hair grew longer and fuller, the demonic powers causing it to become a brilliant electric blue color. She twisted and turned, letting out a cry of bliss when she saw that the fine fuzz that covered her dripping snatch was also becoming the same color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn's flip flops fell from her expanding feet as she continued to grow, stripes of blue appearing around her ankles, wrists, forearms, calves, stomach and breasts. If she had been able to see them, she would have been shocked to find her eyes had gone pure black with wicked, lust-filled blue irises the only thing penetrating the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Dawn forced herself to stop, denying herself final release. She wanted to stay this big for a while, and was in no mood to shrink right back down after bringing herself to orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Dawn whispered, her voice more sultry and cool, looking around at the destruction she had caused. She rose up, her feet sinking into the lawn. She had grown nearly 20 feet tall, able to just look into her bedroom window. Dawn took a step back...crushing a lawn chair in the process...and began to giggle quietly too herself. \"Alright, so I am large and in charge...time to make part two of this fantasy come true!\"</span></div></div>",

Yes, she was big, but she wasn't big enough to go stomping down the street without a care in the world. She needed to be stealthy, careful, until she could get her man, a few minions, and be able to grow to a good city-stomping size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is how she found herself making her way through backyards and side streets that no one ever used, crouching as she walked so any late night passerby wouldn't see her and call the cops. She knew it wouldn't be a problem dealing with them, not with all the clauses that Titania had put into her deal to ensure she stayed nice and safe and big, but she didn't want the hassle of the cops or, worse, the Scoobies, investigating her and ruining all her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn had been feeling pretty good about herself as she finally made her way into the cemetery. She'd managed to get there without anyone looking at her (though it did bug her new demon-enhanced sensibilities that no one had gotten a chance to drool over her big bouncy boobs and pert inflated ass...Dawn groaned slightly at the thought and shot up another foot) and she was now ready to yank Spike out of his crypt and have her naughty way with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this being Sunnydale, things were never ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn blinked as she felt something collide with her leg. She looked down, narrowing her eyes at the vampire that had slammed into her calf and, with an evil grin, brought her bare foot down upon him, feeling him dust under her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, why do-\" Buffy skidded to a stop when she found the vampire she had been going after long gone and replaced with a over 20 foot tall giantess. \"Wow...they grow them big where you're from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn should have been scared. This was what she had wanted to avoid. And yet, when she looked down at her 'big' sister she felt something in her tainted soul snap and her desire to beat and command her sister swelled within her, nearly as much as her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...I'm just special,\" Dawn said lewdly, running her index fingers along her hard nipples, eyes half closed in passion. She rose another few inches at the stimulation. \"Want to see how special I am? Get a taste of my power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy backed away slowly, trying to figure out how she could take on this demonic creature, never realizing this curvy, sultry thing was her own baby sister. \"Yeah, I have to say...ew, did you just wet yourself?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn looked down to find pussy had grown quite wet and a few droplets of her honey had leaked out and begun to run down her leg. Dawn reaching her fingers towards her mound and wiped away the cum, looking at it before staring at Buffy. \"Come on...you want a taste...I know you do. I've seen the way you've stared at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady, I am staring because your huge and naked.\" Buffy leapt at Dawn, only to get swatted away by the giant girl. The Slayer slammed into a tombstone, seeing stars as Dawn thundered towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me, I know you do.\" Buffy groaned as the air became heavy with the smell of sex. It made her dizzy and feel as weak as a kitten. \"I've wanted you for a long time...all of you...and now I think I will take my prize...\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, he was a hell of a stud, especially for a dead man, but this...Dawn had buried it for so long, but she lusted for her sister like nothing else on Earth. For so long she'd kept it to herself, barely even recognizing it on a conscious level. But now, with no inhibitions, and no limitations...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're all mine,\" she purred, lowering to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden shock and tremble of ground brought Buffy back to her sense for the last time. She made a startled cry of fear, protest, and general disgust at the three-foot long slit above her, and that was her fatal error. Upon contact with the ground, Dawn's wet snatch released a small shower of her fluids, some of which went directly into the Slayer's mouth. Before she even had time to wretch in disgust, it was over. Her eyes clouded, and she looked up at Dawn reverently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm all yours, mistress,\" Buffy whispered, even as she started to grow...</span></div></div>",

If there was a part of her that didn't want this to happen it was buried under a mountain of sexual desire and need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuffy's shirt began to tear away and rips formed along the legs of her pants as her body began to expand. Dawn licked her lips in desire as she saw Buffy's toes burst through her high-priced shoes, the little piggies wiggling as the slayer's legs stretched out. Buffy's breasts inflated to porn-star size and her ass trembled and jiggled as her body burst out of the last remains of of her clothing. Just like Dawn, Buffy's hair changed color, only this time to an electric green to match her now glowing eyes, and the same stripes that marked Dawn as a weregiantess appeared on Buffy's body. The young woman screamed in lust as as she reached 10 feet, huge by normal standards but tiny when Dawn looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...\" Dawn moaned, reaching to finger her clit. She was shocked when Buffy leapt forward, batting her hand away and rubbing her hands along the much larger pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... let me... mistress...\" Buffy panted, sealing her fate. Never again would Buffy know a free life... the slayer was dead, for she was now a weregiantess and servant to her massive mistress, her desire all that mattered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do... do you know who I am?\" Dawn panted. When Buffy looked up at her with glazed over, sexually charged eyes, Dawn nearly exploded in orgasmic bliss. \"Not your 'little' sister anymore, am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, Buffy gave her a wicked grin. \"No... Mistress Dawn... not at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe acknowledgement and the submission did it. Dawn threw her head back and bellowed as she began to expand again, her feet taking out a small crypt while her ass ate up tombstones that got in her way. Buffy continued to grow as well, matching her in speed and intensity as she licked and teased the massive pussy. Dawn's screams echoed through the night as she expanded faster and faster... her breasts swelled to the size of sedans and her her beauty become all the more alluring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, with a mighty spray, Dawn came, covering Buffy with gallons of weregiantess-creating cum. Buffy fell onto her back, licking her hands and arms clean.  Dawn slowly stood up, 50 feet tall, and reveled in her power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... what now, Buffy?\" Dawn asked, watching in amusement as Buffy licked the cum off her own feet.</span></div></div>",

She wanted to be a god, and she knew enough about the dark underpinnings of the Hellmouth to know such a thing was theoretically possible for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that goal in mind, she knew she needed to act logically. And logically speaking, the biggest danger to her plans, after her own sister, was Willow. The young witch was not only brilliant, but possessed a level of magical power that had foiled malicious entities dozens of times over. Now that she was on the other side of that battle, Dawn knew she absolutely had to add Willow to her harem, ensuring that such skills wouldn't be used against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis, of course, had the added advantage of putting Willow's knowledge and skills at Dawn's disposal. And Dawn would immediately set her witch slave to the task of increasing her own powers and magnificence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, if she was to add Willow to her team, there was no reason to leave poor Tara out.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tara sighed, flipping through her text book while ignoring her professor as he droned on and on about useless facts involving Freud. When she had signed up for this class, she had expected things to be different. The last thing she wanted was to listen to a history of a man who was long dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, Tara had recently found herself suffering from dreams. Strange, erotic dreams that left her panting and n need of new pjs...and sheets...and a mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't anything to be shocked about. She hid it better than Anya, but Tara was addicted to sex. Not a moment went by that she didn't think about having sex with someone, taking quick peeks at people as they walked past her, dreaming of eatting their asses out or licking their chests till her tongue was numb...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara was a sexual dynamo, she just knew how to hid it well. It helped that she was so shy in public, as it forced people to think of her as a quiet wallflower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the last few months, her normal dreams of kiny positions and toys had been replaced by a strange, strange dream. Each night it became clearer, allowing her to remember more, until now she could see almost the entire thing just by closing her eyes: She was towering over the Earth, the planet able to fit in her palm, giggling as she heard all her friends begging her to to not hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, HE would could up behind her, his long, thick, throbin cock pressing agains ther tight little butt hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he was well...a he...was shocking, and enough to really throw Tara off. That and the idea of being so big...Tara had never been into marccro, but after each dream she found herself panting and desiring somethign crammed between her legs...and Willow's tongue just wouldn't do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few nights ago had she finally heard her dream lover's voice...and found herself shocked that it belonged to a certain blonde british vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, why she was taking the class. Tara was hoping that if she took the class, it would tell her something about her dream, and why she was having it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut so far...nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlipping through the pages, Tara stopped when she found a small section towards the end of the book, discussing the idea of Id Release. It read:<br>\r\n<i><br>\r\nWhen one represses their true desires for far too long, it is not uncommon for these desires to manifest themselves in strange, unpredictable ways. One theory on the human mind calls for a cure known as Id Release. This is where the subject lets go of all their restraints and do exactly what they wish, the theory being that by giving into their desires, they ease them and allow themselves to return to their normal lives.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nTara smiled as she read this. It was certainly an interesting idea, and better than anything she had thought up to this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer professor told them that class was dismissed and Tara, with a new spring in her step, made her way to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least two characters must grow, and grow BIG. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have began adding some story starting points for people to begin with, but feel free to create your own scenarios!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome important things to remember:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can't have one person grow bigger by themselves or become so big that their partner looks small. This is about having two giant people together, experiencing the adventure together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-There is no limit to growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You are welcome to add other kinks (watersports, vore, mind control, transformation), but I reserve the right to delete your addition if you move the focus too far away from growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-This is suppose to be erotic, so there will be sex. Don't be surprised when it appears. Infact, growing should make the characters horny enough to want to get it down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-If you must let clothing grow with them, it should be ditched as soon as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Any couple is up for grabs...even if you want to go the incest route and have Buffy and Joyce or Buffy and Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I'd prefer no male/male slash, but if you must, I guess its ok. Female/female slash is fine though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-You can have more than 2 people grow...infact, if you want all the Scoobies to become giants and use the town as their mattress, the more power too you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Make your chapters longer than a few sentences. Atleast a paragraph or two. The longer, the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Don't jump into a storyline and change everything. If one storyline is focused on just two characters, don't add a third without giving everyone the option of staying with the first story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-I reserve the right to delete short, nonsense chapters.</td>",
