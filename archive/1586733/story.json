Surprisingly enough, she noticed this gain and decided to keep going along with it, since she didn't feel like stopping. As she grew, her shirts and skirts got tighter and buttons would frequently pop. Belts also became difficult to wear, since they squeezed Mimi's constantly growing belly. Mimi's parents were naturally concerned at first, but Mimi became determined to gain, so they decided to let her do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the time this story begins, Mimi had reached 200 pounds. Her belly grew so large it seemed to be forming an apron. Mimi's face had grown an extra chin, while her cheeks plumped up considerably. Her limbs fattened up as well; basically, she was big all over. She even grew about four to six inches as a result of her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi was currently dressed in her signature cowgirl outfit, but she had grown so large it was hard for her skirt to hold itself together. She still wanted to keep it, so it was refitted for her as she grew. Her shirt wasn't so lucky, as the buttons popped of some time ago. Mimi kept it as a sort of accessory, but wore another solid shirt as her main top. It couldn't cover her belly, though, but Mimi didn't mind. She was enjoying her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi had just finished off a large slice of cake. As she patted her belly in content, she heard a knock at the door.

Oh, you're probably wondering why I'm so fat, right?\" Sora said. It was true; Mimi couldn't believe Sora's new form. Sora gained in pretty much the same way Mimi did. Her belly poked out of her yellow shirt and was acting as a resting place for her hands, which looked like meatballs with sausages sticking out. Sora apparently outgrew all of her pants, as she was clad in a long, blue skirt that could probably fit her better than any jeans could, possibly even better than sweatpants, too. Her hair was tied back in a bun similar to Mimi's; she wasn't wearing her signature blue helmet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably wouldn't think much of sumo wrestling, Mimi, but I thought that I'd try it out. It's no professional league, but it's something I think I'll enjoy. So I fattened up to get in. Makes sense, right?\" Mimi was still a little stunned, but felt that it did indeed make sense. \"I guess so. Actually, I'm a little embarrassed. I just got fat because I wanted to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, Mimi. That's kind of why I gained, too!\" Sora reassured her friend. \"Hey, you know what? You should join the league! You'd be great!\" Mimi never really thought about sumo wrestling at all, much less join a league. She did, however, want to hang out with Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'm in!

But she decided she would tell her. \"Right, I'm weak.\" Said Sora, Mimi was confused with this statement. So Sora continued \"After all finished, my life return to normal, but 2 weeks after that, my mom got a good job, she was hired as Head Chef at a cake shop. She brought tons of cakes to home, they looked so delicious. At first that wasn't so bad, I played soccer and I eated a Slice per Day. My mom already gained 20 pounds, and I wanted to avoid that. But I was weak, the cakes was so delicious that I then ate 2 slices per day, then five, then a whole cake per day, before and after soccer practice. When I got to 160 lbs, I got tired too quickly, so I was kicked from the Soccer team.\" I was so depressed that after that I ate even 3 cakes per day, and without Soccer, nothing burned the calories. It was so horrible when I weighed with my mom to see she was at 240 lbs, and I was 280. It was her job to get fat, but I was fatter. I depressed even more. And now I'm here, at 330 lbs, I came to seek a last hope on you to help diet, just to discover that my last hope also let herself go.\" Finished Sora, with a tear falling from her wide cheek. Mimi then placed her hand on Sora's shoulder and said \"Hey, wanna know how I got so fat? Because I wanted to gain, is so relaxing not to worry about what and when to eat. I'm at 200 lbs by now, I like so much my soft belly. And when I saw you, I actually was jealous about how fat you got.\" Sora gave Mimi a little smile. Then Mimi said \"HEY!

Looking at her body she saw that she was fatter than before and let out a huge scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?!\" she gasped as she viewed her round spare tire belly that poked out from under her constricting shirt. She could also see her massive breasts, her bra which once fit perfectly was cutting into her skin. Her gigantic butt and thighs also were already ripping her once perfectly fit pants. Mimi was no longer the trim girl she once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mimi? Is that you?\" asked the voice of Lilymon, her digimon's ultimate form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lilymon! Thank goodness you're here!\" Mimi began, running to the source of the voice. \"Something terrible happened. I got fat somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the only one...\" Lilymon muttered as Mimi saw her and gasped. Lilymon was even fatter than her.

The reason that she didn't likes first day of school is because every year, all her classmates returned from vacation skinnier, or at least the same. But she always came fatter. She has been a fat girl all her life. This is because when she was little, she couldn't play too much sports because she got sick very easy. So she just stayed home to watch TV and eat junk food. When she saw outside the window and noticed all the kids together with her brother Tai and a little blonde kid she was liked, she got depressed and eat even more. That's how she got her frame of 260 lbs.<br>\r\n\"Hurry up Sis, we will be late for school.\" Replied a manly voice. \"I'm coming.\" said Kari. Kari's big brother, Tai, is waiting for her. He is very fat, but, contrary to his sister, he wasn't fat before. When he was11 years old, he used to play soccer and had a slim figure. But one day, he had to take a drastic decision. One day, when he came back from soccer practice, he was about to open the door when he heard crying from inside. He decided to hear from outside, his sister was crying and saying \"that's unfair, I hate this illness, I wish I could be with my brother and friends, I feel lonely.\" Tai's heart broke that day. He loved Soccer, but loved even more his sister. The next day, he quit the soccer team, and just stayed home with Kari doing exactly the same as her, watch TV and eat. Kari was happier since then. Their mother was very proud of Tai because of his loyalty and kindness towards Kari, but also was a little disappointed because Tai didn't burn any calories. Today, she got used to that. And Tai now tilt the scale with 210 lbs. Very fat, but doesn't rival with Kari's.<br>\r\n\"Come Kari. We have to go now.\" said Tai. \"Right, I'm comming.\"</span></div></div>",

T.K. reluctantly woke up &amp; felt his belly while his mom left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, T.K. was a fat kid, &amp; a very young one at that. He was always 144 lb. since he was 3-years-old. He was morbidly obese, yet still breathing normally &amp; walking without much of a hitch. Now T.K. was 8-years-old &amp; weighed a staggering 169 lb, &amp; most of it was fat. T.K. wasn\u2019t always like this though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started off as a very skinny baby without much fat. Then when his parents broke up when he was 2-years-old he stopped eating meals &amp; went to sleep more often. This, without nourishment, left his baby body very groggy &amp; weak. He was in desperate need of weight gain. His mother put him on a crash diet for weight gain &amp; brought home nothing but the fattiest of foods. She even let him have more candy &amp; sugar in his diet to bring his weight up. T.K. was at first reluctant because he missed his brother Matt who he never got to see anymore, finally it was time for a family intervention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt &amp; T.K.\u2019s dad came for a visit when he was almost 3-years-old &amp; talked to him. \u201cT.K. we\u2019re very worried about you. You\u2019re nothing but skin &amp; bones now. You need your nutrition. Just listen to your mother. &amp; besides, if Matt does it too, then will you do it?\u201d T.K. was intrigued by this &amp; decided to say yes. He really wanted to see his brother get bigger too. \u201cGreat, then we\u2019ll see you in a few months, keep up the good work little man.\u201d After that T.K. couldn\u2019t help but binge out on fatty foods that his mother gave him &amp; he ate it gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few months later on his birthday, Matt &amp; dad came back to find him at an astonishing weight, 60 lb. of 3-year-old, a little bit bigger than expected, but he could lose it easily. His mom tried to get T.K. on a diet, but he was spoiled with fatty foods now. He usually has temper tantrums got him what wanted. This with his glorious appetite left him a blob of a boy.

He wanted to join the soccer team at school he barely made it, so he started working out with his good friend &amp; neighbor Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came that faithful soccer game. He was blocking a shot when the guy kicked him in the shin, fracturing it. He was hospitalized with a broken leg for 4 months. With nothing to do he started eating a lot.

After that he gained even more out of depression, thus bringing us here to his present situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put Kari on his bed &amp; noticed she had a fever again, not surprising as she was usually sick &amp; in need of extra medication. He got her the medication &amp; his mom made him breakfast. \u201cHere you go Tai. This should give you enough energy for the day.\u201d She made him 4 strips of bacon, 6 eggs, &amp; a stack of pancakes (no wonder he started gaining weight).

This is inhum-!\u201d you never finish your sentence because you were all dumped into a huge forest. All the rocks looked thicker, the plants were more swollen, &amp; the soil seemed a browner. Then they saw little creatures that looked like they were watering the plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the creatures introduced themselves. Tai was connected with a pinkish ball with floppy ears called Koromon according to what he said. \u201cWow you guys are cute.\u201d Then he heard a gurgle, \u201cGuess I must be thirsty. Do you know where the nearest well is?\u201d then Koromon pointed to the top of a hill with his floppy ears. Tai tried to get himself some water but found themselves tired at the foot of the hill. Then Koromon hops up &amp; gives him some water, but not just that but a huge basket of huge &amp; fleshy fruit. \u201cDo you expect me to eat this much food in one sitting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoromon nodded yes. \u201cHumans are supposed be big. It\u2019s good for you. Are you sure your human?\u201d he inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course I am, do I look like a\u2014What are you again?\u201d Tai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a digimon. A creature made of digital information compounded into a physical form. We\u2019ve been waiting to serve our masters &amp; that would be humanity.\u201d Koromon responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are you making me eat so much then?\u201d Tai inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur human masters were incredibly fat. They told us that our duty to humanity is to help them reach their full potential of growth &amp; knowledge so they could mirror the creators.\u201d Koromon explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019re telling me I\u2019m supposed to get fat just like your masters?\u201d Tai asked yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes you are. If you want to live here like your friends. You\u2019ll have to get fat. I\u2019ll show you where they are.\u201d Where did Koromon take Tai?</span></div></div>",

I really think I should be going now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. You wouldn't want to miss out on all the eating &amp; relaxation... am I right?\" Koromon said then a tray with burgers, milkshakes, French fries, &amp; dozens of other fatty foods were conjured up on top of his ears, filling the breeze with a greasy &amp; sweet aroma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess not. Still, I guess gaining weight a little more wouldn't hurt me any more than it already has. So tell me, how fat were these 'Masters' of yours?\" Tai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see, carry the five, add the zeroes, &amp; then it all adds up to about... 1,000 lb... give or take a few hundred.\" Koromon responded nonchalantly. Then Tai's expression froze as he nearly choked on his food at the thought of getting that fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?! Are you crazy?!?!?!? People can't get that fat without being on life support or on their death beds!!!!\" Tai shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh contrary my dear big friend. You see, the physics or biology of the digital world is made to enhance fantasies &amp; dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're saying is that I want this to happen to me?\" Tai responded warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why else would the great ripple have brought you here, unless you had some desire to be fat inside.\" Koromon quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTai was shocked, but he wasn't shocked for long as he saw several changes in the beach around him: One-these feeding-tube-like straws were attached to the kids\u2019 faces, inlcuding Tai. Two: the water turned bubbly like it was carbonated, &amp; the sand felt more comfortable underneath them as if was made to be solid &amp; plushy. &amp; Three: everyone was getting fatter at about 5 lb. per minute, &amp; Tai at a lesser rate of about 3 lb. per minute.

They were each the size of foothills on File Island &amp; just kept getting fatter, with their enormous Waterbedmon caretakers &amp; by now Super Mega Level Digimon that were super saturated with joy &amp; happiness at the care of their masters. They spoke only through rumbling stomachs &amp; telepathy with each other through the Waterbedmon\u2019s giant conglomerated network as they were moved off the island &amp; into the open sea where they lay without sinking into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA peaceful paradise had begun, but to the children, something was missing. They were so fat that a whale looked like a calf in comparison to their gargantuan body parts. Their skin &amp; body were as healthy &amp; as beautiful as could be; they lived in constant ecstasy from sexual stimulation, in part from the Digimon; &amp; the flavors were orgasmic &amp; rich, as the soil &amp; water they drifted on. It was Tai who brought up this point during their one-year anniversary of staying in the digital world. \u201cMimi, can I ask you something?\u201d Tai asked through the Waterbedmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course boyfriend\u201d Mimi said slightly sleepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we live in a portly paradise of excessive adipose in complete bliss, but if there was anything you might have missed from the real world, what would it be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I suppose we would all agree it would be our parents here to be with us to build a new &amp; better world\u201d Mimi responded sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right Mimi, I do miss my parents &amp; sweet little Kari. Oh what a shock it would be if they could live here with us in blubbery bliss\u2026 You know now that we have evolved our non-physical abilities to demigod status, I say we use it to bring our families here &amp; more children to enjoy this weighty &amp; wonderful world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh!\u201d everybody reacted with rippling jiggles. Then with the Waterbedmon they activated their special temple that was really a giant digivice to send a message to the real world. It sent out a spiral of blinding white light as bright as the stars, &amp; soon the parents arrived in complete joy to see their children again. Although it was a bit difficult &amp; uncomfortable to explain to them that they have embraced their gloriously fat &amp; naked lifestyles to live in comfortable peace to build a better world. The parents were reluctant to agree to live in fat freedom like their children, but when they heard about the health benefits &amp; the ruling rights they would receive once they change the world, they agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was especially true with Tai\u2019s parents who had also brought Kari with them. Now whole gang &amp; their families each have grown even fatter, though the children (including Kari) choose to stay the size of continents with their parents as mountain ranges on top of their bellies &amp; boobs, soon the whole digital world had a new foundation of freedom &amp; fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin another year &amp; a half, four more children named Davis, Cody, Yolei, &amp; Ken arrived &amp; grew to cover the moon &amp; grow life there as well. BY then the human world had discovered their location at last &amp; decided to cultivate the digimass gene that the children give off. Then came the best part, Digimon started to live in the real world &amp; began to help humanity GROW into acceptance of their new size. &amp; they lived Fattily Ever After\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rather than stop drinking her milkshake Sora's waterbedmon waves a tentacle over to Tai to coax him closer, once in range the two waterbedmons connect thier tentacles allowing telepathic communication between the two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tai, I see you've been bulking up too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, um Sora, you used to be almost as athletic as me, why'd you go for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?

Then before you could open your mouth you saw the Waterbedmon attach tentacles to the other kids' Waterbedmon &amp; you heard them talk, but they weren't moving their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is weird. I wonder what mom &amp; dad would say if they saw us now. Should I be worried about us completely losing our health &amp; dignity in nude immobility?\" the bigger &amp; bulkier boy with spiked blonde hair said, or so I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey how are you doing that?\" Tai asked without opening, let alone moving his mouth or throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! You can hear us? I think I know what's going on. Telepathy. Our Waterbedmon are allowing us to communicate via telepathy from their tentacles\" said a little blonde ball with glittering blue eyes &amp; a squeezed baby-faced, preteen face came out from behind the blond spiky-haired boy. \"Oh by the way. My name is T.K. &amp; this is my big brother\" T.K. introduced trying to turn his head around &amp; look at his BIGGER BROTHER..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Matt. I'd shake your hand, but I think Waterbedmon would object. So what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Tai. So tell me T.K. Matt. how do you guys really feel about being blobs, or at least eventually becoming immobile naked blobs of blubber?\" I chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Matt paused, trying to figure out how to best state his most likely repressed feelings. \"I think this is a great opportunity but I'm not certain if we should stay here forever, I mean we have family back at home &amp; if they find us or we return, there's gonna be a lot of questions &amp; a whole lot of, DIET &amp; EXERCISE. Huhhhh\" Matt responded with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Matt. WE could live out our greatest dreams of fatdom here. Here WE'RE in charge, &amp; we could live this lardy life forever &amp; ever &amp; ever &amp; ever.\" T.K. responded dazed, yet attentive. \"Besides none us of ever liked diets &amp; exercise anyway &amp; we could be a family Matt. Just like before. We don't have to be apart again, I know you want us together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!?! What are you talking about T.K.?\" asked Matt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimple. I've heard you talking about being together again, just like the good ol' days before mommy &amp; daddy divorced.\" T.K. responded with nostalgia &amp; hint of, sadness. Sorrow? Regret? All of this as he started to get teary-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was pondering this &amp; soon came to this conclusion. \"T.K., you know what I think?...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then Matt felt the strangest sensation as he started to suckle on the vine, it tasted like sweet licorice &amp; candies of all kinds. Matt was already quite fat &amp; getting close to being unable to stand up on his own, even if he wanted to, but after a few more hours of suckling on the candy vines, he was at a whopping 500 lb. His blubbery body had ballooned by gaining gargantuan girth from that massive meal. the tendrils took themselves out of his mouth &amp; his belly-button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooo... that's good sweetness Gabumon\" Matt panted \" By the way, I think it's time for our next big activity Tai, but first I have to explain this concept to Gabumon &amp; Waterbedmon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Matt, I already know what you're thinking.\" Waterbedmon giggled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone was being watched from the paintings by a mysterious figure. He was a powerful creature saw them through the glass of the chandelier. It was a monstrous demonic digimon who called himself Devimon. He was a digital representation of the devil himself. He used his dark magic to trap them on this place called File Island &amp; then bring them to his mansion.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Davis's POV) I was waking up to my alarm clock to head to the soccer field to practice my goal scoring. As I ran I felt so weird, it was good to be lean &amp; muscular, I was popular with the ladies at my middle school (even the higher grades wanted a piece of me), &amp; I had great teammates. But that's just it, I only had teammates, no real friends to note, good family (even my annoying sister June &amp; her mystery boyfriend that always keeps mom &amp; dad talking), I soon realized there was something missing in my life, I know I don't want to sound like I'm preaching or philosophical, but my body &amp; mind wanted to try something extreme.<br>\r\nBut enough of that, I should be getting back to my story. On my way to school I ran into two hugely padded guys with what looked like large custom one-piece wrestling singlets that could fit a bear inside of its carriage &amp; the overalls would still expose a lot of flab. I stared so much that I accidentally tripped on their sandals &amp; landed on my face. When I came to I found them squatting (probably too fat to bend or go down on their knees) &amp; realized they weren't muscular, they were fat, hugely fat &amp; padded sumo wrestlers. I noticed their girth made them apple-shaped, very spherical like their face was almost squashed into their expanded moobs, belly, &amp; back fat. I soon realized I was staring when they put their hands out to help me up. \"Hey little guy, you okay?\" the blubbery blonde asked with quivering jowls &amp; shivering well everything, even the singlet was shaking from his speech.<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine.\" I responded &amp; then I grabbed the blonde's hand &amp; the other guy's hand (he was a brunette) as well. They were surprisingly strong as I almost flew off the ground like a rock from a slingshot that almost overstretched out my arms. \"Ow! That hurts!\"<br>\r\n\"Oops &amp; it's okay little guy,\" the brunette responded, \"We should have been more careful... By the way, my name is Tai, &amp; this is Matt.\" he zealously introduced himself &amp; pointed at his blonde friend.<br>\r\n\"Hey, how's it goin'?\" Matt responded calmly, then put his hand through his golden locks of spiked &amp; gelled hair. \"We were just on our way to get some paperwork for my little bro so we can continue being home-schooled\".<br>\r\n\"You &amp; your bro are home-schooled.\" I responded confused, though that may have been my concussion talking.<br>\r\n\"Yep me too. Tai responded, \u201cIn fact, he could use some company his age while we're out getting the paperwork done. This may be a lot to ask, but would you like to come to our house &amp; meet him??\u201d Tai queried.<br>\r\nI thought about it for a while, &amp; I realized something, these guys seem to be fat &amp; proud of themselves for it. That must be what I\u2019m looking for, my calling, I wanted to be a sumo wrestler. So I wanted to learn more about this little brother, if anything, he\u2019ll be at least chubby for his age, so I said, \u201cOkay! How do we get there, that is if you big guys don\u2019t mind waddling. Oops I meant walking.\u201d I responded with embarrassment.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s ok we\u2019re used to it. Right Tai\u201d Matt asked.<br>\r\n\u201cRight Matt\u201d Tai flashed a smile in my direction &amp; they took me to their family\u2019s home in their huge SUV which had a valet, &amp; their home was shared in this huge mansion in the more wild areas outside of Tokyo. I got inside &amp; saw the place was affluent, but classy &amp; made with low ramps &amp; elevators for these two huge boys. \u201cThis is where you live?\u201d I stammered with my jaws dropped halfway outside of the house.<br>\r\n\u201cYep, for the past three years. We\u2019re sort of the nouveau riche as we built up a fortune in sports &amp; sciences.\u201d Matt answered with a hint of admiration.<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been living the good &amp; quiet life. Not too much commotion, but plenty of time to relax &amp; a job our parents like\u201d Tai quipped.<br>\r\n\u201cWow! This place is incredible, but I guess that must explain how you got so, you know\u2026\u201d I supposed my incomplete sentence.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2026 FAT yet STRONG!\u201d Both friends responded at the same time. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s what I meant\u201d I spoke awkwardly. \u201cYou guys have gotten fatter &amp; stronger with all the paid training.\u201d I finished unsure of what to say.<br>\r\n\u201cYep we did, but we\u2019ve always been fat, even before we became sumo wrestlers. Remember that Matt.\u201d Tai inquired, to Matt.<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. We went to a fat camp &amp; had a life changing experience that changed our families. But first let\u2019s introduce you to T.K.\u201d Matt responded. Then he went to activate an intercom to an unspecified location in the mansion. \u201cHey T.K., Izzy, you\u2019ve got company.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of company?\u201d slurred a low staticy rumble from the intercom, like his voice was being deepened, or resonated from inside of a cave, then transmitted using old radio technology. This was probably T.K.<br>\r\n\u201cNew friends around your age so tidy up.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah sure thing bring \u2018m in.\u201d Then I was lead to a large cargo elevator which proved my point of T.K. being fat. But now that brought up the question, why would they need a cargo elevator with support ramps &amp; padded seats?\u201d I understand if Matt needed it, but if T.K. were to come out, he wouldn\u2019t fit inside in-between all this girth.<br>\r\nFinally we reached a low sub-terranean corridor &amp; saw what appeared to be a combination wheelchair/bed/computer that could have fit a hippo comfortably &amp; snugly into its armrests. Then as we got closer I saw a huge white glob of cascading hills of dough that could only be described as pure lard &amp; fatness, &amp; there at the peak of the mountain, there came a hugely padded but somewhat sleepy face that was dimpled &amp; contorted into an extremely pouty face with no angles or sharp lines.<br>\r\n\u201cMornin\u2019 \u2018little\u2019 bro!\u201d Matt shouted attempting to awaken this beastial blob. \u201cYour new friend is here, try not to scare him too much\u201d he laughed at the thought of such fear. I was shaking in my knees, heck I don\u2019t need cellulite to show how much I\u2019m shivering right now, for despite the warmth, I felt suddenly cold &amp; exhausted at the point of fainting. \u201cEasy little dude, T.K.\u2019s not gonna hurt you\u2026 Say T.K. remember how much you wanted a new friend, well I brought him to you, so play nice.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Tai  &amp; Matt left the room &amp; as the elevator closed, I was still gaping awestruck &amp; in a complete stupor that I almost didn\u2019t realize I was drooling &amp; had a hard-on though I\u2019m not gay. Or am I? Never mind so I tried to think of small-talk when he asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now I admit, being only 11 1/2 years old, i don't have a big dick &amp; I certainly never thought of how big it could get when hard, but I soon discovered my dick was growing till it was the width &amp; thickness of a baseball bat. Then I thrusted &amp; ginded into T.K.'s massive ass which was about the size of two desktop globes inflated to the size of a large backpack &amp; completely jiggly. I felt &amp; heard him moaning in ectacsy &amp; I could feel my body tighten &amp; tighten as I knew it would now that I'm losing my virginity to a straight guy. I finally finished &amp; came like a cruise ship inside of him &amp; for some strange reason I could've sworn I saw him inflating before my very eyes with my cum, not just in his ass, but everywhere else too. It was like his ass was injected with a  warm water enema. I was flabbergasted, though I shrugged it off &amp; moved on towards his dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took forever but after lots of pushing, tunneling, &amp; excavating, not to mention forcing T.K.'s legs apart even further I found his dick &amp; ballsack. His dick was most definitely like a small satellite antenna with an orb of fat that was as wide as a laptop computer &amp; as thick as rubber around his tip. His ballsack was exponentially the size of a bag of watermelons &amp; appeared to be over ripe &amp; red from overuse. THen I slowly but surely got on top of T.K.'s mast &amp; started riding it as I kicked &amp; punched it &amp; peeled back the orb tip with sweaty fingers I saw it convulse &amp; bulge outward with semen which I then had the urge to taste. The taste was wonderful, like a semi-melted butter ball with whipped cream. I sucked &amp; I drank &amp; even deep-throated his dick to get it directly into my stomach, but then the weirdest thing occurred. I started getting fatter before my very eyes. I crawled &amp; pushed outward till I reached clean air &amp; saw T.K. huffing &amp; puffing like a barge &amp; i soon realized we <i><b>are </b></i> both getting fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.K. was geting even bigger &amp; looked like he might be in need of a new wheelchair/feeding bed. because he was overflowing out of his like a melted icing cake. I on the other hand was pretty skinny beforehand, maybe a tad bit pudgy near the thighs, but never had I seen such rapid weight-gain (next description may be off). First my belly became the size of a flattened, but still over-inflated beanbag chair. Then my legs &amp; feet were practically enveloped in pillow sized slabs of fat that covered me down to my feet till they looked like elephant stubs. Then came my moobs which were perkily resting on top of my belly like it was filled with marshmallows &amp; drooped to the sides. My hips &amp; ass jutted outward till I got a curvaceous pear-shape (though I wanted to be an apple-shape) I soon became like a busty supermodel with hips at least 3 in. thick from the waist &amp; ass cheeks outward. My arms were about the thickness of molasses &amp; practically swimming in fat as they were encumbered the desktop-globe sized shoulders, to the dimpled basketball-sized elbows, &amp; even down the last micro-joint of my fingers which were as wide as water bottles overflowing with liquid lard. Next came my groin; my groin was about the size of a large laptop in area &amp; the ballsack practically bursting with balls now as if they had multiplied since gaining weight &amp; my dick was about the length a water bottle with a desktop lampshade funnel for a tip (this is all when I'm just flaccid). Finally my face was like a well rounded jellybean dimpled with cheeks that could fit a dozen softballs. All in all, I was a very happy but surprised &amp; well-fed ex-jock. \"Woah! This is incredible, but how can we both be getting fatter. Cum shouldn't be able to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nT.K. got out of his daze long enough to notice his body &amp; my body then slumped his shoulders even closer to his face for an even more adorable cherubic smile. \"I don't know how that happened, but I know only one reason &amp; it'll be a long explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey try me.\" I said using his own words against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll show you. Then a flash of beautiful light occurred &amp; we were in a forest of incredible wonders &amp; my clothes had been replaced on my body with some stylish, albeit slightly smaller cargo shorts, a military shirt, &amp; a flaming jacket, all with my signature goggles. \"Years ago I ended up with my brother &amp; his friends in this alternate world where these amazing creatures called digimon live\" he waved his hand &amp; jestured towards the clearing where I saw a beach. \"There prime purpose was a serve humanity in a fat, leisure-based world starting with its children. We can get as fat as we want in the digital world but we planned to have our powers &amp; digimon moved to the real world. So now we live in fat peace slowly biding our time to fatten up the world\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great &amp; all. But what's that have to do with me? &amp; why are we getting fatter without eating anything?\" I asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting there. After we left for our world, we discovered from our digimon that a prophecy of a small group of new digidestined would come &amp; finally begin the journey to fatten up the world into global peace &amp; fat utopia. I think you are one of those people Davis, &amp; as for us getting fatter, we discovered when digidestined have sex with somebody else, the reciever of sperm or milk gets fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was, I was astounded, I was bespectacled, I was dumbfounded. Nothing could have prepared me for this day's discovery. I was elated. Now I could get as fat as I wanted. &lt;http://biffiea.deviantart.com/art/Davis-350857821?q=gallery%3Abiffiea&amp;qo=0&amp; #62;. THen out of the bushes came a digimon.</span></div></div>",

He had had fun with Geomon all day,but now it was time to go home,but after had fought a digimon on the other side of the city before it was time to go home it was a long walk home for him.And boy was Takato bored during that time,luckiliy the digimon they fought was a very interesting one,it was called Moneymon and had shoot money at them during the fight,Henry wasn't there and so wasn't any others,so Takato got all the money for himself,and even more luckily,the money Moneymon had shoot at them wasn't digimoney,it was real world money,so Takato was secretly rich. He could even buy his fathers store,even 10 of them if he wanted.<br>\r\n\"Growlll\"Takato's stomach made a loud growl and Takato holded his stomach,he was really really hungry.Then he felt a very good smell,the smell of nuddles,fried nuddles to be precise. He saw a little nuddle shop were the smell came from and runned immdeiatly over there and bought one of everything.The cook thought he was joking,but when Takato showed him the money and said that he wasn't joking he got his order through.<br>\r\nWhile Takato was waiting his stomach made another growl.<br>\r\nHe looked through his bag to see if there was any bread left,surprisingly,it was,and it was alot of it aswell. As Takato was digging through his bag his orders came out one after one,but it would take sometime before they were all finished.<br>\r\nBut as soon as Takato found any bread he immediatly stuffed it into his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Okay Sir,that's one out of everthing hope you enjoy your meal now Sir\"The cook said and looked at Takato.Takato was about to say that he wasn't hungry any longer,but when he saw all the food the thought that he cook would get angry if he didn't eat it all up,so Takato started to dig in on the 18 dishes of nuddles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the first huge bowl that was ramen with fish and sushi he wanted to say that he was full,but he didn't want to angry the cook,so he countinued to eat.<br>\r\nThe second bowl of ramen was even bigger,it litterly had two hole lubsters in it and two halfs of a fish.It took him nearly an hour to eat up everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato felt a bit weird around his stomach,his regual light blue vest felt kinda strecthed,and it started to feel tight around his waistline.<br>\r\nBut he still got 16 more bowls of ramen to go,so he countinued. After yet another bowl of an almost immpossible amout of ramen with cheese and ham and chicken Takato needed to rest just a tiny bit. He took a little time to check his stomach,he layed one hand on the top of his chest and slowly trased his body.Soon he hit a small bulge,and he felt that his jacket started to get kinda strethced.It really started to feel uncomfertebull.But then the chef came out from the kitchen and Tkato got scared and started to gorge down on the ramen.<br>\r\n5 bowls later the chef had taken the 8 empty bowls and taken them into the kitchen to clean them.<br>\r\nTakato countinued to eat even after the cook had left.Now his jakcet started to feel extremly uncomfertebull and tight,and his jeans were really really tight now. After had finished the his ninth bowl of ramen Takato suddenly felt a soft brees on his skin.He took his right hand on his stomach and taced the hand downwards.Then his fingers made contact with his skin.His shirt and jacket had risen a bit and it was only a few inches left until his navel would show.But then he saw that he had eight bowls of ramen left,so he disaded to countinue anyway.<br>\r\nAfter another two bowls he suddenly felt a little though and he stopped mid eating.He did the same again and this time he felt his own navel.His jacket and shirt ha d risen one inch over his belly button.He was a bit emberresed knowing that so mutch of his skin was showing,but atleats maybe he could try to snug his jacket over his belly button so it wouldn't show,but he also felt his belt was uncomfertibly tight now and he reached down his hands to uncuff his belt,whitch he almost immdediatly regret because then his jacket and shirt raised two more inches over his belly button.But now he only had five bowls left of all that he had orderd.<br>\r\nBut after 3 more bowls of ramen specialities he suddenly heard something.<br>\r\n\"POP\"<br>\r\nHe tried to look under his now very cicular stomach to see his pants,but he couldn't see pass his baseball to a stomach.So he took and his hands again and felt around his stomach and down to his shorts,there he noticed that the button on his pants were missing and his zipper had been unzipped.<br>\r\nThen he felt a cold breeze on his back.He felt around his back and got quite the surprise,his jacket and shirt had risen so mutch that they started to rise on his backside aswell.<br>\r\n\"How is it going there,you look kinda pregnant,how long time until your water bursts\"The chef said with a cookie tone to Takato.<br>\r\n\"HAAAAAAY!!!!That ain't nice to say to your customers,and I am only a bit full,that is all!\"Takato said and gorged down on the last three bowls of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter have finally have finished the last three bowls of ramen Takato sat back in his chair resting and padding his swollen belly.<br>\r\nHis pants had started to brake under his zipper and his white boxers were showing,but underneath the zipper weren't the only place were his boxer was showing,they started to appear a tiny little bit close to the area of his zipper aswell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while Takato gets up from the chair and stopps just for a tniy while to get used to the new weight that was infront of him.</span></div></div>",

Takato is about to leave he sees somethign interesting.<br>\r\n\"Heeeeyyyyyyy!\"There it is\"Takato said and bents down under the bar disk to pick up the button of his pants,but then he hears an embarrising sound.<br>\r\n\"RRRrrrriiiicccccchhhh!!!\"<br>\r\nTakato could feel his pants givin after and the fabric of his pants breaking.From behind right in the middle of his butt there was now a crack in his shorts and his white boxers shined through.Takato quickly took up the button from the ground and put it in his pocket and the cowerd the crack in his shorts with his left hand.Then it he started to walk home.But then it hit him!!!<br>\r\n\"Ohh maaaaaaaaan\"Mom is gonna go through the roof when she sees me like this,and she is gonna forbid me from eating bread and put me on a diet\"Urghh\"Takato shiverd by the mear thought of a diet,especially a one hundred procent vegiterian diet.<br>\r\nTakato countinued to walk home,but with a mutch slower pace then before,but he also considererd the thought of checking in a hotel over the night,it was Saturday anyway,so why not make a quick lie to not return home for the night,and then for the rest of Sunday he could exresice the food baby away.That sounded like a good plan,but then he walked past a very interesting poster,on the poster it said.<br>\r\n\"Have you gotten a beer belly,a pot belly,or a food belly or just a belly you don't want anyone to see,come to madam thinniht and we can hide that belly for you,just a few block away\"\"that's great,and I can get a full treatment and still walk home rich as a troll\"Takato said encuraged,happy and eagerly and started walking towards the place were Madam Thinniht was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter have walked for about half and hour,he finally found the place,and after a bit of problem and explenation in the lobby,and after have paid them full price for what he wanted they finally agreed on him and asked him a few things.<br>\r\n\"You want me to what?!\"<br>\r\n\"Take of your pants,that is all.We are gonna repair them,fix them,make it impossible to see the diffrence from before and after the weight gain\"<br>\r\n\"Okay,I guess\"Takato said to the young very nice lady and gave her his pants buttons and his belt and then stepped out of his pants\"<br>\r\n\"Sure you don't want my boxers aswell?\"<br>\r\n\"No,but we have prepaired a few that looks exactly like those that you already have,because you might wanna change afterwards\"<br>\r\nHearing that made Takato slighly nervous to what he just had stepped into.<br>\r\n\"I almost forget to say,we are gonna do the same thing to your jacket and shirt,so of they go\"<br>\r\n\"Okay then,I guess\"Takato said and did what he was orderd to and took of his jacket and shirt.<br>\r\nThen once Takato was all done the girl guided him to a nice room.<br>\r\nIn the middle a very nice bed was,but it looked like it could be raised up and a few other things.<br>\r\nTakato was orderd to climb up on the bed and so he did.<br>\r\nThe bed wasn't really a bed,it was a very nice and soft matress with a metal frame around it,but the matress was comfortebell atleast.<br>\r\nThen they asked him to stretch out his legs and arms and spread them a bit.<br>\r\nHe did so and the soften of the matress amde him kinda drowzy.<br>\r\nThere was about four girls in the room around the bed,he countinued to stretch and even yawned a bit.<br>\r\nThen they started to poke around with his belly and gave him some belly massag.<br>\r\nTakato noticed that it was only two out of four girls that was giving his stomach massag,but he didn't care,this was nice.<br>\r\nBut suddenly he felt something around his arms and it got tight around his arms.<br>\r\n\"Click\"\"Click\"<br>\r\nTakato looked up and noticed that they just handcuffed his hands,but before he could react they put a strap around his arms and looked them to the metal frame,and when his arms were looked to the metal frame so was his feets aswell.<br>\r\nThen he bed dislodged from the base and started to rise up in the air,and then it was turned so it faced the leader of the group.<br>\r\n\"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!What are you mmmfffffffffmmmm\".The leader put a mouth gag on him so could speek.<br>\r\n\"This may be a bit uncomfertebull,and we really don't want you to scream,so that is why,and I think you are a bit to young to see what we are about to do with your food baby\"The leader said and put something over his eyes.<br>\r\nFirst he could feel they got his stomach and chest coverd in some sort of cream or goo.But then he only felt weird pains.<br>\r\nFirst it felt like he had been hit in the stomach with a metal object or rock,then it felt like got crushed by a press of something,then he started to sweat,it got extremly warm around his chest.Then after have wanted to scream for about ten minutes in the intense heat it stopped,then it felt like they were rearranging his organs,he wanted to puke,but then he felt completly curshed,broken,right in pieces in the middle,he wanted to scream,but he couldn't,then he fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short while Takato woke up in the changing room.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm,what happend\"Takato said and looked around,he was in the changing room,and there his repaired pants,jacket and shirt was waiting for him.<br>\r\n\"Ugghh\"What is that smell\"Takato said and looked around,then he looked down on his boxers,they were nearly yellow.<br>\r\n\"My boxer!!!I can see them\"Takato said and felt around his waist,no stomach,no start of a deforming chest,not anything,just a flat nice soft skin.He even felt a bit taller,about an inch or two taller.<br>\r\nAfter had changed to his new boxer he saw a weight.He disaded to weight himself.<br>\r\n\"Oh,why not\"Takato said and stepped on to the weight.<br>\r\nHe had gained about twenty pounds,but it wasn't showing on the outside atleast,he thought and grapped his butt,no change there at all,still stiff and strong.<br>\r\nOn the mirror on the wall it was a poster with side effects,and it was only one.<br>\r\n\"Warning:This treatments only removes the changes of weight in apperence,but it dosen't change the weight you have gained,the only way for you to lose the new weight is  to exresice it of,we can not help you,but if you want to reveal your secret,just sprey your stomach with this sprey standing underneath this poster.Spray again and on your navel to hide your weight again.<br>\r\n\"Excrise,no way I am doing that,and that spray must be this spray\"Takato said and took up a little spray bottle.<br>\r\nThen Takato got dressed and checked through his pants pockets,the money were still there.He sighted in relif,then he walked out from the changing room and found himself almost home.<br>\r\nSo he walked home and hide the spray in one of his pockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he walked through the door and into the dinner hall he got himself a HUGE surprise.<br>\r\nHis dad had made a HUGE dinner,but that wasn't the surpise,ALL OF IT WAS BREAD!!!!<br>\r\n\"Welcome home son,Dad just finished making dinner\"His mom said and gave hima hug.<br>\r\n\"Daaad?W-What is-s this?\"<br>\r\n\" I am planning to start making more types of bread,and I want you to test them,sooooo dig in\"Takato's dad said and pointed towards the table full of bread,and more was stuffed around the table.<br>\r\nAll three of them sat down around and started to dig in.<br>\r\n1 hour later.<br>\r\nThey had now gone through half of everyhing on the table and it started to show on everybody how mutch they ahd eaten.<br>\r\nTakato's belly was now a quite wisebell lumb.<br>\r\nAnother hour later.<br>\r\nTakatos belly had grown even more and he started to get uncomfertebell around his waist,but this time he knew what do do and unbuckeld his belt,now the table was empty of bread,but now his dad had given him three basket with bread over the top filed with bread.<br>\r\n2 hours later.<br>\r\nTakato's belly was starting overhang his waistband and his button was about to pop,then it poped and hit his dad right on the knee.<br>\r\n3 more hours.<br>\r\nTakato's belly had grown magnificently and it was terring through his boxers and shorts started to break,but he felt a bit taller aswell.<br>\r\n1 hour later.<br>\r\nTakato was walking up to his room and went to bed,all the bread finally over,and hit had taken its tool on everybody.<br>\r\nTkato had a more fillied face,his arms started to get a bit chubby aswell and his boxers and shorts were starting to break,and he had starter moobs.<br>\r\nBut his dad gave him and them some encuraging words.<br>\r\nHe said that the brillijant thing about this bread was that it would quickly be digested and the weight gain would disappear and thier bodies would return to normal ver night,but the full feeling would remain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day after a bread free and quick breakfast Takato stormed out of the shop,but not before he had weighted himself,he still had gained ten more pounds and it was some wisebell flap slightly wisebell through his jacket and shirt and it overhanged his waist just a tiny bit,but then he was of.

fast as he could,but his hidden gut made it harder for him and soon he was out of breath and walked instead.Takato walked through the city,it was still morning so maybe the ramen shop hadn't opend yet,but that was not were he was going.<br>\r\nWhen he finally came to the ramen shop it was close.But Takato didn't want to go to the ramen shop,he wanted to go into a back alley near the ramen shop that he had discoverd on his last visit to the area.Sweet and misterious aromas came from the alley both then and now.Takato smelled in the air and caught a scent of curry.He liked curry and he was kinda hungry after have runned through the city just to get to this place.His tummy then made a massive growl signifying that it was very hungry.Takato shrugged it of a bit and entererd the back alley,but if the ramen shop would have been opend the chef would have tried to prevent from entering that place.<br>\r\nTakato walked through the back ally,it almost seemed like an entire city.He countinued to walk on and soon he found the place were the sweet scent came from.The curry shop was opend and he sat down on a chair.<br>\r\n\"Hello there!May I help you?\"The shop owner asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes,I have alot of money and I am very hungry so I would like one of everything if you please\"Takato said and took up the money and showed them for the chef.<br>\r\n\"O-okay Sir,right a-away S-sir\"the chef said and enterd his kitchen.<br>\r\nVery soon the food came out and Takato didn't even hesitate and started to eat.<br>\r\nThe more he ate the more it seemed came out.<br>\r\nSo many diffrent tastes and so many diffrent dishes.He completly piged out on the curry,it was delicous.The place served many diffrent kinds of curry and they all tasted great.<br>\r\nNatuarlly as more food and curry entererd Takatos belly,it started to grow,and grow and grow and grow.For every dish it got bigger and bigger.This time Takato was a bit prepaired for taht and he reached down and unbuckeld his pants and unbuttonend them aswell,then he countinued to pig out in a big way.<br>\r\n3 hours later the chef had finally stopped taking out dishes for Takato and he could finally take the empty plates away.<br>\r\n1 hour later Takato was finally done and he relaxed a bit in his chair and breathed out with a strong curry breath that almost knocked the chef out.<br>\r\nTakato took some time to look down on his belly.His jacket and shirt had risen about 5 centimeters over his belly button and he couldn't look past his belly.He looked like a 5 month pregnant man,witch was impossible.<br>\r\nTakato took sometime to get used to his new weight.Then the chef came out and asked for his money and Takato gave him his money and even some dricks.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,Sir.Now.I think you need some new clothes and maybe a place to rest,this little resturant is conected to a hotel,just go about 5 meters away and there is a door on the same side as this little resturant,go in there and check in\"the chef said and pointed Takato in the right direction.<br>\r\nTakato said thanks and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to the door and opend it and walked in.When he had closed the door he found out that that was the main entrens to a gigantic luxury hotel.<br>\r\nHe walked up to the kasher and said that he wanted to check in.The kasher looked awhile on him,then he nodded and made a friendly smile.Takato took up some money and gave it to the kasher and the kasher gave him a key.Takato thanked him and then walked away.On a huge timer it said that it was 15 minutes to lunch so Takato walked up to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in his room he looked around.It was like a house in itself.He walked up to the wardrobe to get some new clothes.He then found himself being scaned by the wardrobe itself and then it opend and an exact copy of his clothes appeard but they were fitted to his new weight and size so he throwed away his old clothes into the garbadge can and then got into the new clothes,they fitted like a glow on him.He even looked a bit slimmer in them.Then the watch said that it was time for lunch so he walked down.<br>\r\nWhen he had gone down to the cafeteria he found out that each guest had thier own table.He sat down by the table and then the personal reveald what they were serving for him.Huge plaets with almost everything.One huge plate for one type of food.On the table thier was Hamburgers,cheeseburgers,baconburgers,french fries,spaghetti,ramen,steakes,cakes,pizza and mucth mutch more and Takato just piged out.Even after have emptied 5 huge plates he still didn't feel full.He countinued to gorge through the massive amounts of food that they served and about 3 hours later he was finally done,his belly now looking like he was 9 months pregnant.<br>\r\nHe wadeld up to his room and collapsed on the bed and almost instently falled asleep.<br>\r\n5 Hours later.<br>\r\nThere was a knock on the door.<br>\r\nTakato woke up and opend the

He pretty much got what he wanted from mom &amp; dad all the time anyway, this was just even more spoiling than usual. He tried to get a present for Shinya, but he didn\u2019t like it, threw a tantrum which broke a vase in the house. &amp; guess who got the blame, yep Takuya. He tried to enjoy the party, but he beat Shinya at a party game &amp; he was also in trouble with his parents, a week of no soccer. Finally to add insult to injury, Takuya accidentally knocked over the birthday cake &amp; he was also grounded for a month after that. Just when things couldn\u2019t get any worse, a text message showed up, who was it from? Cherubimon, though he didn\u2019t know at the moment that Cherubimon was making a preemptive strike to get to the warriors first. \u201c<i>Takuya, do you feel dissatisfied with the way your life is going? Would you like to get away from it all</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya tought for a moment &amp; texted, \u201cYes &amp; yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>What would you say if I told you I could not only get you away from your life, but also make it a dream come true.

Just show the ticket holders this text message &amp; you will have a ticket to a whole new world of possibilities. Friends, family, love, &amp; fortune.

As he got on the trains, Takuya saw two VERY important factors about this deal he didn\u2019t realize before.  1, the trains looked way different than ordinary trains, as if drawn by cartoonists. &amp; 2, it seems that he wasn\u2019t the only kid who got this deal. It seems that dozens of others got it as well. He got his first-class ticket &amp; went to the front where he saw a small boy with a white shirt &amp; a big orange hat. He sat next to him &amp; started talking. \u201cHey little guy, I\u2019m Takuya. What \u2018s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cTommy, &amp; I\u2019m 9-years-old. How old are you?\u201d Tommy said with a hopeful smile.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m 11. So what brings you here to this little deal this stranger is giving us?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I wanted to make some friends &amp; get a better relationship with my big brother, I\u2019m gonna miss him.\u201d He said sadly, then beamed up as he said \u201cHey, I\u2019ve got an idea! Can you be my big brother in this new place, cuz\u2019 I\u2019m scared of what could go wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry little man. I have a little brother of my own, so I\u2019ll be glad to take care of you. In fact, I came here for the same reason as you, except it\u2019s my little brother I\u2019m talking about.\u201d<br>\r\nThen a deep, but kind voice, like a king\u2019s, spoke through the intercom, \u201cTesting, testing, is this thing on? Good! All passengers turn on cell phones &amp; be ready to depart, we\u2019ll be there in a half hour.\u201d Then they felt the train accelerating at dangerous speeds as lights flashed in many colors all around them. The strangest thing that happened was that their cell phones were transforming into orbs of light which surrounded them &amp; they were in an energy bubble as data, &amp; they were naked. Yes, naked, just like in their digivolved forms. They felt weightless &amp; numb from paralysis as their bubbles opened up from above &amp; revealed ____ carrying them into a violet castle complex pinkish energy shining from it.<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

What are you? &amp; how are you going to change our lives?\u201d<br>\r\nCherubimon chuckled like jingling bells &amp; said, \u201cMy dear sweet boy I know your names as I am a digital being, born of data about angels, &amp; I treat all children as my own, so that\u2019s how I know your names. &amp; once I have the rest of the children here, you will all understand what I want in exchange for the reality change. In the meantime, enjoy yourselves right here in the orbs I have provided for your comfort. Don\u2019t worry about being seen, your bodies will be covered as you undergo the transformation.\u201d<br>\r\nThere Tommy &amp; Takuya stayed chatting for a while, eating plenty of snacks, being told not to worry about their health, especially when Cherubimon changes reality. Soon dozens of orbs were brought in with completely naked boys &amp; girls (they weren\u2019t covering their bras, but they were fine &amp; so was everyone else. &amp; everyone was chatting &amp; eating. The first one to notice something strange was Takuya, it was his weight, or should I say his belly. It was noticeably more pooched out with a few rolls than before, so Takuya was noticeably fatter than before, this was probably because he has eaten so much more junkfood than he ever has in his whole life, &amp; he hasn\u2019t exercised it off.<br>\r\nThen Cherubimon came into the room &amp; clapped his giant hands to get everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cChildren, children, now that I\u2019ve introduced myself to you all, let me explain what I want from you in exchange for reality. All I want is to be remembered on your body that I was the one who brought a better livelihood to you. I want you all to gain weight for the rest of your lives, in fat.\u201d Everyone was quite confused about this statement &amp; were talking to one another about it before Cherubimon hushed them up again. \u201cNow I know what you\u2019re thinking. But I will make sure everyone loves you despite your enormous weight &amp; will take care of you in this reality, as well as all of you being able to meet each other again, &amp; you won\u2019t have to worry about your health in this reality. Now is everyone willing to accept? If you decide to back out, I will return you to the moment you got my text message &amp; you will have no memory what happens after that, but you will be able to say no. All I hope is that you will all say yes &amp; live as my child cherubs, forever.\u201d  So Takuya &amp; Tommy thought for a moment if this was a good idea. What do they say (both must either say yes or no)<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Cherubimon floated down into the core with his Dark Warriors, Ranamon, Grumblemon, Mercurymon, Arbormon, &amp; his greatest most powerful, most silent evil creation, Duskmon. They brought the drugged &amp; hypnotized chubby children to be his incarnations of power on earth. The children began their rampage on the internet &amp; prepared the brainwashing for Cherubimon. They implanted a part of their corrupt &amp; now portly fractal code &amp; DNA so that they could prepare the reformation of the human world. In a matter of weeks, the human world\u2019s city\u2019s, transportation, &amp; weaponry were coveted by Cherubimon &amp; thanks to his broadcasts towards other governments, the governments were already under his control. They soon broadcasted it to the majority of the public. The adults who were brainwashed were building buildings &amp; had cybernetic implants to help them. The children who were brainwashed were all turned into fat gods like Takuya &amp; Tommy. &amp; the seniors were put in retirement homes where their cremated ashes become fuel for the world. Everyone else who wasn\u2019t enslaved were living in prisons or in poverty thanks to the control &amp; oppression of Cherubimon &amp; his Dark Warriors.<br>\r\nAs their godly transformations are complete, Takuya &amp; Tommy subconsciously were enthralled with this power &amp; care, even if it cost them &amp; the world their freedom. They were finally turned into fat gods, earlier than anyone else I might add as they were the chosen ones to wield the Ancient Warriors.

It was almost weird seeing your little brother, who for some reason, you could tell was only 9-years-old with the body of an Adonis in his prime, in statue form, made of solid rock, being so casual &amp; gentle with his strength.

Then it showed you as a 6-year-old with a preschool Shinya carefully walking through the park holding your noise-makers for 4th of July. As each year passed on in progression, you noticed a lot of recurring themes. For example, Shinya was always shorter than he should be &amp; much more delicate as he appeared to be held onto like Tiny Tim or in a cast &amp; crutches while he had some sort of artistic project in the background. Second of all was that you were always taller than most kids your age should be, but much skinnier, without muscle or fat, just flat like a lanky basketball player, or an amateur lightweight on the wrestling team. Thirdly, you seemed to be holding in a repressed sadness that was hidden behind a hollow smile, like you were holding back some hidden desire or fetish, which you probably have been doing your whole life.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Shinya,\u201d Takuya asked (through speakers of course, always going to be through speakers from now on unless it says \u201cverbally spoken\u201d).<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Takuya.\u201d Shinya responded coming back from his walk down memory lane.<br>\r\n\u201cWas there ever some hidden desire I had since I was a kid? Were you injured often when you were a kid? &amp; how come there aren\u2019t any more photos after I turn 9-years-old?\u2019 Takuya asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWell you told me when you were little that you always wanted to be bigger, &amp; comfortable for the rest of your life. I was born like Tiny Tim with fragile bones &amp; thin muscles barely capable of surviving most injuries, so you had to dote on me constantly so I wouldn\u2019t get hurt\u201d Shinya responded with a sad look on his normally angled &amp; dimpled face, \u201cIt made you sad because neither of us could gain weight easily with you always working to take care of me, &amp; me too fragile to eat so much. You eventually found happiness at around 9-years-old when we both took off to an early puberty, &amp; the photos of those events can be seen right here.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ami shot up, \"DORUMON LOOK OUT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a very akward silence. \"Hush my child.\" a strange, cracking voice soothed the young teen, \"Niether you or your digimon are in any danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swirled around on the bed to meet the new voice, \"What the?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami, calm down.\" Aoto put his hand on her shoulder, \"We're all fine.\" he motioned to the petite, very wrinkled digimon with a calming motion, \"These nice digimon took us in after we were all ambushed by SkullMeramon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Jijimon and Babamon smiled (though Jijimon's beard covered his up) at Ami. \"We found you all passed out just outside town.\" the bearded elder digimon motioned outside the hut with his paw adorned staff, \"So we decided to bring you nice young'ns into town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha?\" Ami looked to Jounichi for an explination, who responded with an obviously fake smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoto nudged the fellow digidestined with his elbow, \"Be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" the gothic boy grunted, \"Me and Impmon were the only ones concious so we filled them in.\" he narrowed his eyes back at Aoto, \"Happy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children, such children.\" Jijimon shook his head. Ami suddenly freaked out again, \"Where's Dorumon?!\" Babamon picked up a small animal digimon, \"He's not exactly back to one hundred percent, but he'll live.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi sniffled a little, \"Dorumon...\" she whimpered. \"Ahaha... yeah, I guess I degenerated back to Dorimon, sorry Ami...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purplehaired digidestined gripped her fuzzball of a partner in a tight hug, \"AHHH!!\" he screamed, \"Lemme go lemme go!!\" Everyone cracked up at this (except the ever-stoic Jounichi) <br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n\"So, what kind of town is this?\" Ami asked, shocked at it's huge size, \"It's more like a city!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloppy Town was absolutely huge. Bigger than the digidestineds' hometown by any means. With several tall buildings and even a radio tower (Station DGMN 005) peircing the sky, the local Bird type digimon could be seen happilly perched everywhere. The local plaza was clearly visible from the hutlike structure they had all been brought to, and many in-training and fresh digimon played peacefully. And near that there was a large colleseum where the local tournaments were held between the digimon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the plaza, a mature and thriving city stood, supporting all of the Digimon who had become accustomed to the easy lifestyle. There was no loud traffic, yet there were roads (\"For the Digimon with wheels?\" Ami guessed) And even a university for the local knowledge-seeking Digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloppy Town was indeed a Digimon's ideal city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ami's stomach grumbled underneath her sweater. \"What do you say we get something to eat?\" she asked Dorimon, who she carried in her slender arms. \"I'm for it!\" the purple animal digimon agreed, \"Aoto, you up for an eating contest?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToyAgumon glared at Aoto, \"Not another one! Last time you two ate poisonous mushrooms!\" the chubby redhead glared back at his mechanical partner, \"So?\" he dragged the word out mockingly. \"'SO?!' So you two ate 50 of them! EACH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry about that, children,\" Jijimon comforted ToyAgumon, \"There aren't any poisonous mushrooms here... unless of course, you want-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoto raised his hands defensively, \"No no, I'm good without them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpmon stuck his tounge out at ToyAgumon, \"Stop worryin', we're here to relax!\" he turned to his partner, \"Right Jounichi?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of relaxing... how long can we stay here?\" Ami turned back to the shrivled old couple of digimon. \"You mean you were planning on leaving?\" Babamon and Jijimon asked in unison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... yeah!\" Ami turned her head, \"We've got to find a way back to the real world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense.\" Jijimon waved his hand dismissivley, \"You can stay here as long as you like!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ami could retort, her stomach gurgled again. \"Why don't we just get something to eat, and then we can find you a place to stay for the night?\"<br>\r\n--------<br>\r\n\"Mmmmhmmm!!\" Aoto pat his swollen belly, \"Who knew Bone Meat could taste so GOOD?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpmon picked at his teeth with a toothpick, \"Meh, I've had better, I really liked the onigiri though.\" Dorimon stuck out his tounge and gagged, \"Bleh! I hate that stuff, I'm with Aoto on the Bone Meat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi, her own stomach swollen quite a bit, gave a polite little belch, \"I've gotta say, I wouldn't mind staying if I could just get a place by that Digi-Deli Bakery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJounichi had to admit, even the GothPocky tasted better than normal. Though, coming across some Pocky (let alone good Pocky) was pretty rare in the Digital World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJijimon and Babamon greeted the digidestined and their partners with arm faces just as they had before, \"Welcome, Welcome back!\" Jijimon greeted eagerly, \"How did you enjoy your meals?\" Babamon poked Aoto's paunch, \"Quite well, it seems!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redheaded teenager blushed and turned away, embarrassed. \"It was really good Jijimon, Babamon.\" Ami smiled, \"Thank you again for recomending it, and thanks even more for paying!\" Jijimon blushed, \"Oh no problem, no problem at all, not for such young sprouts like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it here!\" Dorimon shouted, \"Can't we stay?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoto scruffled his friend's fur, \"Of course we can buddy!\" Jounichi looked up, \"Wait, we've got to get back home!\" Impmon stood by Jounichi, as always, \"Yeah! We've got a job to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoto stood opposite his gothic counterpart, \"If we're really suppossed to get home, the means will come to us, why can't we relax, just this once?!\" ToyAgumon, not wishing to split hairs, stood in the center of the arguement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um-\" Ami stuttered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's right Ami, we've got a job to do!\" Jounichi forced her to his side. Aoto grabbed the other arm, \"She didn't say that!\" Ami sighed, releaved that at least one of her friends was thinking straight, \"She thinks we should stay here and kick back, right?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two engaged in a childish tug-of-war with Ami's opinion until Ami put a stop to it. \"STOP IT!!\" she yelled, making everyone jump slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now.\" Jijimon's voice rippled anxiously, \"Why don't you take a vote to it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJounichi and Aoto's votes were set in stone. Ami thought about it for a second...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we should stay?\" Ami said nervously. \"YEAHOO!!\" Aoto, ToyAgumon, and even Dorimon jumped for joy. Even Impmon seemed happy about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJijimon and Babamon smiled at eachother, glad that they could make their day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Ami, Jounichi, and Aoto's expansive adventure began in this strange new town on the Server Continent. Filled with perks of all kinds, how can they resist indulging a little? And as we all know, indulging usually leads to weight gain...</span></div></div>",

You can even add your own storyline that has nothing to do with any of this.You can use all the enemies &amp; minor characters from the show or manga. You can add slight twists to the original plot. You can even make up your own story that has nothing to do with the manga or anime but still has to do with digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere's what I want in my interactive:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1# All chapters that aren't making important decisions have to be at least a paragraph long. So no one-liners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2# Weight gain has to come with a little bit of height gain otherwise their proportions are off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3# No slob or toilet stuff, but immobility is ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4# Keep weight gain as realistic as possible except when using magic or long time gaps (minimum 3 weeks).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5# No vore or unbirth, but inflation, stuffing, &amp; force-feeding okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n#6 Any form of sexuality is approved except transvestites &amp; only reference sex if its a sexual scene. As of 12/11/2015, SEX IS OKAY to write about, but do it when the kids have been made decently fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S. I'm mainly going to be adding to the male characters of Digimon Adventure since it's my favorite. But if you have suggestions for other chapters or want me to add to the female weight gain, be my guest. Oh, &amp; another thing, for anyone who has already added chapters, I hope to see new chapters frequently. I  mean, c'mon people, I'm sure there are digimon fans out there who want to add to my interactive. I'll even pay you 100 gift points for chapter, 200 if it's really good.</td>",
