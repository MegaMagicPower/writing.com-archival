Petters said over the squad mike. the Pelican lurched as the pilot started maneuvering to try and avoid as much fire as it could. William held onto the harness that kept him to his seat, it was there to make sure he didn't go flying if the pelican went down. A lot of good it would do as the Covies would be on them before they had a chance to do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pelican stopped moving and leveled out, there wass another lurch and the doors cracked. \"<i>Touch down!

He was almost immediately swamped with plasma fire coming from a group of grunts with a pair of hunters nearby. William ran for cover, a warthog that had been blasted onto it's side. He peeked over the top of the jeep, firing of a few rounds at the group of advancing grunts. The rest of his team had similar reaction's to his, running for what little cover was available. Not everyone was as lucky as he was though, it had only been five minutes, and they had already lost two men. William yelp, startled by a blast of plasma fire that had shot past his visor. Shaking his head and berating himself for not paying attention, he returned to the battle, blasting grunts and occasionally getting a few shots on the pair of hunters, the rest of the squad doing the same with their own assortment of weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam turned his head towards the voice, crouching behind the worthog. It was Samuel, the squad's sniper, he was behind the remains of building, the rubble making excellent cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" William yelled over the sounds of the skirmish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't get a good shot from here.\" He explained. \"I need you to give me some covering fire so I can get to that building over there.\" He continued, motioning to a four story building across the street from the worthog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it done. Wait for my signal, then run.\" William turned away from Samuel, pulling out a frag grenade. He pulled the pin and threw it into the crowd of grunts. The explosion killed the majority of the grunts and stunning the now lone hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go, go, go!\" William shouted, motioning for Samuel to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamuel nodded before darting from behind the destroyed building, moving from cover to cover while William fired at the remaining grunts and hunter, drawing their fire away from the mobile sniper. When Samuel finally made it inside of the building, William's comm crackled to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, thanks man. Now sit back and watch the fire works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of nothing but the sounds of gun fire, William heard, well, more gunfire. Five consecutive gunshots, considerably louder than the rest, five grunts dead. Five more gunshots, five more grunts dead. There weren't many left now. three grunts and the hunter. They were easily taken care of by the rest of the squad, which was now to only six men. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSgt. Peters went to each man and colected the dog tags. Jerry Fisher, Samantha Bloom, Vern Yigs and Reggie Quint. Four great men and women, that will never get to see the outcome of the war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short moment of silence, Peters stood and addressed the remaining soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We lost some excellent men today. So when you're out there, remeber your fallen comrades, and for every one of us that they take, take from them a thousand of theirs! Now let's get out their and give those alien bastards hell!\" This was met with a large cheer from the soldiers, their morale now recovered thanks to the Sargent's speech. \"All right men, on me, we're heading deeper into the city, so be on your toes. So, according to the GPS data that I received, the main Coveanent force is in the heart of the city, so We'll split into three groups of two and approach them from the north, east and west, leaving the south open for Squads Zeta and Rho. Are we clear?\" All of the soldiers nodded in response. \"OK, the teams are gonna be...\"</span></div></div>",

Simple, yet effective... also it was pretty fun to see the horrified looks on whoever was on the receiving end of a close-range shotgun blast. The marines began heading out immediately and soon came under heavy Covenant resistance. Most of their foes were lowly Grunts or Jackals, but they did have a few Elites with them, which would surely prove to be a handful. Nevertheless, Williams wasn't the type to scare easily and boldly announced his presence to the enemy by blowing away a nearby Grunt and grabbing its Needler with his free hand. One of the Elites who was armed with a Plasma Sword charged him and made a swipe at his head, only to miss at the last second. Taking advantage of his foes carelessness William pressed his Shotgun right against the Elite's head and pulled the trigger causing it to stumble backwards as William fired one more shot into its chest to make sure it was dead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point a couple of Brutes had shown up armed with Gravity Hammers and the marines would soon be in trouble if they didn't start taking out more Covenant troops. Fortunately, William was able to kill three more Grunts with his shotgun before it ran out of ammo and was also able to bring down one of the Brutes with a barrage of needles. Tossing aside the now spent Needler William grabbed his foe's fallen Gravity Hammer and charged a nearby Elite who had one of his allies pinned down along with a squad of Grunts. Right at the last second the Elite noticed the charging marine and dodged just in time for a Grunt to be knocked across the battlefield. The Elite in turn took a swing at William, only to miss by an inch, giving the brave warrior just enough time for a counter attack...</span></div></div>",

Then as if summoned by his thoughts an Elite appeared on the top of the pile of rubble and saw him. William saw his S2 a few feet away and grabbed it. without taking the time to bring it to his shoulder, he brought the barrel around and pulled the trigger. The elite's shield flared, then failed and his neck exploded in a shower of gore.

It was a good thing to as the ground where the \u201chog had been was strafed by the duel plasma launcher on one of the Banshees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI count four hostile\u2019s in the air, engaging.\u201d McKay said and William felt as well as heard the big gun the took up the entire back half of the \u2018Hog spin up and start firing. \u201cYeah! TAKE IT BITCH!\u201d William heard McKay yell as William swerved again. William looked up ahead and saw the road and surrounding building had been hit hard by artillery, most likely from the Covies\u2019 mortar tanks known as Wraiths. <br>\r\n\u201chold on, things are going to get a bit bumpy up ahead.\u201d He warned McKay. They were onto the wreckage within a few seconds and now William was not only swerving wildly to try and avoid the hail of plasma fire from above but also to try and avoid the piles of rubble and burned out wreckage that hd once been cars fighters at one point. As he did this he could feel and hear the gun fire periodically up at the Banshees.<br>\r\n As if things couldn\u2019t get any worse it seemed the Covies had been holed up in this area and now they were taking fire not only from the ground but also from the ground forces as well. Do to the gun being take up trying to keep the Banshees from getting a lock onto the \u2018Hog Jackson had to deal with the ground forces as best he could, He propped himself up in the passenger seat so he could see over the wind shield and level his assault rifle, this William only heard rather than felt as the Rifle was not as big or as powerful as the gun on the back.  William got in on the fight as well a she ran down a few of the grunts who were unlucky enough to step out in front of the \u2018Hog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with all the fire they were pouring on the area they weren\u2019t going to make it at this rate, they needed a way to either get away from the ground forces or to lose the banshees. Then William saw one that would do both or at least one, a mall with a big glass entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on!\u201d William yelled as he jerked the wheel and hit the breaks to make the sharp turn to get up on the sidewalk and then they were smashing through the glass that had somehow survived the bombardment. The roof forced the Banshees to pull up and kept the three marines out of site of them and luckily there were no Covies in the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the \u2018Hog flew past burned-out store fronts and signs of combat William began to think about where they should go, the Covies were pushing them further into the city rather than towards the base camp.. Before William could make a choice they reached another entrance to the mall and one of the Banshees flew down and hovered in the doorway turned to fire on them. \u201cJACKSON, TAKE \u2018EM OUT!\u201d William yelled and Jackson nodded, then dropped down back below the wind shield. He than grabbed the Jackhammer and got back up with it on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is where you go bye, bye.\u201d He said and pulled the trigger. The rocket streaked through the air ahead of the \u2018Hog and caught the Banshee dead center. It exploded in a mass of red and green fire and black smoke.<br>\r\n\u201cGET DOWN!\u201d William yelled they sped towards the flaming wreckage. Jackson dropped back down and McKay braced himself as the \u2018Hog hit the debris and smoke at top speed. There was a bone jarring impact as the four-ton armored recon vehicle plowed through was left of the Banshee, and then all at once they were back in daylight and there wasn\u2019t a Banshee in site. The road ahead of them lead straight into a tunnel which William didn\u2019t mid as the Banshees wouldn\u2019t be able to follow them.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Knowing where the immense firepower would best fulfill its destiny, he looked and spotted what he was looking for: A hunter. Or more accurately TWO hunters since they always traveled in pairs. Andrews flicked the safety off and activated the two times zoom. He sighted on the hunter's massive chest plate and fired. The hunter must have seen the rocket comming and tried to sidestep it, but failed. THe shaped charge detonated on the hunters shield which blew the monster into ribbons. There was a cry of anguish as the other hunter saw its bond brother go down. It immediately began charging at Andrews and smashed a marine with its massive shield in its mad charge for revenge. He let the other rocket loose but he undershot and blew a file of grunts and an elite to hell. Just as the hunter was about to crush him with its shield, Andrews flung himself sideways and drew his M6d handgun at the same time. The unexpected manuever cost the monster dearly as Andrews fired 5 shots into the exposed patches of orange skin on the hunter's backside. He shakily got to his feet and spat on the hunter's corpse...</span></div></div>",
