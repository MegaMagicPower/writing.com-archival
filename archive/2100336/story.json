He decides to go with his partner, Ruby, to investigate the problem. However, as soon as they got their and got separated, Jaune stumbles into a strange building that was not in the school maps. Unfortunately, a bright light blinds Jaune and after several seconds, he finds himself in a strange forest. The trees were massive, even though they don't have branches, big boulders, and Jaune can hear giant creatures nearby. Unfortunately, that is the least of his problem when he felt the ground shaking. The shaking got stronger an stronger, like something is coming. And before Jaune knew it, a massive object came from the sky an almost slam on top of him. Jaune looks and sees that the object was a shoe, a mountain size shoe. He gulps in fear as he looks up and see that this shoe belongs to an even bigger girl. The redheaded girl is looking around until she spots something by her feet.<br>\r\n\"Ohh, what's that?\" Nora ask herself as she bends down.

Two fingers pushed into him, one at the front and one at the back. Jaune feels them push into him as he gets lifted off of the ground. He gets taken for a ride as the girl raises him up and up. Past her legs, past her skirt, past her torso and up to her face. More specifically her eye as she sees exactly what Jaune is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune, it was absolutely terrifying to be completely powerless to this normal girl. And her eye scanning him over didn't help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith looking so close it was only normal for Nora to recognise him as more then just a small bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Your Like A Small Man!\u201d She cheered as she brought him further away from her face. Her mouth wide open in amazement. \u201cWhat Are You! You Have Got To Tell Me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing a chance to turn a poor situation to a good one he decided to explain his situation.

Attempting to pat him gently on the head, however it was more like a fatal blow to Jaune. \u201cI mean at that size, you've got to be the greatest guy in the world. Every girl would probably fall for you without you even trying\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune fought off her finger as he looked at her. \u201cWell, i don't want to be this size\u201d He said to her. \u201cMy partner Ruby would probably be around here. If you and find her she can help me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Little Guy. But I've got my own things to do\u201d She said dismissing him \u201cOh i know you can come with me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune face palmed himself. Did this girl not hear that he had a job to do. She seems to be impossible to get through to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don't have time to come with you, can you just t-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh don't be a Bossy Bradley\u201d She said as She just dismissed his wishes. \u201cYou\u2019ll love it with me, ill show you around the school and all the cooler girls around. Oh and i can even feed you some food and teach you tricks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first part sounded helpful to Jaune. The second part didn't. \u201cAnyway, I've got to move.

At first, she didn\u2019t see Jaune standing on top of it, but as the blond jumped up and down, waving his arms, this changed. Judging by Weiss\u2019 face, she was startled by Jaune\u2019s presence, but that quickly turned to disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Why do I suddenly feel like getting her attention was a bad idea?\u2019 he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEw!\u201d Weiss cried. \u201cA bug! In <i>this</i> school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss glared in disgust and disbelief before reluctantly reaching down, grabbing the cylinder by the sides and gently shaking it, hoping to get the \u2018bug\u2019 off. As she shook it, Jaune held on for dear life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on, I\u2019m not a bug!\u201d he yelled, his voice not reaching the student\u2019s ears. \u201cI\u2019m a person!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the tiny creature still holding on, Weiss began shaking the cylinder more violently. Jaune\u2019s grip finally gave out and he was flung across the hall, landing hard and painfully on the floor. From his perspective, he flew at least 40 feet, but in reality, he barely flew a couple metres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning as he looked up towards the ceiling, his body aching tremendously from being thrown like a rag doll, he saw the white-haired girl making her way over to him. As he stood up and attempted to run, he soon realised that wasn\u2019t an option as he toppled over, not having recovered from the fall yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh god, this isn\u2019t gonna end well for me, is it?\u2019 he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to be correct as Weiss literally towered over him. She was just an average girl, but to him, she was as tall as the tallest building, perhaps even taller. Then, with a satisfied smile, she raised her foot into the air. He watched with absolute horror as the bottom of her shoe descended upon him, with the girl intending to crush him and end his life completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune braced for impact...</span></div></div>",

Before Jaune could why he's still alive, the building that is Weiss's shoe is moving again...with Jaune stuck to it.

But between the gum being so sticky and each of the giant girl's footsteps feeling like a car landed on top of him, he couldn't find a proper time to make his escape. Not to mention that the nonstop movement was triggering his motion sickness. He remembered his first ride on a rollercoaster (which also happened to be his last) and realised that this was at least ten times worse than that. He was starting to believe that volunteering to investigate this case was the biggest mistake of his life, since it's what brought him to this moment. He could feel himself about to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Weiss! How's it going?\" A girl's voice called out to Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly came to a stop, Jaune finally getting a much-deserved break from the motion and having a chance to catch his breath. Of course, with the bottom of Weiss' shoe now on the floor, he couldn't see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, for the love of...\" Jaune heard Weiss mutter under her breath before she responded to the other person. \"It's going great, Yang. Thanks for asking. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's cold, even for you, Weiss!\" the girl named Yang joked with the most cheerful voice Jaune had ever heard. \"I just wanted to know if you'd like to go with-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't,\" Weiss interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on! You didn't even let me finish!\" Yang whinged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need to, I know it's something I won't be interested in,\" Weiss said. \"Now, I need to get going. I have about a minute to get to class, so I can't stand around talking to you any longer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about this? You listen to my question real quick and I'll let you go,\" Yang bargained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, there's just no winning with you sometimes...\" Weiss groaned. \"Fine, make it quick. And when I say quick, I mean <i>quick</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss subconsciously began tapping her foot on the ground, something she often found herself doing whenever she was getting impatient. For her, it was just a small, insignificant movement, one that most people wouldn't take any notice of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Jaune though, it was hell. His body was aching more and more as it was slammed into the floor repeatedly. Weiss had no idea how much she was tormenting the poor boy with just a simple movement. She had no idea that with each tap of her foot on the floor, she threatened to crush Jaune's tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I will! Jeez...\" Yang muttered before continuing. \"As I was saying, I just wanted to know if you'd like to go with me and a few friends to a dance club this Friday night? You know, take a load off, relax, enjoy ourselves, have a great time! You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was starting to see stars at this point. Luckily for him though, Weiss finally stopped tapping her foot. The heel of her shoe was still on the floor, but the front of her shoe, where Jaune was trapped in the gum, was now hovering no more than an inch above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She's... stopped...'</i> Jaune thought, struggling not to let exhaustion overcome him. <i> 'Alright, it's now or never!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune used what little strength he had left to try to pull himself free of the gum. At first, it seemed like no progress was being made until he finally felt the sticky grip on one of his arms loosen before he managed to break free from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Jaune yelled out, finally feeling a little bit of relief and hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, I would've expected you to know by now....\" Weiss began replying to Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! Come... on!\" Jaune exclaimed as he pulled his other arm free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that out of every single person you know...\" Weiss continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will... get free!\" Jaune declared as, bit by bit, he freed himself a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I would be the very last person to accept that invitation,\" Weiss finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more pull...\" Jaune said as he saw victory ahead of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune gave one final pull, he let out a fierce yell to psyche himself up, like a warrior unleashing a battle cry before delivering a powerful strike to their opponent. His hope and resolve paid off as he finally freed himself from the gum, falling to the floor. The hard landing left him short of breath, but he would much rather feel this pain and exhaustion than continue feeling that motion sickness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm not going to let you waste any more of my time,\" Weiss stated, her patience well beyond its limit. \"Goodbye, Yang.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss was about to walk away, Jaune, realising he still wasn't in the clear yet, somehow found more strength in his body. Using this last bit of strength that he couldn't believe he had, he rolled out of the way as Weiss' giant shoe slammed down on the ground right next to him. He looked up and watched as the giant white-haired girl continued walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to go home now...\" he muttered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang also watched Weiss walk away until she disappeared around a corner. She then sighed with a look of exasperation on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems like she's in an even crabbier mood than usual,\" she muttered to herself, \"and that's saying a <i>lot</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune looked up at the girl towering above him, realising that this was Yang. She had blond hair, eyes with a light purple colour and a noticeably attractive figure. If the situation were less dire, he would've allowed his eyes to wander, but right now, he had more important things on his mind. He weakly tried calling up to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... down here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strain that his body had been put through in the last few minutes had taken a big toll on him. He couldn't even raise his voice above normal speaking level, let alone shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... look down here... on the floor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better get to class before I get in trouble,\" Yang mumbled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took a step in Jaune's direction...</span></div></div>",

Her fingers grasped him and he was lifted up off the floor. He was displayed in front of the giant, curious eyes of Yang. She stared at him for what felt like an eternity before breaking the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are... are you real?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I am...\" Jaune managed to answer, barely able to raise his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... You really are a tiny person...

I need to hide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wha-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune couldn't even finish his sentence before Yang stuffed him into her shirt, wedging him between her boobs, which at his size were like large hills to him. Normally he would've been embarrassed, but due to exhaustion and the movement catching him off-guard, he didn't even have a chance to process what just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon placing the bug-boy in her shirt, Yang immediately took off, running down the halls of the school. She made several turns, each one making Jaune feel worse and worse as he struggled to contain the contents of his stomach, his motion sickness at an all-time high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, slow down...\" he futilely begged, his voice not reaching her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>--- A short while later... (Though it definitely didn't feel like a short while to Jaune...) ---</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang breathed a sigh of relief as she sat down. Currently, she was in a part of the school that usually nobody came to, at least not at this time of day. Whenever she felt like skipping a class, this was where she came. Teachers almost never checked here, and even if they did, she knew a good hiding spot to avoid them. This was her perfect place for some R&amp;R.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, now wasn't the time to sit back and relax. She reached into her shirt and pulled out the tiny Jaune, who was on the verge of passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that, little guy,\" she apologised. \"I'm supposed to be in class right now, so I couldn't afford to be seen by the teacher. Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune could only pant. This day had been so cruel to him. His body, mind and soul were reaching their limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that ride was a bit too much for you...\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was smiling, but it was mostly a guilty smile with a dash of sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you just rest for a bit, alright?\" She assured him. \"I'll talk to you when you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune continued to pant, as well as clutch his stomach, trying not to throw up. He was like this for several minutes before his stomach finally seemed to calm down and he managed to get some of his breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think... I'm good now...\" he mumbled before looking up to the giant girl, calling out to her. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello\u2026\" Yang replied awkwardly. \"So, uh, what exactly are you? You look like a human and you can even speak, but you're bug-sized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I am human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But that's impossible! No human is that small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't born like this. I was shrunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrunk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

Getting around the school is almost impossible for me. It takes me so long to travel across one hallway, not to mention that it's dangerous. I already got stomped on and only survived because of luck. I don't want to take that chance again. Next time, I might end up actually being crushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want my help?\" Yang asked before putting her hand on her chin in thought. \"Hmm\u2026 Should I, though? It sounds like a lotta work\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! I can't continue the investigation on my own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, little buddy, I was just joking!\" Yang assured with a chuckle. \"Of course I'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?

However, his laughing stopped as he remembered he wasn\u2019t in the clear yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally regaining his stamina, he stood up, dusting his clothes off before taking in his surroundings. He was in a hallway, a short distance for the giant students, but a long distance for him. With few other choices, he began the long trek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Great, where do I even begin?\u2019 Jaune asked himself. \u2018Finding Weiss again would be a very bad idea. It\u2019s clear that she would stomp on me before I even had the chance to show her I\u2019m a person and not a bug. As if that weren\u2019t bad enough, I have no idea where I am, and Ruby could be anywhere in the school.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted as he came across a door.

His giant partner towering over him as it was made very clear that there was no way he was going to be heard or seen by her. Ruby headed towards the door and although he doubted it, he had to at least have to try \u201cRuby! Come on you have to look down!\u201d The blonde boy said out loud, wanting her too look down. She didn't though as she just kept looking forward and kept walking. Her foot slamming down in front of him as he was forced to once again jump out of the way. Her giant boot slamming next to him as she lifts it up. Her powerful step leaving him as Jaune watches her leave the classroom and leave his sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one girl he knows he can trust, is too big to even see him. Actually no the problem as not that she was big, the problem was that he was so small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat can i even do at this size?\u201d He said to himself. The answer was given as he heard a loud sound. The loud sound of paper turning. He turns around and see the girl Ruby was just questioning. Blake! She had her legs crossed, reading a book at the desk as this was his chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike all the other girls who he has tried to get the attention of. She was sitting down right now. this was his chance, maybe his only chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs over the giant classroom. Keep running and keep running until he reached the other side. Right at her foot as he looks at her. She was wearing nylons and while Jaune was not the biggest fan of the, he was beyond happy to see them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe runs over and go to the stationary girl. She was not moving right now, as it was like he was about to climb a statue. He moves  and jumps onto her shoe, climbing to the top of it as he stood up on top Heading over and walking around the rim of the shoe. He jumps onto the nylon and looks up. He couldn't see anything but her leg right now, but he knew what was on the other side. Moving his arms and feet, he started climbing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe can only pray that she does not move, as that would be the end of him right now. As he keeps climbing up, he found that he's speed was not desirable. He was really slow, but that was not because a lack of effort but it was because of his size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally reached halfway, he was already tired. Beyond tired at that point. He didn't let that stop him though as he planned to reach at the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Blake, she was completely unaware of the small boy that was climbing her leg. She knew about the disappearances, but she is too smart to get mixed up in that business. Don't go looking for trouble and she won\u2019t find it. It\u2019s not that she doesn't care, it\u2019s just that she was too smart to get involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich if Jaune had the same brains, he wouldn't be doing this. The boy finally reached the top of her knee as he rests there. Falling down and laying on his back as he looked up at her. Just like the rest of the girls he has met, she was beautiful. Stoic yes, but that only adds to her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune took this time to look at her, only to also bring his breath back. When he finally did, he got up and started the climb again. Walking across her long leg as he looks up at her. She was reading her book, and seemed perfectly okay to keep reading it. This girl was perfect to climb. He could only think how dangerous this job would be if he chose to do it on Ruby. As much as he loves his partner, Jaune would be the first one to admit that she was beyond hyper and that is dangerous. He keeps moving and thinking about Ruby, thinking about what she would be doing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Somewhere Else-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune! Jaune! Jaune where are you!\u201d Ruby said walking around and shouting. \u201cWhere did he go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking for your boyfriend?\u201d A voice said as Ruby turned around. Seeing a girl in front of her. The girl had long unruly blonde hair, a boy that was beyond curvy and a kind smile on her face. Her clothes having the first two buttons undone letting the world see her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby blushed \u201cNo he\u2019s not my boyfriend! He\u2019s my... partner\u201d She then got ready \u201cMy name is Ruby Rose, and me and my partner Jaune Arc are investigating the disappearances of this school\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d Yang said as she then moved her hand to her chest \u201cYang Xiao Long. Nice to meet ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby instantly liked this girl, not only because of her kind and cheerful nature, but because she seemed okay with sharing \u201cWell Yang, can you tell me what you know about this place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot much honestly. It only happens to boys. There was one time where i flirted with a boy, only to have him gone the next day. Got to admit it was bad\u201d Yang said \u201cWell what do you know about this yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... know that\u201d She said as she started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, your not good at this are you Ruby?\u201d Yang said with a big laugh and a big smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! I\u2019m one of the best detectives there. I drink milk\u201d She said proudly only getting her to laugh \u201cAnd... well it is normally Jaune who finds the clues. We work well off each other, i don't know where he is though\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby, your not really good at this\u201d Yang said raising her eyebrow \u201cBoys disappear, your partner disappears, connected?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Jaune\u201d Ruby said with eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Somewhere-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing back to Jaune and the climb, he was now _____________</span></div></div>",

This was without a doubt the most physically taxing day he had ever had. All he had done all day was run and climb, barely getting a chance to stop and take a breather. So naturally, he relished every moment of this break. He looked down at the book that Blake was reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ninjas of Love?' he noticed. 'She doesn't look like the kinda girl to be into that stuff... Though I'm not judging, she's allowed to have her own taste...

I have more important things going on right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave himself a quick slap on the face, returning his mind to reality. He looked up at the giant Blake's head. Just her head alone was like a building compared to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, how do I go about this? ...I guess I'll just yell and hope that she hears me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then started to yell as loud as he possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!

To Jaune though, it shattered him hearing this. She doesn\u2019t even see him as human! Not even at this close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis girl seems smart and aware, and he was as close to her face as one could reasonably get. Yet he is mistaken for a bug. This hurt the detective so much, but it was not over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll handle it.\u201d She said simply. Blake moving her finger around and going into a point situation. He saw this, and knew he wanted to get away! Her finger will literally end him!.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe dodged out of the way, as the giant pillar of flesh came down and hit right near him. A powerful hit that he just narrowly dodged. He could see every detail, every crevice of this finger as it worried him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she started to twist her finger around, making sure the bug was dead it frightened him even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Jaune was an intelligent boy. He knew he would have to keep his head down and stay still for a while. If she sees him moving, she will come for another press and he is that confident he could not handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she lifted her finger again, Jaune was looking right at her eye. He spotted her, but the question is if Blake spotted Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her finger and inspected it. Seeing there was no remains. Curious, the girl leaned in to her shoulder. Bringing her eye closer as he ducked down even more. Knowing that this was the moment of truth. Her cat like eyes looking down at him, and if they were truly cat like no doubt spotting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought her face close and should of seen the bug, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Beep*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer phone got a message. A loud one that got Blake to pause, and mover her head away. Jaune was thankful to this. As it was the only lucky thing that has happened in this very unlucky situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached and grabbed her phone, looking into the message. \u201cIlia wants to meet up. Sure.\u201d She said simply as she put the phone away and packed up the book. He could not be happier right now, correction actually. If she saw him, then Jaune would be happier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt the whole body shift around, moving as she got up from her seat. Jaune panicked as he surely was not expecting this. Sliding across her school uniform for a while, until he managed to catch himself at the edge. Seeing the giant body as he would get one hell of a fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up, packed up her situation. She got moving, leaving in fact as she walked more and more. Out of the room as this was like a nightmare to Jaune. The slightest movement from Blake was enough to make Jaune scream. He needs to hold on, for his sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny shady characters?\u201d Ruby questioned, as right now Yang and her were sitting on a bench. Ruby with a notebook writing down what she can. Yang has been great! More then happy to answer her questions. Yang was just lying back, drinking a can of soda and answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm... a couple i\u2019d say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Ruby said putting her pencil to ad. \u201cWho are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell there is this girl, Cinder. She goes to this school and I would say is trouble.\u201d Yang added. \u201cManipulative, mean, rude, a real trouble. I think she is evil, not gonna lie. She has two cronies, Neo and Emerald. Emerald isn\u2019t that bad, but Neo. Oh man i do not like that mute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCinder, Neo, Emerald.\u201d She said back, writing it down. \u201cAnyway one else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHm... well about a week ago, i saw a weird woman around the walls of the school. Pure white hair, a black outfit. Don\u2019t know who she was, but she looked like trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeird, white woman.\u201d Ruby said writing that one down too<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake walked out of the door, spinning as she went down the hallway. Jaune screaming and trying not to fall. He felt so unsafe, so he should not know if he was happy or sad, and after what she said sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBug\u2019s still alive.\u201d She said as Jaune looked her way, seeing that she spotted him on the edge of her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sick of you already.\u201d She said not very happy, as she brought her finger to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune acted quickly. doing whatever he had to avoid her finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let go. Dropping down fast past her body seeing he was flailing. If he did not grab something, he would literally die right there. The floor was not safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to see what he can do, and eventually found something. As he flew down and landed right onto her shoelace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou might think a shoelace would kill Jaune instantly, but it did not. As the shoe lace went down with the hit, therefore absorbing most of the blow. The shoelace was also soft, so while it hurt him a lot, it was not deadly. Another miracle has happened with this girl. He could not help but smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGot it.\u201d She said simply, moving around and leaving. Since he did not have a good grip, he could do nothing as he fell down. Right down onto the ground as he hit hard. Rolling over as he watched her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks away, her towering frame going away. That clearly could have gone better, but at least Jaune is alive.<br>\r\n\u2028Too tired and hurt to move, he lets himself rest. Going down and relaxing as he almost drifted off to sleep. He needed this rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Boom!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever there was no rest for the weary, getting up quick he heard the booms becoming louder and louder. Heavy steps as he knew he was gonna have to try with this one as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore steps, until finally ___________ Rounded the corner</span></div></div>",

A blonde with her top buttons undone, leaving little to the imagination. This caused him to blush intensely. Jaune had never been good with girls and the more attractive they were, the worse he was when speaking to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now wasn't the time for him to be intimidated by her beauty and the size of her... assets... He had a job to do, not to mention his safety was on the line. Gawking at the scenery could wait until later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to get their attention. Despite knowing the odds of it working were close to zero, as usual, he began jumping up and down, yelling out to the two of them to look down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the two girls neither saw nor heard Jaune. They continued walking, as the blonde girl was recalling the last time she had spoken to one of the disappearing students. Jaune looked on in horror as her shoe lifted up before descending towards him. For what felt like the millionth time, he jumped out of the way, narrowly avoiding being crushed. The shoe landed where he had been standing a split second ago with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stood up, once again relieved that he didn't end up underneath somebody's shoe. He looked up to see that the two girls had stopped walking and were now standing above him, talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He told me that dinner was on him this Friday night, then left towards the library,\" the blonde girl explained, a somewhat sad look on her face. \"That was the last I saw of him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Ruby said, jotting this down in her notebook. \"And you're sure that you didn't see him again after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, positive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby put her notebook away, her eyes happened to wander to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune realised it was now or never. He then began his usual routine: jumping up and down while yelling up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his joy and relief, Ruby seemed to notice his movements. She bent down to take a closer look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Yes, this is it!'</i> Jaune thought excitedly. <i>'She'll finally see me! I'll be saved!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, strange,\" Ruby said. \"This bug looks a bit... unusual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde girl looked down and saw a small speck on the floor, which she assumed was the \"bug\" that Ruby was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, who cares?\" She asked. \"It's just a bug.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Oh no...'</i> Jaune thought, as he instantly realised where this was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was proven right when the blonde girl lifted her shoe above him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAIT, PLEASE! STOP!\" he yelled up to the two girls, desperately trying to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the shoe descended towards Jaune...</span></div></div>",

I'm still alive, so everything's okay! Anyways, nice to meet you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang faintly smiled, happy that Jaune found it in himself to forgive her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, too,\" she replied. \"And I'm glad you're okay, but still, I promise I'll find a way to make it up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll hold you to that promise,\" Jaune joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'At least things are going a bit more smoothly now,'</i> she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, back to business,\" Ruby said as she held Jaune back in front of her own face. \"Tell me everything that you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was surprised at how mature ruby was acting, though this was definitely a pleasant surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrunken boy then told his giant partner everything he remembered, from waking up shrunken, to the ordeals he's had to go through, to finally reuniting with her. In exchange, Ruby told Jaune everything that she'd managed to gather, from the disappearing students being boys, to the mysterious woman that Yang had seen roaming the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think maybe that woman has something to do with the disappearances?\" Jaune inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She could have,\" Yang said. \"But I think Cinder, Emerald and Neo are definitely up to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that just leaves us with one question...\" Ruby realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we go first?\"</span></div></div>",

So maybe it was this fear that gave jaune the little burst of speed he need, running and dodging the giant shoe slamming down. As it touched the ground, Jaune could feel the powerful wave send him back a bit. Even though it didn\u2019t touch him, it had a large effect. Slowly looking up, he could see the beautiful smirking blonde. Moving some hair out of her face as she gazed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, the bug\u2019s still alive.\u201d She said with a smirk. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, stop playing with the bug.\u201d Ruby said with a chuckle, finding this pretty funny. While Jaune had a name for the girl. Yang. Once he gets big he\u2019s gonna remember that name. For one reason or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you kidding me! Look at him standing there, he\u2019s challenging me Ruby. I got to finish this.\u201d And with that, she stopped her foot down again. Jaune wasted not time running. Since he knows he can outrun it, he admittedly got more confident. Dodging the steps every time they came down. Yang mixed it up, trying to get him with the other shoe but it didn\u2019t work. He kept right under her, knowing that if he makes it an awkward step she would have trouble. No plan to get away, but he can\u2019t focus on what he can\u2019t do right now. He needs to focus on what he can. He was about to run direction,  but suddenly Yang\u2019s shoe blocked his way. Like a building with no door that wasn\u2019t going to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye bug.\u201d Yang said with a smile as she raised her foot lowering it down. She stopped down, knowing she got the bug this time. Even twisting her foot around. Only for the bug to run out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s still alive!\u201d Ruby said pointing, hurting Jaune\u2019s ears. \u201cThat\u2019s one tough bug.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. almost don\u2019t want to kill anymore.\u201d Yang said with a smirk as he turned, she was not stepping on him more. She wasn\u2019t even trying. Does that mean this nightmare was over. \u201cMight keep him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a bug collection?\u201d Ruby questioned as Yang just laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, i mean let him stay on my body for his sort life. You ever felt a bug crawl over your body Ruby? Feels amazing.\u201d Yang said as this girl was a bit of a freak. She\u2019s talking about it so casually though, and openly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... can\u2019t say I have Yang.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell let\u2019s see how you like it. Come here bug, there\u2019s a girl that wants you!\u201d She said, getting down onto her knee and reaching for Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might be the first time Jaune has accepted a giant hand, cause this means he will get up there, close to the girls and on Ruby. They have to see him at that point! Jaune even started running towards Yang, excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh he wants to get up!\u201d Yang said stopping. \u201cI think the bug might have a crush on me.\u201d Yang said with a laugh. \u201cOr maybe he just wants to be on your body so much Ruby, he can\u2019t hold himself back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Ruby couldn\u2019t help but blush a bit. Yang brought her hand down and went to pick up the bug. Her fingers practically touching Jaune when suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what are you two doing!\u201d A voice said, as Yang got up, Jaune crying for her. She stood up though, and Jaune was lost on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh... hey Goodwitch!\u201d Yang said with a bit of a panic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is headmaster to you young lady!\u201d She said walking up, Ruby being told about this woman. Her and Jaune looked at her file. She was the headmaster of this school or otherwise known as the principal. And the aura of authority she carried sealed this. \u201cWhat are you doing out your class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018You know, just having fun with Ruby here. Showing her around answering questions, it\u2019s all fine.\u201d Yang said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh hi...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will get to you in a minute.\u201d She said shifting her eyes for a second, getting Ruby to be quiet. \u201cWould your mother like it if you were suddenly cutting classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPff, like she would even care.\u201d Yang said back at the corner of her mouth. Goodwitch was aware of her neglectful mother, but still she felt that was no reason to act out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust get to class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, see you around Ruby.\u201d Yang said as she tok a step over the bug, her eye still on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune watched the blonde leave, and was looking at the most beautiful woman yet. not girl, but woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss Rose, while I let you and your partner investigate this school, I did not give you permission to disrupt my students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d She said back meekly, as she then suddenly frowned even more. \u201cActually, my partner has disappeared as well, so this kind of got more personal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell i certainly hope you find them. I do care for the boys safety, but I also fear the worst.\u201d Goodwitch said, as she shifted her gaze down. Jaune could swear her eyes landed right down onto Jaune. However she did not say anything about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm... actually there is something I should ask you about. Yang spoke about a woman, with white skin and a black outfit around the outskirts of the school sometimes. Do you know anything about that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d Goodwitch said. \u201cIf i did, i promise you I would stop it within a second. The safety of my students are my top priority.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUnderstood... well guess I better go and look more. Thanks for the talk! Ruby said running away, leaving him by himself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell not fully by himself as it seems, cause there is a giant sexy woman by him. She stood there for a while, watching Ruby leave. Almost like she was waiting to be alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally closed her eye, before she said \u201c_______________\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jaune came to a decision. Waiting in Ruby's pocket wouldn't yield any results and even if he climbed over to her other pocket, her scroll would probably be too big for him to do anything with it. His only hope was to climb up to her ear and yell into it. Surely, she would hear him then... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began his climb, making his way up the inside of the pocket. As he finally exited through the opening, he looked up, immediately realising this would be quite the task. Ruby wasn't a tall girl at all, but from Jaune's perspective, she was the size of a building, maybe even a mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Aw man, maybe this was a bad idea...'</i> Jaune thought. <i>'Maybe I should just go back in her pocket and wait after all.'</i> He then shook his head. <i>'No, that won't work. I need to get her attention as soon as possible.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Jaune continued climbing. He left Ruby's skirt behind and made his way up her stomach. He heard a loud grumbling noise and felt a large vibration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I really need some food right now...\" Ruby complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Now that she mentions it, I could go for some grub too...'</i> Jaune thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he stayed focused on his current goal. He continued up to Ruby's chest, keeping a tight grip to her breasts as he climbed, his fear of falling growing more and more as he climbed higher. Ruby's breasts were usually pretty average. Not too small, but nothing special either. However, at Jaune's current size, they were definitely huge to him; big enough to provide him with a decent foothold as soon as he got on top of them, allowing him to feel slightly more relaxed and less anxious about falling. However, this was also where he realised his situation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm literally climbing on Ruby's boobs right now...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune began blushing intensely. This situation was definitely an embarrassing one for him, that's for sure. However, he quickly shook those thoughts out of his head, reminding himself that he was only doing this out of necessity. He continued climbing and finally reached Ruby's collarbone, a much less embarrassing part of her body for him to be climbing. He then diverted his course sideways, making his way to her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune sat down and sighed with relief as he finally reached his destination. He needed a breather and he definitely earned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I'm safe... for now...'</i> he thought. <i>'Now, to do what I climbed all the way up here to do...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune stood up and got as close as he could to Ruby's ear before yelling towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY! RUBY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stopped as she heard the sound of her blond partner yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Jaune?\" she said, looking around. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH! DOWN HERE!\" Jaune replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Down where?\" Ruby asked, continuing to look around in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOWN HERE! ON YOUR SHOULDER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised a brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shoulder?\" she asked before looking down at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, Ruby's brain didn't fully register Jaune's tiny presence. However, after staring at him for a while, her eyes widened in shock. She quickly reached up and grabbed him between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, be careful!\" Jaune exclaimed, surprised by the sudden motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby held her tiny partner in front of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jaune?\" she stammered, not quite believing that what she was seeing was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me...\" Jaune said nervously, waiting to see what would happen next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it really you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god...\"</span></div></div>",

Even if she couldn\u2019t help him get back to his normal size, he could at least rely on her to keep him safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jaune wandered around, he made sure to look out for even the slightest sign of danger. At his size, nearly everything was a hazard, a threat to his very life. If he encountered an actual bug, it could kill him. If anyone was walking by and didn\u2019t see him, they could accidentally step on him. Even if they <i>did</i> see him, they would likely mistake <i>him</i> for a bug. And not everyone likes bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was walking, he felt a tremor. It was small but noticeable. However the next one was bigger. And the next one was bigger yet. As each tremor became bigger and bigger, Jaune soon found that one of his fears wasn\u2019t far off. He gazed ahead and saw two giant shoes walking towards him. When he looked up, part of him was happy with what he saw, but most of him was terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his partner, Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!\u201d Jaune called out, his hands cupped over his mouth as a makeshift megaphone. \u201cRUBY! DOWN HERE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she took no notice as she continued walking, her giant shoes getting dangerously close now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRUBY! LOOK AT THE GROUND! IT\u2019S ME, JAUNE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Ruby\u2019s ears failed to pick up the tiny voice of the tiny Jaune. Her footsteps became louder as she approached. Jaune looked up in horror as Ruby moved her foot forward to take another step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This is it...\u2019 Jaune thought sadly. \u2018This is how I die...\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune reflected on his short life as he prepared to face death via the bottom of his partner\u2019s shoe. The same death many bugs face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it seemed fate decided to spare him for now. Rather than landing directly on top of Jaune and crushing him like he was expecting, Ruby\u2019s huge shoe crashed down a short distance in front of him, missing him. He then let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding as he looked up, seeing his friend, looming above him like a skyscraper. No, even taller than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Hmm, Jaune said he\u2019d meet me here about twenty minutes ago. Where is he?\u2019 Ruby wondered. \u2018Even he\u2019s not usually <i>this</i> late.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girl looked around, Jaune straightened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Nows my chance!\u2019 he thought with a slight amount of hope. He once again cupped his hands over his mouth and screamed at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cRUBY!\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he seemed to be successful. Ruby perked up and her silver eyes scanned the area. However, she didn\u2019t see anything, which was only natural, since the blond was a speck on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, weird.\u201d Ruby said aloud to herself. \u201cI could\u2019ve sworn I heard Jaune\u2019s voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune repeated the process, shouting as loud as he possibly could in a desperate attempt to get his dark-haired partner to notice him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\u201cYOU DID! I\u2019M DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND!\u201d</font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Ruby uttered, confused. \u201cThe ground?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune felt an immeasurable amount of relief when Ruby looked down at the ground where he was standing. That is, until a thought crossed his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What if she doesn\u2019t see me?\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby conintued to look at his spot, he waited for the moment of truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that...</span></div></div>",

I bet they have good food, maybe pancakes.\" Nora says in a peppy tone as she storm off ahead of Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora wait.\" Jaune shouts as he tries to catch up with the peppy red head. The two were way off of where they supposed to go as Nora stumbles in a science room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wonder what sorts of stuff are being made here.\" Nora says as she fiddles around with a bunch of stuff that she really isn't supposed to. She find a some ordinary lab equipment, some projects like a potato attach to a battery. But what caught her eye the most was a strange little remote that fits in the palm of her hand. She mess with a dial until a small beam zaps the potato project until it disappers. \"*gasp* This thing can make things invisble.\" Nora saya with glee. Unfortantly, Nora was dead wrong about the device. If she look closely, she would have notice that the potato project didn't exactly disappered, but instead shrunk to a very small size.She was ready to try something else when she hears her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nora, where are you? We need to talk to the principle of the school first before going around the school.\" Jaune's voice could be heard nearby. Nora looks at the small device in her hand and another gleeful smile form as she has a idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding behind a desk, she waits for Jaune to enter the room before zapping him with the remote she thinks makes thing invisble, how very wrong she is of what the remote is truely capable of. Jaune is about to enter the door and Nora sets the device....</span></div></div>",

He opens his eyes and is greeted by a vast empty landscape with nothing for miles. All he sees is strange round mountains in the distant.

Unsure of what happened, whether she shrank or this giant girl just suddenly appeared, (It was the first one. Duh.) Ruby Rose began sneaking away, taking in glances at the panty-shot while she got away.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, Ruby wasn't the only one who had something interesting to look at. The giant red-head had been looking for bugs all day, finding everything from ants, to bees, even a new four limbed bug she had never seen before, and then crushing them. It was her favourite pass time while she waited for her stoic handsome friend to finish brushing his hair.<br>\r\nRuby thought she was about to get away, before a giant sneaker crashed infront of her. Looking back up, she saw it's owner eyeing her up, smiling with glee and excitement.<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy! A new tiny bug to play with!' The cheerful voice boomed in Ruby's ears, making her recoil. \"And it looks so cool! It has a cape, a funny head, everything a girl could ask for!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-oh,\" was all Ruby could muster, \"Um, I'm gonna start running.\"<br>\r\nStarting into a full blown sprint, Ruby ran around the boot obstruction in her way, making her way to what looked like a giant log. But Nora was hot on her tail, fee-fi-fo-fumming towards the tiny bug girl. Lifting her foot up high, the red-head crashed it down at her, Ruby managing to barely dodge it. Another later stomp also missed her body, but pinned her cape in place. Ruby tried to pull her cape free, yanking as hard as she could. Nora simply watched, giggling to herself, before knocking her down. As her soon-to-be executioner raised her foot, Ruby could see the stains of all the other bugs Nora had crushed, but she could have  sworn she saw a tiny tie dangling down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes in anticipation for the sudden demise, Ruby listened to the whooshing sound of the plummeting foot, and felt the ground shake below her as it finally made impact. But surprisingly, she was still alive. Opening her eyes, she noticed that she was in the crevice of the sneaker sole, staying safe in the empty space.<br>\r\nThe giant red-head rose her foot back up to see her latest victim, before standing stunned that, not only had it survived, but was now making a break for it. Before she could respond accordingly, Ruby made it to the worn out log and hid in safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief, and looking back out to the giant girl, Ruby began laughing in hysterics. \"Wow, I almost died! Ha ha! M-my life was almost snuffed out, by a... ha ha, a shoe! And I escaped! I escaped death! Death can go straight to heck!\"<br>\r\nHer victory, however, was interrupted when she felt a presence near. Looking back around, tears still in her eyes, she saw a...</span></div></div>",

The shoe alone was like a building compared to Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl above her had a mischievous grin on her face as her eyes scanned the ground, as if she were looking for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby wondered what the giant girl would be looking for, but that question left her head as she saw movement. An ant had come running out of a hole in the ground and was now wandering around with seemingly no objective. Currently, Ruby was about the same size as the ant, maybe slightly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I should probably stay away from it...'</i> Ruby decided. <i>I just hope it doesn't have a grudge against me for any of the times I might've accidentally squished its friends...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, while Ruby wanted to stay far away from it, the girl above had other ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found one!\" She exclaimed gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly raised her shoe above the ant and just as quickly brought it down on the poor critter, crushing it instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, gotcha!\" The giant girl boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and saw another ant nearby. She giggled playfully before lifting her other shoe up and stomping on that one too.

However, the fear inside our tiny protagonist grew even worse when the giant girl's eyes locked onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you?\" The girl asked. \"You think you can take on the mighty Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby didn't wait around any longer. She took off, running as fast as her now tiny legs could carry her. She could hear the giant footsteps following her as the girl, who Ruby now knew was named Nora, was undoubtedly chasing her. A giant shoe landed right next to Ruby, almost causing her to fall over, but she managed to keep her balance and continue running. She saw a hole in the trunk of a tree.

She had ten minutes to come up with something. She had a few ideas. She could continue moving around on the ground in the hopes that Weiss would notice her movement and take a closer look. She could look around for something to use to get Weiss' attention, perhaps something to wave around. Or... an idea that Ruby wasn't exactly fond of... She could climb up Weiss' body to her shoulder and yell into her ear. Surely she'd be able to hear Ruby's tiny voice then and notice her... right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, Ruby decided to...</span></div></div>",

She couldn't afford to waste time finding something to help her and climbing Weiss' body would be too dangerous... not to mention embarrassing... Ruby ran right towards Weiss and stood in front of her shoe, jumping repeatedly, waving her arms and shouting up to her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY WEISS! DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND! LOOK DOWN HERE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurely, Weiss would have to look down eventually, then she would see Ruby and save her... right? Ruby began to wonder if this was indeed what would happen if she continued, but pushed that thought out of her head. She didn't have time to stop and think about whether or not this would work. All she could do was hope for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hope seemed to pull through as she noticed Weiss' blue eyes trail down to the ground. Ruby began making even more dramatic motions than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Come on, Weiss!'</i> Ruby begged. <i>'Surely you can't possibly miss this!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was definitely correct. Weiss didn't miss her motions. Her eyes narrowed on the tiny, moving speck on the ground right in front of her foot. Ruby could tell by the giant heiress' expression that she could see her. However, she didn't realise that this wasn't exactly a good thing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh gross, a bug!\" Weiss exclaimed, raising her foot above the speck on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Weiss! No, I'm not a- AAAHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby attempted to call to her partner, only to scream as Weiss' shoe smashed the ground near her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, you disgusting little pest!\" Weiss ordered the \"bug\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she didn't expect it to understand her and leave her alone, but one can dream, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was about to try yelling up to her partner again, but was forced to dodge another incoming shoe, the shockwave sending her flying. She landed on the ground painfully, but shook off the pain as she got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'It's no use, I can't get through to her!'</i> Ruby realised. <i>'For now, I'll just have to run!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby began sprinting away from Weiss as fast as she could. At first, the giant heiress continued stomping, attempting to crush the \"bug\" under her shoe, but as she saw that it was finally running away, she stopped, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, you'd better run,\" Weiss muttered before sighing. \"And of course, Ruby's <i>still</i> not back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby continued running until she was certain she was too far away for Weiss to spot her. She didn't know what she felt more of; exhaustion or despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Weiss didn't recognise me...'</i> Ruby thought sadly. <i>'My own partner... She mistook me for a bug and... Tried to squish me under her foot...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all so crazy. She'd spent a long time waiting for a special mission, and now that she'd finally gotten one, she was shrunken down to the size of a bug and almost crushed underfoot by her own partner. This was too crazy for her. Too surreal. She was tempted to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'...No, snap out of it, Ruby!'</i> the tiny detective thought, determination visible in her eyes. <i>'You wanted a special mission, something new and bizarre, now you've got it! The least you can do is see it through to the end or die trying!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped herself in the face a couple of times, psyching herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'I CAN DO THIS! THIS IS WHERE I EITHER LIVE A HERO OR DIE A HERO! ...Hopefully live, I don't wanna die... BUT EITHER WAY, I WILL BE A HERO!'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, Ruby began her journey. She decided on her next course of action...</span></div></div>",
