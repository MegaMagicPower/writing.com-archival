Toddling around in his cute little diaper or pull-ups, which he switched between. Sometimes Sarafina would be his babysitter, but Nala would still help out. Simba honestly thought of them as family to him, since the both let him breastfeed from them. They even baby him when he's at their place. And he loves the treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here's a question, are his parents, Sarabi and Mufasa the loving parents we all know, and approve of Sarafina and Nala's care they give Simab, and would be close friends with Sarafina and Nala, should Simba end up in Sarafina or Nala's tummy? Or are the a bit neglectful of Simba, that he is usually happy when his parents take him to see Nala and Sarafina, so he gets away from their neglectful nature? Perhaps Simba has come to live with Nala and Sarafina, and will eventually end up in one of their wombs.</span></div></div>",

Mufasa and Sarabi had been sentenced to banishment from Pride Town and all the surrounding towns and cities within the state. Taka, whom most knew as Scar had long since passed away, so Simba had no other living relatives to look after him after his parents lost custody of him. And Sarafina had signed the papers to become his legal guardian. She promised to love and care for him as much as possible. As did Nala. After acquiring Simba's personal belongings, the city had the house demolished and become a yard extension of Sarafina's place, having lived right next door to Sarabi and Mufasa. As the city started the construction to turn it into Sarafina's yard extension, Sarafina carried Simba into her house. He had fallen asleep on her shoulder, and was cutely sucking away on his thumb. She had already prepared a room for Simba, and had it designed so that he could gain access to her's and Nala's rooms, but also so it could be his personal nursery, being babied up and all, but allowing him some of a typical 4 year old's assortments of toys and such. She even had a TV and movies for his age group in the room, but she also had it so that, when he wanted to be babied, Sarafina was able to baby him. Diapers, a crib, bottles for when he wanted her and/or Nala's milk in the bottle, a chair to sit in to breastfeed Simba. pacifiers styled for boys, the works. And in their town they encouraged toddlers to stay baby like and hold on to their childhood, so most still wore diapers, even if they were potty training. But for Simba, pull ups and diapers were required, due to his undernourishment, his bladder had been underdeveloped, so, he wet himself more often then not, and didn't realize it. But none of the friends he had at preschool gave him a hard time about it. In fact, they made sure they used their padding to make him feel better. And the other parents approved, knowing it wasn't because their little ones were rebels, but because they were trying to help a friend. And Simba was thankful for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sarafina entered Simba's room, he woke up. \"Hey there sleepy head, how are you feeling?\" Sarafina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I otay. Um Sawafina. Is it otay if I call you Mama now?\" Simba asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sweetie, and you can call Nala sis if you wish. We are you family now, after all,\" Sarafina said before kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe giggled and replied, \"Thank you Mama.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they both heard Simab's tummy growl and he blushed. \"I see a little cub needs his breakfast. Do want Mama to.......\"</span></div></div>",
