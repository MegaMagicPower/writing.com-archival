All that you know is that it was absolutely huge.  It was holding something in its paw, or was it a scaly claw?  Was it holding your house, a city, the whole planet?!  The oddest thing, though, was that you were not scared at all.  Though you were a speck, a speck of a speck, to this huge anthro, you knew that he or she would not hurt anyone, and would always be there for you.  The next part of the dream is fuzzy right before you wake up, but it has something to do with how many mega-anthros and tiny humans were in your dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You begin to stir from this strange dream to find yourself in the midst of a great landscape of rolling off-white hills and valleys, wearing nought but your nightie. The ground beneath you is wonderfully soft and slightly warm in contrast to the distinct chill rolling across this landscape, which upon closer inspection appears to have a series of faint lines criss-crossing it. Just then you hear distant but powerful foot-falls, gradually getting more and more powerful, signifying the approach of something really huge. When you find that those footsteps are beginning to resonate through the ground beneath your bare feet you suddenly realise that this landscape is actually an enormous pillow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStraining your eyes you see that everything around you is like a vastly overgrown version of your bedroom. The curtains, the wardrobe, everything was familiar but immense. You jump to the conclusion that you've somehow been shrunk and those foot-falls belong to someone in your family. Before long you hear a mighty, booming and yet proportionately quiet voice calling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you up yet?\" It was your mother. You become rather frantic over the possibility that she wouldn't be able to hear you or see you and thus you'd be thrust into an adventure in your own home to successfully alert at least one family member to your presence and condition before you get killed or, alternatively, she manages to spot you but becomes so overwhelmed that she could well faint or panic and carry out actions blindly, which would increase your risk level. At any rate you decide to give it a try when she calls out in a voice more fitting to the situation. \"YOUNG LADY, ARE YOU AWAKE?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM MOM!\" You shout. \"BUT I SEEM TO BE IN AN UNBELIEVABLE PREDICAMENT! PLEASE, COME IN!\"</span></div></div>",

You couldn't help but gape; not only was she incomprehensibly huge but she was an anthropomorphic rabbit. The look on her face made you quiver as she frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever do you mean?\" She spoke firmly, but her voice didn't roar or boom like you'd expect. \"What could...?\" She stopped and her frown became a similar expression of amazement to the one you were likely to be exhibiting. She took a couple of steps closer, allowing you to observe her more thoroughly. She was barefoot, but otherwise she had on a green skirt that hung about halfway down her calves and a blouse that wasn't quite light enough to be sky-blue but was heading that way. She knelt down with a mighty thud and stared right at your figure, making you fall on your rear as you found yourself staring right into her mouth. There was no doubt that, by your standards, she could inhale thousands of aircraft in one go. \"W...WHAT HAPPENED?\" She asked at a volume you'd expect from her size but it still wasn't dangerously loud. \"Why are you so tiny?!? Are you... human?\" Sitting up you took a deep breath, pushing down the sense of dread that came from seeing those massive incisors just past her lips, and answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But why are you a rabbit?\" The disbelieving stare she exhibited now became one more of confusion. \"Have I really shrunk?\" You mutter, not realising she can still hear you clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey,\" Your mother asks, \"What can you remember?\" You recollect all you can in this short space of time. As you finish your mother lifts her head away from the bed and brings a paw up to her muzzle in an expression of worry or something like that. What she says next knocks you a bit.</span></div></div>",

You manage to grab a single strand of fur before she lifts her hand. \"No matter.\" She says. \"You're here with us now, so we're gonna have to look after you. You're still my little girl.\" She had a momentary laugh at this, shaking you so that you might have fallen off if she hadn't turned her wrist, so where her finger formed a furry wall before now it was the floor. You curled up from the combination of uncertainty about your new life as a microscopic person and the early morning chill. \"Oh dear. You're such a tiny thing you must be frozen in that little nightie.\" Before you knew it you tumbled down her curling finger into the depression of her knuckle. She was so massive that by the time you came to a stop she'd already encased you in this merest portion of her fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting your bearings you began to use your mother's fur as support for your climb to the top of her fist. Every movement she made shook you, nearly sending you falling back down, possibly all the way through her fist if you weren't careful. She hardly said anything as you climbed, making you wonder if she could feel you hauling your way up her finger. Finally you reached the top, momentarily blinded as your head poked out of her fist before you saw...</span></div></div>",

My head feels so sore.\" Then in surprise, you look and see you're in a bright green carriage of some kind and you look past to see you were going through a city made up of jade. From the looks of it, you were in some kingdom that appeared to combine the medieval world with a touch of modern culture given the way some of the people were dressed. \"Huh?\" you ask. \"Oh good,\" says a voice. \"You're finally awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and look in surprise because you see a woman dressed in jade chain mail with a strange mask and long black hair. \"Who are you?\" you ask. \"What's going on here? Are you some kind of kidnappers.\" The woman waves her hand and shakes her head. \"No, no,\" she says. \"It's nothing sinister, Your Highness.\" You give a confused blink. \"Your Highness? Is this some kind of prank.\" \"No. It's not a prank. We are on orders from the newly crowned queen to bring her son and heir to the castle.\" What that woman said confused you. Your mom was no queen. Not as far as you remembered. She could act larger than life at times, but royal? That was a funny thought. \"Lady,\" you say. \"There has to be some mistake. I'd think if my mom was a queen, I would've known it long ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look out the window of the carriage and see that as you're leaving the town, there was a stretch of lush green land where there appeared to be no signs of civilization. \"Where are we going?\" you ask. \"You said we were going to the castle.\" \"We are,\" says the guard. \"But the castle is a journey away from the rest of the kingdom.\" \"Why is that?\" \"Because if it weren't, your mother might accidentally destroy all buildings close to the castle.\" You give a scoff. \"I'm not sure if I believe what you're saying about my mom being the queen, but I do know that she's not a klutz.\" The guard looks in confusion. \"How could you not notice that... uh... nothing.\" You scratch your head but decide to go along with... whatever it is that's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours go by and you wonder exactly how long these people are going to continue with their joke, when you see something up ahead. It looked like a jade castle that looked like something out of a fairytale, complete with a briar fence and bright flowers. You give a whistle but then you look in surprise because the gate goes on for miles, as do the walls and as the carriage gets closer, the castle appears bigger and bigger. You and the guard exit the carriage and she walks you up to the door. Or more specifically, she walks you <i>under</i> the door because the door was so colossal that you'd have to climb three skyscrapers just to reach the doorknob which was too big for you to turn as it was. \"Who designed this castle?\" you think to yourself. \"It looks like something out of Jack and the Beanstalk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you're forced to plug your ears as two trumpeters sound off and the guard brings you further into the castle. \"My queen,\" says the guard as she bows. \"Your son has been found.\" You roll your eyes, thinking that this was still some weird joke, but then you hear shaking and feel earthquakes in the ground. It sounded as if something large was coming. This was an accurate description because at that moment, right in front of you, hidden by a loud and frilly skirt, landed an enormous paw like that of a feline. The paw was big enough to crush several city blocks at once and the claws were painted with gold nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look up at the queen, you're completely dumbfounded. Her face and her golden brown hair were definitely those of your mother, but there were a few, not so minor differences. First off, she was wearing a regal Victorian-style dress with a bejeweled tiara that you'd never expect your mom to wear. Next, she was an anthropomorphic lioness with gold colored fur and bright green cat's eyes. Third, she was very obese, especially in the stomach and rear, the latter filling out her enormous skirt and then some. And as for the last part, your regal lioness mother was <i>colossal</i>. You peg her height as being at least as tall as 10 skyscrapers stacked upon one another. She could probably fit everyone of her subjects in her mouth at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness queen holds up a pair of opera glasses to get a good look at you just to confirm it's you. This winds up confirming the claims that she was your mother as she then speaks in your mom's voice. \"I was wondering when you were going to show up.\" You give a look of surprise right before your monarch mother lowers one of her mountain-sized hands to pick you up and take you to her enormous face. You find yourself face to face with lips as big as canyons as the queen smiles at you. \"Mom?\" you ask in surprise. \"What's going on? How did you become so big. Why are you a lion? What's this I hear about you being the queen?\" Your giant mother just shrugs her shoulders before plopping down in her massive throne that creaks as her big royal booty squeezes into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck if I know, sweetie,\" says your mother. \"I just woke up this morning like this. But why look a gift horse in the mouth. After all, we are royalty.\" Your mom places you right behind her tiara as you try to figure out exactly what is going on.</span></div></div>",

You are whisked through large passageways and into a huge hall, where an impossibly large purple gem made up the roof and the floors were covered in a fine black carpet.  You are amazed by the beauty of the temple, where some sort of religion you never heard of must be practiced.  You ask your escort what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, chosen one, I see that your excitement has blurred your senses and reason, but that is definitely expected.  I probably wouldn't believe it myself!  You have been chosen to be the Great Mother's next head priest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great Mother?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Grand Parent, the Goddess of all that is Good, our beloved divine ruler and savior!  I believe you prefer to refer to her by her true name, Ayla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice many other priests kneeling on the black carpet in complete solitude in a circle.  You are directed to the center of the group and can feel power well up in you, though you do not understand it.  You start to kneel yourself, but a voice in your head tells you to remain standing.  The power grows greatly, and to your surprise you start to levitate off the ground!  You continue to rise up into the air towards the very high purple ceiling.  You think you are going to hit it, but instead you pass through the gemstone like water.  You can still breathe, and your body feels cleansed with every breath that you take.  You rise for hundreds of feet until you break through the surface of the purple ceiling, causing it to ripple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA million things hit you at once.  All around you you see the curvature of the Earth, and realize that you are many miles above the surface.  You look down, and notice the temple below start to look smaller.  Looking down, you first realize that the temple is round with long golden corridors reaching out from opposite sides.  The ground it is on is black just like the carpet, and you realize it must be the same material.  You realize that the temple is wrapped around a huge pillar, one of four of different lengths, and a fifth one nearby...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do a double take.  That temple is on the ring finger of a giant black furry hand!  Slowly, you rise your head, to see the humongous face of a jet black jackal, a divine goddess hundreds of miles tall.  In her other paw is a massive marble sceptre, which is tilting towards you.  As you are pressed against the hilt of the sceptre, a pearl the size of a small city, you hear a divine female voice echo throughout you and the rest of the world:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations, head priest, and may your leadership be known throughout history.

Your floating body rose with her, always staying level with her face.  At six hundred miles, she was definitely a sight to behold, dressed only in an ethereal robe and more jewelry than you thought could be made with Earth's resources.  Placing the sceptre against her throne, which was many times taller than any mountain, your goddess brought her free hand forth, summoning forth a huge flat surface out of nowhere.  You gaze in amazement as Ayla performs her magic; she apparently has the ability to create objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the surface like a silver platter, the jackal next thrust it into the air.  Immediately multicolored dust rises from every corner of the planet, gathering in a coat on the platter.  You see some of the dust pass by you and recognize them as people; Ayla is bringing everyone on Earth to her.  You even see a little golden dust rise from the ring/temple on her massive finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only imagine what it must be like, having everyone in the world bowing down to Ayla and you.  \"My beloved people, let us begin the festivities!\" cries the goddess to her subjects.  \"We shall start with a great feast, with plenty of food for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surface of the silver platter changes, but at your distance you cannot tell by sight.  However, as a chair pops up under you and a table appears in front of you piled high with every kind of food imaginable, you must think that everyone else is receiving the same treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had first seen what was going on, you had assumed that Ayla was a demanding goddess, expecting loyalty and servitude from all of her human followers.  Now you realize that this is clearly not the case.  Ayla is turning out to be incredibly generous and caring to all of mankind, and probably wouldn't even hurt a fly, even if she could fit a small country in her paw.  Humanity worships this jackal goddess and is completely devoted to her only because she truly deserves it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you eat your meal, you realize that no matter how much you eat, the piles of food do not grow smaller.  Apparently, in this new world you have woken up in, world hunger is unheard of.  You imagine that Ayla has also prevented the existence of many more of your previous life's evils, like war or disease.  You start to feel very fortunate right now that this odd life switch occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen everyone finished eating, all of the food disappeared.  You think that the celebration is over, but it turns out that it is far from over.  In fact, Ayla announces how long your celebration will last.</span></div></div>",

Clearly you are not in your original home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise and get dressed, after insisting on doing it yourself, in gold robes with white threads running through them to give them a more flashy and fluid appearance compared to plain gold. You follow the man out of what must be your bedroom as far as anyone here is concerned and ask him about what he's told you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've been ever so excited,\" He comments, \"For you to forget the facts. It is the New Year; the celebration of creation, when the divine god brought forth all that exists.\" You're not really sure what he's referring to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is the great god to whom you refer?\" You ask him, nerouvs about what could happen just for asking that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, the most powerful being ever known. Protector of life and giver of joy. His name invokes awe, respect and happiness in all who speak and hear it... Hovalla.\" You admit that the name of the god is a most heroic-sounding name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you enter a large hall within the temple; it is ever so vast that it's a wonder alone in how so much space can be found under one roof without it caving in. At the other end of the hall is a most impressive statue; a very realistic anthropomorphic lion statue at least 200 feet high. You figure that it must be a portrayal of Hovalla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not to scale.\" Your priest-guide informs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can believe that.\" You comment, thinking how many civilisations have built statues of gods much bigger than they believed the gods to really be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" He continues, \"His divine greatness is always ready to deliver information and awe to those who forget.\" You wonder what happens now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest-guide signals for you to go up to the statue. It is a long walk across the hall over marble tiles. As you head towards the statue you hear priests entering behind you, obviously ready to perform the ceremony.

You can't hear a voice in your head but you feel that something or someone is speaking to your whole body via your subconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter standing in front of the statue for a while you then feel your body moving through some unheard commands. Your arms stick out in front of you and begin pushing downwards somewhat limply; the priests kneel. Then you turn to the statue and begin reciting something that you can neither understand nor control. After that you feel like something's just let go of you; you attempt to kneel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no need,\" This is real telepathy now, \"Remain standing my cute little vizier.\" You look up at the statue, thinking that it's come to life; it is just the same as it ever was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something very strange occurs. The ceiling of the hall becomes transparent and a starry sky appears through it; you and all the other priests look directly through the transparent roof of the hall.

As you float out of the temple you look down at it as you float higher and higher. After a while you realise that the temple is in fact a ring on one of Hovalla's fingers. The scale of it suggests that it is multi-storey, which makes your comprehension of Hovalla's scale infathomable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance you see the Earth retaining its familiar shape. Various dots are swarming off it. Initially you think that these dots are all the people on Earth but, as you float towards wherever Hovalla is sending you, you can see that all other mammals are among them. Clearly Hovalla has the power to allow all species to live together in harmony, or at least groups of species. Finally you see where you are heading for. A vast silver platter has formed over Hovalla's right hand, while the temple has on his left hand. Upon this platter wonderfully decorated brass walls separate each species into different halls where they will feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float down right at the head of the table where all humans are being seated by the great god. At the moment the table is just a huge mahogany surface, nothing is on it. It takes a while for all the mammals on Earth to arrive but once they do Hovalla speaks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the feast begin.\" Immediately a vast mountain range of every food humans can eat appears on the table and people begin to tuck in.

That hope was quickly dashed; the chasm was impossibly deep, the bottom-assuming that there even <i>was</i> one-well beyond your sight, and part of you wondered if this crack split the Earth down to the core.  <i>No way!</i>  You thought, almost violently.  <i>This is impossible!  No one can do this!!</i>  You look back to the preistly figure, almost as though this entire thing was somehow his fault; all you got in return was a 'go on' motion.  Turning back to the gap, you scowled at the open air.  <i>Damn it all; might as well go out with my dignity.</i>  Moving your foot from solid ground, you closed your eyes, shifted your weight and just waited for the sensation of falling into a bottemless pit to take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt never came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes once more, you almost gasped in shock.  Where there had been nothing but open air had been not even seconds previously, a complete bridge now spanned the gap; how did that just happen?!  <i>Wait a minute</i>  You thought, your brain actually working once again.  <i>Kitsunes are tricksters</i>  It was a conscious effort for you to not slam your face into your palm for forgetting that; as it was, you just continued onward.  The other side of the bridge slowly came into view, and you started to wonder about the image that you had seen prior to this; how accurate was that image?  Was this 'goddess' really an antropomorphic fox?  Was she really as big as the tapestries made her out to be?  What did she want with you?  All these questions and countless others swirled around your mind as you reached the end of the bridge and stepped onto solid ground once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scenery suddenly vanished, replaced by nothing but blackness as far as you could see in every direction and probably beyond.  You were still on some sort of black ground, but you couldn't really tell just what that ground was.  After getting over the initial shock, panic started to set in; what just happened?  Where were you?  What the hell was going on?!!!??!?!  \"Thank you for coming.\"  A voice that was so angelic and loud that very well might have been the voice of God, if God was a female, spoke out of the blackness.  \"For a little bit, I was afraid that my little joke had put you off.\"  Your eyes widened at this; this voice, this beautiful, powerful, divine voice, was that of the goddess that you had been supposedly summoned by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was no trouble.\"  You say, remembering the part that you were suppose to be playing.  \"But, if I may be so bold to question, would you kindly reveal yourself to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chuckle from that voice sounded, actually causing the ground to shake slightly.  \"I already have; in a way.\"  You were about to ask what she meant, when you started to rise into the air.  Another few moments of panic followed, but the goddess spoke once more.  \"Don't worry; I'm very gentle.\"  There was a chuckle on the end of the sentance, but more an amused one than one that spoke to malicious intent; either way, there wasn't much you could do about it.  Several moments passed without anything happening but more of the black landscape becoming visible; when you started to see large strips of orange ground surrounding the black.  Longer passed, then you started to see the black and orange land for a recognizable shape; a HAND!  You had been standing on a hand that probably could have held the entire solar system within it!!!  \"Now you're starting to get it.\"  The Kitsune's voice spoke from a recognizable direction this time, causing you to turn toward it; and you very nearly passed out from shock and a twinge of fright.  There was the snout of an impossibly large fox face, a feminine one at that, just within your feild of view.  \"Oops\"  The fox spoke, her impossibly massive jaws moving in time with the words.  \"Too close, sorry.\"  You moved, much faster than before, away until you had a perfect view of her full, nude, and surprisingly attractive body.  It was then that you realized that the tapestries <i>hadn'y<i> shown her size accurately; they had scaled her down!  She gave another chuckle as you sanpped out of your stupor and blushed as you realized that you had been staring shamelessly at her for a few moments now.  \"Like what you see?\"  She questioned, flirtatiously; actually spinning to reveal her full, parsecs tall, figure to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swollowed, shaking your head to clear it as you looked at her once more; noting that she seemed to be leaning on empty space before you.  For a goddess, Kitsune seemed to act more like a teenager.  \"W-why have you summoned me?\"  You finally managed to spit out; causing her to frown a little bit.  Apparently, she was hoping that you'd play along for a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you wanna get straight to the point.\"  She said, sounding a little bit bored.  \"You're here cause-\"</i></i></span></div></div>",

Curious, you open the book and flip through the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a picture of you when you were very little, just a wee baby.  You see your mom holding you and your dad by your moms side, but there is a weird sharp cream-colored thing on the ground.

What could this possibly mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your windows to let some light in, but instead of the sun, you see that same eye you saw in the picture!

It\u2019s amazing really,\u201d your father said.  Amazing is an understatement.  You wonder what will happen if Leonard grows to the size of a continent, or what would happen if he got larger than the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound very worried about this.  I mean, he won\u2019t be able to handle us safely for much longer will he?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise you hear Leonard laugh.  \u201cBro, if you wanted to play you just have to ask.\u201d  You wonder what he meant by that.  Then Leonard plucked you out of your seat at the table.  The speed at which he did that frightened you at first.  Your fear did not last for long though.  For some odd reason you felt completely safe pinched in between Leonard\u2019s fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you were lightly tossed in the air by Leonard and that fear came right back as you found yourself gliding a few miles above the Earth.  Something told you that you were going to be just fine.  In fact, you started to enjoy your little flight through the air.  An object that was immeasurably large rose in your path and you realized it was Leonard\u2019s tail.  You landed safely in the tuft of fur at the end of that tail and this felt perfectly natural to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle flick of the tail launches you into the air once more.  This time you are able to enjoy the entire trip.  Leonard obviously plans on catching you.  You start to think that it should be cold this high up in the air.  Something Leonard must be doing is keeping you from freezing to death.  You don\u2019t think about that for too long though.  Flying through the air like this is just plain incredible.  You glide over Leonard\u2019s mane in between his ears and come to a landing safely on his muzzle.  It felt like the landing should have been much harder, but the surface of Leonard\u2019s muzzle was just as soft as it needed to be to make your landing as pleasant as could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how\u2019d you like that bro?\u201d Leonard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat, that was incredible,\u201d you said, not even bothering to try and hide your sense of wonder and amusement.  Leonard placed you back at the table while your father and mother just smiled at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that you\u2019ve got that out of your system you do remember that you are supposed to be getting ready for the birthday party, don\u2019t you?\u201d your mother asked.</span></div></div>",

You suddenly realize that since you just woke up in this new life of yours, you probably don't have a present for the huge lion that is your kind brother.  What would he think, after how nice he was to you, after he apparently played a huge part of your life, not just only in the literal sense?  Not only that, but what would you possibly get a fifty mile lion for a gift?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom suddenly walked up to you and whispered in your ear, \"Jake, would you be a dear and get Leonard's present?  You told me that you hid it under your bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly relieved, you reply 'yes' to your mother and give her a big smooch.  Now, if only you knew how to tell Leonard how to get you into your house, which was now two miles up the pole sticking in the ground in the valley near your massive brother's left ankle.  You think of the first thing that comes to mind.  \"Hey, big bro, I need to brush my teeth; could you give me a lift to my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mega sized brother is more that happy to help, \"Sure, anything for my little bro.\"  An enormous tan claw lowers until level to the cliff, and you step on.  You whizz dozens of miles through the air as you approach the house on the giant pin.  After opening up the hinged wall of your bedroom, Leonard gently deposits you on your bed.  \"Make sure you floss as well, little bro, so your teeth can be big and strong like your big bro's!\" the mega lion shouts before showing off his pearly set of pointy white mountains.  You try to shake the scary image out of your head as your wall closes up, then look under your bed.  Sure enough, there is a present there, but it's so small and thin, you have to wonder what Leonard would do with such a thing.  You slip the wrapped gift, which has the words, \"To Leonard, From Mom, Dad, and Jake\" on it, in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to brush your teeth as well before calling for your adopted brother.  After another trip of dozens of miles, you return to the cliff top, where your parents have a chocolate chip birthday-pancake with twenty-one candles on it.  \"Wow, already?\" gasps your huge lion sibling.  \"But it's only morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday, Leonard!\" called out your parents.  \"We thought that we should do this as soon as possible so we can talk about your present.\"  Leonard looked very happy as he effortlessly blew out the candles, then ate the pancake, candles and all, as if it was the tiniest crumb. You doubt that he could taste such a small thing, but it was the thought that counts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents signal to you, and you bring the present out of your pocket and present it to Leonard.  \"Happy Birthday, big bro,\" you say as he carefully plucks the present from your fingers.  Bringing the present miles high to his face, you guess that he is opening it by the way his fingers move very slightly and delicately.  You do not believe it, but your brother shouts out, \"Wow, this is the best gift ever!  Thank you so much, this is what I always wanted!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper is daintily handed back to you as your brother roars loudly with glee.  You look at the paper and see that Leonard's gift is...</span></div></div>",

Pausing for a while you decide on a suitable answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite alright, Leonard. I just need to wash, get dressed, you know what I'm talking about.\" Your rather patchwork-y answer does seem to settle Leonard as he carefully lowers a claw for you to climb on. You take a quick wink at your parents, who seem to understand, as you settle yourself down on your brother's massive claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're set down back in your room Leonard shows the good decency to replace the wall that had been removed.

There's a gentle light coming through your curtains, which seem to have a more relaxing pattern on them as opposed to the plain colour you were used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon drawing the curtains you are shocked by the vista, it seems that you're now living in a high class house on top of a hill overlooking a beautiful valley. You wonder why your life has suddenly changed as you step onto the balcony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning 'big brother'.\" Came a beautiful and sensitive but powerful and commanding voice followed by a light giggle. You suddenly look around for your supposed little sister. \"Oh, come on,\" The voice came again, almost rooting you to the spot, \"This is no time for games.\" Then you look right above you, a shadow had been covering the whole house since you came onto the balcony and the voice was coming from above your head. There you see an awe-inspiring but intimidating sight; your 'little sister' turns out to be a gargantuan anthropomorphic vixen. She was so large that you deduce that her height must be measured in miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, &lt;insert name here&gt;.\" She continued, smiling down to you with no teeth showing; the sort of considerate smile you find coming from your family. \"You'd better get dressed. Mum's already getting your breakfast ready and Daddy's organising the dining field.\" She disappears from view while you go back in to dress and let everything sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've now got a younger sister who was an anthro the size of a mountain, if not bigger. You were now living in a classy house and it seems that you all eat breakfast together even though the house must be no bigger than a sugar cube to your not-so-little sister.

Realizing quickly that the only place to go is back to the vista, you head there, and you are not too surprised to find your huge little sister waiting there.  \"I see you're ready, big brother!\" sang the vixen as she lowered her huge pinky finger to the level of the vista.  As you get on, you realize that you were on the fourth floor of your mansion, but you do not see your front door anywhere.  As you step on the black mount of fur, you realize; the only way your sister would be able to lift you or anyone is if they are at least four stories in the air.  Any lower, and you're sister's little finger would be out of reach.  You don't even think now that the first three floors are used for anything, though your family must still have become rich somehow to afford the mansion and all of this property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe finger lifts up, and carries you slowly to a gently sloping hilltop, the top of which is covered with an enormous checkered cloth.  Your mansion could probably fit on one of those squares.  Seeing some scattered dots on one of the red squares, you realize that your family must be there.  As the finger lowers down near them, the cloth gives, letting you just walk off towards the places set on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to see you up, sweetie,\" says your mom as she serves you some fried eggs and toast.  Your father seems absorbed in the paper, and you are glad that your family hasn't changed much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Mom, what's for breakfast?\" asked the loud voice above you.  You flinch a bit; you will have to get more used to this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eggs and toast, Vicky,\" your mother shouts up to the huge fox.  Amazingly, she holds up an identical sized paper plate for the vixen, who grabs it between two huge claws.  You realize why your family is using disposable dishware for your sister, as she tosses the whole breakfast into her huge maw all at once.  \"Wow, that was great, Mom, I'm stuffed!\" she replies from above, before covering her mouth with from a very noticable belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't figure out how such a huge anthro can live on what must be relatively less that one crumb of food a day, but you decide not to worry about it to much as you dig in to your own food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tasty meal, you wonder what is in store for you on your first day in this new world.</span></div></div>",

You decide to look through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first picture is unusual; you're certain that the baby in the picture is you and you recognise your parents younger faces in the picture, but what strikes you as disturbingly odd is the yellow background. It just didn't look right for wallpaper. The next photo shows you taking your first steps from your mother to your father, except that it was upon some black surface that looked too smooth and neat to be a carpet; the same yellow background seemed a bit far off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery photograph carried some importance to the various stages in your childhood and adolesence, and yet there was always that same yellow background occasionally accompanied by a large smooth black floor and sometimes large black patches on that yellow background. The final picture clinched it. It showed you almost as you are now, standing with your parents on what was recognisable as grass, but the background was a strange combination of black, green and white surrounded by that same distinguishable background; it almost looked like an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do a double-take. That background was fur, the black surface was either a pad or a nose and that really was an eye in that final picture. Confused you open the curtains in the hopes that the daylight will clear your head. Instead of sunlight you find yourself staring straight into that same giant pupil of that very same eye. It blnks, giving you an astonishing view of eyelashes that are bigger than you on all counts. A strange shockwave goes through the house, like you're standing on a bus that's setting off, and now you see an enormous anthro-cheetah face filling the view of your window. It greets you with a feminine voice that was grand but not booming; it was gentle and soft but had a hint of echo that came from being produced by lips bigger than your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my little brother.\"</span></div></div>",

I was getting worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen as hard as it is to believe, you recognize this cheetah girl. You were talking up to Maggie, your older sister. You remember that she was adopted but you didn't remember her being a giant cheetah. As you continue to look at your sister, she gets on her knee and holds out her paw, placing a claw in front of you. It would appear that your sister wanted you to climb into her hand. You hesitate at first and then you climb Maggie's finger as she lifted you up in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter bro?\" she asks you. \"You act like you don't remember your own sister. Then again, I wasn't the one who got hit by that baseball at school yesterday.\" Well that would explain it. But even for mild amnesia from a head injury this seemed unreal as Maggie feels your head with one of her large fingers. \"Oh, I remember my sister alright. I just don't remember her being so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie suddenly gives a shocked look of worry before turning her head and looking at her own backside. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"So it is noticeable. I knew I was putting on weight lately.\" \"Uh, that wasn't what I... don't worry about it Sis. You're beautiful. I didn't...\" \"Oh it's alright bro,\" says Maggie. \"I know you'd never say anything that would hurt my feelings. Now I hope you remember to hold on tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a look of confusion before Maggie shoves you into her cleavage tight. You wiggle in your sister's breasts but you can't move. \"Maggie! What are you...\" Before you can finish your sentence, Maggie runs off like a meteor and you can see the outside world becoming little more than a blur. Duh, your sister was a cheetah and a cheetah that sized would move as fast as a meteor. You're impressed at how she can move so supersonic without stepping on anybody or destroying property. Everyone Maggie passes, at least those who can see her, act surprisingly casual to a cheetah giant. They must've been used to your sister, which meant, you were the only one who found this experience strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is your cheetah sister taking you?</span></div></div>",

The hole appeared to have reptilian like toes. \"What the?\" You ask. Suddenly you hear stomping and then you look up to see a giant shadow. It looked feminine but at the same time lizard like with a long snout and a big tail along with long brown curly hair with a white highlight. The creature bends down to reveal a pair of giant breasts and a giant clawed hand reaches down and grabs you by the shirt as you let out a grunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you look and see that a giant alligator woman, slightly chubby in body shape was looking down on you. \"Howdy little bro,\" she says in a slight southern accent. \"What are you doing out so late at night? You come to help me fish? You better be careful where you step. That's the fifth time in three days I've had to pull you out of a foot hole.\" Then your eyes popped. This dozen mile high alligator giantess was your sister.</span></div></div>",

Stretching her arms out and wriggling her toes as she tried to recover her spatial awareness it soon dawned on her that this wasn't quite her bedroom. The furnishings were all in the same positions but there was a lot more space and it all seemed to be in an uncanny state of repair, almost as though it was built only yesterday. She got up and looked round but, in the gloom, there was little in the way of clues she could find. She decided to open the curtains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she did so she was struck by a sight that left her filled with awe, fear and intrigue. Staring right back at her through that same window was an immense eye so vast that she couldn't even see anything beyond the cornea. Suddenly the whole house shook to a might, booming but tolerable and friendly voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, sis.\" It boomed. \"Did ya have a good night?\" Delia gasped in shock as she recognised this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B...Banta?\" She squeaked. \"Is it really you?!?\" She watched as he blinked, a massive eyelid covered in red fur raced by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dilly, are you okay?\" He asked, the power of his voice almost toppling her. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...What happened to you?\" She gasped. \"You must be... TITANIC!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now.\" He thundered. \"You moved in with me when you were just twelve, and I was only two miles tall back then.\" Delia's hand shot to her mouth as she gawped at this; he was treating such a size as being no big deal (no pun intended).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember anything about that.\" She chanced. \"My memories are of you being just another guy where most people'd be concerned.\" She felt a great quaking as Banta's eye zoomed away, revealing more of his mountainous face, covered in red and cream-coloured fur with a long muzzle curled up in a look of concerned. Not only was he colossal, he was a red panda!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dilly,\" He boomed, \"Do you feel all right? I can't really remember being human-size, mum and dad said I was just a cub back then. The earliest thing I remember was when I was four, and about three-hundred feet tall.\" Delia knew Banta was four years older than her, so she figured he must be alluding to when she was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aside from the shock of seeing how vast and furry you are I feel fine.\" She answered. \"But, if you were two miles tall when you were sixteen, how big are you now?\" She rested her arms on the windowsill, wishing to get a better perspective on her current situation, she caught sight of a single black furry column pressed against the outside wall, which she guessed was one of Banta's fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last time I checked I was 32 miles, 3,748 feet and nine and a half inches.\" He replied. Delia promptly fainted back onto her bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Like most mornings you are having a hard time waking up.  This morning feels unusually bad though.  Your bed just feels so comfortable that you don\u2019t want to be roused from your slumber.  Eventually you do recognize the fact that you do have to get up eventually.  There is something wrong, but your sleep addled mind cannot determine just what it is.  Then it hits you, you are not in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are resting on something soft, yet firm.  Whatever the ground beneath you is made out of is extremely comfortable to the touch.  The ground also feels like it is radiating a little bit of heat.  It is just warm enough that you can understand why you did not want to wake up.  When you look around you find nothing but a surreal landscape.  You look like you are in a dense forest of snow white smooth limbless trees that soar into the air.  There are also a few black ones off in the distance, but the white ones dominate the landscape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hose is gone, but you do have a few little supplies lying around.  For one thing your blanket is still here as well as some clothes, shoes, and other items for your personal hygiene.  That appears to be all though.  There is no one else around and you wonder just how you managed to get here.  It does not seem like you could have walked here on your own even if you were sleep walking.  \u201cHello, is anyone there?\u201d you call out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re awake.  Sorry I didn\u2019t notice little buddy,\u201d a voice said out of nowhere.  The voice sounded like it was coming from above the trees.  That did not seem possible though.  Those trees looked like they were thousands of feet tall and you did not think you would be able to hear anyone shouting at you from above those trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something else added to the weirdness.  Something incredibly huge started to descend through the trees.  It was headed straight at you and you tried to run away from it.  The black pointed object started to move in the direction you were running and you realized it was coming after you.  Despite sprinting as fast as you could the object easily caught up to you and swept you off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object started to lift you upward and you clung to it for dear life as you were elevated miles into the air at a mind boggling rate of speed.  You were lifted beyond the trees and as you got further and further away from them you could start to make out patterns in the trees.  It was mostly white like you had expected, but the black trees you had seen earlier formed what appeared to be ring like spots in the forest.  After a few more seconds you could make out that the forest was not a forest of trees, but of fur.  You were now able to make out that you had been resting on the back of paw that had to be a few miles long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you realized that you were riding on a claw that had to be well over a mile long.  You were being raised toward the face of a massive feline.  Due to the type of fur it had you guessed the feline was a snow leopard.  Despite its size you could tell there was something else different about it.  There was an opposable thumb on the paw that you could see.  It also had one more surprise for you when you were so close to its mammoth face that you could not even see all of it.  It could talk.  \u201cGood morning.  Did you sleep well?,\u201d it asked as its warm breath washed over you.</span></div></div>",

The mega-sized snow leopard, speaking in a deep, manly voice, sounded concerned.  \"Are you okay, buddy?  Is it too cold out?  Here, let me help with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the huge claw started to move, carrying you farther and farther away from the enourmous feline face until you enter what looks like a mammoth, fur-lined cave.  You can't believe it, but you are actually inside the snow leopard's paw, where the claw retracts.  An enormous slit-pupiled eye zoomed towards the entrance, locked on to your immobile speck of a frame.  \"Come on, buddy, please say something!  Wait, I think I know the problem.  Your shocked that I grew three miles last night, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf it was possible, you were even more speechless than before.  This monstrous feline is still growing, miles at a time?  Even though three miles probably would look like two inches to this snow leopard anthro, that does not make the figure less intimidating.  The snow leopard's huge eyelids lower, giving it a very concerned look.  \"Listen, buddy, I know that your afraid that I will never stop growing and end up hurting someone, and I actually am very afraid of that too.  It's been haunting me the whole week I've existed.  But we have to face our fear together if we want to overcome it, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, through the frightening miles of visage and rumbling loud voice that rocks your soul, the fact that this huge beast is afraid of its ever-increasing height as much as you, if not more, speaks to you.  You finally find your voice and speak with complete empathy, \"Listen, I'm very sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopard speaks to you softly, \"Please, don't be sorry, I'm sure it was only a natural reaction.  I'm very relieved that you still see me as a being with feelings, though.  Nothing like everyone else, who think I'm a monster.\"  The leopard decides to lower you back to your campsite located on the back of his palm.  As you descent, you notice several large mountains covered with snow surrounding the behemoth paw, and the two actually blend with each other very well.  This snow leopard must be hiding from all of the other humans by disguising himself as a mountain range.  Though you are not very afraid of the snow leopard now, you still don't have a clue what is going on.  You slide down a soft white pole of a fur strand to your campsite and look for anything that can give you a hint.  You look through your pile of clothes and come across one piece of evidence; a scientific-looking slip of paper.  Reading it, you are surprised to find out that this snow leopard was born in a top secret laboratory in an experiment to create...</span></div></div>",

The scientist in charge of the operation sounded a little insane from what you were reading.  It looked like the military was involved in this too.  They did not seem like they expected this to work, but were only involved in this to make sure they could look like they were using all of their money in a responsible way and thus maintain their budget.  When this project started showing some actual results they had been just as surprised as anyone else would have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military did not get that involved in the project even after the project had yielded results.  They did not see what was then just a four foot tall snow leopard man could do for them.  The lead scientist did not seem sane either and that probably influenced their opinion of the project.  As you read you really came to dislike the lead scientist in charge of this project.  Despite claiming to want to create the \u201cultimate life form\u201d he only seemed interested in his work.  The snow leopard was treated more like an object than a life form.  Some of the things done to the snow leopard sounded pretty brutal to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the snow leopard, referred to as specimen 3245, had started to grow.  It bothered you that they had not even bothered to give him a real name.  The snow leopard\u2019s growth had been slow at first.  After six months he had begun to grow much more rapidly.  He had managed to escape after his rate of growth caught them by surprise.  Since these files stopped recording information about the snow leopard when he was about 100 feet tall you assumed that was when he had escaped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe place he was created in was must have been somewhere in Alaska because that was where you live.  It was a good thing for the snow leopard if it was because even a 100 foot tall feline would not have been noticed in the isolated area you lived in.  Still, he had been growing about ten feet per hour by the time he escaped and his rate of growth had been increasing.  You wondered how tall he had been by the time he met you and why he had chosen to befriend you.  His only experience with humans had not been positive when he first encountered you.  It is surprising he did not crush you like a bug upon spotting you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one way to find out about your questions and that was to ask the snow leopard.  He did not seem to have any trouble hearing you so you asked, \u201cHey, why did you decide to befriend me when we first met?\u201d  It did not seem like that strange a question to ask a friend.  Besides, you might find out if he had a real name if he told you the story about how you became friends.</span></div></div>",

In fact, he seems happy just for having someone to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis escape had been far from discrete.  He was being held in maximum security, with armed soldiers surrounding his reinforced cage at all times and shackles holding him in place.  Apparently, as he grew, all of his other vital statistics such as his strength, stamina, and even his senses and intelligence also grew.  He had wanted to escape for a long time, but it was only when he reach one hundred feet that he was able to break out of maximum security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where the leopard's story starts to scare you, since the soldiers started to attack him as soon as he was free.  Riddled with machine gun fire and badly burned by grenades, he furiously smashed dozens of the guards to pieces as he made his escape.  He ran far, far away from that laboratory, only keeping the records on him that were attached to the tag on his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro ran for a long time until his wounds got to him and he fainted.  When he woke up, however, he felt something warm trickle down his throat.  The first thing he saw when he opened his large eyes was you pouring a bowl of soup into his mouth.  He noticed that his wounds were covered with snow to stop the swelling and he knew that with his superior rate of healing that he would survive.  It was then that the anthro realized that not all humans were evil; only that the ones at the laboratory were some of the bad ones.  This human was obviously good, so the snow leopard vowed then that he would definitely befriend this human, and since this human had done everything that it could do, he would do everything he could as the ultimate life form to somehow return the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since then, you two have been in hiding in the northern Rocky Mountains, although you don't know why; surely there is nothing that a hundred mile snow leopard would fear.  However, you are wrong, \"Those bad humans said that if I get out of hand that they would resort to nuclear force,\" explains the anthro.  \"I can feel how powerful I have become so far, and I still cannot survive a nuclear bomb attack.  I am hoping that I come that far before I grow too big, because I really would like to meet other good humans.\"  You feel very bad for this huge anthro who has lead the most difficult life you have ever heard, and still wants to turn his life around for the better.  However, it is then that you hear a loud noise.</span></div></div>",

However, you realize that he is only lifting his huge hand a little bit to crawl northward.  As he moves, you notice the spots on his face high above start to move around.  Apparently, he is a master of disguise who can blend in with the scenery even as he moves.  You notice the forest of white start to grow thicker and taller, and you actually start to feel warmer as the leopard heads for colder grounds.  You also notice that he can move almost silently and diligently, even though his movements should have at least started several major avalanches.  Soon, you see all of the dots disappear from the leopards face, now blending with the cloudy sky more than the snowy ground.  Judging from the thickness of the fur now, the leopard must have nearly doubled in height.  You can't help but ask the leopard if he can perhaps withstand a nuclear bomb strike now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so, buddy.  Maybe one now, but only if it didn't hit my head.  Two bombs, though, are definitely still lethal.  I know how much you want to see me right all of my wrongs, but now is not the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back up at the disappointed huge face in the sky.  You are definitely starting to feel some sort of friendly bond with this monstrous feline.  He almost feels familiar somehow, almost as if you have been with him for the whole week, rather than just a few hours.  You do wish that you could do something to cheer him up.  Looking back up at the leopard, you call out, \"Hey, buddy, how about we do something fun together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge leopard's face seemed to light up.  \"Wow, really?  I mean, you actually trust me enough to do something fun with you now?\"  You are confused, but realize that in this world, you were still supposed to be frightened of the leopard handling you at this point.  However, the leopard replies, \"That's wonderful, buddy, and it will also be great practice for when I can return to civilization!\"  Soon, you learn that the ultimate life-form's idea of a good time is...</span></div></div>",

In a few seconds you were gliding gently through the air.  \u201cIt took a while, but I\u2019ve finally mastered my telekinetic abilities buddy,\u201d said the leopard.  The snow leopard had you flying above him which left you a frightening height above the ground.  Your fear soon dissipated though as you started to get used to what felt like flying to you.  For some reason you seemed to fly where you wanted to fly as well and that was when you realized the snow leopard was at least a little telepathic as well.  He had to be to know where and how you wanted to fly.  It was an amazing experience that made you feel incredibly free even though you knew that you were under the snow leopards power and that the both of you were being hunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that you like that, but let me show you what else I have been working on,\u201d the leopard said as he flew you in front of that miles long head of his.  You see his hand paws on either side of you and you wonder what he is doing.  Then the hand paws rush at you and you scream in fear as you think he is about to swat you like a fly.  You think you might have been wrong to trust the feline until the pads on his paws actually hit you.  Not only were you not dead, you were not even in any pain.  The paws parted and you saw the leopard just smiling at you.  \u201cThat is one I have really been working hard on.  I think I might actually be able to walk among humans with crushing them if I step on them now.  Now all I have to worry about is handling an attack on me without getting me or anyone else killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was amazing.  You knew he swatted you with full force.  Countless tons of flesh and bone had come together all around you and not a single head on your head had been harmed.  It was also a relief to learn that the leopard really was trying to learn how to live among humans without harming them.  The leopard was not through playing either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid on his back and flew you directly above his mouth.  Then he opened it to reveal a truly frightening sight.  His maw was huge and his fangs looked like they were larger than mountains.  When he sucked in a breath of air you could feel the air pulling at your body and if it were not for the leopard\u2019s powers you could easily imagine yourself getting sucked into the dark abyss that was his mouth.  Then you felt the snow leopard\u2019s power let you go and you found yourself falling into his mouth.  This time you figured that if he wanted you dead he could have done it earlier, so you trusted him keep you safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard pursed his lips and then blew gently.  At least it was gently to him.  To you his warm breath rushed up with enough force to keep you afloat in the air.  The amount of control it took not to blow you away was simply stunning.  You found that you could even move around safely while the leopard was blowing and you wondered how long he could keep this up.  Then you thought about how large he must be and how much air must be in his lungs.  It would take a long time to empty those things.  He might also be assisted by one of his other powers as far as you know.  You really were having fun and you wanted to thank the leopard for the amazing experience but you did not even know his name.  \u201cHey buddy, I want to thank you, but your name seems to have slipped my memory,\u201d you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the leopard tells you\u2026</span></div></div>",

You heard him purr and repeat, \"my name is Miles,\" with his eyes closed until he slowly opened them. Something was wrong with his eyes when he opened them, you saw a glint of a green glow for the few moments they opened until they were open completely. You thought it must have just been the shine from the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he showed you his affection for his new name Miles leaned back against a mountain with a completely content look on his face as you both stared at the sun which was almost at the horizon, night was coming.

There wasn't a town for several hundred miles. You were both in the middle of nowhere with nothing but each other. You could have worried about what may come tomorrow, but today was more important even though it would end soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the sun had gone down and the temperature dropped you both could see the moon. It was a blue crescent. You were in the short line of hair between Mile's eyes, even though it was nowhere near short to you as you still couldn't see either pupil. You yawned, not because you were tired but it was a long day. \"Mile's can you set me down on your hand. I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure bud,\" he slid you off his muzzle onto the back of his hand, directly into your small camp. You pulled out your bag and found a case with sandwiches you must have made for the trip. You ate the sandwich as you watched Mile's face through the furry jungle. He seemed calmer then this morning, like a weight was lifted off his shoulders and replaced with helping hands. 'How could a little guy like me feel so big' you thought. There was something there, you could feel it, something you forgot but it's not lost. You wanted to remember it badly, but you couldn't<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down to you smiling, \"It's pretty late and I don't sense any danger out there. Do you want to turn in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your right, I should get some sleep. We need to get farther North before we do though, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right bud, hold on.\" He carefully shifted and crawled across the ground without disturbing a single spot of land. He reached a few miles North before stopping and laying back against another mountain range. Again the journey seemed like a large scale exodus, but it must have been like a short baby crawl to him. \"Good night little buddy,\" he said before placing his arms behind his head and closing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Night, Miles,\" you saw him smirk again. You walked over to a sleeping bag you laid out and tucked yourself inside. But before you could fall asleep completely you noticed something strange. Miles's fur flickered oddly. You could tell he was already asleep by his silent breaths and his lowered eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his fur flicked and morphed it seemed to lose its color. As it lost its color you remember he did this before when he crawled a distance away from where you first were. His camouflage was turning on. His fur started to blend in with his surroundings to the point that you could no longer see his face. Instead you saw the moon behind him and a faint outline of his body that you only saw if you squinted. It made you feel like you were sleeping in the sky. All you did was smile and drift to sleep.</span></div></div>",

You scratch your head and yawn as you pick up an alarm clock from your bag. It was about three hour before dawn. You put it back in and wanted to go back to sleep until you noticed something, an odd sort of mumbled song. It was soft and soothing, \"la lalala la...la laah.\" It was familiar and coming from high above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you looked for the source you noticed that Miles's hair wasn't transparent anymore. And the song was coming from him. He was wide awake and lightly tapping against the mountain side with his other hand. The hand you were on was on his chest. He closed his eyes while singing and then looked down to you and stopped suddenly, \"oh...sorry little buddy. Did I wake you. I'll stop singing if I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's alright. It's a really nice song, it sounds so familiar too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, it was the song you hummed to me while you were helping me the first time we met. You told me it was from a song you heard on the radio that you couldn't remember the words to. Before you hummed it to me I didn't even know what a song was. But, it was beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, I did sing that now that I think about it...wait a minute I thought you were asleep that night. That's embarrassing that you remember that. It's not a bad thing, but still I feel awkward thinking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha! That's the same thing you said the day I told you I remembered the song. You said 'I can't believe you remembered that'...\" he suddenly went quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you know...that might have been the first time I ever laughed...maybe even the first time I ever smiled. Buddy, thank you for showing me how to smile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt his joy wake you up from your drowsy state. You stretched and pulled yourself halfway out of your sleeping bag, wide awake. \"You know, I feel like we've known each other longer then the past week we've been together.

The man in charge of the lab was a man with one eye and red hair that was graying. His hair already looked like it was turning gray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and let out a grunt as he held up his cane. \"Oh my gosh\" you say. \"Are you alright?\" The man gets up and gives a look of surprise to see you that quickly turns into a look you don't trust. \"Excuse me, he said. \"Have you seen anything unusual.\" You look to see the lab was filled with all sorts of beakers and chemicals that stunk to high heaven. \"You mean other than a lab explosion Mr....\" \"Curry,\" said the man. \"Dr. Curry. What I'm talking about is a creature like no other.\" \"Creature?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Curry shows you a photograph of a strange creature resembling a white lioness with what appears to be a pair of wings growing out of her back that gave a glint like pure gold. \"What on Earth is that?\" you ask. Dr. Curry lets out a sigh. \"Leonida. A dangerous beast that would destroy the very world if left to her own devices. My staff and I were charged with containing her.\" \"Oh my.\" Curry nods his head. \"But she can't have gotten far. She's exactly fifty miles tall.\" \"Fifty miles!\" Suddenly Curry stops you. You both hear vibrations. Curry and you both take the last surviving vehicle, a jeep and drive up the side of a mountain and you see Leonida and can't believe your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeonida was a hourglass shaped giantess in a tight green unitard that showed off her curves nicely and had long silvery mane like hair. You let out a gasp and Curry tries to silence you with his hand. \"Don't alert the beast,\" he says. \"She'll look for any excuse to devour you.\" But at this point, Leonida's ear twitched and she turned to see you both, but didn't react until she saw Curry. She gave a look of despair and roared loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back!\" Leonida yells. \"Don't come another step closer!\" You crouch and expect Leonida to attack but instead she folds her wings in a vain attempt to hide. To your surprise she was quaking. This lioness big enough to smash an entire city beneath her foot was stepping away backwards. Something was wrong. Leonida didn't act like a creature of mass destruction. In fact, she was acting as if she was scared. What was going on? \"Don't fall for her tricks boy,\" says Dr. Curry. \"Leonida is very tricky. You lower your guard and she'll squash you like the insect you are to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something blows into your face, it appeared to be paper work, a file, a file on Leonida. \"What's this?\" you ask. You read the file to see a photograph of a young woman in her twenties, resembling Leonida. She looked afraid and was wearing a suit just like Leonida. Not only that there appeared to be a blueprint that stated \"Operation Wild One. You then saw a photograph of Leonida but she was smaller than she is now, being the size of a small house and then see photographs of her getting bigger and her wings growing in. Then you realize something. Dr. Curry wasn't trying to contain Leonida, he was the one who mutated her into what she was. He turned an innocent woman into a giant mutate. \"You bastard!\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to Curry but then he pushes you down. \"Infidel!\" he yelled. \"Leonida is the first of a race of neo-sapiens that will make armies obsolete.\" \"If anyone found out what you were doing, they'd take you apart\" you say. \"On second thought, I'll save them the trouble.\" Curry then clicks a gun and points it at you and makes you step back. \"I could just as easily turn you into a second mutate. Stay out of my way.\" At this point Leonida has gotten on all fours and was running off as Curry pointed his gun at her. \"You can flee if you want to lioness,\" he said with an evil look. \"But this tranquilizer can take out even take out someone as big as you. Say goodnight beast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the doctor was about to shoot the lioness, you see two weapons on the ground, one a taser and the other a tranquilizer gun. Either one will give that jerk what was coming to him, but which do you choose.</span></div></div>",

However, you hear some sort of voice calling for you, and you recognize it as your father's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise, my son, today is your special day!'  You flop out of bed and get dressed in the clothes by your bed, but you are confused.  \"Dad, my birthday was three months ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, son, I'm talking about your knighthood!\"  Suddenly snapping back to reality after hearing this odd statement coming from your father, you rub your bleary eyes and look around the room.  You look like you're in some sort of room in a large, stony castle, yet you must be home if your dad is here.  Perhaps he called for some redecorating, since he obviously changed your wardrobe.  You realize that you are putting on a highly decorative vest and odd fluffy pants.  You feel like you are in the Middle Ages, and wonder if you are going to a Renaissance fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even time to eat, your father, dressed in fancy clothes as well, ushers you through a long system of hallways and stairwells.  \"So, Dad, about this knighthood thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, you must be thrilled!\" exclaimed Dad as you both climbed a tall spiral staircase.  King Levice told me himself how proud he was of your accomplishments as a paige!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King ... Levice?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, King Levice, the Great.  He's been our king for 9,000 years, you know.  You learned all about his accomplishments in school, like how he unified most of the nations of Earth in one day, how he won the Battle of the West in a record seventeen seconds, and how he is still greatly respectful of his people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know what is going on, but this Levice guy sounds too good to be true.  You decide that you should ask this guy what is going on as soon as you meet him in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, your father opens a door to the courtyard, where several armored men are kneeling in respect.  Your father gestures you to walk through the row of knights, and you do, though you do not see anyone that looks like royalty.  When you get to the end, you start to kneel, too, but something suddenly stops you.  A great and powerful voice from above ushers a command, \"No, new knight, I wish for you to rise and face me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are confused as to who said that, but there is no doubt in your mind that it must be Levice.  You turn your head all over, but do not see anyone that could be him.  You hear a deep, rumbling laughter followed by the words, \"I enjoy your humor very much, but now is a special time.  Look upward, new knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look upward towards a tall tower, strikingly black against the pure white sky.  \"Look higher, knight!\" says the voice once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally look straight upward, and suddenly soil your fluffy pants, as you see a huge iris and pupil in the sky.  As it blinks once, you see two huge brown leathery lids temporarily darken the sky.  You consider running, but you stay still as the eye grows smaller and a head becomes visible, that of a truly enormous brown dragon.  You see tall spires rise many miles over the castle before realizing that they are fingers.  You are completely in shock when you realize that this means that this dragon must be carrying the whole castle, or even a whole country, in the small of his palm.  You see an enormous, shiny artifact, a sword, gripped in the dragon's other hand, the tip of which is descending at an alarming rate towards the castle!  You crouch in defense, but amazingly only feel the cold tip of the blade lightly touch each of your shoulders.  You look up to see what has happened, and only see the face of the dragon smiling from ear to ear.  \"Congratulations, new knight, and may you have many years of success serving I, your king.  Now, everyone, let us off to breakfast.  New knight, you may have the seat of honor next to your king.\"  You try to soak your knighthood in as two massive brown fingers tipped with tan-colored claws start to close in on you...</span></div></div>",

Pretty soon, you can see the Earth's surface itself, and it is strangely desolate, with many small dots of green and blue separated by vast expanses of bare rock.  Obviously, this is so Levice can traverse his kingdom without crushing any of his subjects, but it still seems depressing to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you are placed on a soft brown surface, and based on the gargantuan eyes that are staring at you, the spot that Levice decided to take you to was the bridge of his muzzle.  Levice then dipped his mighty fingers into another landmark, and procured a variety of fruits, which he laid in front of you.  \"Eat well, new knight, you have deserved it,\" spoke the king, the sounds rumbling beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as you are told, more because you are afraid to disobey this continent-sized dragon that you are hungry.  As you eat, you watch in amazement as Levice slowly places the land he was holding back on the ground.  \"So, new knight, while you are here, is there anything you'd like to ask your king?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a ton of questions about Levice, but you think it might be more important to know exactly what you're getting into with this knight business.  \"Well, King Levice, I can't help but wonder why a powerful huge dragon like you needs knights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While it may be true that my size has definitely proved useful in the past, I'm afraid that there's not much I can do now against our enemies,\" replies the king.  \"They are becoming smarter; they blend in with my loyal subjects and take control from within my territories.  Though they surely will not challenge me, I also cannot slay them without harming millions of my own people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, you need human knights because they can defeat enemies individually, while you are more suited to defeating entire armies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.  But enough about war strategy, now should be a time of celebration for you!  You're a knight now, and that is a great achievement!  After breakfast, I was thinking that you could show me some of your excellent skills I have heard so much about!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, not realizing that you had any skills suitable for a knight.  Especially when Levice tells you that he is especially interested in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cI would be extremely interested in seeing your mastery of the sword.  It has been said that you are the finest swordsman of your generation,\u201d said Levice.  You could barely keep your jaw from dropping in surprise.  One of the only things you knew about swords was that the pointy end goes in the other guy.  And you could not just be good with a sword here; you had to be \u201cthe finest swordsman of your generation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated to think about what would happen to you if you disappointed this dragon king.  He had destroyed much of the surrounding countryside just by walking around and pretty much isolated the various human communities.  You hated to think about what he could do to a person on purpose when he was angry.  If you showed that you were not any good with a sword he might think that you are a fake that had done something to his real knight and he seemed like he really cared about his people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to think of a way to get good with a sword extremely quickly.  Then you thought about how ridiculous that notion was.  There was no way you were going to get good with a sword between now and the end of breakfast.  Maybe you could say that you were felling a little sick after eating breakfast.  That might not work out too well either after you think about how societies in the Middle Ages worked.  The cook might get blamed for poisoning you and then things would not work out too well for that cook.  As much as you want out of this situation you do not want to get anyone else in trouble either.  You were just going to have to hope for the best when you performed inadequately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the jovial feel in the air that went along with breakfast you were too nervous to eat much.  Pretty much all you could do was observe the day\u2019s activities.  Your father was busy congratulating you most of the time and you received quite a bit of attention from the opposite gender.  Even King Levice joined in on the celebration as best he could.  He was probably the reason the celebration was being held outside.  It was surprising that he was able to converse with his subjects so easily at his size.  You would think that something as large as that dragon would not be able to see or hear a human.  You thought he might be a magical or something like that.  Levice would occasionally dip his massive head down so close to the ground that people would hand feed him treats like fruits and meats which he would kindly thank people for doing and he once again left you surprised that he could even taste those foods.  That also made you wonder how much it took to feed a dragon that was of god like proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe celebration stretched breakfast out, but it still came to and end too soon for you.  Everyone, including Levice, was urging you to demonstrate your skill and you were forced to comply.  You walked out to the demonstration grounds that had been set up during breakfast hesitantly.  \u201cThere is no need to be humble knight, show me what you are capable of,\u201d Levice called down from above.  At least he had mistaken your fear for humility.  Maybe he would accept that as an excuse for your poor swordsmanship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There you were, standing in the middle of the grounds, sword in hand, hundreds of eyes on you, one pair incredibly large and excited. You sigh as you raise your sword and grip it with both hands. You feel very nervous about what may happen after you fail to impress everyone, but the time for that isn't now. You look at the crowd, then at Levice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here goes nothing.\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin with simple strokes, swinging your sword around in the air. For some reason, it's as if your mind already knows the basic technique of swinging a sword around at a subconscious level. As you continue through the list in your head, you are a bit stunned at what you were doing. You began doing more complex strokes in the air, even spinning the sword around in your hands a few times. You can hear the cheers of the crowd, calling out your name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful, new knight. You are quite talented, as some of the others have told me. But perhaps you need a partner to fully show your skills. Ashe, one of my most trusted knights shall assist you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne person walked up to you, wearing armor with a sword sheathed at the side. You look in surprise to see Ashe a woman! In fact, she seems to be a couple years older than you. She seemed a couple inches taller, and had shoulder-length reddish-pink hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, new knight. I am Ashe, captain of King Levice's personal guard knights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Joshua.\" you say. You honestly didn't expect her to be the captain of Levice's personal guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let us not keep our liege waiting. Show me your skill, new knight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brandishes her sword, holding it up in front of her. You almost immediately know what to do next. You lightly tap the side of her sword with yours, a swordsman's greeting. Then, she takes a step back, and you do the same. The two of you circle around each other, sizing each other up. You're sure that she must be an experienced fighter to be one of the dragon's most trusted knights. Ashe, staring at you in the eyes, takes her chance and attacks. You parry her attack with your own, and you launch your counterattack. She blocks it and strikes again. The two of you go at it for a while, the crowd cheering for you both as Levice watches the show with delight. If you were surprised with how good you turned out to be, then you're stunned with how well Ashe can maneuver between your techniques, dodging, blocking, and counterattacking with every chance she gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are as good as they say you are.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you do still need training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshe swings her sword in an upwards motion, and you bring your sword down to block it. But the force of her attack actually knocks the sword out of your hands, and it lands a few feet away from you. You look to your sword, then back at Ashe, who by now it pointing the tip of her sword right at your face. You gulp, unsure of what will happen to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will be enough Ashe.\" Levice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshe sheathes her sword and bows to you. You return the bow as Ashe returns to the crowd. You move to the sword, picking it up from the ground. You look at Levice, who smiles warmly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have shown remarkable skill, knight. Truly, you are the best of your generation. In fact, I remember clearly that most of the newly knighted could only last but a few minutes when Ashe is to spar with them. I hope that you will become as strong and as loyal as my other knights. You have quite a bit of potential, quite a bit indeed. I now dub thee, Joshua, knight 1st class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers once more as you raise your sword. You were feeling pretty happy right now, getting complemented by the brown-scaled king. When everything has been said and done, you walk down the halls of the castle, heading to your room. You'll be receiving your own personal sword and armor tomorrow when training starts. But for now, you just wanna head back to your room to rest from that match with Ashe. Speaking of Ashe, when you make the turn around the corner that leads to the hall with your room, you see Ashe standing there, waiting outside your door. She notices you and approaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Joshua. Not many paiges are immediately given the title of 1st class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you Ashe. I'm actually a bit, eh, surprised myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, understandable. The lowest class a knight is given is 3rd, and they make up the majority of King Levice's army. 2nd class knights are elite, and they watch over the 3rds to make sure they haven't made any mistakes during the tasks they are given. They are also the ones who give out the tasks to be done by the 3rds and paiges. 1st class is the highest, and only the greatest knights, or those with potential thereof, attain this. They can answer to Levice himself, and they are more commonly known as his personal guards. This is usually because any tasks given to us come from the king himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head, taking in all the information as best you can. Yet, you can't help but ask one question. \"I see, but why do you tell me all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it seemed to me that you didn't fully understand the position given to you. So, I brought it upon myself to inform you. Unless, of course, you already knew all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, ah, didn't mean it like that. Thank you for telling me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Oh, and a squire will be assigned to you tomorrow, as well as your equipment. Don't be late for training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks away, with you thinking about what she just said. You get to have your own squire? You actually feel a bit excited about this. You head into your room, resting your body on top of your bed. You just stare at the ceiling, thinking about how you life somehow changed overnight. You still have tons of questions, but for now, maybe a little nap will be best.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As it turned out, your nap had indeed done wonders for you. The initial shock and confusion of the day weren't quite <i>gone</i>, but the brief rest had fashioned them into a new determination: a drive that, incidentally, befit your new status as a knight of the realm:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were going to find out just <i>what the HECK was going on.</i> And you were going straight to the top...to Levice himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothing out some wrinkles in your clothes, you make your way down the castle's hall; your footfalls echo as they come down on the stone. You mumble thanks to a few passing staff and guards as they congratulate you, then stop as you come to a set of wooden double-doors. You take a deep breath, steeling yourself. Your idea on confronting Levice was brazen and probably a little stupid, but you couldn't bring yourself to just go along with this world turned upside-down. You <i>had</i> to know what was behind this; there were so many things that didn't add up: having no memory of Levice or his rule, the inexplicable skill with a sword, why everyone else acted like nothing was strange...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDetermined, you push the heavy doors open and walk out onto the courtyard. Groundskeepers clear away seating and patch up any damage to the grass as crowds of people of every age and class mill about, chattering. Most of the talk seemed to be about you and your new knighthood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, high above it all, there was Levice. Or rather, his head, partially hidden by clouds as he thundered on. Squinting, you see his lips moving and his eyes focused inward toward his muzzle--he must have been talking with someone, then. Well, as rude as it was to interrupt royalty...you weren't going to just give up now. Readying your nerve one last time, you cup your hands over your mouth and call up to the dragon king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Your Highness! I have to speak with you, it's...important! Very important!!\"</i> A few people stop and watch you. From their expressions, shouting up at Levice and all but demanding his attention isn't something knights do often. You catch a few whispers that sound like <i>\"no respect\"</i>, but otherwise you're left alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice's eyes flick to you and you flinch. Even with your determination and the colossal dragon's kind attitude, the difference in power is immense. Your father had said Levice had united---or perhaps <i>conquered</i>--much of the world in a single day; that he had ruled for nine thousand years. You were dealing with something that bordered on godlike...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshua! Are you well?\" Levice's voice snaps you out of your reverie. Now attentive, you see that he turned his head fully to speak with you, and a look of concern across his scaly, mountain-sized face. \"You called out to me, but just stood there silent afterwards. Is something wrong, young knight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, idly wondering how he even heard you. \"I-I'm well...King Levice. I have to ask you some....important questions, about...well, <i>everything</i>.\" An edge came into your voice, \"I need to speak with you as soon as possible.\" You ignored the brief whispers from passerby. Nobody stopped this time, but it didn't matter to you. To heck with knightly tradition, you wanted answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a wonder, Levice actually chuckles; the sound makes the ground shake. \"I'd prefer a touch more deference, but I'm always pleased when my subjects can be direct with me. I'll oblige, Joshua.\" Once again, Levice reaches down with his massive, sky-filling free hand and gently plucks you off the ground. Smiling at you, he gently sets you down on his snout...and you notice Ashe already there, rolling up what looks like a map along with other sheets of paper and slipping them into a messenger bag. She looks rather surprised at your arrival, glancing between you and Levice for a moment. \"Ashe, your proposal is interesting, and I'll give it consideration. We'll discuss this later, but for now you must return to your normal duties.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshe salutes, clenched fist over her heart. \"Thank you, My King. It is all I could ask for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice gives a quick nod--the tilting \"ground\" making you lose your balance--before he pinches Ashe off his nose and sets her back down in the tiny kingdom in his hand. Then he turns his gaze to you. \"Now then, you said you had 'urgent questions' for me, Joshua? What's troubling you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo turning back now...it was time to get some answers about all this. Why you didn't remember any of this world, where Levice had come from; everything. The only question was how to make your case....</span></div></div>",

Some part of you wants to all-out rant at Levice and <i>demand</i> answers, but you know that would just make things worse. Badmouthing the king was a dumb thing to do as a knight, more so when he was a dragon the size of a continent who could carry an entire country in his palm. Levice didn't seem to be a dragon of the \"eats people who make him angry\" sort, but you didn't want to test his patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking Levice straight in his eyes...that easily dwarf your entire body...you salute as Ashe did, clenched fist over your heart. \"My King, what's troubling me is...everything, since I woke up this morning. I'll be honest with you: before today, I have no memory of you or your rule--in fact, I'd regarded dragons as fictional creatures.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice quirks an eyebrow at that, but stays quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened, you continue \"I'd never wielded a sword before, either. Barely even touched anything bigger or more deadly than a steak knife. When I was even halfway competent with a blade, I could hardly believe it! And...even that I would use a <i>sword</i> was a shock. Everything here is practically medieval; knights, swordsmanship, the clothes...I remember it as something out of a museum, not what I'd see every day!\" You clasp your hands behind your back and begin pacing up and down his snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice's manner remains impassive as you pace, the words still spilling forth. \"I'm honored to be your knight, King Levice. I truly am...but all this; something isn't right here! Perhaps it's with <i>me</i>; maybe this is just memory loss and I'm rambling, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joshua. Be still, young knight!\" Levice rumbles. His tone carries power and authority, and you instantly clamp your mouth closed and stop your pacing. But his words are also free of anger, or even annoyance. The titanic drake almost sounds...concerned. \"You were right to bring this to my attention, young knight. I noticed your distress and confusion this morning--you went pale when asked to demonstrate your swordsmanship; when you showed your own skill, you looked absurdly surprised. I spoke with your father during the festivities, and he told me that you barely remembered anything. He chalked it up to a lack of sleep, but when you finally saw me, you looked utterly terrified. Though you seemed well otherwise...I knew something was distressing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope and relief swell up within you. \"So...you suspected something?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've ruled for thousands of years, dear boy. Even at my size, you don't stay king that long without learning to spot trouble.\" You can't see much of Levice's face, but the smirk is clear on his voice. It only lasts a moment, though, and he's serious once more. \"But to the real matter: you say you may have simply lost your memory somehow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and slowly start pacing again, though not as frantic as before. \"Yes, King Levice...but even if that's all there is, it doesn't explain my skills with a sword,or why nothing <i>triggered</i> my supposedly 'lost' memories in the first place. <i>Or</i> why I remember the world being so different than this.\" You grunt in frustration, \"It's almost like the entire world just changed overnight; like history was re-written...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice's snout shakes beneath you as the dragon king grumbles deep in his throat. He looks puzzled, almost confused. \"Hmmmm....this is most odd, my young knight. Troubling, even....I do not think this is merely your mind being addled. I have memories of <i>you</i>, as an eager recruit to my knights, always wanting to speak with me when I came by.\" He snorts, shooting brief gouts of smoke from his nostrils. \"Rest assured, I will look into this. Both myself, and through my scholars and advisors. We <i>will</i> find answers for you eventually, Joshua. You have your King's word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart soars. Levice understood! You were worried your concerns would be blown off or even land you in trouble, but he was just as worried about this as you were! You had an ally in all this, and he was--literally--the biggest help around! \"Thank you, King Levice! You don't know how much this relieves me!\" You stand at attention and clap a fist over your heart in salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice chuckles. \"You are welcome, young knight.

Instead, of all the things you could've started off with, your mind only links back to Ashe, and whatever it was the two of them were talking about. \"What were you and, uh... Ashe doing before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice smiles, but looks more excited then his default kind and noble face. \"A thread to sew back many of the divided nations of this world, young knight. A path to finally bring the earth back to its green and blue beauty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nations?\" You say, immediately interested. You look back out at the endless plains of stone and gray that Levice walks upon, the land devoid of any trees of life for there to even be a <i>state </i>made out of, let alone a whole empire. \"You mean there's still people out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLevice's mouth lowers back down in a frown, his eyes turning somber as they turn back to the ground. \"None left for the world below to let live, my boy. What little remains could only exist in the skies of the other gods, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah...what? \"Did you say...<i>other</i> gods? There's <i>more</i> dragons?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face grows confused, then concerned, stepping back into the case of your supposed amnesia, then he tries to force up a smile. \"A few, as far as I'd seen, but I'd seen many gryphon, pegasus, and a few manticores, just too name a few.\" He explains. \"But yes, if it interests you, I'd been discussing with her to be the main ambassador of this project to commune with another god-bound city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...wow.\" Is all you can say. You're body'd been numbed long ago to shock, so the impact just bounces right off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, as your first duty as a knight, would you be interested in joining her?\" He asks. \"It might do you wonders for your new title?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mouth opens up, but then you get a hold of yourself, letting your brain turn his words over a few times. \"Well...I'll think about it, but what would exactly would I be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing you don't already know about.\" He chuckles, but his face freezes as he realizes what he'd just said, and he clears his throat. \"...As in you'd be accompanying to meet another dragon. You'd help Ashe discuss trade agreements and the like, the usual written work, but you'd also just be making friends and leaving a nice impression to let the rest of their subjects want to know of us more.

The whole building seems to be something of a castle design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just have time for some breakfast.\" Your wife tells you as she leads you into a dining hall where a hearty spread has been laid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you have breakfast you ask your wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me again, my dear, what is it that her majesty has requested my services for?\" Your wife looks up at you and seems to let the question sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't unusual for people to forget in the excitement.\" She comments. \"She's been so impressed by your loyalty and diligence that she has decided to make you a Knight of the Tiara!\" This sounds impressive; in your old universe the Knight of the Garter was a most esteemed position so you wouldn't be surprised if the Knight of the Tiara was at least an equal position in this universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast there is a heralding of trumpets and a figure dressed in what could only be full regalia enters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord,\" He addressed you, \"The Queen awaits your presence.\" You nod, excuse your wife and follow the man out to a truly splendid coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suprised by the journey; the horses were taking their time when you consider how urgent everyone had sounded and there was nothing to see but castles, manors and other high class buildings as far as the eye could see. You'd expect the royal palace to be grander than all of this.</span></div></div>",

Her extremely-highness has shown such consideration to her subjects that she made clear instructions for a no-build zone around her palace lest she accidentally destroy any buildings.\" You let this sink in; you're beginning to understand that her highness must either be very strong or very big, though at this stage you can't know how big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carriage passes through an impressive gateway and out into open country. It travels through fields and forests, up and down hills and across rivers and streams. You're stunned by just how far you have to go to reach the Royal Palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you round a steep hill you suddenly see an amazing sight. There before you is the Royal Palace. It is absolutely grand! From the distance it looks like a city all in itself where the royal family, their servants and the most privalaged peerages could live. It'd probably take all day to get from one side to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you close in you realise it's even bigger than you first assumed. The windows must be over one-hundred feet tall and the whole structure seems to have been built into the mountain range itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It never seizes to amaze me either.\" Your escort comments. \"And I must've worked at her majesty's palace for at least four years.\" You know that the awe of the sight can't be hidden from your face so you accept your escort's comment and continue to watch the palace loom higher and higher as the carriage gets nearer and nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you feel the carriage slow as you see some quite impressive gates come into view. They seem to be quite small compared to the wall they're in; thirty foot high gates in a four hundred foot high wall. When the horses drawing your carriage stop a palace guard approaches; he does not have such regalia as your escort but his uniform is still a smart piece of tailory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening, sir!\" He greets you followed by a nod at your escort. \"You are expected.\" With that he signals the other guards and the gates open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon passing through the gates another awe-inspiring sight comes to you. The palace grounds not only stretch for squares of hectares but some of the plants seem to be significantly bigger than expected, though they are still small compared to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a long ride through the vast palace grounds before the palace itself comes into view. You can hardly comprehend its scale; the steps leading to the entrance are each the height of the wall! The horses do not slow at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head for the stairs you are surprised to see a set of double doors just under the height of the gate set into the stone of the lowest stair. They open to let the carriage through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you take in the corridor that the carriage is travelling through; it is a most impressive piece illuminated by what seem to be gas lamps and has an architecture more closely associated with the Georgians. The horses begin to slow.</span></div></div>",

A couple of palace guards approach your coach and open the door; you and your escort step out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA figure wearing colourful robes descends the staircase and greets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone is getting ready for the ceremony.\" He informs you with a posh accent; either it's expected of him or he's from a posh family. He leads both you and your escort up the stairs towards a classical set of double doors, blazened with what must either be gold or brass and the woodwork painted bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room on the other side of these doors is impressive in itself; a grand hall that's second to none, furnished plentifully with portraits and tapestries hung on the walls and what looks like a persian carpet on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please remove your shoes.\" The doorman instructs you; while your escort does so like it's nothing too special you remove yours reverently, not wanting to soil the stately setting. The doorman produces a pair of decorated slippers that are not only comfortable but also your exact size. \"Please wait and make yourselves comfortable.\" The doorman continues as he shuts the double doors and then goes up the grand staircase leading up and out of the grand hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your escort and yourself are the only ones in the hall you begin to look around, being curteous enough to take your time and not to touch the extravagent items in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, do sit down.\" Your escort comments. \"Her majesty doesn't order such exquisite furniture for no reason.\" You smile nervously and take a seat on the sofa where you can look straight at your escort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a knight of the Tiara yourself?\" You ask him; he looks at you with a surprised expression before replying sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good lord, no. A knight of the Tiara never escorts a member-to-be. I am the Queen's page first class member seven. You know it's customary for a person who's to be a member of such a high order to be escorted by a first class royal page; on top of that a first class page must also read the induction speech.\" You seem more than surprised. This man is one of the Queen's highest ranking pages and he also has to make a speech during the ceremony. Looking up from your seat you suddenly notice something that should have been obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bay window opposite the double doors has green curtains closed over it; it's not too surprising to find the curtains closed, there could be any number of reasons for that. It's no surprise that a soft light is passing through them; you figure they must overlook something of the palace grounds. What is surprising is that these curtains are on the <i>outside</i>!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, sirs.\" A voice suddenly addresses you, you turn your head to see a maid had arrived. \"Can I get you anything?\" She offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" The page replies, \"I'll have a port. And for you?\" You think about this; you're not entirely sure what drinks are available in this world aside from alcoholic drinks. You decide that it might be honourable to show some humility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll just have a glass of water, thank you.\" You answer; the maid curtsies and walks down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems to be just over an hour, eight glasses of water and one trip to the bathroom, two footmen come down the grand staircase and ask you to follow them. As you follow them back up the staircase the page follows you.</span></div></div>",

There's a large rickshaw-like object in it, set on rails with two bicycle seats at the front with a more comfortable seat behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be seated.\" One of the footmen invites you into this unusual contraption; you hesitantly get in first while the page enters next before the two men take their positions on the 'cycle seats. The other footman mutters something to them and, before you could say Eddy Merckx, they started pedalling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device moves forward slowly at first but soon picks up speed; the journey in this thing is surprisingly smooth and fast when you consider that only two cyclists are being used to propel it along. Windows on either side of the long tunnel it travels down let in light but pass by too quickly to see out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the cyclists slow to a stop at what looks like a platform. Two more footmen come down to greet you as you and the page exit the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will they be alright?\" You ask the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" He answers, \"They usually swap with another pair after transporting somebody.\" This gives you satisfaction as the footmen guide you to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou travel through more laviously decorated corridors before the footmen lead you into what looks like a cloakroom. The page nudges you and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change into some shoes.\" You get the idea and seek out your size from amongst the wide selection available; in fact there's such a selection that you even get to choose a design you like. These shoes are clearly not for typical outdoor walking as they are too soft-soled and delicately patterned. A footman takes the slippers you were wearing and carries them off, most likely to store them somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room after this is yet another hall; it's darker and smaller than the first with a flat window filling most of one wall, again with the curtains closed on the outside. You theorise that it must be deeper inside the palace. After a while waiting in this simpler room another footman enters and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're ready for you now.\" Just as you stand up the page whispers into your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to remind you, you follow the footman while I go up the stairs.\" You thank him for his helpful words and commence to do so. You watch as the footman walks straight ahead as you leave the doorway and up a winding staircase while you turn down the tiled corridor following the footman until you both come to another pair of double doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can go no further.\" The footman tells you. \"But I will open the doors. I am told it is usual to remind sir that you are to walk to the end of the platform and kneel. Her majesty will guide you from there.\" You are surprised by this. Her majesty sounds like a very generous and considerate lady but you think that unless she made each instruction formal that it would sound very odd to anyone else present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footman opens the doors and you step through. The sight is mind-blowing. On one side is what looks like an extra large theatre box with well-dressed people in it, on the other side you see the page on a balcony; the theatre box is lower than the platform you're standing on while the balcony is higher. You walk slowly and reverently forward along the tiled plateau until you find yourself standing just behind a white circle that's practically on the edge; you kneel with one knee on this circle while you keep your other knee suspended above the floor and keep your eyes on the ledge, remembering the basic rule not to make eye-contact with the monarch on first encounter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a series of rhythmic earthquakes runs through the area; you resist the urge to look up as best you can but your eyes can't help but be drawn upwards where you see an astonishing sight. A massive silhouette is approaching you; every step it takes coincides with an earthquake. This figure has an unusual look to it; it's got a human figure but also has an animal figure. You bring your eyes back to the ledge for fear of what you'll see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a shadow descends on you; an area of colour has turned up where you're looking, confusing you further. Then you hear a grand yet angelic voice address you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look to me, honourable one.\" That must be the Queen's voice; you raise your head and take in what is clearly a massive anthro and as you look higher you notice that the Queen is, in fact, a colossal mountainous anthro...</span></div></div>",

Why the palace is so far from the nearest town, why the palace is so huge, why the steps to the palace are four-hundred feet high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Nathan of Harbingdon,\" The Queen announces, \"By virtue of the power avested in me by the powers-that-be and my own birth, I hereby dub you knight of the Tiara. Arise Nathan, Knight of the Tiara.\" As she named you 'knight of the tiara' you felt something large and smooth on your back. A regular monarch would knight you with a sword, because of her size this queen knighted you with one of her claws. You stand upon her instruction and your eyes follow her mountainous form from her waist all the way up into her enormous eyes. \"Will the page read the induction speech?\" She requests, the page who escorted you produces a parchment and unrolls it. You are unsure as whether to look at her majesty or the page; fortunately she uses her claw to turn you towards the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, Queen Mikayla, members of the Order of the Tiara,\" The page addresses all present, \"Lord Nathan was born on the 19th April 1549, an only child of a humble couple. His father was a member of her majesty's revenue services, employed to find reasons why people hadn't paid tribute to her majesty. His mother was employed in her majesty's employment and trade management services as a secretary to the pensions office. As a boy Nathan expressed great interest in the exploits of her royal majesty, his teachers regularly remarked on his great performance in subjects like history and social studies. When he reached manhood he discovered that his feelings of admiration and loyalty to her majesty were embedded at a very deep level and received high acclaim for his patriotic speeches at school. Once he reached the end of his scholarship he joined her majesty's security forces as a humble archer; he quickly rose through the ranks and became an esteemed swordsman who quelled many rebellions in the far reaches of the Kingdom of Rylio. By the age of 20 her majesty granted him lordship of the town of Harbingdon and awarded him the Royal Ring Medal.\" You look at the medals on your chest and identify the first medal from the middle as being this. \"In the following year Lord Nathan met Samantha, daughter of Lord John of Ebbingdale; they got on well and formed a friendship. This companionship allowed the opening of a new road between the town of Harbingdon and the village of Ebbingdale. At the age of twenty-two Samantha of Ebbingdale asked for Lord Nathan's hand in marriage; both families were in full support but Lord Nathan, being a dedicated officer of her majesty's security forces, could not accept the offer without seeking her majesty's approval...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was most surprised by your request.\" Queen Mikayla comments, you turn to her. \"Most officers in my security forces only approach their CO or the Field Marshall.\" You start to feel guilty and embarrassed. \"It was clear to all of us that you felt that patriotism and loyalty to the queen mattered more than the loyalty of marriage, but your feelings could not be changed. I granted you permission to marry and remain in my service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After the marriage,\" The page continues, \"Lord Nathan was awarded the Loyalty Medal of the Cup.\" That must have been the second one from the centre of your chest. \"Six months after the marriage a major uprising occured closer to the Royal Palace than had ever occured before his his lifetime. When Lord Nathan led a regiment to quell this rebellion the sheer weight of rebels was overwhelming; her majesty was just coming out to deal with the rebels when Lord Nathan drove his regiment into them against the odds. Many rebels were downed but the regiment started to suffer casualties. Seeing two loyal soldiers being cut down and observing the struggle of the rest of his regiment, Lord Nathan ordered them to fall back but did not go with them. He stood his ground and downed several rebels but the odds were againsts him. If her majesty had not intervened when she did there would have been a good chance that he would have fallen in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was such a sight as to take me aback.\" The queen tells you. \"Such loyalty as to sacrifice yourself for the skae of your regiment, your country and yours truly. I personally brought you to the Royal Ward and asked the doctors and nurses to treat you for your wounds. Upon the day you recovered I decided that your actions were worth another medal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Letter Opener Medal.\" The page identifies, obviously the medal closest to your shoulder. \"For one whole year afterwards Lord Nathan maintained a prosperous economy in Harbingdon and led several regiments to clear victories in the far reaches of Rylio and even brought a neighbouring province into the grand kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was your loyalty, diligence and consideration,\" Queen Mikayla explains, \"That made you a most worthy candidate for a knight of the Tiara. Your final steps to your new position came from such high level patriotism and humility.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed by the page recounting your life story, supported by the Queen herself.

The whole palace whizzes by as you're carried by her majesty to parts unknown. You see whole regiments of servants keeping the giant palace in a condition worthy of royalty. After a few minutes you decide to keep your eyes upon her majesty as you consider what must be and what might be regarding her royal lifestyle in relation to her titanic stature; your mind is flooded by questions that you wish to ask her, though some you do not wish to ask on fear of reprimands even if permitted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the Queen enters what must be a dressing room and sets you down upon the dressing table, right between a fur brush the size of a cruise ship and a powder compact the size of a Shakespearean theatre. You look up at Queen Mikayla as she takes a seat in front of you, putting her waist at your eye-level instead of her groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, Lord Nathan,\" She addresses you again, \"I don't usually do this with the newest Knights of the Tiara but you're a curious case.\" This causes you to look up into her house-sized eyes with an expression of bewilderment. \"It was amazing to see that you kept your head down as I approached, every other member kept raising his head slightly as I approached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too surprised by that, your majesty,\" You tell her, \"I don't think anyone can get over your grandeur.\" The Queen smiles sweetly upon hearing this and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true, my size is the source of much awe, respect and, alas, fear. Though I didn't see you move at all until I instructed you to I'm guessing that your eyes couldn't keep from trailing towards me.\" You blush but, inspite of your great size difference, she notices this and smiles again, only more teasingly than previous.

You then look and gasp to see you're missing part of your shoulder. \"What is going on?!\" you yell. You then see a man with dark skin in Egyptian garbs carrying a cobra shaped staff. \"Ah, General Atomos, you're finally awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see your chest is not only well muscled, but covered in all sorts of scars and you're wearing an Egyptian style garb you'd expect on someone really important. \"General?\" You ask. \"Me? What happened.\" The doctor just gives a smile. \"We won the war.\" \"War?! What war? Did something happen that I didn't know about. Ouch!\" You feel your head is throbbing like crazy. You must've sustained a heavy injury. The doctor runs up to you and helps you off the bed you were on and you look around to see you'e in an Egyptian temple. You run out and see nothing but desert sands for miles and the room is decorated with multiple animal totems the size of skyscrapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rest now General,\" said the doctor. \"You took the greatest injuries against the Remulans. \"Remulans?\" you ask. \"Who are the Remulans.\" \"Doctor,\" says a female voice. \"Has the general awakened.\" You turn your head to see a dark skinned girl around your age, with bright blue eyes and markings on her face and shoulders. She was wearing gold scarab shaped earrings and a blue Egyptian dress with the Eye of Horus around her neck. \"Ah,\" said the doctor. \"Princess Nefira. I'm glad to report General Atomos has made a full recovery. Almost.\" \"Princess?\" you ask in confusion. Nefira looks at you in pure concern. \"Oh no,\" she says as she walks up to you and feels your head. \"Amnesia. Mother will need to see him immediately.\" \"Mother?\" you ask in shock. \"You mean the queen.\" \"Of course,\" says Nefira. \"Follow me. Mother wants to congratulate you personally for the victory against the Remulans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefira walks down a long hallway, prompting you to follow behind her. You look to see the hallway is quite high and must go on for miles. \"Uh,\" you say. \"Princess was it? What exactly happened?\" Nefira turns her head and continues to look in concern. \"You really don't remember? It was a terrible battle. Even my mother the queen had to join the war.\" \"Wow? That bad.\" Nefira gives a really frightend look. \"You haven't heard the worst. The Remulans had a weapon that could even take Mother out.\" You're wondering why they would need a specific weapon to take out the queen. She must've been quite powerful. \"Fortunately you stopped them and killed their general before they could use it. For that I thank you. Okay. We're here. The throne room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Princess Nefira walk up to the door and you see that the door appeared to be attached to the center of a much larger door that looked several times the size of a skyscraper. Nefira opens the door and calls out to her mother. \"Mother!\" she yells. \"General Atomos is awake!\" \"Excellent.\" Says another female voice. \"I was beginning to worry about my bravest soldier's well being.\" You look forward and are in total surprise and awe. Queen Terweg wasn't even human. She was a gray skinned hippopotamus anthro with long black hair in a bob cut with a gold tiara with a hawk's head in the center, bearing sapphire eyes. She was wearing an ankh necklace and earrings much like her daughters along with a white regal dress. This hippo queen had red markings around her bright blue eyes and gold and silver bracelets around her arms. But what struck you most about your hippo queen was that she was huge. She was big enough to carry you and her human daughter among others on just one of her finger nails. This hippo had to be at least ten miles tall. </span></div></div>",

Queen Terweg lifts you up to her face big enough to build an entire landscape on. The two of you are soon in front of the queen's monumental snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have done well General,\" says the queen. \"I owe you my life. If it weren't for you, the Remulans would've no doubt ended my life.\" \"Uh,\" you say as you bow. \"Thank you, your highness.\" You smiled as the queen smiled back at you, but those enormous hippo fangs of hers scared you deeply. Nefira gives a look of concern because she sees that her mother's neck is bandaged as well as her legs. That must've been a terrible battle if someone as big as this hippopotamus was injured as well. \"Mother, with all due respect,\" says Nefira. \"I don't think you should've ran in as hastily as that. You're much too big a target.\" The queen just lets out a snort and forces her daughter to hold down her skirt before she strokes her on the head and gives a smile. \"I appreciate your concern Nefira. But I'm pretty sure that I can take on any threat to my kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a grunt and think to yourself. \"Why are you worrying about her? She's as big as a kingdom.\" Then you decide to ask the question you've been thinking about since you woke up. \"Uh, your majesty. Not to seem rude but..\" Queen Terweg looks up to you and brings both you and your daughter to the top of her nose to put you down in front of her moon sized eyes. \"What is it General?\" You gulp and then blurt it out. \"Why are you a giant hippo?\" The queen gives a shocked look and drops her jaw. \"Oh no,\" she says. \"I knew that head injury was worse than anyone thought.\" Nefira even bites her nails and then turns to you before walking across her mother's snout. \"You really don't remember?\" she asks. You shake your head and the princess lets out a sigh and slaps her face. \"In our kingdom, whenever a new queen comes to power, the gods strip her of her humanity.\" \"Strip her of her humanity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Terweg rubs her large stomach and picks up where her daughter left off. \"The queen becomes a bestial titan to protect the kingdom. It is a different beast every time. As you noted, I was transformed into a hippopotamus much like the goddess Taweret.\" You then look to Nefira and see that she's very beautiful for a woman who's mother is a hippopotamus and then give a look of shock. \"So that means.\" The queen nods her head causing you and Nefira to slide down and land in her cleavage. Nefira manages to land on solid ground while you fall into the cleavage canyon forcing her to dive in after you and pull you out as you both rest on the queen's left breast. \"When Nefira comes to power,\" says Queen Terweg. \"She too will become an anthro titan.\" Nefira then walks up to you and whispers into your ear. \"Between you and me,\" she says. \"I really hope I don't become a hippo like my mother.\" Terweg then picks up her daughter and places her in front of her eye as she gives a look of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is wrong with being a hippopotamus?\" \"Oh, oh, nothing mother. Not that you... I mean.\" The queen lets out a laugh and you laugh with her. She was just having a little fun with her tiny daughter. But then she gives a look of concern. \"I'm afraid there is much that the general has to relearn about the kingdom he defends.\" The hippo monarch says.</span></div></div>",

Sitting up in bed you see a man in some sort of uniform standing at the door to your bedroom. However it doesn't look like your bedroom; it seems too high class to be <i>your</i> bedroom. \"I trust sir had a good night.\" You try to find your bearings since you hadn't been awake for five minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so,\" You answer eventually, \"But I did have a strange dream last night.\" There's a flash of concern in the man's eyes before he settles down and says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sir, I'm sure that Jane would be happy to talk to you about anything that's troubling you. After all, no one dares to refuse her what she wishes for.\" You're surprised by this. You remember that Jane is your girlfriend and remember various good times with her but she wasn't special to anyone else except her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and get dressed, the man keeps offering to dress you but you ask him to relax and let you do it yourself. Considering his behaviour you assume that he's either a butler or a footman; it seems to you that you've entered a parallel universe where Jane's family seems to have become very influencial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're dressed another man enters wearing the exact same uniform of the first man you met. \"Miss Jane wishes to know how you're getting on.\" He addresses you, you smile and answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready now. Would she like to see me?\" The men seem to almost smirk and the second man answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's always ready to see you, sir.\" You smile with satisfaction and follow both of them out of the door. You step out onto a balcony overlooking a vast cave that looks big enough to contain the whole of New York City, London, Kyoto and Hong Kong and still have room to spare. It's mind-blowing! The men show you to what looks like a tradtional Rolls-Royce and drive you down the cave on a balcony the size of a city street but with no other cars in sight. You are stunned by the fact that the whole cave is lit when it's big enough to be a whole country on its own.</span></div></div>",

It seems that Jane was no longer the dainty girl you were familiar with, she was a massive, titanic anthropomorphic giant coyote! Her stature was such that you were sure that she was bigger than Mt. Everest. She wore a wonderful dress that you were sure someone could make a lifesize map of Greater London on, her fur was surprisingly fine for a being so big and her eyes were resting right upon you.

You look around the room and notice you're not in you're house, you're in a bedroom atleast twice you're normal ones size and you're sleeping on a four poster bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Clarisse will be most happy to hear that\" he says, \"you have a date with her in an hour please get dressed and I will drive you there\" he says. You sit back confused, you knew you're girlfriend Clarisse had some influence as she showed up for you're first date in a stretch limo but you don't remember her having this much influence. You get up and grab a plain old shirt and pants out of a closet and get dressed. You head downstairs following the man and find a huge spread laid out on a giant table, you sit down and begin eating. \"Sir I must remind you that when you see Ms Clarisse you are to not gawk and be as polite as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, she's my girlfriend after all\" you say. You quickly finish eating a course out of the probable 7 on the table and put a jacket and shoes on, you follow the man who seemed to be some kind of chauffeur/butler outside. You gasp as all you can see is grassland and in the distance a structure so large it made mount everest look like a puny rock, \"ok I am definitley not normally where i'm supposed to be\" you think. The chauffer doesn't even react as he loads you into the car and starts driving directly toward the structure. As you get closer you start recognizing features on it like windows, and a door, \"holy shit it's a giant house\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who lives there the whole state of Nevada?\" you ask the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir that's Miss Clarisse's house, the government was very generous once she reached the 6 mile mark and ended not only the Afghan war but also the one in Iraq\" the driver says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....how'd she do that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the government just told the extremists if they kept it up we'd let her go on them after telling them they hurt you sir\" the chauffer says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, my girlfriend is 6 miles tall?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no sir, that was when she was 15 she's grown another 2 miles in the last 2 years\" the driver says putting the car at full speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great so my girlfriend is 8 miles tall, wow guess parallel universe do exist and i'm in one\" you think to yourself. You keep driving and the driver says \"we're about half way there sir,\" you look outside and all you can see is row upon row of carrots. These carrots weren't normal sized though they were huge, most were bigger than limo you were driving in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow those are some big carrots\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, well the government took some of her DNA and were able to splice it with plants to create the produce you see in front of you, lucky thing too she was almost bankrupting the country on food costs alone\" the driver says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why aren't you suprised that i'm asking questions when she's been my girlfriend for 5 years\" you ask the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that's easily explained sir, you're you from a parallel universe, looks like the scientists did a good job\" the driver says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you mean I was brought here and you know?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, you see the you from this universe was taken out by a sniper before we could move him into Clarisse's abode, she doesn't know about it so collectivley the world has been franticly developing inter-dimensional technology to find another you, we thought other universes were less scary then telling Clarisse you were dead.\" the driver says laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and what about my family, my friends, my life\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, sadly that is all behind you, the machine is one way\" he says as you feel the car stop. \"Do not worry, Ms Clarisse will take very good care of you, besides that I think you'll be in shock from meeting her, I think this universe's you fainted when he first met her. He presses a button on a remote and you hear a buzzer sound and a gate opens and he drives up to a doorstep with a set of steps heading up it. He opens the door and you walk up the steps thinking \"well if I can't go back might as well become what they wish of me, I don't want my girlfriend destroying everything.\" The chauffer presses another button and you hear a doorbell ring although it sounded more like the loudest church bell in existence. The door opens inward and you look up, and up, and up. The driver had neglected to mention one thing that made sense now, you're girlfriend was not only now 8 miles tall but also an anthromorphic bunny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Alex, I was wondering when you'd show up\" she says in a voice that sounded like that of an angel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clarisse\" you reply. She bends down and places a finger on the ground, you walk up and grab onto the fluffy fur, you're quickly lifted up very quickly suprisingly you're not crushed by gs or anything like that even though you guessed you were moving maybe a quarter of the speed of the space shuttle. She lowers her finger to her other palm pad and drops you on before shutting the door. You look as the door shuts and were pretty sure this place could survive getting hit by a good portion of the world's nuclear arms. So should you tell her the truth striaght from the get go or let her believe that you're her \"true\" BF....</span></div></div>",

Most bizarrely is how cool it is; last night you went to bed with a dreadful feeling of clamminess under the oppressive heat that had accumulated during the day. Now you feel quite refreshed, especially with those periodic gusts coming in through the skylight. Suddenly the light is blocked off and it's almost impossible to see around you. Looking up you see something completely shocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous green eye is peering down at you, now and again it blinks with a mighty rumble allowing you to see its long eyelashes; it's almost as though the owner of this eye's being flirtatious. Next thing you know the whole room goes topsy-turvy as you hear a sound like a spoon striking a teacup, fortunately there are so many cushions you're slightly dazed but uninjured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" A mighty familiar feminine voice giggles. \"You're just so cute when you gaze up at me like that.\" You're gobsmacked.

Just then you take another tumble as the room goes head-over-heels and you find yourself sliding down the chute that led to the skylight and free-falling right into a massive gray paw.

The poster depicted a pear-shaped obese anthropomorphic sheep big enough to make the skyscrapers below her look like ant-hills. The poster read \"Sheepzilla\". You look and see that there were other posters next to this one and all depicted that same sheep. Upon closer examination, this sheep giant is a woman and appears to be wearing blue lipstick and small glasses that contrast with her silvery wool and black skin. You take a closer look and realize that this sheep has the same face as Ari. \"Huh,\" you say. \"Ari did say she was going to be in the movies once she was out of high school. Guess she decided it would be monster movies. It must be uncomfortable to be in that suit all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you hear thunderous giggling and gasp. \"Trust me.

How does it feel to be the fianc\u00e9 of the famous Sheepzilla.\" You didn't know what Ari was talking about and then gasp as you look up at a pair of blue lips big enough to swallow an entire parking lot.

She starts crying, the tears falling on you every so often, she cries for a good 5 minutes and you really weren't sure what you could do to stop it. You turn the picture over and notice there's a message scrawled on the back \"To my daughter, do not worry the person standing in front of you is the exact same boy you fell in love with. I've watched him for a month now and he will take good care of you, never forget the boy you fell in love with but you can fall in love again.\" \"Wow so her mother was the one who chose me to come, well I might as well do my best\" you think. Clarisse stops crying after another 5 minutes and you hold the back of the picture up for her to read, she stops sniffling and just stands there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who are you?\" she asks staring down at you somewhat angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexander at you're service\" you say bowing. She pushes you over \"so other then telling me the love of my life is dead why are you here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, as I said i'm you're boyfriend from a parallel universe, you're not an 8 mile tall anthromoprhic rabbit there but otherwise no difference. I was brought here to act as a replacement for you're boyfriend so that you'd never know that he died, that plan did not work out as well as they hoped\" you say. The tv on the wall turns on and a face appears \"so you told her, do you have any idea what you've done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you, you had the balls to hide the fact that her love was dead for a month and then you try to deceive her again. I can see where you're coming from, but she can't be that irrational I know this girl, admittedly not as a bunny and she wouldn't hurt a fly heck she wouldn't even swat a spider that was crawling up her arm\" you yell at the tv. All you hear is the man on the tv say \"take the shot,\" you hear a bullet but you don't feel it as you had closed you're eyes. You open you're eyes and you find yourself surrounded by white, you look up and see Clarisse staring at the tv. \"If the person who took that shot is within this house in the hour and I find him, I will become the first omnivorous bunny\" Clarisse yells, you actualy hear the guy scream and him start scrambling to get out. She turns to the tv and says \"Mr.president you have no worry, I will not hurt anyone but I will also not help you stop anymore wars, all those people's deaths are on you're head\" she says before switching off the tv. You look up at her and ask \"why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what?\" she replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you let them kill me, I mean I must be the last person in the universe you'd want to save right now, I just told you you're lovers dead and i'm just a stand-in\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not so bad\" she says leaning forward she kisses you pushing you gently against her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look you have to be going through a lot right now, you'll need a bit of time to get used to me, and I to you, plus you'll probably need something like a week or month to fully accept he's dead an....\" you're cut off as she kisses you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are the man I fell in love with\" she says smiling, \"you might not be exact but I can tell from that comment that even with just meeting you that you care for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are my girlfriend\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I saw outside is carrots, is that the only thing to eat here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I can cook up a storm, you'll love my carrot cake\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, the you in my universe sucks at cooking\" you say. \"Also you're probably a tiny bit in shock\" you say having studied a few psychology books becuase you were bored and you found the subject interesting. \"3,2,1\" you say and she hugs you against her chest whispering \"never leave me, never leave me.\" You just sit there and wait till she's finished, she places you down on the couch and spins around, \"so was the other me this good looking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but she didn't have a cute little tail coming out her backside\" you reply,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so you like my tail?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's cute, even though it's bigger then I am\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well you're a guy so you probably like just my body\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, you probably still tell just as bad jokes as before\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you call a flying turtle?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shellicopter\" she says, you giggled a bit and said \"see now that's the really bad humour I remember you having.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why aren't you trying to get back?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they told me the machine's one way and well, the night before I came here was the night I lost her, I took her home and find a message on my machine that not a minute after I left her appartment was on fire, I waited for an hour and the news came on saying the fire was out but that there was only 1 confirmed death and...\" you trail off as you're eyes start to water, \"Clarisse don't let the pain get to you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I heard she was gone the first thing I tried to do was take my own life, but I couldn't do it. Probably why I was brought here to keep me from ending it. You're mother probably heard me say that I was going to make sure I finished it in the morning, even hid a gun near my bed and left a note\" you say. You're eyes fill with tears and you just stare down and let them fall one by one, as you remember the pain and what you had tried to do. You look up and she's right in front of you, she gently blows on you knocking you over. You just lay there feeling kind of dejected and pissed that you had hurt the girl in front of you. She gently pokes you once, twice, she keeps poking you till you look up at her. She's smiling down at you and asks \"Alex do you want to be my boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look up at her stunned, you wait a second before replying, \"I would love to\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then give you're new girlfriend a kiss\" she says leaning over. You get up and you have to stand on you're toes to reach her, right when you're about to kiss her she moves back causing you to lose you're balance and fall forward. \"Sorry\" she says giggling, \"it was just too good an opprotunity\" she says scooping you up. She holds you next to her cheek and you kiss her, you spend the next few seconds getting fur out of you're mouth. \"Don't worry, you'll learn to do it without getting any fur\" she says smiling. Next is </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tv turns on and the guy who you realize is supposed to be the president of the U.S comes back on. \"Well you seem to be doing well\" he asks \"no more hatred, we can expect Clarisse's help in any conflicts right?\" he aims the question at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's not my call, besides I have a condition even if it was my call\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that condition be?\" the president asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that damn machine that brought me here work in reverse and let me see my family to say goodbye, or atleast send a note through saying I went on a spiritual journey or something and didn't commit suicide, they probably think i'm dead right now\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done\" the president says, you see a machine wheeled in behind him and a man hands the president a note, he holds it up to the camera and you read it. The note's perfect and the president himself activates the machine and sends it through. The machine is wheeled out and the president says \"so we can expect Clarisse's help with any global conflicts right?\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not my choice it's hers\" you say turning to Clarisse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm first you try to trick me, then you try to kill my new boyfriend when he's kind enough to tell me, soooo no\" Clarisse says. She sticks her tongue out at the president and makes a licking motion and turns the tv off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok that made sense up to the end\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well when I was younger he tried to give me a carrot but I kind of forgot he was there and well he should be glad I didn't swallow\" Clarisse says. \"Actually ever since then,,,,\" she trails off and leans over, she pushes you onto the couch with her nose and licks you from head to toe. \"Mmm you taste really good, better then carrots, in fact you taste good enough to eat\" Clarisse says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, eep\" you say and you faint right then and there. You slowly wake up and you see Clarisse staring down at you obviously concerned as she kept chewing on a carrot. You sit up and moan \"augh, what just happened\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You fainted, i'm sorry my little prank went too far\" she says her ears drooping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no harm done, just you know never do that again ok?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course anything for my little fluffy-wuffy\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so i'm you're fluffy-wuffy wuffy what do you want to be?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, are you ok with calling me Ms.fluffy buns?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I mean the other me called you it so why not\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you\" she says, she gently lowers a hand to you and cuddles you against her cheek once you get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you saying something about carrot cake before\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're hungry, of course i'll go grab some\" Clarisse says. She walks off and comes back carrying a piece more fit for her size \"dig in\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this a bit big?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'll just eat whatever you don't, we both get a meal that way\" she says smiling. You start eating and right away you realize just how good a cook this girl is as this is by and away the best carrot cake you're ever eaten. You eat a pretty large portion of the cake for you're size before moving back and sitting down more stuffed then you've been in a while. Clarisse starts eating and quickly finishes off the rest of the cake. You look up and laugh \"hey Clarisse you have crumbs stuck in you're fur\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well can you get them for me?\" she asks, She raises you near her mouth and you spend the next minute removing crumbs. \"Thank you\" she says when you're finished and gives you a kiss. You sit down in her palm pad and ask \"so what do you do for fun around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know hide and seek right?\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know hide and seek\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my version is called Jack and the giant, guess who's the giant\" Clarisse says grinning. \"You have to hide from me for 10 minutes and if you do you win, however if I find you I win, the winner gets to request one thing of the loser\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um isn't that kind of dangerous, given the size difference\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not normally, the playing field is my body and I have to guess what part of me you're on\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um isn't that kind of getting too close too quickly\" you say blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to take advantage of the situation?\" she asks giving the question an angry undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, that would be totally wrong\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then there's no problem\" Clarisse says, she picks you up and drops you down into her fur, you instantly crouch down and start crawling to help the fur cover you. You crawl for a few minutes not really sure you were making any progress to well anywhere when she says \"breasts\" you look around and clearly being able to see them you shout back \"no\". You crawl around for a few more minutes when the \"floor\" gives way and you land in a hole \"hmm i'd say my belly button\" Clarisse says. You look up to see her smiling down at you \"hey I was right\" she says, she sticks a finger slightly in her belly button and you grab onto her fur and she pulls you out. She places you down on her palm and stops to think \"hmm what should I have you do, it's been so long since I last won at this\" she says. She lifts her hand up and puts you down near one of her ears \"would you mind giving my ear a scratch? it's been such a long time since they last got the care and attention I can't give them\" she says. You walk up and she bends her ear over, you hop up and start rubbing and scratching, you can hear her sigh. You rub for a probable good half hour and you somehow covered about half her ear. You feel her fingers pinch around you and you're transferred over to her other ear where you start rubbing again. After another half an hour you just lay there exhausted and she gently picks you up and puts you down on her palm. \"Aww is my little fluffy-wuffy tired\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you say in reply, you just lay there tired as all heck. \"Aww well let me try to fix that for you\" she says. You feel the tip of one of her fingers start rubbing against you're back and you sigh. It wasn't really removing the exhaustion but it was removing a lot of the strain in you're body and was really soothing. After a minute you try to get up but she just gently pushes you back down and she starts singing \"fluffy-wuffy fluffy-wuffy I am here for you, fluffy-wuffy fluffy-wuffy I will care for you. Watch and protect you, bake and clean too, all I ask is you love me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was great\" you say getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're awake, um oh....\" she tries to hide behind her ears to cover up her embarrasment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey why are you hiding, that was beautiful, did you come up with it just now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but I was always told I had a really bad singing voice\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't, that was great, is there more to the song?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and starts singing again \"fluffy-wuffy fluffy-wuffy do you like me? fluffy-wuffy please tell me. I can't stand not being able to know, becuase I love you with my heart and soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The answer's yes Clarisse and that was excellent\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you\" she says \"i'll be sure to sing for you as often as you want\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, might as well write that down and call it the fluffy-wuffy song\" you say jokingly but still smiling. She puts you down, runs off and grabs a piece of paper and a pencil and actually does write it down along with a melody you know since she brings it back once she's written it down and you learn the song has a verse 3 and 4. You share a laugh and for some reason the thought of that sniper crosses you're mind. \"Hey Clarisse what would have happened if you did find that guy?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I forgot all about him, i'd probably just eat him in one gulp\" she says. You look up at her horiffied and she says \"i'm kidding, I wouldn't do anything, just put him outside the house and scare him a bit by showing him my teeth\" she says. \"Ok that's good, you really need to stop trying to scare me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think i'm a good girl?\" she asks sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but sadly i've heard of many an instance where power turns someone from good to bad\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is my little fluffy-wuffy worried about me\" she says snuggling up against you \"don't worry I don't do anything bad, as long as you're with me I'll be a good girl\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be a good girl without me right?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, i'm not allowed out enough to really do anything bad\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last time you went outside?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, i'd have to say back when I was 15 and I was almost sent over to stop the wars\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww well you should go out every so often\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's really hard to watch for everything when you're this big\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, hmmm well there's a large field near the house they gave me, you should be able to atleast walk around it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're house is only a 5 minute walk and it's been a whiile since I saw it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go play there?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

You stop for a second suprised at what you just said, I mean you did love her because she was still the same being but saying it so early for some reason suprised you. Clarisse smiles down at you with a big bunny grin and lowers her hand to you. You climb on and she stands up and walks upstairs, you look around trying to get as much knowledge of the house as you can. From what you see the upper floor was only made of a bathroom and Clarisse's room but once she entered her room you saw why. It was huge, not only because she was so big but her bedroom was pretty much the size of the living room downstairs complete with tv and a couch of it's own. Clarisse lays down on the bed and she puts you down in front of a pink monolith sticking out of the white. \"Um....is that what I think it is?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, you should touch it and find out\" Clarisse replies. You slowly walk over the soft surface and poke the pink thing, Clarisse doesn't react in any way so you slowly start rubbing it and that's when Clarisse lets out a moan. You jump back and say \"i'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what that felt great\" Clarisse says, you look up and you can see her smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah but we just met and..\" Clarisse gently pushes you over with 1 finger and shushes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I didn't want you there, you wouldn't be there now would you\" she says smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no I wouldn't\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then stop being so uptight and have some fun\" Clarisse says. She picks you up and holds you in front of her face \"or am I not good enough, do you not want me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no no that's not the problem\" you say waving you're hands. \"It's just....processing all this is a bit much, well that and i'm really not sure where to start\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then i'll be the lead\" Clarisse says. She puts you down in between her mountains and says \"you're mission if you choose to accept it is scale one of the two mountains surrounding you and plant a flag at the top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a flag\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter, get climbing otherwise an earthquake's gonna start\" Clarisse says while smiling. You sigh and start climbing her left breast, the soft flesh gave way as you pushed and grabbed it making climbing very easy. It takes you an hour and somehow by going all out you make it to the top, you lay out once you reach the top panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There I made it\" you say trying to catch you're breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt great, it was like I was getting a mini massage' Clarisse says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you liked it, can I get a drink?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Clarisse says, she gently picks you up and puts you down on a pillow before getting up and walking downstairs. You move around trying to get some of the strain off you're body \"augh i've done more physical work today then I usually do in a week\" you think. Clarisse comes back in a minute carrying a tiny cup which was still about 10 times you're size. She holds it between 2 fingers while you drink you're fill before setting it down on a bedside table. Clarisse lays down next to you and this is when a fact sets in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clarisse why are you naked?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's hard to make clothes for me and honestly no one's really said anything about it before\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well doesn't it get cold?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I have fur to keep me warm\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I just don't want anyone oggling you as you're my girlfriend\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw well aren't you a little sweetie\" Clarisse says reaching over and picking you up. She gently drops you into her chest and you lay there in her fur content to be near her and neither of you had a care in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't mind if I sleep here do you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you've been sleeping there whenever I got my paws on you since we met\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm well that's good\" you say getting as comfortable as possible. You lay out on you're stomach and you feel Clarisse start stroking you're back with 1 finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh that feels nice, wish I could return the favour\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess it'd be nice if you could, but then I couldn't cuddle you like this\" Clarisse says picking you up and gently hugging you against her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, besides how many guys can brag their girlfriend is truly one of a kind\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i'm kind of curious but since you're part animal are you controlled by the whole mating season thing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lady has to have some secrets\" Clarisse replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a yes\" you say, and you're literally blown over for you're answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you ask?\" Clarisse asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No reason, I just thought it was something i'd rather know now rather then later\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I shouldn't be like that for a while so there's nothing to worry about\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happens when you're in mating season?\" you ask,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am a rabbit, so I do what rabbits do\" she replies. This was a bit unnerving to you as phrases like \"they're going at it like rabbits\" were coined for a reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I normally do when you're within natures hold\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd normally have school or something else that made you leave the house but now that i'm not letting my eyes off you that's not happening aren't you lucky?\" she says truly happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's great\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was the other me ever here when you were in heat?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once, I saw him and my memory goes a bit fuzzy but I remember waking up with him on my chest, asleep, from what I could tell he was exhausted\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he unhurt?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and stares at you for a bit \"it sounds to me like you don't truly trust me\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No that's not the problem it's just I know I lose myself to my urges and I assume you're stronger then me but we haven't known each other long\" you say. Clarisse picks you up and stares at you \"well if you don't trust me then maybe you shouldn't stay\" she says opening her mouth. You just hang there stunned at what was happening, \"well I guess it's my own fault, had such a nice second chance given to me and I screw it up because i'm untrusting\" you think. She brings you closer and closer and you don't even react, you can feel her breath and as she brings you closer the intake gets shorter and shorter almost like she was waiting for someone to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Clarisse i'm sorry for what I said, i'm just afraid of being hurt, especially by you even if you don't mean it, becuase i'm not sure how I could handle that\" you say. You feel her mouth shut almost around you and she lifts you up and drops you on her nose. You just stare up at her for a bit till you see a tear fall down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot\" she whispers, \"I almost.....I almost got rid of you, because you don't trust me\" Clarisse whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarisse i'm sorry, please don't cry\" you say running up and hugging her face trying to comfort her but not sure what you can do. She stops crying after the first tear falls and she picks you up between 2 fingers, \"i'll forgive you but you have to show you trust me\" Clarisse says. \"Anything\" you reply. She reaches under the bed and pulls out a fitting pair of scissors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close you're eyes and hold out you're palms\" Clarisse says snipping the scissors. You shut you're eyes scared to death, you keep them shut for a minute and you don't feel anything. \"You can open them now\" Clarisse says. You look at you're jacket and the crest for it is missing, you look in you're hands and you're holding what feels like cotton. You look up at Clarisse in confusion and she passes you a sewing kit. \"Stitch that cotton into you're jacket\" she says. It takes you a minute but you do it and Clarisse puts the mini kit away. \"Now you can't lose that jacket, i'm trusting you\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok but where'd you get the cotton\" you ask, she puts you down and sits down in front of you, you notice instantly. \"Did...did you cut off part of you're tail?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes this way i'll always be with you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" you say walking up and hugging her tail. Clarisse picks you up, \"well do you trust me now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" you reply. She smiles and snuggles you in between her breasts and gently lays a hand over where you are acting as a blanket. You quickly fall asleep to the sound of her breathing and heartbeat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up slowly as you had never been more comfortable then you were right now. You sit up and Clarisse is still sleeping, you shrug and just go back to sleep for a bit as you knew you weren't gonna be able to wake her. You woke up again probably half an hour later with Clarisse staring down at you intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" you say and she looks down at you even more intently now that she knew you were up. She gently picks you up and much to you're suprise you see what looks like a giant gas grenade fly out of nowhere and explode in her face, she slowly falls forward still holding onto you and you're quickly surrounded by some sort of special forces and pried out of Clarisse's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...what the hell was that?\" you say to one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just knockout gas\" the leader says \"we're here to extract you for a few days\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today is the start of Mrs. Clarrisse's natural mating cycle and it would be.....regretable if you were to be injured\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going anywhere, even if she's in heat I can't just disappear, she'll go nuts, you want that?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...never considered that possibility, fine you can stay but you better have some damn good luck kid\" the leader says before him and his team disperse back to wherever they came from. \"Great, more so that Clarisse being in heat, there are special forces as well as tanks probably scattered around the house\" you think sighing. Clarisse gets up after a few minutes and looks around in fear not knowing where you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarisse i'm down here\" you say and she looks down and quickly locks onto you. She smiles and lifts you up to her face before gently rubbing against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fluffy-wuffy\" she says and snuggles against you before laying out, she gently snuggles you into her chest and pets you with 1 finger before much to you're suprise she starts to sing. She sings the full version of that song you heard before all the while with a big grin on her face. Clarisse lifts you back up after a bit and says \"Fluffy do you love me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Ms. fluffy buns\" you reply. Clarisse smiles before doing the one thing you were dreading. She starts lowering you towards her nether regions and when she has you over it, you can feel and smell the desire emananting from her organ. \"Hey, hey Clarisse isn't this taking things a bit too quickly?\" you ask. She quickly pulls you back to her face \"Fluffy-wuffy doesn't love me?\" she asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you with my whole heart, it's just i'm really not sure I can take that step yet\" you say. She looks down at you still confused \"you don't want me to get hurt or anything right?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" Clarisse replies before rubbing against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well right now if we did that, I think i'd get hurt and you'd be the one who hurt me\" you say hoping you're plan will work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares down at you in shock, \"No I don't want to hurt you\" she says fighting her natural instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then can we wait a bit Clarisse till i'm ready?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of..of course we can, i'll wait as long as necesscary\" Clarisse says snapping out of the control of her urges, she smiles down at you and you hear static. You look down at the bed and you see something black in contrast to all the white, \"hey Clarisse can you put me down?\" you ask. She does and you run up to grab the walkie-talkie \"Kid what the fuck is happening?\" you recognize the voice of the special ops guy. \"Nothing, she's back to normal now, so I suggest you guys get out of here\" you say. \"That's, that's impossible\" the guy says \"we have strict orders to stay until her cycle is complete\" he says. You turn to Clarisse, \"who are you talking to?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some special ops guys, they were sent here to watch over you and well me during you're mating cycle, but the guy won't believe me you're not on it anymore\" you say. Clarisse gently picks you up and you hold the walkie-talkie in front of her mouth. \"Hello, who is the leader of this operation?\" she asks into the walkie-talkie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be me Mrs.Clarisse 3rd division special ops commander Brad talon\" you hear the leader say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mr.Talon as you can tell I am no longer controlled by my natural desires, so you can leave\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cannot do that Mrs. we were given strict orders we have to stay until you were finished you're mating cycle\" says the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright how about this then? you all leave and give me some privacy, or I will personally find each of you and then you will be mine to do with as I please\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey isn't that a little harsh?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it isn't i'm sick of these government agents who were sent out because some bigwig doesn't treat me like a living thing and instead like some kind of weapon or thing to be used\" Clarisse says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We...we will pull out, thank you for giving us the chance\" Brad replies. You smile as you see a bunch of C-130 hercules transport fly through the room and out an open window. Clarisse sighs \"damn government always meddling in my buisness\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if they hadn't meddled I wouldn't be here right now\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is true\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...how long does you're mating cycle last?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long, only a day or 2\" Clarisse replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" you reply. Clarisse lowers you to the bed and pins you under one finger \"you know just because I have my urges under control doesn't mean we still can't have fun some like yesterday\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we atleast have some breakfast first\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Clarisse says picking you up and placing you down on her palm. She walks downstairs to the kitchen and puts you down on the table before rummaging around in a fridge. \"Now I know there should have been another piece of, ahah\" she says as she pulls herself out. She places a plate with another piece of carrot cake down on the table and moves you onto it. You eat you're fill before stepping back and letting her devour it which showered you in crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really like you're own cooking don't you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, do you like my cooking?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, Alex you're covered in crumbs\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're right\" you say shaking yourself you only got a few off. Clarisse lowers her hand to you and runs upstairs \"oh this'll be so much fun, my first time\" she says. You're about to ask first what? when she opens the door to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no no no\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleaseeeeee\" she says holding it till she's nearly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but it has to be a bath not a shower that would probably pulverize me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay\" Clarisse shouts, she starts the water running and it was like niagra falls had been created in the bathroom. Clarisse just waits there for a bit before turning the water off and entering. She holds you over the water as she gets in before slowly lowering her palm in till it was up to you're neck. Finally she submerges her hand and you have to start swimming.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I just laid on top of you?\" you ask while swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't want to be away from me?\" Clarisse asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, and i'm pretty sure even the slightest motion will make a wave bigger then I am\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Clarisse says picking you up and putting you down on her shoulder. Staring down you say \"I claim this land in the name of well me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah and what if the land fights back?\" Clarisse says picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess i'm at her mercy\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thinking but this bunny loves you so you'll be well taken care of\" Clarisse says. You both wash yourselves quickly as a small area had been set aside for you for that purpose and the shared bath is soon finished and you could tell by how Clarisse's ears were drooping it was over faster then she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust to clarify you ask \"Clarisse what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was over too quickly, and you didn't stare at me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't stare at me even once, am I not attractive?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarisse I respect you too much to stare\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on you can stare a bit\" she says leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if I must\" you say looking her form up and down she starts to blush. She lets you stare for a minute before picking you up \"ok that's enough\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever\" you say sitting down in her paw. Clarisse walks downstairs and says.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"There's something I need to show you\" she says before walking through the house, she walks over to what you thought was a wall but there was a actually a door about the size of a garage door etched into the wood. Clarisse puts you down near the door and you walk up and open it, there wasn't much in there a few books that looked like photo albums, a blanket. \"Grab the books\" she says, you grab them and climb up onto her offered finger. Clarisse walks over to the couch and sits down gently depositing you on her stomach, you look through the books, you keep seeing the same man and woman and what looks like well Clarisse as a baby but way smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarisse is this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, \"that's me, my growth started increasing when I hit a year old and I was already a freak baby, once the government learned of me my parents freely gave me up\" she says on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey it's because they loved you\" you say. Clarisse shakes her head, she takes you back to the little room and you see one last object a black tape recorder. You pick it up and hit play, you listen and you hear a conversation between what you realize are Clarisse's parents and a government agent. The government agent offered them a large sum of money for doing their country such a \"great service\" but they turned it down saying \"we don't want this freak child in our lives anymore or any reminder of her.\" You hit the stop button and rewound the tape putting it back, you jumped as a tear splashed near you and Clarisse just lay her head down and started to sob. You ran up and climbed onto her cheek even though it took a few minutes, \"shh, shh there there Clarisse, you're not a freak, you're a beautiful bunny and I wouldn't have you any other way then you are now\" you say. You spend the next 10 minutes comforting her and eventually the tears dry and the sobs turn to sniffling which stops. Clarisse lets you get up before staring down at you \"thank you\" she whispers wiping a few tears away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarisse, I know this is part of your past, but can I destroy it?\" you ask. Clarisse just looks at you stunned, \"not the good things, but this\" you say picking up the tape recorder. \"I want you to trust me and forget what is on this tape and only remember the good times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't that be a li.... \"so then believe the lie\" you yell. You were crying now, \"I can't...I can't believe that the the parents of this beautiful girl were such monsters that they'd do this, I wouldn't know you now if they weren't but still\" you can't help it you punch the floor as you had to release some steam. \"Please Clarisse for me, forget it, I....I don't ever want to see those beautiful eyes ever stained by tears again\" you say looking up at her. Clarisse looks down at you stunned, \"sorry, I probably said too much\" you say shuffling you're feet. You were ever so gently pushed back by something soft and you look up to see Clarisse, or atleast her lips. You were slowly pushed down till she was kissing you and the floor and she held the kiss for a good 10 minutes thankfully you got air from inside her mouth. Clarisse lifts her lips and then you're carefully lifted up and dropped onto her palm and brought to her cheek. \"Thank you Alex\" she says gently rubbing against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what\" you ask hugging her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For caring for this silly rabbit\" she says lifting you up and dropping you on top of her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem, I love my big fluffy bunny\" you reply hugging her nose. You laid down and Clarisse carefully stood up and walked over to the kitchen table and sat, you were transferred from her nose to the table and you just sat there. \"So what about you're family?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a...happier upbringing let's leave it at that\" you say. Clarisse looks down at you, \"oh come on you said you'd trust me right?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I had a good upbringing as I said, parents loved me and always supported me so no Clarisse I don't have any problems in my past and i'm sorry\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm you're boyfriend I should be protecting you, but I can't protect you from that\" you say sighing. Clarisse giggles a bit, \"thank you fluffy wuffy, you're always worrying about me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" you reply. Clarisse picks you up gently and looks down at you, \"so how should I reward you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reward for what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For always caring for me hmmmm....\" she trails off in thought and you can't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Clarisse it's not like you owe me for every little thing\" you say. She nods in response but still just sits there thinking, Finally she stands up and smiles devilishly at you, \"you're going to like this\" she says matter of factly. She walks through the house seemingly to try to remember something before seeming to give up, she walks over to the couch and lays down making sure her chest was compact before nestling you inside. You were right you did like it, her fur was so soft but it was really warm and still kind of bouncy, kind of like being on a waterbed. You laid back and Clarisse sighed, \"so you get something out of this too?\" you ask rubbing her. Clarisse gives off a soft moan and nods, \"well you're not the only one who wants some fun\" she replies. You nestled yourself in and Clarisse gently laid a hand over her breast trapping you. \"So do you think you can escape?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I want to?\" you reply. You spent the next few minutes petting, poking and prodding and even licking to find out what Clarisse liked best. Finally you settled on gently stroking her fur and she sighed the whole time you were doing it, \"mmmm how does someone so small make me feel so good\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love I guess, it's the same for how you can be so gentle even though you're so big\" you reply. Clarisse nods and then lays out on the couch as you hit a sweet spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next 10 minutes stroking before she's able to sit up and she gently pushes you down signalling you to stop. \"Geez even though that was supposed to be a reward you spent more time making me relax then relaxing\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarisse as long as you're happy and I get to stay near you that's all I need, well that and essentials like food and water\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez way to wreck it\" Clarisse says before playfully poking her breast near you causing you to fall into the impression. Clarisse giggled and held her finger there trapping you, \"hey let me out\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're going to be trapped there forever right next to me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but uh what about when I need to use the toilet, in fact I think I need to go right now\" you say. Clarisse freezes and quickly picks you up before running to the bathroom and putting you down on the ground where you notice there's a tiny toilet set up for you. She turns around and you do you're buisness before washing up, Clarisse picks you up and walks back into the bedroom, \"that's not fair\" she says pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me having to go the bathroom isn't fair?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods, \"you were supposed to stay in the forever and ever\" she says dropping you gently back on top of her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that's fine with me\" you say laying back. \"It's warm, soft, and best of all i'm near you at all times, what's not to like\" you say. You look up to see Clarisse with a huge grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez you always know just what to say to make me happy don't you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I aim to please\" you reply.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You lay back against the warm surface, it giving way a small bit \"so Clarisse I guess you were an only child?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....yeah I was, good thing too as I became so big\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you like carrots because you are a rabbit?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just like them, mmm especially with some nice lettuce and tomatoes\" she says causing you to crack into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a rabbit diet to me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well, nyahhh\" she replies sticking her tongue out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Clarisse, how long has the government taken care of you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I was very young, I don't think i've ever not been in the government's care, which I guess means I should owe them, but they can be such jerks sometimes\" she says crossing her arms over her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, hey Clarisse how come nothing's you know happened to me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the weight of just your finger tip must be incredible and you should have created gale force winds when you folded your arms just a second ago, what gives?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse smiles \"that's my little secret\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you can tell me, pleassseeee\" you say. She giggles bouncing you up and down and lowers her head \"fine fluffy i'll tell you\" she says lowering a finger for you to get on. Your lifted up to face level and she smiles \"i'm kind of an anomaly, my body acts like it's normal size except when i'm touching something man made, although I can exert more force if I wish\" Clarisse says. You were kind of confused by the explanation \"come again?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs and puts you down on the bed, \"do you trust me?\" she asks. You nod and she smiles and stands up \"well then little guy here I come\" she says and she jumps. You couldn't do anything but stand there and stare in horror as her body fell towards you, you didn't even scream. She just descended on you and then........nothing, I mean you felt pressure sure, but no more then you'd feel if a normal girl that weighed around 100 something pounds would give off if she was laying on top of you. The body above you moved and lifted off you and soon you were staring up at Clarisse's face \"hi fluffy\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT.THE.FUCK!!!?\" you shout at her and she smiles down at you \"I told you, even though i'm this big unless I want to, I weight no more then 120 pounds\" she says laying back over top of you pushing you into the bed with her giant white tummy. You tried to push her off but it seemed it didn't act both ways, as although it felt like she was only giving off 120 pounds of force it felt like you were trying to move however much she weighed. After a few seconds she rolls over and scoops you up in her palm, you turn away and she pokes you. \"Aww what's wrong fluffy?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea, how scared I was, I trust you Clarisse, but that was....that was....that was the most terrifying thing i've ever experienced\" you say coming close to tears. It wasn't like you didn't trust Clarisse and sure there was a few things that hadn't made sense to you but in your eyes it was the equivelant of the moon falling on you and expecting to live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Were you, scared of me?\" she asks thankfully not trying to turn you around. You couldn't help yourself, you nodded and felt the tears start to flow splashing onto her fur below you. You were slowly lifted up and Clarisse gently hugs you to her cheek \"I'm so sorry, I didn't know I'd scare you this much\" she says, You nodded again and snuggled up against her fur, Clarisse gently started to sing and she gently puts you down on her stomach and starts to stroke your back with 1 finger. You slowly calmed down and started to pet her tummy or atleast what you could to try and pay her back. Clarisse sighs, \"oooh that feels so good\" she says. You push up and she moves her finger \"that's another thing, how can you see me, and how can you feel that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to answer your first question, I am a rabbit and we're known for 2 things, our big floppy ears, and our good eyesight\" Clarisse says. Continuing she says \"to answer your other question, I think it's like with my whole weight thing, even though your so small I can feel everything you do like your my sized\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how come I couldn't get you to move before?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you \"you really think i'd let you go that easy\" she says smiling. You sigh \"fine, but can you please never do anything like that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarisse nods \"will do fluffy, your not....mad at me are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I am?\" you ask honestly not sure if you were or not. Clarisse's ears drop and she stares at you sadly, \"I'm really sorry fluffy, it seemed like you might find it funny afterwards\" she says trying to smile. You sighed and looked up at her \"look Clarisse im not actually angry and since you promised never to do it again I forgive you\" you say. She gives off a quite girly squeal and you were scooped up and she gently kisses her palm, \"ooh thank you fluffy\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for you Clarisse\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything?\" she replies smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, ok nothing nasty\" you reply, she nods still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know\" she says putting you down near her belly button, she slowly pushes you forward till you fall in and she giggles \"there now your stuck\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey this is entrapment\" you say but Clarisse just covers her stomach with her hand and lays back against the bed. You were sure she could still hear you yet she had decided on....something you weren't sure what but you weren't exactly going to stay where you were. You started to climb the inside of her belly button, problem was even though it was really small to you it was like climbing a small skyscraper to you and every so often her bellybutton would shake almost like Clarisse was laughing. Finally you reach the top after a half an hour of climbing you sit on the edge of Clarisse's bellybutton. You knew she could feel you so you push against her hand and suprisingly you could move it a bit, you start to push up when suddenly the weight increases and you hear Clarisse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who goest there, you cannot get past this gate without knowing the password\" she says trying to make her voice as deep and loud as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clarrisse is the most beautiful bunny in the world\" you reply. Clarisse moves her hand away and stares at you \"it's no fun if you guess on the first try\" she says sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sorry, make the password something less obvious next time\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I like hearing you compliment me\" she says smiling from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's gotta be a better way than that\" you say sitting down on her fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could just ya know compliment me at random intervals\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine beautiful let's go with that\" you say getting a smile out of her. Clarisse picks you up and snuggles you just under her beck \"well I think it's about time we both took a nap, don't you?\" she says. You nodded and got as comfy as you could in the fur as Clarisse laid her hand over you and you both fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

Blinking your eyes a couple times, you gazed around with a curious expression. Where was your room? It was mostly complete darkness around your bed. Groping about blindly for a light, you find a flashlight on your bedside table. Flicking it on, an amazingly powerful beam of light cut a path through the dark, dazzling your eyes for a moment. What you saw made your mouth hang open for a few seconds. All around you, was empty space for miles and miles. Only you and the bed you rested in were pretty much the only visible things. Pointing the light up, a wall greeted you, as vast and as large vertically as the horizontal level. Strangely, the wall and the ground were covered with a thick, reddish-brown fur. Rubbing your hand against it, you smiled slightly at how soft and warm it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make the situation stranger, you could hear breathing. The wall and the ground seemed to move in and out with the breathing as well. Jumping out of your bed, you wandered around, finding no aim as what to do next. Looking up once more, climbing the living wall seemed like an interesting idea. You were pretty athletic, and a fit body could help lead you to what was at the top of that wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you began climbing. It wouldn't be an easy task, considering how...big it was, going beyond your line of sight, but it was a challenge you wanted to face. A repeating motion went on for hours, pull up, push with your feet, and continue on up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter so long, your breathe began to become a little heavy through your mouth, and your limbs began to feel the ache of exertion. Looking down, you had left the ground far below, and yet looking up, there was no end in sight. It could take you days to reach the top. Maybe weeks? Months? You didn't have the energy for that, no human did. Sighing, you still climbed upwards, furthering the plight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before your body gave out with exhaustion another hour later, a great earthquake shook the world. You held onto the furry wall with for dear life.\"Honey, you awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice seemed familiar. Your mother's? It couldn't be...the voice was loud. LOUD. It seemed to echo and vibrate your entire body. A chuckling followed the booming female voice.\"Honey! I can feel you climbing my pouch! Now you know you're too small to explore it....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother earthquake. Light filtered tinto the darkness,. Looking up, a hand was descending down upon you. You couldn't quite gauge it's size, however...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand plucked you up between it's equally furry thumb and forefinger. All you could see and feel was brown/red fur, but it felt somewhat comforting. Next you found yourself laying flat on your back, looking up at tree's that towered above you. But these weren't trees...no branches or leaves, just a single strand that shot up into the air, feeling like fur. Looking up past that, more amazement filled you. Two monumental....breasts blocked your view. Yes, breasts. They were...big, to say the least. As in, planetary. Astronomically large, able to hold worlds between them. Past them, a blur, probably thousands and thousands of more miles up, was a humanoid face of a kangaroo. It held the features of both a human and an animal, grinning down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, honey.\"Your mother spoke.</span></div></div>",

You toss and turn for an hour but even though you want to sleep again, you just can't. You let out a slight groan and then you hear something that sounded a lot like an Earthquake. \"Huh?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and then you hear a loud but feminine voice. \"Are you awake yet baby? Time to get up.\" That sounded like your mother, except it was so loud. \"Mom?\" you ask. You decide to ignore it and then go back in bed but then you hear a loud tapping. \"Come on my little boy,\" says that mysterious mother voice to you. \"Wake up.\" You let out another groan. \"Come on Mom, it's still early.\" Then the voice of your mother lets out a laugh. \"You silly boy. I have really got to get you a clock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost sounded like your mother, for lack of a better word, was mocking you, as if you were some kind of toy. \"Mom? Where are you?\" \"I'm right up here sug!\" It was then you heard a rumbling and the roof above you begins to move, sliding away, as if you were in some kind of dollhouse. \"What on Earth? Ah!\" Before you can say anything else a huge pair of claws the size of skyscrapers pick you up. You're picked up past a wall of white fur as big as a landscape and up past a pair of what you assume to be breasts. As you try to wrap your head around this situation, you look up in shock. Staring down at you was the face of a giant polar bear woman, heavy in body weight and with long cyan colored hair and a pair of yellow sunglasses. You then realize something, this polar bear's face looked like an animalistic version of your mother's and as she brought you up to her face, she smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sweetie.\" \"Uh,\" you say nervously. \"Good morning, Mom?\"</span></div></div>",

She looks down at you with a concerned face. \"What is it honey?\" she asked in a concerned voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes a step, but trips and falls on you. Luckily, you end up wedged in her huge planetary cleavage. \"Honey, please don't be dead! she yelled causing you to sweatdrop. She stands back up causing you to fall out of her cleavage, down her one piece dress and into her underwear. \"Oh! That's where you are. Well if you're frisky this morning go ahead honey,\" she said making you gag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab ahold of her underwear and start to climb. Somehow while you were climbing, you ended up in the back and inbetween her huge buttcheeks, each, looking big enough to crush a planet. You feel her sit down and her butt press on your small body. You quickly think and jump into her buttcrack. You hear her moan, making you gag, and start climbing up her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 4 hours of continuous climbing, gagging, and moaning, you realize that it would take you forever to get to the top.

As she does this, you accidentally get sucked into your mother's mouth, big enough to swallow a city. You grunt as you land on her tongue and try to stand up. Fortunately your elephant mother reaches in with her trunk and pulls you out. \"Oh!\" she yells. \"I am so, so sorry honey. It's a good thing a caught you there before I swallowed you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again?\" you think to yourself with a scared look on your face. This happened before? Before you can say anything on the matter, your mother lifts you up with her trunk and places you on the top of her head in a forest of blonde hair. You couldn't wrap your head around this. Why couldn't you remember that your own mother was a planet sized elephant woman. You take a good look to see she has a golden brownish skin and judging by her two tusks, she was an African elephant with long blonde hair. Your elephant mother was also very heavyset. Of course she was an elephant, but she was so large she would probably weigh nine hundred pounds had she been normal size. But why was your mother an elephant. Were you adopted? No, you couldn't remember being adopted. But then again, you couldn't remember much of anything. Maybe that clumsy mother of yours squashed you so much, you had amnesia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you decide not to ask anything yet, seeing as your mom was walking into the kitchen. She genuinely loved you, but she was a total klutz and somewhat of a ditz. Maybe this would be dangerous but for some reason you could survive being crushed under her massive body. Suddenly your mother slips a little and she begins to yell slightly as she begins to tip. \"Oh no!\" you yell. As your mother sways back and fourth, you try to grab hold of one of her hairs and hang on tight, but then she sways too far and you let go and come tumbling as your mother falls on the table, her heavy weight causing it to break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey?\" asks your mother. \"Honey! Where are you?!\" \"I'm right here Mom. Don't worry, I'm okay.\" You say in a muffled tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere are you?</span></div></div>",

You were at the end of her right nostril and gag because you're covered in your mother's elephant snot from head to toe. You try to break free but the mucus is so thick that you can barely move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside your elephant mom lets out a sigh. \"Oh that's a relief honey.

To get you out of her hose nose, your mom inhales some pepper that flies all the way to the end of her nose You gag on the pepper and even cover your eyes, in the process getting your mom's nose slime over your eyes. To make matters worse the entire nose begins to shake. \"Oh no.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Mom trumpets a few times before she lets out a sneeze that sucks you towards the exit of his nostril screaming.

You couldn't swim so you started thrashing around trying to keep yourself afloat until you manage to grab onto something. You held onto whatever it was coughing out all of the foul tasting water you swallowed in your panic. After collecting your thoughts you looked around and saw water stretching out for miles in all directions with a couple of large mountains poking out of the surface here and there. You looked at those strange mountains for a few more seconds until you realized they weren't mountains but colossal sized plates, cups, pots, and other cooking/eating utensils. Looking down at your makeshift lifebelt you saw it was a very soggy piece of bread that would be no bigger than a crumb to your mother. When your mom sneezed you must have fallen into the sink. Even if being around your mother was as equally dangerous you decided to take your chances with her than drowning in this dirty dishwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey! Where are you\" Your mother called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must be looking for you. Looking up at the thousand mile high walls that was the edge of the sink you knew there was no way you could climb those smooth walls so your mother was the only one who could get you out of this mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! I'm here in the sink!\" You called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's not answering\" Your mother sighed \"Oh well. He'll turn up like he always does. I better wash these dishes before I start cooking breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom I'm in here!\" you yell until your brain processes what she just said \"wait did she just say wash the dishes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis situation was going from bad to worse very quickly and showed no signs of stopping. You used the bread you were floating on to dog paddle over to a plate before climbing on. The plate was slightly slanted looking like a crashed flying saucer. If you got to the top of this then maybe your mom would see you. You ran as fast as you could trying to make it to the top of the plate before you mother got to the sink. You may have either gross underestimated the size of the plate (which for the record was over 100 miles across) or overestimated your running speed and stamina because you were panting after 500 yards. A shadow now loomed over you as your mother stood over the sink. Now that you were looking at her from a much lower position you saw how <i>scary</i> she looked. You only hoped she would notice you before she starts washing the dishes.</span></div></div>",

It was only going to get much more awkward because your mother then lowers her trunk and inhales. You grunt and then let out a groan because you are sucked into your mother's trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother covers her nose with her hands and blows to get you back to normal before she blows you out into her palm big enough to hold an entire continent. \"Are you okay honey.\" You cough a few times. \"As okay as I can get in my mom's nose.\" Your mother lets out a giggle and then places you on the counter. \"Now stay right there honey,\" she says. \"As much fun as squashing my son is, I don't think you can take anymore of it.\" Your mother then picks up the table pieces and walks away before she comes back in the room with another kitchen table.

You even saw her underwear and it was so small and tight. You then turn your head and then you shake. What were you thinking. That butt belonged to your <i>mom</i>. This was the woman who brought you into the world. Now that you think about it. What about your dad? You didn't have memories of your father. Your mom must've squashed your hippocampus or something. Maybe you didn't have a father. If you did, how would he survive being married to such a behemoth and how could an elephant woman give birth to such a tiny human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast is ready honey,\" says your Mom as she gets up and then walks forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are you having for breakfast?</span></div></div>",

Your mother may be a clumsy fat pachyderm but she was a good cook. Unfortunately, as she sits down in two chairs (she needed two to support her heavy weight, both chairs crack under your mother's elephant butt and she grunts and sends the pancakes flying. \"Oh no!\" you yell. \"No!\" One of your mother's city sized pancakes hit you. It was soft but it still pinned you to the ground and as your clumsy mother got up, her butt shakes the table and the pancakes fall and land on her cheeks as she lets out a grunt. Even the pancake you're stuck too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsie.\" says your mother as she looks at her pancake covered butt cheeks. She peels off the pancakes and you're stuck to your mom's behind with maple syrup. You feel like a mole on her behind and can't even move. \"Mom,\" you groan. \"What is with your butt? Is it a magnet for tinies.\" \"I'm sorry honey,\" says your mother as she looks at her behind in the mirror. \"Oh, this is the fourth time this week.\" \"Fourth time?\" you ask. Your mother then rubs her butt against the table to try and shake you off her pachyderm rear. All this succeeds in doing is making you slip and now you're stuck upside down further down your elephant mother's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom grunts and then smacks her cheeks and shakes you around. This was hands down the worst time you've been stuck to an elephant's butt. But then your mother gets an idea and puts her butt in the sink filled with water and scrubs you off onto a sponge. You cough as your mother places you on the table. \"Are you okay honey? I'm really sorry.\" \"I'm fine Mom.\" You grunt. Your mother puts her pancakes back on her plate and places you on top. At your size she obviously expects you to pick away as she eats the pancakes. You take off crumbs the size of human sized pancakes to eat as you and your mother eat breakfast. The pancakes were surprisingly delicious given they had been stuck to an elephant's rear just a second ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your mother notices something. \"What's wrong honey?\" she asks. \"Are you okay.\" \"Oh, I'm uh fine Mom.\" Your Mom lowers her head and her moon sized eye is directly over you. \"Don't lie to your mother sweetie. \"I know something's bothering you.\" You let out a sigh and decide to tell your mother the truth. \"Okay Mom. The thing is... how long have you been an elephant?\" Your mother gives a look of surprise. \"Oh no,\" she said. \"I did it this time...\" \"What?\" you ask. \"What happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother lets out a sigh. \"Honey, I'm not the most graceful woman. But well, you were born with an invulnerable body that can handle being squished by anything twice my size. I've actually been falling and squashing you since you were a baby. I'm afraid all that squashing has damaged your memory.\" \"I'm sorry Mom, I didn't mean. Oh no, it's my fault.\" \"But what about dad.\" Your mother lets out a sigh. \"I have no idea. Your father did a one night stand. You'd think he'd stick around longer since well, I'm the only elephant woman on Earth.\" \"Oh,\" I said. \"Sorry I asked. But how can a giant elephant have a tiny human baby.\" Your mother strokes your head with her trunk. \"Slow down. Honey. I'll explain everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does your mother tell you about first.</span></div></div>",

A panoramic window is cast in a slight shadow suggesting that the sun is up but it's not shining onto your side of the house. Looking round this stately layout you find two doors, one leads out onto a magnificent landing while the other enters a delightful en-suite. During your look around you come upon a photo album titled 'A Family Treasury'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking through this you find some shocking material. In one photo you see yourself as a toddler in a field of white grass, in another you see yourself with your sister and father when you were only about six or seven on some bizarre pink paving with a very weird looking background. Further on you see yourself in your high school uniform standing in more of the earlier-seen white grass with suggestions of the pink paving nearby with a great mass looming in the background. You stop and do a double-take. Flicking back you realise that the white grass was, in fact, fur and the paving was a paw pad, which means the background was the face of a humongous animal of some kind. The scale it was at couldn't have been less than five miles, quite possibly a lot more than that. Leaving you to wonder why you and your family were posing for photographs on such a massive creature; there was not a hint of fear in those faces suggesting that they knew the giant very well and trusted it to extraordinary lengths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear and feel a series of mighty tremors rhythmically reverberating through the edifice like someone was tapping their finger on a tabletop, but these were powerful enough to register on the Richter scale and were coming from the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, kids.\" You hear your mother's voice at a volume you'd expect for her but coming from outside and above your room. \"It's high time you were up.\" Bewildered you go to the window and open the curtains. You are immediately confronted by a giant eye filling your view. It blinks showing eyelashes the size of tree trunks. \"Ah!\" You hear your mother's voice again, this time coming from slightly below and off to the side of you. \"You're up at least, sweetie.\" You gasp in shock at the realisation. This furry behemoth who could drop an entire church down her throat was your mother! She's a titanic...</span></div></div>",

It's not even six o'clock yet.\" The tremors come closer and then you hear a loud crashing noise as if something big and heavy hit the ground. \"Good morning,\" says a feminine voice. \"Wake up my little puppies.\" \"Huh?\" you ask. \"Mom.\" You recognized that voice as your mother's but puppies? \"Uh,\" you say. \"Did Mom just call us puppies.\" Your brother lets out a groan. \"I know. We're way too old for that?\" Before you can ask another question you hear a shaking noise and look out the window to see your house was moving up towards the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on...?!\" Then you see it. It looked like your mother because of her dark hair in a bun and blue eyes. But she was different. She was a titanic Akita inu anthro. She was heavy set just like you remembered your mother being, but at her size, she had to be hundreds of miles. One of her eyes alone was way bigger than any skyscraper you could think of and your house was a crumb to her. In the background you see several mountains filled with caverns. Your house was a cottage which meant this mountainside was where your gargantuan mother made her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back but your brother just walks forward. \"Morning Mom.\" he says so calmly as this gigantic beast woman smiles down on you both and brings you closer to her face.</span></div></div>",

Ouch.\" You grab your head and you realize that your vision is blurry, so you put on your glasses. You look around and you see that you're in a middle school and that you're in the nurse's office. \"What the?\" you ask. You then groan and see that you're covered in bandages on your head, arm and leg. Apparently you had just recently been injured. You see that you're wearing a soccer uniform so that's probably how you got hurt to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then turn to see the school nurse on the phone. She hung up upon seeing you were awake. \"Oh,\" says the nurse. \"Thank goodness you're awake. That was quite a nasty fall you took.\" \"A fall?\" you ask. \"What fall?\" The nurse let out a sigh. \"Just as I thought. That spill you took on the field caused you to hit your head. I'd say you have a mild case of memory loss but nothing serious. You'll just have to lay low for a while. And soccer practice is definitely out of the question.\" You try to walk but you grunt because your leg is still in pain and the nurse has to stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really shouldn't be moving around like that. You're going to reopen your wounds again. Don't worry. I already contacted your mother, she'll be here in a minute.\" That confused you. You knew for a fact that your mom was currently at work. How could she possibly be able to reach the school in only a minute. \"But that's....\" Before you can continue there was a shaking noise and the nurse ducked to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire school was being shaken up by the quake and the floor even cracked slightly. \"What's going on?! A quake?!\" The nurse let out a sigh. \"Not a serious earthquake. Just your mother approaching.\" You raise an eyebrow. You knew that your mother was more than a little on the plump side but there was no way she was heavy enough to cause an earthquake. Before you could question any further, the nurse starts to lead you out. \"I still have no idea how that woman can exist or how she could've possibly given birth to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, you look forward and see something that catches you by surprise. There is a large hoof that appears to be bigger than your school right in front of you. You look up and then you see the owner of the foot. She was an absolutely massive 5 miles high anthropomorphic bison. She had bright brown fur with long black hair that was worn in an afro and large curved horns. She was also very obese with a large bulging belly, a monstrous butt and a pair of E-cup (in scale) breasts as well as an udder as big as her head. She was also wearing a skin-tight pair of jeans that looked like they were coming apart along with a red jacket and black A-shirt. You'd swear that this buffalo giantess looked like... no, it couldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then the buffalo giantess looks down on you in concern. \"Oh my gosh!\" she yells in your mother's voice. \"Are you alright, Darling?\" You couldn't believe it. It appeared that the buffalo woman was your mother. Looks like your headache is the least of your problems.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awake with a start after your vivid dream, your mind still trying to comprehend what you have just seen. As expected, the vast majority of that dream is cloudy and indescribable, but it did not feel like being entrapped in a living nightmare. It was more like that of a distant memory which, even now, can only be seen by the unconscious mind, and what ever it was, you felt entirely safe and carefree of any dangers the vision may have presented. You also felt some strange form of familiarity towards it, as if you yourself knew that very entity your entire life. 'It doesn't matter,' You thought to yourself, 'it was only a dream'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift yourself up and glance around to ensure you were no longer half asleep. Through drowsy eyes, you see that everything is still bitch black, giving the instant assumption that it was still the dead of night. Though this appeared to be your room, you can't even see the windows or the bed which you lay upon, which now seems all the more inviting now that you have awoken from your deep sleep. Satisfied that nothing was amiss, you happily return to the warm, soft, furry confines of your bed and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait. What?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shoot back up again, suddenly feeling more alert then ever before. Rubbing the sleep from your eyes, you feel around for the switch of a bed light lamp. Your hand grasped not the switch for the light lamp, but only more of the same strands of fur that you lay upon, which only now you realise are much bigger that anything you felt before. You also realise that there is something else that was rather off about your 'bed'. The entire surface resonated with a strange bodily heat, and (where you thought it was your own imagination deceiving you) is heaving up and down, as if it were taking in large quantities of air whilst it too was in a state of slumber. While you sat up bolt up right and fighting impulse to make a run for it, you realise that all your movements had caused the entire, unseen massive landscape to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was waking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a deep, resonating male voice suddenly broke the tense silence, shaking you to your very core.<br>\r\n\"Is that you, my child?\" The voice spoke, a hint sleepiness in his voice.<br>\r\nThe nameless entity sounded as if he were a great and mighty God was speaking from the very heavens themselves, yet somehow you were not scared by it. There something comforting about the way it spoke. Familiar even. You struggle to lift yourself up and stand above the great strands of fur towering above you. Whatever you were doing caught the entity's attention, as he spoke once more in the same, rumbling tone. \"Having trouble?\" It asked, almost inquisitively. \"Here. Let me help.\"<br>\r\nAt this, the 'roof' above your head began to move. The great ceiling of your resting spot began to lift, sending a ray of morning sunlight directly upon you. After shielding your eyes from the sudden in burst of light, you eyes adjust just in time to see the the large roof above you was in fact...<br>\r\n...a hand. Or is it a paw? It looks like it is both. But that isn't the most astonishing fact about it. What could been seen as a normal sized hand paw, looks more like the size of an entire city block, if not larger. The great palm was covered in more of the same strands of fur, now seen as coloured in deep grey and brown coat. The tips of each finger have humongous, sharpened claws that look like they could easily skewer through reinforced concrete. It hoovers above you for what feels like an eternity, before bringing forth the fore and thumb finger directly where you are standing. You only stare in both fascination and horror as the great digits surround you, finally pinching between two leathery patches that not even two whole football pitches could fill. They then lift you firmly but ever so gently from the bed of fur you slept in, bringing you higher and higher until you start to recognise the scenery before you. The field of fur you were confined to beyond to that of a great, masculine chest, complete with well shaped pecs and six packed abs, all clad in same brown and greying fur. Judging by where you were last plucked from, it looks like you were rest just in between the central area of the chest, nestled neatly in the vast mountains of muscle of fur and muscle. Just from this height, you can easily assume that this creature which you have slept upon had to be at least 100 times larger than that of an average human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance up to see if you can face this unimaginable being, but could only feel your stomach drop at the site that met your gaze. Just in front of you, there was the largest, most terrifying maw you have ever seen. White, sharp canine teeth glisten in the light, each of which were the size of a skyscraper, the fangs would put the highest building in the world to shame. Behind them, lay the great, colossal tongue which, if so inclined, could easily slurp up an entire army in one go. And just at the very back of the maw itself, lies the uvula swaying back and forth, hanging just above the gaping bottomless pit that was the gullet. From it comes great washes of warm air, with enough force to match a hurricane, making you clench to the strands of surrounding fur for support. For a horrible, brief moment, you think that the massive creature was going to swallow you up as a measly snack. Thankfully, it proves to be untrue, as the great maw closes after what turns out to be a simple yawn, smacking a few times in satisfaction. 'If that was just a yawn,' you thought worryingly to yourself, 'I would hate to see what happens if he sneezes.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the the maw closed, you finally come face to face with this god like creature. The face, (if you could call it one) was in the form of a wolf's head. His monolithic, pointed ears swivels in your direction, trying to listen in to any sounds you may emit. His seemingly mile long nose was finished with the usual black nose, save for his gaping nostrils which continued to suck in air at an incredible magnitude, each looking like they could sniff up a whole acre of forrest if the wolf tried. As with the rest of his body, the Wolf had the same golden brown fur with some of the similarly greying patches dotted around his muzzle, indicating some early signs of experienced age. The wolf finally opens his dreary eyes, revealing great golden coloured irises with great deep pupils situated in their centres, still adjusting to the morning rays streaming in this seemingly endless room. They then focus themselves upon your tiny form still plucked in between the giant finger and thumb. You cannot help but whimper slightly in fear of what may come next, whether this predatory animal will simply eat you or perhaps just squish you there and then. But to your great surprise, the titan of a wolf simply smiles warmly at the sight of you, with the same admiration of a father would give to his beloved child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this instance, that may very well be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the fingers holding you aloft begin to bring you toward the wolf's maw, stopping only just before his great, black lips. You brace yourself for whatever the wolf intended to do. The giant lips part slightly and the giant tongue you saw earlier came out, already wet with saliva. Upon seeing this spectacle, you close your eyes and turn away, not wanting to see what was happening. The tongue came into contact with your tiny body, bringing itself up and coating you with mass amounts of spit. While it did appear un appealing from a distance, you realise that the wolf wasn't doing anything to harm you. On the contrary: It appears he is only giving you a sign of complete and utter affection, like a family dog giving his love to his beloved owner. He continues to lick you a few times more until he pulls you away and brings you once more to his gaze. No longer feeling any sort of danger, you gaze again into his golden, now affectionate eyes. As you struggle to find something positive to say to the wolf, he does the job for by saying a few kind words of his own. But what comes out of the wolf's muzzle only makes you more stunned and confused than ever before:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my dear child.\" He says gently to you with his deep, rumbling voice. \"How was your sleep with your Father?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You can only stare in both confusion and disbelief at the titan wolf's statement. Not only was he a being as large as a city and possessed a great deal of power that could easily wipe you out of excistance if he so wished, but also claims to be related to you in blood. Your Father no less. Your mind fails to comprehend how a speck of a human could be anyway related to this god like wolf, and how he could even care for a tiny dot of a child such as yourself without much in the way of ordeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour state of dismay has not gone unnoticed by the wolf, as his expression changes quickly from that of caring and loving, to that of genuine concern and worry. \"My dear child!\" He exclaimed softly, bringing you close to his golden eyes, now filled with anxiety. \"Are you alright? You look as if you just seen a ghost.\"<br>\r\nAlready an irrepressible feeling of guilt rises up within you after hearing your Father's comforting voice. You know that he is very well the meaning of your current state of emotions and loss for words, but as you see the true love and care reflected in those golden eyes of his, you cannot bring yourself to admit it, in fear you may hurt his feelings. Somehow you knew that deep down, despite your disbelief, this colossal wolf is indeed your father and would do anything to ensure your well being. He asks again, with a hint of suppressed guilt in his voice. \"It has... nothing to do with me. Is it?\"<br>\r\n\"No...\" You finally spoke, only hoping that your Father could hear your miniature voice. \"It's not that. I just woke up from a really vivid dream last night, and I wasn't too sure if I were still asleep or not. You just caught me by surprise is all\" You rub the back of your head, averting you gaze in an attempt to cover up your little white lie. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to worry you...\" You paused hesitantly before finishing with; \"...Dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you glance back at his expansive face, you expect for him to gaze back you with a look of distrust or sadness. But you see only a warm, broad smile stretched across your Father's massive muzzle and a bright gleam in his eye. He once again moves you towards his moist, leathery lips, this time puckering them as you are pressed against them in what could very well have been the biggest kiss you ever had (Yet somehow felt this isn't the first nor the last time this will happen). Your Father finishes his kiss and then lowers you once more to his landscape like chest, still brimming with thick fur and hardened muscle. After releasing you from his grip and placing you between his mountainous pecs, he then rests both of his gigantic, padded paw hands on top of you, embracing you gently against his miles high form. \"No need to apologise, my little one.\" Your Father spoke, almost in tune. \"So long as you're still safe and healthy as ever, I can never feel any happier.\" <br>\r\nYou can't help but feel a warm, heavenly sensation as your Father hugged you tightly, only emphasising how much this incredible creature you've just met loves you with every fibre of his being. However, you still cannot not shake off the feeling of shame still evident in your mind, as you indeed feel a great deal of affection towards the wolf, but fail to recollect a single memory or shared experiance with him for your entire life. Perhaps you could somehow ask your Father about your past without making him knowing and worrying about your evident memory loss. That didn't matter know, for you simply return the hug as much as you could, enjoying this one happy moment between Father and child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway!\" Your Father finally says after what seemed like an hour, \"Let's get up now, shall we?Your Father frees you from the embrace and begins to prop himself up from the bed, practically shaking the world around you as he rose. You began to slide gracefully downwards, thinking that you may end up being stuck further down your Father!s titanic body. Thankfully, the wolf had already brought his hand underneath to stop your rapid decent, coushening you with his big centre paw pad, which end looks like it could hold a whole market place on there. You then bring yourself to the palm of your Father's hand, allowing you to see his other hand which moves to remove the duvet that covered the lower half of his body. As he whisked away the covers, you see that he has astonishingly large muscle calves, snapped perfectly like that of a body builder. The legs ended with similarly canine yet humanoid feet, with four furry toes on each one, which seem to large enough to crush a house even with just the smallest one. You make a mental note not to dwell around his feet whenever your on the ground. You realise that your father is almost completely naked save for a tight pair of briefs which he wore over his crotch, which gave you a very clear view of his... Well... Shall you say... overwhelmingly humongous package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then swings both his legs over the side of his bed, which you can hear each of his gigantic feet paws land with a distant and soft boom, which you could feel even from all the way up in your Father's palm. The wolf then stands up fully, giving you an extreme feeling of vertigo even when you're not looking down, just before he stretches out his whole muscle built body, giving out such a load moan, that it could wake up an entire city scape should he be near one. He relaxes, sighing in relief as he drops his arm back to his side, before looking back down at your tiny form, marveling at the mind boggling spectacle before you. Your Father only chuckles in response at your possibly dumbfounded expression. He smiles again before saying; \"So, shall we go and...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grasped onto his paw fur to steady yourself, but needn't have as your Father kept you perfectly leveled leaving you with the chance to look around. Directly behind you was the thigh of your Father, and as you watched the muscle stretch and contract you realized just how built your Father was! Apparently this huge wolf was your Father! Just his hand was the size of a city block, and apparently this wolf was your Father?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think more into it, you took a breath in and noticed a strange smell in the air. You looked around to see the paw had moved closer to your Father's... package, and a quick sniff in the general direction of it confirmed the smell and with embarrassment you realized your dear Father must be in heat! The musky smell filled the air and it seemed only your small sensitive nose could smell it! You turned away having became bright red to realize that your father had reached the bathroom.<br>\r\n\"Well, you know how the usual routine goes, time to wash child!\" Said your Father, happily gazing at you. With embarrassment, you realized he wanted you to strip! A few seconds passed with you wishing the ground, or rather his paw, would swallow you up before his eyes began conveying a look of concern, he only wanted the best for you! Well, if you couldn't even trust your own \"Father\" then where did that leave you? With a sigh, you began taking your clothes off and now you were standing fully nude in your Father's paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly moved you down and he placed you on a stool, checking to make sure you were stable, he let your clothes slide down his paw next to you, withdrew his hand and backed off. Before you could ask what he was doing, he moved his paw to the side of his tight, black briefs and lowered them to the ground, stepping out of the leg-holes with 2 deafening bangs. When you opened your eyes your father was standing completely nude having discarded his briefs on the bathroom floor looking at you. You had only seen his package covered by briefs before, and if his palm was the size of a city block, then his package was a huge city! The pubic fur looked well kept, trimmed slightly, enough to see his package in full glory. Before you could observe more, the noise of your Father's paw hitting the stool sounded, and you looked to the side to see your Father's paw. He motioned for you to get on it and when you did he rose up towards the sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father deposited you on the rim of the sink and motioned for you to slide in. You hesitated and decided to wait for your Father to put you in gently, you looked up to see your Father staring up at the cabinet above you and he began reaching for it. A shadow appeared and suddenly your Father's cock prodded you gently, unknown to your Father, and you slid down into the sink. Having got the item he was looking for your Father got off his tiptoes and suddenly he moved his hand carrying a bottle, he squirted a little and dabbed his paw-print in it before touching a surface close to you. It left a paw-print of shampoo which you moved towards and grabbed a handful of the shampoo before rubbing it into your hair. Your Father then told you to back away from the taps and he turned one on lightly, to you it was like a waterfall! He placed a finger/paw under it then turned it off. He held it over you and let it drip down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the first drop hits you get down on your knees and splutter. Your Father quickly pulls his paw away in concern and checks you to see if you're alright and decides that you're clean enough for now. He holds you against his muscular eight pack and you can faintly hear his strong heartbeat before he sets you back on the stool.<br>\r\n\"Now that that's done with, you head off to breakfast my child, I'll be there shortly after I wash.\" And with that he left. You had no idea what way it was to breakfast so you just began walking on the stool hoping to find the way off. You reach an edge of the stool and see no way but before you can turn around the door closes and leaves a breeze which knocks you off. You fall screaming but somehow manage to survive the fall! You were cushioned by something soft! You look down at notice it's some sort of black fabric, you walk around for a few minutes before you tug your foot only to fall over! You see it's tangled in something and after looking you realize with horror it's pubic fur, you're in your Father's briefs! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes pass and your Father returns, he has his towel and leaves it on the stool. He picks up his briefs, walks into the shower hooks them on the shower hook and proceeds to wash himself. Where are you during all of this?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were about to let out a sigh of relief when suddenly something else slides by you. Looking to your left you see you barely missed another horrendous death. His cock was ginormous and thankfully limp. Never did you think you would be in a wolf's briefs and looking at a cock that could flood a city in pre-cum. The musk from earlier was now visible and acting like a light fog engulfing you in heat. This was too much and there was only one way you could see yourself getting out of this. One way... and it was not pretty. \"I'm going to have to turn him on...\" you said with great reluctance. At your size there was no way you could climb out of here and live to tell the tale, but getting him off was definetly not going to be a walk in the park. Many risks were involved and if you brought him to an orgasm or worse he lost control of his urges, you could possibly die. \"Is this really the only way?\" you whisper under your breath. The plan was to turn him on enough for him to notice you were down there. Sure it was a stupid plan, but what else could you do?! \"Alright well there is no use in just sitting here until he shifts, lays down, or worse\" (You don't want to die). \"Let's get started!\" You say with suppressed fear. Walking over to his shealth took about 3 minutes and once you were next to it you were sweating. The heat was tremendous! \"Uhhhh let's see\" you say as you put one hand on it and slide by. \"I thought it would be a lot more responsive, but my presence must not have any aff-\" Only after a few stokes his cock was starting to expand, he was sure deprived of a mate and ready to go at any time. You were starting to hear a a response above as well, but not in a good way... massive moans were starting to rumble from your \"father\" and they were only getting louder. \"Mmmm Wow I guess I could go for a little while, my son must of gone off into town\". \"Uh oh\" was all you could manage to say before a hand was brought down to pull off the briefs. Light burst into your face and towering above you there was an anthro wolf's face covered with pleasure. Oh! Let's not forget the cock you were next to was growing faster than ever! \"I've got to run now! It's going to take forever to get away and he could blow any second!\" You say with great amounts of fear!  The plan had gone south and it looks like there was never really any clear way of survival. The wolf started to masturbate and the great amounts of wind generated kept knocking you down! The warm body you ran on began to feel like an earthquake as his hand smashed over and over into his crouch. You kept running, but you were not even an 3 inches away from his towering and now trembling Cock. A giant shadows moved over you and it was his hand! \"It... no it can't be! Already?\" You thought yo yourself! Turning around quickly you saw a swaying and trembling Cock. With one last twitch it BURST! Semen blocked the light in the sky and came crashing down like a comet. Gallons and gallons of the liquid fell down upon you and it become a swimming game. Your life was officially on the line and with the amounts of semen you were currently taking in, it was not looking good. Swimming through the semen was difficult and no easy task. It was thick, hot, and hard to see through. Gasping for some sort of air was only rewarding you in cum and one step closer to death. Finally swimming to the surface you grabbed all the air you could inhale and floated for a second in the wolfs semen. \"Well... at least I'm out...\" </span></div></div>",

You flatten yourself against ground as the great beast's foot paw narrowly swoops over you, creating a great gust of wind as it goes. The paw then lands at least a few hundred yards from were your standing and with it, came a deep yet surprisingly gentle rumble that is enough to make you jump back on you feet and reverberate throughout the area. As you look up, you see your Godly Father continuing to make his way towards the shower, apparently oblivious of the fact that he almost crushed you just moments ago. He hangs his briefs and towel on the shower rack and proceeding to step into the shower, closing the curtain as he does so. 'Are all anthro wolves always this careless?' you think to yourself. You couldn't imagine what your mother must have gone through in order to live with your Father, let alone have a child together that is barely the size of a crumb compared to the wolf. You suppose that you just need to adapt to this new life in order to get a grasp of things, as well as try to gain your lost memories back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile your Father washes and sings a merry tune, you take the opertunity to explore the rest of the  house beyond the door, which has just been left ajar by the Wolf's entrance. It takes you a fair while to reach the opening as the length of the bathroom exceeded that of a few kilometres in your size, and by then you are already chilled to the bone without any clothes. How your Father expected to find a way around this place without his assistance is beyond you, considering the fact it would take the best part of the day to walk around the entire premises once and not get lost. At long last though, you manage to walk through the opening to the hall, giving you a chance to glance around this strange new world you have been brought into. The hall of the house resembled that of a large, woodland cabin, complete with oaken furniture, a stonework fireplace, wooden window frames and large, tribal looking decors mounted on the logged walls. A large, alpen sofa was positioned in the middle of the room, facing a similarly wooden table placed in between two identical reclining chairs. All of which are facing a massive flat screen TV with large surround sound speakers and what looked like a skyscraper sized Blu-Ray player positioned at the bottom. It all looks what an everyday household should be like, aside from the fact you have to crane your neck in order to look up at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you glance to your right, you spot a large stone mantelpiece, with a wide, shiny mirror positioned on the wall above it. Upon the structure are an assortment of picture frames, which aren't as large as the other furniture in the room, but was clear enough to see the content of the pictures from a fair distance away. From a distance you recognised the wide, beaming grin of your Father, who was apparently showing of his impressive physique to the camera, posing and flexing his muscles as if he were in some kind of Godzilla like bodybuilding competition. Many of the photos features only your Father, but one of the other photos placed in the middle of the display showed a very different individual in the picture. The photo was that of a beautiful, long haired woman in a summertime dress. She is smiling back at camera with a look of absolute joy and love in her eyes, as if nothing in the world could spoil her happiness. As you look carefully in the background of the shot, you realise that there is nothing except for a large, furry wall that looked strikingly similar that of your Father. You gather he was there at the time of the shoot, clearly unable to be seen in the rest of the picture. You also realise that your mother is holding something in her arms, which on closer inspection recognise as a bundle of blankets. In the opening of the covers was the face of a small newborn baby, sleeping as the woman cradles the infant in her arms. You then immediately realise that the baby in the wraps must be you, and that the woman holding you is none other than your own mother. She must have been overjoyed with you being born into the world, it must have been the best moment of her life. You can clearly see a resemblance of yourself in her image, but the question of how she had developed a relationship with a miles high wolf anthro and managed to have a human child of normal size, as well as how you cannot remember so much as a fleeting glimpse of your past life still rings true in your head. Perhaps you should take this up with your Father sometime, even if you feel that he is somehow he is partly responsible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear the sounds coming from the bathroom behind you. You realise that it's...</span></div></div>",

He steps out of the shower, still dripping with gallons of water from his shaggy fur coat, his eyes hidden behind overhanging head hair. Just then, he lowered onto all fours and began to shake himself vigorously, causing floods of droplets to fly in multiple directions around the bathroom, some as far as you now stood though thankfully not enough to get you soaked again. It would seem that the Wolf still retained the traits of a common canine, minus the fact that he walks and talks like an everyday human. Your Father then arises and grabs the towel on the shower rack, rubbing it all over his brown and greying fur all across his finely tuned stature. He continues to rub his face as he begins to walk straight towards the bathroom entrance, still unbeknownst about your current position on the vast tiled floor. With each thundering step, you fear that he may not notice you on the ground as he did before, that you may very well end up as a speck of dirt that will end up stuck at the bottom of your Father's mighty footpaw. There was no use you being able to run away either, since there is a considerable amount of distance to cover to steer clear of the potential hazard soon to be hanging over your head. Though your chances were significantly slim, you decide it was best to give at least one idea in your mind a try.

Your thoughts were interrupted by... \"Child are you awake?\" Then you yelled. \"Yes, Dad!\" Then the roof over you opens and a fore finger and thumb plucks you out of the forest of fur and up to the Wolf's mile long muzzle. He then says. \"I'm Sorry! Are you okay? Are you hurt?\" Then you reply sincerely. \"I'm okay. I'm okay. It's my fault! I should have been more careful.\" You are then lowered back down onto his chest and embraced in another hug, but it felt different this time. You hug back and try to comfort his guilt and concern. \"I'm okay.\" You repeated. You felt really bad, but then he replies deeply. \"I'm glad! I wouldn't be able to live without you my Child.\" You start to cry and feel some sort of bond between him and you. Then you think to yourself. \"I remember this feeling. But why can't I remember Dad, Mom, or anything?\" He then raises you back up to his tear filled eyes and says. \"Should we get to breakfast?\" <br>\r\n\"Sure.\" You reply. \"But first can I get some clothes on!?\" \"Sure my Child.\" He said as he chuckled.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having quickly getting yourself dressed in your own suitably sized wardrobe with a pair of jeans, T-shirt, white socks and walking boots, you then make your way back to your Father. From atop of a chest of draws overlooking the bedroom, you watch as your Father dresses in his own super sized clothes which included a fresh pair of underwear, a white tank top and red running short shorts. All of which begin to strain against the sheer amount of muscle on the Wolf's body. You briefly wonder how he managed to find clothes his size and who in the world would be able to make such clothes for a miles tall wolf. You make a mental note to yourself to ask him when the time was right, among many other questions that remain to be answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father then makes his way across the bedroom towards the set of draws, once again causing small quakes as he went, and lowers his outstretched hand for you to hop on. Now feeling confident in your Father's ability to handle you safely, you obediently jump on to his index paw-finger and casually make your way to your Father's padded palm. After sitting yourself down in a comfy position, your Father brings his hand in closely towards his chest, obliviously ensuring that you don't have a nasty fall again. He then begins to make his way through the house, once again passing the living room area and the large mantelpiece where the pictures of your Mother, Father and you all sat neatly in a row. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mere seconds which would have taken you nearly half the day to reach by your own, the both of you enter the kitchen which feature the same wooden furniture as the rest of the house, including a round table, one or two chairs with soft seats and several cupboards all around the room. There are however several usual appliances such as a fully electric oven and cooker, a microwave and even a blending machine which looks as if it was capable of grinding up an entire building with it's massive sharp blades and large jug. After a brief examination of the massive kitchen, your Father sets you down on the table and begins to walk to a gigantic, retro looking fringe and pokes his head inside to see what's inside, his tail wagging like an expectant dog awaiting his meal. \"So!\" He asks you looking over his shoulder with an energetic smile on his muzzle. \"What would you like for breakfast?\" After taking in the sights of the kitchen, you briefly forgotten about what you would like to eat, let alone trying eat something the size of a landscape. So you quickly think of the first thing that comes to mind a say:<br>\r\n \"Um, may I have some eggs, bacon and toast please?\" You think that would rather ludicrous especially by you Father's standards, but he simply smiles back at you. \"Course you can! I was just about to have that myself!\" <br>\r\nWith that, he brings out a large packet of bacon, a carton of eggs, a slab of butter and a loaf of brown bread from the fridge and proceeds over to the cooker. You sit there amazed by the fact there are titan sized food being displayed on the work top, in which getting this kind food practically impossible to obtain were it not for the fact that there was a giant wolf living in the world. You watch as your Father proceeds to put two slices of bread in the toaster, cracks two eggs into the frying pan and two pieces of bacon on top of a baking tray with tin foil and shove it straight into the oven. With breakfast cooking, he then heads over to the cupboard and brings out a plate the size of a small village and a knife and fork from one of the cutlery draws. He also brings out what looks like a tiny box which contained some sort of human sized equipment. You then realise that the box contained a collection on human sized plates, bowls cutlery and an identical round table to the one you are on all laid out for such an occasion. You have give the old Wolf credit: He certainly knew how to keep prepared for having such a tiny member of the family here. \"Hey Dad?\" You ask him whilst he was tending to breakfast. \"How did you manage to get all of this kitchen appliances that are both your sizes and mine?\" The Wolf glanced back over his shoulder to look at you, a kind of bemused expression evident on his face.<br>\r\n \"Well, it certainly wasn't easy.\" He explained. \"Finding some suitable equipment for any human guests coming round would be a bit of a hastle when your trying to persuade the local populace that a gigantic beast would like to buy some household appliances that I could barely see. As for the equipment my size, aha...\" He scratched the underside of his muzzle, a somewhat awkward grin forming along side it. \"Let's just say that it had to kept strictly business as not arouse any suspicions to the companies involved supplying the equipment. They must have suspected that I was using it all to cook all my guests and have them for breakfast instead! Ha!\" He chortles, slapping his thick leg as he did so. \"As if I would have tiny humans for dinner. I never hurt a soul in my life!\" He looks back at you and seeing the wide eyed expression on your face, he quickly added: \"That is... I never intentionally harmed anyone. Always have to be careful when dealing with such fragile, sentient people like yourself.\" He quickly looks away as if embarrassed. That is when another question came to your mind: \"Do you have many guests round here?\"  You ask polity, so as not to make your Father feel any more embarrassed than he is. He shrugs casually. \"From time to time. They mostly come round to inspect the place and see how I'm getting on. I greet them as equals and they do the same with me. Honestly it just helps to give them peace of mind that I'm the kind of giant creature that's likely to go on a blood thirsty rampage.\" He then gives you a kind, but also weak smile as if resigning to some sad truth. \"It's not easy being big. And it can be pretty lonely out here when either people are not interested or too scared to come visit. That's why I'm always happy to know that you're here. That I still have family to spend time with.\" <br>\r\nYou couldn't help but feel a little sad yourself, for this big wolf with his gigantic size and overwhelming power has to deal with a world that barely accepts him, that sees him more of a monster than a person, despite the fact he the most caring and kind hearted individual you've ever known. You cannot begin to express how fortunate you are to have such a relative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several long minutes, your Father's expression lightens up again as he spots the cooking meal. \"Ah! Breakfast's ready!\" He exclaimed excitedly. He dishes out the the eggs, toast and bacon and places them all on his plate, the waft of the food enticing your nostrils as they appear before you. Your Father sits down at the table just beside you and begins tearing off several small pieces of buttered toast, egg and bacon and handed ithem over to your own plate. It was all rather large compared to you, around the same size of boulders from a crumbling mountain, though judging by the fact your stomach is rumbling from sheer hunger persuaded you that you were perfectly capable of finishing the lot. \"Thanks Dad!\" You call back up to him, giving you a smile back. <br>\r\n\"Don't mention it, my dear! Now help yourself.\" As you begin to tuck in, you watch as your Father did the same, only that he is positively 'wolfing' his down in such hungry chomps that you almost feel it's happening in fast forward. His knife and fork cuts, pokes and slices at the meal and sends the pieces of food flying into his open maw which continues to chomp, mash and swallow in gusto. Even his eyes seem to have changed, which were once calm and soft looking were now hungry and savaging like an actual predator ripping into his prey. You only hope you don't have to look into those eyes anytime soon, or end up in that fanged riddled maw by accident. After what seems like seconds to you, the big Wolf gives one last gulp of his meal and sighs in satisfaction. He even gives out a mighty belch which was enough to set off a hundred car alarms. You can only cover your ears and grin back up at him in amusement. \"Nice one Dad!\" You say to him. He grins back at you, reminding you of a naughty school boy who had just committed a mischievous prank. \"Sorry about that.\" He replies in mock apology. \"Old habits die hard as you people like to say. I'm still living by my old wolfish ways.\" He notices that you've hardly managed to eat halfway through your meal yet and folds his arms over his head and leans back on the chair. \"You take your time child.\" He says, closing eyes and relaxing his now normal eyes. \"I'm just going to lay back and let my meal digest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to finish your meal until you're down to the last crumb and feeling quite content yourself. Before you begin to finish up however, another question comes to mind. It arouse just when you remembered what your Father said about people being too scarred about meeting him and how he managed to sustain a life for himself in a world full of tiny people. You also remember the photos of your mother and how happy she looked with you in her arms and your Father barely seen in the background. How he said that you being here was the happiest he'd ever been knowing he still had a family. You look back up at your Father and wonder if he's ready to answer any of your seemingly endless questions. After all, he is the only key to unraveling your lost past. \"Dad? Can I ask you something?\" The wolf opened an eye to look back down at you. \"Of course.\" He said kindly. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\nYou decide what it is you like to know about and ask...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost immediately after you pop the question, you Father opens both of his eyes to look down at you. He then brings himself back forward and brings his hands back down on the table, a look of mild surprise on his face. \"Oh. Well...\" He replied, scratching the side of muzzle as he tries to think of the best answer to your question. \"I didn't think you would ask that. I always assumed your Mother would have told you beforehand or that you simply didn't care why.\" You only stare back back up at him, the need for answers too strong to hold back on. \"I know it seems kind of out of the blue.\" You reply, simply keeping things as kindhearted as possible. \"It's just that I wanted to understand how you two became close despite your species and sizes.\" You lower your head in hesitation, not quite sure how you can put being born from the colossal entity into words. \"And... how you two had me.\" You're not sure how your Father would react to this, if fact you're quite sure he feels just as uncertain as you do about the relationship between the two of them. But suddenly, you feel a massive paw finger gently stroke you head, and then look up to see the Big Wolf smiling back down at you, a true Fatherly expression spread across his muzzle. \"Of course, my child.\" He replies in his deep, affectionate voice. \"You have the right to know how it all started between your Mother and I as well as how you came to be.\" <br>\r\nHe then lowers his paw and motions for you to clamber on. You obediently climb up to the centre of his paw and lie yourself down so as to get a better view of your looming Father. Propping his elbow upon the table, he scratches the under side of his muzzle trying to think of the best way to begin the story. \"Let's see.\" He says pondering to himself. \"Where to start...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a year before you were born, I was traveling a fair distance away from where I used to live to explore the outside world, since I was more of a 'lone wolf' compared to most others of my kind. Anyway, I had just made it to the outer ridges of the mountain range that divided the two lands when I came across a rather peculiar group of people traveling along one the old forgotten roads leading through the forrest. I heard about tiny people like before when I was a cub, so I was curious to see what they were like up close. Through stealth and the cover of night, I learned that they were a research group trying to find evidence of large sentient life living just beyond the range. Since I overhead one of them talking about discovering intelligent life, I thought I might introduce myself to help verify their theory. So I made myself known by greeting them in the most welcoming, friendly manner I could think of: A Howling of welcome. The people however, being the tiny defenceless beings that they were, took the message to that of \"I'm going to eat you!\" rather than \"Greetings friends!\" Naturally, nearly all of them ran away from the sight of me. One of which, much to my distaste, left one of their partners behind in favour of saving himself. That left only one of them brave enough to meet me face to face: a woman in fact. Perhaps the most beautiful creature I had ever laid eyes upon.She never screamed, never cried or tried to fight me off. She simply approached me, as if hypnotised by my mass and size, but also my actions since I did not attack nor ran after the others. I too felt compelled to see this woman for who she was rather than judging by her species. As such, I offered a hand of friendship and she accepted, clambered onto my paw and I brought her up to see her. At that moment, I suddenly felt a strong emotion the minute I gazed upon her. An emotion that made my heart race and developed a strong desire to keep this woman close. To keep her safe. It was that moment onward that I realised something I haven't felt since leaving my lands and supposed family behind: I had fallen in love. It was then she spoke to me, telling me that she never met a creature such as I, and asked ever me so kindly to take her in and learn so much more about me. Judging by the way she asked, she must have felt the same way about me too, so I gladly took her and the remainder of her gear to the safety of a nearby cave where we settled down for the best part of the week. From there, we talked away for hours on end, learning about her culture and way of life, whilst I told her about me leaving my people to explore the world on my own. We became really close as time went on, so much so that I became all the more evident for my true feelings toward her. She obviously took notice of this and so, one night, she asked me how I really felt about her and that she won't hold it against me if I was honest. So... after much effort on my part, I told her she was unlike any other person I've met. That she made me the happiest I have ever been in my life. And, with every fibre of my being, I would look after her no matter what happens to me.<br>\r\nAnd that is when I said... that I was in love with her.<br>\r\nI felt foolish immediately afterwards, knowing that such a relationship was simply impossible to conceive. That it simply could not happen. But then she told me something that would never forget, something that made my spirits soar. She told me me that, as strange as it sounded to her, she felt the very same way about me, and she would gladly spend the rest of her life with me if she had to. I simply could not be fortunate enough to have someone like that accepting me for who I was, for being treated as an equal rather than a horrible beast. That is when we realised, that we could be more than just friends from there on. I wanted her so badly, and she me. Shortly after confessing to one another, we had our first kiss, we cuddled, showed our affections and... aha. Let's say that one thing led to another and... we truly bonded. We became one, in a matter of speaking. It was truly a wonderful night...<br>\r\nThe next morning, we agreed that I would take her back to her people to prove that she was alive and well and to prove I was no threat. It proved much easier than anticipated, as a rescue team was dispatched just before we arrived her home area. They was just about ready to call the military despite my best efforts to calm them, but then they spotted the woman in my paw and rushed to her \"rescue.\" As a matter of fact, the one who abandoned her beforehand, 'Harold' was his name, came immediately towards her and told her how he was so sorry that he had ever left her in the first place, and he certainly didn't hesitate to through a few insulting words my way as well. She of course didn't buy it and slapped him across the face, telling him it was over between the two of them. He certainly wasn't happy I can tell you that. She then explained to the team that I meant no harm and that they were all perfectly safe when around me. A few were reluctant, but after I finally convinced them I came in peace, they started to warm up to me, even so much as to ask if they could examine me for testing. When my existence became known to your government however, they felt it best that I should find a home further away from the populace, though still providing services to the community in exchange. With that, they provided the necessary equipment to build my new home and I set about living and working for the good people of this world. As for the woman. We did see each other for a while, talking about how we can live out her lives together and what we could do to improve the lives of others. But alas, fate got in the way of things. The company in which your mother worked for stated that it was the best of intensions to not let our lives intermingle as to not hinder their progress with their research upon me. Obviously, they simply disliked the idea that we should be seen together, as they probably saw it as \"unnatural\" to see a human woman and a miles tall wolf being with each other. She would have disagreed, but she would also lose her job if she objected. So we decided it was best that we should stay separately until we would be permitted to see each other again. So we parted ways, and I was left alone in my home, waiting for the day she would return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare up in astonishment at the wolf after he finished his tale. It was quite the story, but certainly something that needed to be seen to be believed. You Father is looking back at you with his golden eyes, which seem to glimmer in a kind of sad adornment. \"As you may know by now,\" Your Father continued. \"That woman was your mother. She went through a lot when it came to public media attention, claiming that she was \"The woman who tamed The Colossal Wolf.\" True in a sense, but not the way they imagined it.\" Your Father leans back on his chair, suddenly looking more saddened than he was before. \"I tried to see her many times, but she was always working, as was I still striving to be a valued member of the community. Helping with construction projects, era search and development and so on. Eventually I started to lose hope that I would never see her again.\" The wolf suddenly looks serious, as if something important had just appeared in his mind. \"Until something happened. Something that would change both our lives forever.\" You sit back up from your resting spot on the pad and stare wide eyed at your Father. \"What? What happened to Mom?\" You ask urgently. Your Father simply looks down on you, his eyes filled with a kind of determined fire and simply says...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You blink a little at your Father's statement. You certainly didn't expect him to look so severe about the fact that your Mother had just been expecting you. Then again she certainly didn't expect that she would become pregnant even after having sex with a miles tall wolf either. The big wolf smiles upon the expression on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me explain: One month later when I was working out in the woods, I just so happened to come across a little jeep that parked just beside me. I was curious to see who it was to had come to visit me. To my great surprise and pleasure, it was your Mother who had just managed to find time off work and drove all the way out to see me. I was over the moon when she came, as she was just as happy to see me too. But one thing I realised about her was that she appeared troubled by something, and asked if we should talk about it privately. I of course agreed and so took her in my palm and brought her close. I was tempted to show my affections towards her, but I contained myself long enough for her to tell me what it was that troubled her. She told me about currently going through several tests after she didn't quite feel herself lately. So after many examinations, she didn't find anything wrong or life threatening, but she did discover something much more shocking and life changing. It was then she looked me straight in the eye and told me... she was with child. Dispute the slight pang in my chest, I congratulated her on the coming child and that she would make a great mother. But that wasn't all. To my absolute shock, she had never been with another man since our encounter, and that the only possible relation to the child had to be... ME.<br>\r\nI was stunned. I didn't think it was possible. It couldn't be. I told her myself that it cold not possibly true. But she confirmed it. The DNA tests taken when the scientists took samples of my blood matched to that of the child. Inside, I was delighted! I was going to become a Father! <br>\r\nYour Mother was delighted too, but also worried. Not just for me or herself, but also the fact that this child would be a birth of miracles: A child born of a human and a Gigantic Wolf. It would be the news of the world if the truth got out, and all the organisations around the world would most likely treat her and the baby like Guinea Pigs and to be experimented on for the rest of their lives. I certainly never wanted that for your Mother nor for the child. After much talking and persuasions, we figured it was best that we kept the origin of the baby a secret and to state that the child was simply the result of a one night stand between her and another anonymous man. Quite frankly I would have objected to that, but I agreed to go along with it anyway. Your Mother said it was best to keep our distance, but promised that she would come visit and especially let me see the baby for myself when it came. I was more than happy to oblige, and the prospect of me having my own child kept me going throughout the year.<br>\r\nSo for the next 6 months, we had our regular visits, the home coming along nicely, me working the funds towards child care and your Mother becoming more and more excited as tummy grew larger and larger with each month. For a while, I was surprised that her tummy didn't seem as large as I thought would be, that I had expected it to grow the size of a mansion by the time it was Summer. I then anticipated whether or not the Baby would have a great big pair of Wolfish ears and a big bushy tail, with a fresh set of fangs to boot. However, your Mother simply looked every other human expectant woman and happily went about her business prepraring the new arrival. I tell you now, dear Child, your Mother was the happiest I've seen her in a long while. Being away from work had taken a huge weight off her shoulders, more so the fact that she didn't have deal with the media as much. We even went on holiday: Down to a completely deserted coast were we swam, I posed for the camera and enjoyed some quality time with her as well... Hhmhhm!<br>\r\nAnyhow, it was then I made my pledge to become a true Father, that I would do everything in my power to help raise our Child and make us a real family. Your Mother couldn't be any happier, and told me didn't care what the rest of the world says. She would happily give her old life away just so she would become a Mother, and to live with me if she wanted. I could never agree more.<br>\r\nThen came the moment of truth. Just a day after we returned to the house, her water just broke and began to have contractions. The baby was coming! Immediately, I took your mother in hand and ran to the nearest doctor's clinic since the hospital was miles away from were we lived and I hadn't yet acquired a phone. Several medical staff and civilians practically sprinted for their lives when they saw me approaching, but after I explained what was happening, a very courteous man by the name of Dr Heinrich volunteered to help with the procedure. The problem was, that all of the emergency facilities were full up at the moment, so we had to conduct the delivery right there on my palm. So after letting the good Doctor up in my hand, he set to work delivering the baby. I stood stock still, all the while reassuring her that she was going to make it, that I loved her so much. <br>\r\nAnd then, finally, the baby was born. Your Mother had you right there on my palm. The both of us were the happiest we've ever been. What was also a great surprise was that you were perfectly human: No big tail, no big ears and certainly no fangs. You were exactly like your Mother, in every way. I couldn't complain about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Father looks dreamily at you, as if you were a priceless gem. You couldn't help but glance around the palm you're sitting on. This had just been the place you were given birth on, and this Wolf which it belonged to had been there from the very moment you came into excistance. As wierd as it sounds, you feel the deep bond you thought you've forgotten strengthen between the two of you. Then a more serious expression came on his face. \"The only thing is however.\" He says, his voice soft but concerned. \"Despite being born human, your Mother took a secret test of your blood that proved you inherited something from me. That thing turned out to be my blood. Blood that in facts strengthens your natural immunity and healing abilities. You have more control over your body, inside and out and even have a longer life expectancy than normal people. In other words...\" And he lowers his head and speaks to in a way that makes him look more of a God than ever before. \"..that makes you the first living proof of super human life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a silence, broken only the gentle rustling of the trees from the world beyond, which seems much further away now. You just sit there dumbfounded, unable to take in the fact that you were above average human level, more so when finding out you have a Giant Wolf for a Father. He sits back up, still giving you that serious expression. \"That's a very big secret between the three of us.\" He continued, his golden eyed expression not leaving yours. \"We never told that to anyone. Not even to your Mother's closest friends. I'm only telling you this now because you ought be old enough to know the truth. The world isn't ready for such a revelation. And you must promise me that you will never speak of this to anyone else. Not even to your friends. It's for your own safety. Understood?\"<br>\r\nYou take a moment to take in what your Father said. Why would it be bad to tell anyone about this? Surely it would be better to use your blood to help those in need and develop cures and vaccines against deadly deseases. But then, what if it falls into the wrong hands? What if someone wanted to use the blood for destructive purposes, to cause wars and untold misery throughout the world? You look up to your Father, who is still waiting for an answer. After a moment of consideration, you nod in agreement. \"I promise Dad.\" You say obediently. \"I swear I will never tell anyone.\" Your Father's muzzle brakes into warm grin and his tail begins to wag. He brings you up to his lips and kisses you straight on top of your head. \"There's a good pup.\" He says softly.<br>\r\nJust before he brings you back down however, you like to ask one last question. \"Hey Dad. One other thing.\" He looks at you with his grin still fresh on his face. \"Yes, my dear?\" You ask the question with a little more confidence in your voice. \"Where's Mom right now?\" The wolf gives you a surprised expression, as if this should have been something you should have known this all along. In hesitation, he says with a hint of difficulty in his voice...:<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You want to make sure that you don't worry your Father into thinking you have a serious head problem, so instead of simply blurting it out, you just scratch the back of your head it that kind of 'Ops-a-daisy!' manner of speaking. \"Sorry Dad!\" You exclaim apologetically, not entirely sure you believe in your own words. \"I forgot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, your Father looks like he is about to ask something else but simply shrugs it off and returns to his familiar form. \"Never mind.\" He says in his fatherly voice. \"She'll be back soon before the holiday is over. In the meantime,\" He says this as you can hear his tail beginning to wag happily underneath the table. \"We have the rest of the holidays to spend some quality time with each other!\" <br>\r\nThe prospect of having the rest of your holidays spent with your colossal Father sent a kind of electrifying jolt through. One that held the unexplainable urge for adventure and for living an unforgettable experience. After all, it's not like everyone has a Gigantic Wolf for a loving and fun Father. You look up excitedly at your Father who was giving you a similar expression, like a schoolboy awaiting to be taken to the theme park. You'd like to know more about what it is that you two will be doing this week, and begin to ask enthusiastically: \"Ok Dad! What would you like to do today?\" He ponders for a moment, deciding what activities the both of you can enjoy. \"Well,\" He says thoughtfully. \"I,was thinking we could go out for a walk towards the big mountain ridge where it borders your land and mine. Or we could simply stay here and play some games.\" You looks back down at you with a kind of excited expectancy in his golden eyes. \"It's still up to you though. You're on holiday and can do whatever you want here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to decide. Going for a walk does sound tempting. Seeing the sights of the world beyond and taking in the fresh air is sure to help clear your mind and get things in order. On the other hand, you are curious as to what kind of activities your Father has in store for you. After weighing you choices, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You both agree that you will both take a walk towards the great mountain ridge, although because of it's great distance, it'll really be your Father who will be doing most of the walking for you. As your Father prepares a picnic for the both of you, you take the opportunity to gaze out through the gigantic glass window looking out into the great forrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It is all so astonishing. The pine trees towars higher than anything you've seen before in your life, reaching so far into the sky that they almost blot out the entirety of the sun, and the earth on the ground look like they could stretch out for almost an eternity. It appears that everything within you Father's land is larger in comparison to all the plants you're accustomed to back home. No wonder the world organisations wanted to explore and examine this place so badly, and now you're curiosity is starting to grow as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you hear your Father returning with a large, shoulder held sack which would have seemed normal to the Wolf's size, but to you would have been enough to hold several sea tankers at once. He motions you to walk onto his open right hand and you oblige almost immediately. He then brings you up to his right shoulder and asks you polity to clamber on. Again you do as he says and climb onto his muscly shoulder, holding on to his thick strands of fur for support. \"It's going to quite the trek up the mountain, so I'm going to have to use both my arms and legs for the ascent.\" He tells you. \"So just be sure you hang on tightly while I do so.\" He then notices that you have a look of concern on your face, initially because you're not quite sure if you can keep your grasp while being continuously raised up a colossal mountain. He smiles down at you, stroking you on the head gently with one of his massive fingers. \"Don't worry my dear.\" He says reassuringly. \"I'll make sure you won't fall.\" With that said, you do feel reassured that your Father is still there to look out for you and with a smile and a nod, you tell your Father that your ready. Smiling back, he walks towards the door and opens it to venture out into the great giant wilderness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your Father begins to trek down the forrest path, you glance around the great mass of trees, admiring their lush green leaves and fine bark. On top you can see an eagle souring around, though it looks more like a buzzing insect compared to the size and mass of the trees. You Father also notices and chuckles. \"Honestly, you should see some of the animals from where I come from. They'll make me look small in comparison!\" You laugh nervously back, hoping that you will never have to face a fully grown grizzly bear that is several times larger than your already titanic Father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your Father brings you to clearing through the woods and you have a miraculous view of the scene ahead. From a distance, you can see the great mountain looming on the horizon. It's many peaks and snow covered tops scrap the sky as they barely break the top most clouds that drift above them. Judging by the distance between the mountain and where you are now, it will take quite some time for you to reach the very foot of the ridge. Your Father notices this too as he scratches the underside of his greying muzzle. \"It appears we have quite the task ahead of us.\" He says ponderingly. \"Which means that it will take a while for us to begin our trek up. In the meantime...\" He looks over to you, a smile broadening on his lips. \"How about we discuss something interesting whilst we walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to think about what you would like to talk about. At first, you want to talk about your missing memories and if you'll be able to remember them if you tried. Although you are also curious as to where your Father may have come from, and if that he still remembers anything about his own family. After a while of thinking, you decide to ask...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your Father glances back down at you when you asked your question, his eye brows raised slightly as if surprised at such a strange question. Noticing this, you quickly add; \"Um... I mean. It was a long time ago, and was just wondering if you remember what I was like back then.\" You gaze back back up to see your Father scratching the top his head, a look of deep thought etched across his great face. \"Hm.\" He mused. Then he gives a slight chuckle, as if the memories just came back to him. \"Well now that asked, you certainly weren't raised like most children.\" He continues to walk towards the mountain as he talks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you were born, we were a little concerned about how we were going to raise you. That is, being brought up by your Mother and a big lug of a wolf like me. We knew that we had to keep your leianege a secret and still be able to provide the very best for your development. I of course would've accepted if your Mother decided to raise you with your kind, but she insisted that I had as much right to be with you growing up and to act as any good father should. And so, we decided that your Mother will move in for the time being, giving the wider community the excuse that she needed time away to carry on with her research and to care for her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for what you were like... A-ha. Well safe to say it was both strange and heartwarming for me. When I first laid eyes you, I knew immediately you took after your Mother in many ways. You practically had the same eyes, the same hair, skin and, dare I say it, good looks too. I still remember when you just turned a year old when it was just you on my palm. At first, I thought you'd be afraid to see a gigantic wolf bearing down at you. But to my great surprise, you only giggled and had actually wanted to reach out and pat on my nose. I of course couldn't resist the temptation of play either. We played many games from there on, like playing hide a seek in my fur, where your Mother was afraid that you might get lost in there but I could always feel you rustling around my head, chest and legs. Then there was the time where we went to the beach when you were Six, and we built that great sandcastle together. You then acted as the valiant knight of the castle who had to fight the big scary beast, threatening to crush the castle and have you for dinner. I obviously played the monster, and I think I performed quite well. So with me acting all big and terrifying and you being all heroic and brave, you jumped straight from the castle and onto my foot after trying 'in vain' to stomp you. You started to climb my leg but I still caught you on the way up. I then tried to intimidate you but you simply jumped on my arm and ran all the way up, dodging my grabs at you and jabbed me in chest where my heart would be. You beat me fair and square, and I admitted defeat saying that I was just lowly beast not worthy of your mercy. At that, you just simply laughed and hugged me, saying that you'll never think like that of your Dad, that you still love this big old beast for who he was rather that what he was. I... almost welled up at that point. It was one of the sweetest things you ever said to me, and I loved you all the more for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe great wolf sighs happily as he draws closer to the mountain, leaving you to ponder in your own thoughts trying to find the lost remnants of your memories. You certainly seemed to recall a big castle made of sand, with you perched on top of the highest tower and brandishing a spade like a sword. You could then recall a gigantic, muscle bound Titan rising from the sand and looming menacingly down at you with hungry yet playful eyes. How the giant had teasingly plucked you in between his fore finger and thumb, joking about having you as a nice snack unless you gave up but refused to give in. The next thing you knew, you were triumphantly standing upon the great beast's chest, with the wolf smiling broadly back and giving you the literal father of all hugs. It was a shame you could only picture it all as a distant dream and not a fond memory, but at least you remembered it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it is fair to say that I was your whole world growing up.\" Your Father continued brightly as he brings you closer to the foot of the mountain. \"Though by the time you hit your teens, you had to go back to civilisation in order to attend High School. Your Mother is even considering letting you go to the same university once you finished. After that you...\" He pauses for a moment, as if he was trying to say something that wasn't in protest of you leaving the house that you grew up in. \"...Do whatever you want to do I suppose.\" He seems rather downtrodden at the prospect of you leaving his care. Even you have to admit, you're going to miss having the awesome wolf for company. Partly because he is the only one who remembers your past life and, for one, he also seems to be the closest thing to a friend as far as you know. Somebody you can trust without a doubt in your mind. Like you can tell him just about anything...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this however, your Father perks up again as he proceeds towards a large rock face which, as you observe, if just as high as your father, if not larger. \"Anyway!\" You father exclaims happily. \"Let's not worry about that for now. Better find a way to the top of here to get to the ridge.\" With that, he approaches the wall and places his right paw hand paw on a divit in the rock and his left foot paw in the other. He then proceeds hoist himself up towards other climbing points on the rock face. He notices you looking back down towards the ground which, despite already being a good mile off the ground, is looking all the more distant the higher you ascend. At this, your Father simply smiles at you. \"Don't worry.\" He says reassuringly. \"I had plenty of practise before. Just you make sure you cling on tightly whilst I climb. Even if you slip, I'll be sure to catch you. Alright?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the great wolf begins his climb, slowly but surely making his way to the top. You watch in amazement as he propels, shimmy shimmy and even leap towards usable ledges, which looks large enough to support a small town. You have to admire the amount of sheer bodywork your Father has put in, as every muscle in his arms a legs are hard at work to get himself supported onto the mountain side. You reckon he could go a lot faster, but you knew he is most likely trying to make sure you don't fall of from all the movement he's making. Even you have a hard time trying to grasp onto the many strands of fur surrounding you for support. As you take another glance behind you, you begin to see far more of the world around you. Seeing the tops of the great trees and other great mountains in the distance. Despite seeing all this for the first time, you still can't help but feel a great sense of familiarity towards this place, as if you knew this place your whole life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're really beginning to enjoy the view when...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You feel your head in pain at that yell before you realize who it was who was on the phone. \"Hello Lorelei.\" You say. Lorelei was your cousin, younger than you and always energetic. But why was her voice so loud?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So cousin,\" you say. \"What's up?\" \"I'm stopping by to visit you out in the country. Mom says I've been hanging around the big city too long. I just hope everyone's prepared for me.\" You let out a scoff. \"No one is that prepared. Okay Lorelei. Just give me time to clean up. See you later.\" You let out a groan as you hang up the phone. \"Crap,\" you say. \"I didn't think anyone was coming today.\" Thinking quickly you run away picking up all the debirs on the ground and shine the windows, not wanting your cousin to think you live in a pig sty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you're knocked off the ground by a tremor. \"Ah!\" you yell. \"Quake!

You then sigh in relief. \"Good,\" you say. \"It's still early.\" You then think. Your folks were sending you away from the big city into Galaxy Shores, a beachside town on the West of the U.S. They said you were going to spend the Summer with your Aunt Molly. You don't know much about Aunt Molly since you never met her. All you knew was that she was your mother's younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, you didn't even know what your aunt looked like since you didn't have any photographs of her. Soon your bus arrives. \"Here we are,\" says the bus driver. \"Galaxy Shores. All ashore that's going ashore.\" You're dropped out of the bus and you wipe your brow due to the heat before you stalk to walk out. You look down to see the street is somewhat ramp shaped and there was a beach on the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the beach and as you do, you see a souvenir shop that has a t-shirt that had the image of some strange teal colored cow and read \"I SAW THE GREEN COW OF GALAXY SHORES\". \"Huh,\" you say. \"They must have some kind of cryptid tourist trap around here.\" You smile and then make your way to the beach. You see a local with a metal detector and thought you might ask him if he'd seen your aunt. \"Excuse me,\" you call out. \"Excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man takes off his earmuffs and stares slightly at you. \"A shoobie,\" he says. \"Ho hum.\" \"I just want to ask you a question,\" you say. \"Do you know where I can find Molly Montana? She's my aunt and I'm supposed to be staying with her for the Summer.\" The man lets out a laugh. \"I didn't know the big girl had a nephew. Kinda small to be related to her aren't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what the man's talking about before you hear a rumbling sound. \"What's that?!\" you yell. \"An earthquake?!\" As you stumble to the ground. You see everybody leaving the beach calmly and that confused you. Why would they leave so quietly if there was an earthquake. Does this happen a lot. That's when a shadow casts over you and you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see a giant teal furred anthropomorphic cow. She was 80 miles high and very obese with a large stomach, thunderous thighs and E-cup breasts. She appeared to be naked from the waist down, mainly because she had a huge udder as big as her head. She bends her knees and you look up to see this cow woman is wearing a pink bikini top with a pair of star shaped sunglasses and had long orange-blonde hair and two long bright white horns. This was the same cow creature from the t-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step back and the giant cow woman smiles down at you. You try to run but she reaches down and grabs you by the shirt before lifting you up and bringing you in front of her lips big enough to land planes on. \"I've been expecting you,\" the cow giantess says. \"I'm Molly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up in shock. This 80 mile cow was your aunt.</span></div></div>",

You look down and see her breasts and udder both shaking. She must be packing enough milk for a large body of water. Still, the fact you had to stay the entire Summer with this weird relative of yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly begins to walk away and you hold on tight to one of her enormous nostrils. \"Aunt Molly,\" you say. \"My mom said you were her little sister. Looking at you, I don't see how that's possible.\" Molly lets out another laugh and you tumble and fall onto her tongue before you look at her cavernous mouth big enough to hold an entire street. You step back and Molly extends her tongue for you to climb back into her nostril. \"Well,\" says your bovine aunt. \"There's a funny story behind that. Your grandfather was into.... funny stuff.\" You have no idea what Molly's talking about but you decide it's best not to ask questions as she's stepping out into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I could be related to such a little cutie,\" says Molly as you continue to ride in your cow aunt's nose. \"Where's that sister of mine been hiding you all these years? Molly licks the inside of her nose to kiss you as you groan. She seemed friendly enough. \"So Aunt Molly,\" you say. \"The whole Green Cow of Galaxy Shores?\" Molly giggles and nearly sends you into her sinuses. \"Oh, well, I've been living here for so long everyone's gotten used to me. I'm kind of like their...\" \"Cash cow?\" Molly actually laughs at that joke.

I can recognize my room at least.\" You had recently been sick with a strange illness that had the symptoms of a flu but also caused temporary memory loss and your head was still sore. You walked up and looked in your mirror right before you heard a voice calling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You up yet, kiddo?\" asked the voice. You recognized that voice and remembered who it was. \"I'm perfectly fine, Aunt Claire.\" You remembered that your parents were killed in an accident years ago and you were raised by your father's younger sister. Claire was for the most part easy to get along with, but there was something about her that you could swear was important to know, yet for now you couldn't remember it. \"Are you absolutely sure you're okay?\" asked Claire. \"The doctor did say that it would take a while before your memory completely returns and I would hate for you to get an unpleasant surprise if you can't remember what I look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh. \"Aunt Claire, please. I'm not a baby.\" \"Do you actually remember what I look like?\" \"Well, I remember that you're a redhead.\" Claire lets out a laugh. \"Oh. You are just asking for trouble. Come on. Breakfast is ready.\" You smile and you remembered that Claire always woke up hours before you did. You presume that it was for work reasons but you couldn't remember at the moment what she did for a living. Or did she get up early to make sure you were prepared for school? You shrug your shoulders and walk into the next room for breakfast. There was a plate with toast, bacon and eggs on it and you walk up and take a bite out of the toast. \"Thanks, Aunt Claire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you realize something. There was only one plate at the table and Aunt Claire's breakfast was nowhere to be seen. \"Say, Claire. Aren't you going to be sitting at the table?\" Claire gives a scoff from offscreen. \"Are you kidding me? They don't make seats big enough for me to sit at the table. They don't even make tables big enough for me.\" You were confused with what your aunt said but then you remembered that Claire was somewhat fat. Not that it bothered her. As you're eating breakfast, you heard loud vibrations and the apartment begins to shake. You have to grab your glass of milk to keep it from spilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" you ask. \"An Earthquake.\" \"No,\" said Claire. \"Just my footsteps.\" You're confused. \"Claire,\" you say. \"There's no way that you're <i>that</i> heavy.\" \"Kiddo, I'm probably the heaviest woman on the planet. Just turn around. But I'll warn you, if your memory hasn't returned, you'll be surprised.\" You turn around and gasp as you see an enormous eye looking in the window. The pupil alone is as big as the wall.\" You walk closer to the blue eye and you hear your aunt laughing again. \"Is it coming back to you now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you recalled something very important about Aunt Claire. She was a 40 mile high hippopotamus. If she were human size, she'd weigh a few thousand pounds. She had cream-colored-skin and long red hair with huge H-cup breasts, a large belly and an even bigger butt. Right now she was bending over to look into the apartment where she kept you and had her huge butt casting a shadow over an entire landscape as she smiled at you. \"Remember me?\" she asks tauntingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a nervous laugh. \"Okay, Aunt Claire. I may not remember everything.\" Claire lets out a laugh and shows off her large and sharp building sized teeth. You remember that everyone in town knew that Aunt Claire was a giant hippopotamus but don't know how it could be possible that she'd be related to you, yet didn't question it. For the most part, she was really nice. Though you did remember that one time a bully was causing you trouble and she trapped him in her mouth for a week to get him to leave you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Claire let out a sigh. \"Well,\" she said. \"It will all come back to you.\" Claire held her finger out to your veranda, obviously gesturing you to climb upon her huge and pink fingernail. You shrug your shoulder and climb the nail. From your vantage point, you remember that the city your apartment was in was kept in a bauble that was part of your aunt's necklace and your aunt was up to her knees in the ocean. \"One of these days,\" you think to yourself. \"I'm going to ask her how she got so big. Or why she's a hippo in the first place.\"</span></div></div>",

Huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gently close the book and put it back next to your bed as you head down the stairs for breakfast. Today was a Saturday after all. No rush. Downstairs, you pour yourself a bowl of cereal and begin eating. You can't help it, but you just can't seem to stop thinking about your imaginary friend. After breakfast, you decide to plop down on the living room couch to watch some TV. As you flip the channels, you soon stop at an old movie you once saw before when you were younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, I remember that movie! Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were utterly surprised when that booming voice just came out of nowhere. You looked around, but there wasn't anyone in the same room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you remember it?\" the voice asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Y-yeah...Who are you, anyway?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, your old buddy! Pumpy Clumpy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just look around you again. You seriously can't believe what the voice just said. There was a disembodied voice that appears out of nowhere, and claims to be your childhood imaginary friend? That's just too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who are you, and how do you know Pumpy Clumpy? I've never mentioned him to anyone ever since I grew out of childhood!\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, I'm Pumpy Clumpy! I'm outside, since I can't fit inside. Come on out, and I'll explain everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just shrug as you turn the set off and head to your front door. Whoever is playing this prank on you had better have a decent explanation. As you open the door and look around, you see no one at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm behind you!\" the voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to the house, but see no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, I meant I'm behind the house. Just look up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do as you're told...And you mouth suddenly hangs open at what you see. It was a humungous blue-skinned face, with large green eyes looking at you. The creature must've been as huge as a skyscraper! The head alone was as big as your house! Then, you see a large blue hand descend down towards you, picking you up by the shirt collar with two fingers the same size as your whole body. You're then placed onto a palm as you were brought close to the creature's head. You instinctively curl up with your eyes closed, waiting for this thing to eat you, or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey, I'm not gonna hurt you or anything. Don't you remember me?\" the creature said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly open one eye and look into his green eyes, almost feeling a sense of nostalgia from them. You were slowly brought farther away so you could see the creature's concerned face. He looked so familiar to you. Could it really be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...You're...You're really my old friend, Pumpy Clumpy?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! That's what I've been trying to tell you!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...How? You were my imaginary friend! You're no even supposed to exist! How is this happening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well about that...You see, as you grew older, you began to play with me less and less. I knew that you were growing up, and I had to let you forget about me sooner or later, so...I decided it was time for me to leave. But, even after growing up, you still saw me as your best friend. I was touched, and I wanted to see you again, and...Well, this is the part that gets complicated. You see, there was this thingy, and it made me real, but it also made me bigger too. I don't really get it myself, but now I'm just as real as you, and I'm really big now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kind of understood his explanation, but also understood that he doesn't fully know how be became real as well. But, does it really matter now? Your childhood friend has returned, in the flesh! You smile as you pat the hand you're on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we both have no idea how this happened. But, I'm glad that you've come back! I really missed you Pumpy!\" you happily said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you two! Now give me a hug!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cough a bit, reminding him about the size situation. So, he just brings you next to his head so he can nuzzle you instead. You hug as much of his snout as you can. After the 'hug', there was a loud growling coming from underneath you. The two of you look down at his huge stomach as he blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, can I get some breakfast? Promise I'll eat just as much as a regular person.\" he said.</span></div></div>",

You can feel something cold underneath you - you must have fallen out of bed during your sleep. You can also feel something wet underneath your nose, the small pool of something running from the bottom of your nose to the very top of your lip. You could also feel something rather heavy on your back and front. What that could be, you had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes slowly open, revealing a tiled floor. That... wasn't right. Your bedroom had a carpet. You push yourself backwards and maneuver into a sitting position. The room you were in looked like an office building, only abandoned and run down. A desk to your right had been eaten away at by a mould, the whole thing looking black and rotten. Looking up, you realise that there was a rather large hole in the ceiling, that continued up for several floors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd where your nose had been when you were laying down was a tiny pool of blood. Wiping at your nostril with a finger resulted in the red liquid coating the tip of your finger. You must have fallen a short distance to where you had laid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour apparel was also rather... bizarre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom what you could feel, you were wearing a shirt and trousers - normal stuff. But over the shirt was what seemed to be a bandolier with sheets of metal layered over it, forming crude armour of some kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, this didn't look good. Still, you just had to figure out where you were and from there it should be pretty easy finding the nearest town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground begins to shake. Then it shakes again, and again, the shaking happening in a rhythm that steadily increases in strength until you can no longer stand without falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey, [Your Name]! Up here!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou obey the feminine voice and look upwards through the series of holes, and see something that would remain in your memory for a long, long, time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single, massive eye was looking at you through the hole, hovering a large distance overhead. The eye, and head, pull back, allowing you to see just what you were dealing with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the hole you could see the head of an utterly titanic deer,  your mind unable to estimate just how huge it was. You were so stunned by the sight that you barely noticed the hand that hovered above the hole, allowing two fingertips to deftly pick you up between them and place you onto a titanic palm, the nails of the hand it was par of being composed of a pure black keratin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Uh... you okay, little guy?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust what had you gotten yourself into?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From what you could see you were in a large desert just outside the building you awoke in. The yellow and red desert stretched on for what seemed like forever, the uniformity of rolling dunes only broken by the odd tower jutting out of the sand that bore resemblance the one next to you. The odd bit of sand hit your face as gusts of hot wind whistled around the air but thankfully the shade you were sitting in did wonders in keeping you moderately cool. Although, as you regained your senses you noticed that the shadow wasn't coming from the tower but rather from something equally as large. Only just now did you register that you were still sitting in the palm of that large furry creature. <i>Oh, right,</i> you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the massive anthropomorphic doe that picked you up.What you were looking at should be absolutely impossible, yet here you were staring up at it as she sat cross-legged with her back leaning against the building you were just in. She was wearing what looked like a patchwork poncho made out of some kind of brown tarp, the same material also used to make herself a flimsy pair of undergarments. Looking way up you could see her face as she idly looked across the desert, intelligence flickering in her amber eyes. You think you could deal with suddenly seeing a humanoid animal but you were honestly struggling considering how utterly huge this one is. Just by a rough estimate she could be well over a mile tall standing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the most part she wasn't aware that you awoke and you flinched when the deer started moving. She reached down to her side  and brought up what looked like the container of an extremely large water tower before she uncorked its 'cap' and started drinking from it. As you watched her drink you flinched again when her eyes suddenly turned downward to look at you. \"Oh, you're finally awake.\" She said, setting her giant canteen down. You could feel your heart rate skyrocket as she slowly brought you closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExperiencing a brief sensation of vertigo you suddenly found yourself lifted up until you were eye-to-eye with the deer. \"Are you feeling better? I think you hit your head.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Was all you could mumble. When she talked you saw flashes of the inside of her mouth and all you could think about was how easily she could throw you in there and swallow you whole. That, and how she could effortlessly crush you with a single movement of one of her fingers. For some strange reason you knew she wouldn't do something like that but the thought still lingered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deer gave you a worried look. \"I think you might have a concussion. We should head back to base and do some scavenging another day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant deer-person, a massive desert, metal armor, scavenging? Nothing was making sense and as much as you wanted to pretend the giant talking animal wasn't there you couldn't ignore her forever. You swallowed and spoke up. \"I... I don't know what's going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in my bed sleeping and then I suddenly woke up to...\" You motion with your hands at her and the surrounding desert. \"...This.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were out scavenging, I left you in this building while I quickly scouted one of the other towers across the way,\" she explained. \"Remember?\" Listening to her you tried to remember something, anything, about this world you woke up in but nothing came except memories from your 'normal' life. You shake your head at her and her expression sank. \"Do you remember who you are, where we are?\" Again, you shake your head. She hesitated for a moment before she spoke up again. \"Do you remember me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I don't remember anything.\" You tell her. Your words took her aback as she sorrowfully looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better not be tricking me.\" She said, a hint of frustration bleeding through the distress on her face. The look she was giving was making you feel faint again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm not. Please, I have no idea what's going on.\" You pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" she muttered. The two of you were silent for a few moments before she spoke up again. \"The wound on your head looked pretty bad, maybe the impact gave you amnesia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so distracted by the situation that you completely forgot about it. Reaching a hand up to your head you winced as you felt a large bump through the cloth wrapped around it. Wait, bandages? \"Did you do these bandages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea,\" she simply said. Her hoof-like fingers were so large that you were actually incredibly impressed she could even work with something that was relatively so small. \"I'm guessing you want me to bring you up to speed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, long story short, there was a huge war many years ago before either of us were born and civilization was utterly destroyed. It was so long ago nobody even knows why they fought, but it reduced most of the world to a wasteland just like this one. People don't usually stay in one spot too long and are always on the move to try and find more resources.\" She explained before pausing. \"As for me, I'm your partner. You found me when I was a sick little fawn out in one of the irradiated zones and I guess you must have felt sorry for me and nursed me back to health. Back then I was just a dumb animal but I still knew what you did for me so I followed you around. I'm not sure why you didn't kill and eat me, though, especially when I started getting bigger. You just kept treating me like a harmless baby animal even when you only came up to my leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't always like this?\" You interrupted. \"This big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just kept getting bigger and bigger. Anyway, I followed you everywhere and the changes kept happening. I suddenly found myself introspecting and looking at the world differently, the sounds you made with your mouth began making sense and had purpose. Then my body started changing shape until I could walk on two feet and talk, just like a human!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" You muttered as you took it all in, the deer giving you a nostalgic smile that you unfortunately couldn't share. It sounded like you two had a lot of history together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was five years ago and we've been wandering ever since. You named me Nina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for being patient with me, Nina.\" You said to her. By now you were feeling safer sitting in her palms. Even if her sheer size was mind-boggling it was reassuring to know that you two apparently shared a long, trusting relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hopefully your memories come back.\" You suddenly found yourself being lifted towards her face, gasping as her cheek suddenly pushed against your entire body. Nina gently rubbed the side of her face against you and you found yourself relaxing as she smothered you with affection.  \"And if not... We'll make it work. I owe you my life so I'll protect you no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held you in that loving embrace against her cheek for a while longer before she pulled you away. Nina gave you a look of admiration before you felt the world around you sway as she stood up to her full height, slinging what looked like an incredibly large bag around her shoulder. Just like earlier you could hear the shaking rhythm of her footsteps as she went into motion. \"Where are we going?\" You yell up at her, unsure if she could even hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of her large ears twitches and she looks down at you, still keeping pace. \"To our temporary base. We usually choose a spot to come back to when we explore areas like these.\" You nod and look off at the horizon and from the orange painting the clear sky it must  be close to dusk. After a short while she approached one of the towers and pressed the side of her hand against an opening. \"Go inside and get some rest. I'll be outside if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank her and hop down into the small dusty room. Any entrance to the room was completely barricaded so you assumed the only way of getting in was Nina. Not many possessions were in the room besides a small pile of bags, a bedroll and a few odds and ends sitting on a desk. Right in the middle of the desk was a book that had a piece of tape with the word 'journal' written on it that caught your interest. Reading that might give some clues to what was going on or at least give you some insight on what type of relationship you had with Nina. You were interested what the 'you' of this universe did on a daily basis, especially with a giant deer-person as a companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large thud startled you and looking back you could see the fur of Nina's neck outside the large hole in the wall. That was another option, spending some time with Nina to get to know her, again.  From the way she was giving brief side-ward glances at you it was obvious she seemed concerned about you and your predicament. You were definitely sure you needed to get used to her size, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your eyes, just thinking about the circumstances you were in tired you. Perhaps you  actually fell out of the bed but landed in some parallel dimension instead, but it didn't really make sense. Whatever the case the situation still left you confused but you felt you had to press on; for all you knew you could be stuck in this world. You probably had time to do one more activity before you should get some sleep. What do you do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yawning, you pull the covers off and stumble over to the light switch, blinking sleep out of your eyes. As you begin to proceed through your morning routine, you can't help but feel that something is wrong, somehow. All of a sudden, it hits you; where was Mimi? You remembered your pet husky sleeping on your bed with you, and you hadn't seen her since waking up, which was very odd, seeing as though she rarely left you alone for a second in the morning if you hadn't fed her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning slightly as you enter the bathroom, intending to brush your teeth, you glance out the window - and then glance out the window again, not quite sure what you were seeing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere the city you lived in had once stood, now lay a gigantic meadow, seemingly stretching beyond the horizon. Mouth hanging open in bewilderment, you blink as you stare at the unfamiliar landscape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour confusion is only increased when the floor seems to tremble from some far-off impact. The trembling stops... and then resumes. The trembling continues, increasing each time it resumed. It was if a great Titan was striding along, footfalls shaking the earth itself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTitan quickly proves to be apt, however, as the entire roof to your house is lifted away by two gigantic, fluffy white fingers, and you are harmlessly pinched between two massive claws. The claws quickly bring you upwards to a titanic, stormy grey muzzle - one that seemed awfully familiar. You were fairly certain that you knew who this gigantic, multi-dozen-mile tall anthro was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMimi's mouth opens and her tongue lolls out; the great husky pants, her hot breath buffeting you back and forth slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pair of green eyes focus on your tiny form, exuding love, compassion... and submission. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Master!\"</span></div></div>",

It comes to you so clearly all of a sudden that you have a feeling of deja vu, but you do not know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to get out of bed, but realize that your not in bed; you're in a sleeping bag.  The air is a bit dank, and it is very dark, except for very shiny crystals poking out of the walls.  You feel like you are in a very large cave, and try to remember if you were going camping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" you cry out, hearing a reverberating echo.  Unexpectedly, a high pitched girly voice replies very quickly from above, \"You don't have to shout, silly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou automatically apologize, \"Oh, oh, I'm so sorry for waking you up, miss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn odd cackle echoes through the cave.  \"Ee hee hee!  You are SO funny!  You know that I don't sleep!  Here, let me get the light, I've been dying to show you my new outfit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a powerful gust of wind and the sound of rocks crumbling on the ground, followed by the simple flick of a switch.  Immediately, you see a huge bat girl, standing in the huge cave.  Her wings alone are much thicker than you are tall, and the toes on the ground look like some sort of living mountain range.  You notice her body is barely covered by a tight black outfit, but you are too surprised right now to think about how sexy this bat looks.  Besides, the huge pointy ears and fleshy nose are pretty frightening.  You flinch when she starts to move her huge hand towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, your scared.  Did you have that train dream again?  I can only imagine how scary it would be to get hit by a derailed train.  It was a good thing that I was there to catch you when it happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are perplexed by this story that never happened, but for some reason are greatly moved by it.  Suddenly, part of the cave wall slides down, and three more towering anthros walk into the room.  \"Cacophony, there was no trouble tonight?\" replied a deep, heroic-sounding voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not tonight, sir,\" replied the bat girl, who is named Cacophony.  \"I was listening all night, but I didn't hear anything worldwide that wasn't handled by the regular authorities.\"  Amazing, you think, that her hearing is that good.  Almost too good, like a super power of some sort.  You suddenly realize that not only are you in the presence of four enormous anthropomorphic animals, you were in the presence of a band of super heroes.</span></div></div>",

You look to the wall to see photographs, like wanted posters of what you could only describe as monsters. The first of the wanted posters showed a picture of monster made out of dinosaur bones, another wanted poster showed an image of a giant robot that looked like it had a second face on its forehead and a third wanted poster showed an image of a dragoness in gothic clothes with a third eye on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't tell where you were and tried to get out of bed only to grunt in pain. Your injuries still haven't fully healed. Then you hear tremors, loud ones and get back in bed and crouch as you try to endure, but for some reason you weren't shaking. Maybe it was the height of the table... you didn't know, but then you saw five titanic figures, you'd say each had to be one hundred miles high and every last one of them looked feminine. One of them even let out a growl. \"I can't believe it!\" she yelled. \"Doubletron got away again!\" \"Don't get in an uproar Hightail,\" says another of the giantesses. \"These things happen. Besides he's damaged so it's not like he can get far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figures step closer and you see that you're looking at five anthro giantesses, all cats. The leader was a lioness with golden yellow fur and long hair reaching down to her butt. She was dressed in a green amazon style torso with a sword attached to her belt. The second of the giants was a white tiger girl in a light blue outfit similar to the lioness but without her midriff showing. The third giantess was a cheetah in a red suit of armor with a large shoulderpad on her right shoulder and two lightning bolt symbols on each breast plate. She was carrying a whip in her belt. Then there was a jaguar girl in a dark blue unitard and strange beads around her neck, with dyed blue hair. She sort of looked like a sorceress. The last of the anthros to come forward was a mountain lioness in a gold colored suit of armor with face paint on and a quiver of arrows strapped to her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could not believe this. The lioness who was obviously the leader turned back at the other giantesses. \"We can't waste time going after Doubletron until he shows his face again. \"Hightail, I need you to stake out the Western Hemisphere. I heard a report of pirates terrorizing the Caribbean.\" The cheetah girl nods her head and zooms off before the lioness turns to the jaguar girl. \"Dazzle,\" she says. \"Could you please check on her guest. You know, the one Stripez carelessly brought back to the Den?\" The tiger girl steps back and rubs the back of her neck. \"Will do Hera.\" says the jaguar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puma girl lets out a scoff as Dazzle walks off to check up on you. \"I don't know why you let a human into the Den Hera, it's much too dangerous.\" \"What choice did I have Catseye? Stripez said he was in critical condition. \"We don't leave humans behind in times of crisis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize it. You were in the presence of superheroes, much like Ultraman except even bigger. This titanesses were guardians of the Earth.</span></div></div>",

She looks absolutely stunning as she her face becomes clearer, and you can't help but thank her for stopping the meteorite.  You still can't believe that nobody else seems to notice anything going on at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the huge orcaess starts to speak in her angelic voice.  \"Wait, come here, Amosa, I can feel something!\"  Suddenly, another gigantic orcaess, even bigger than the first by almost half a body length, swims through the sky to the first one.  \"What is it, Fortuna, do you feel an earthquake?\" asks the larger orcaess in an equally angelic voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, big sister, I think someone is praising me!\"  You suddenly realize that you must be the one that this huge divine cetacean is detecting, and suddenly grow fearful that perhaps everyone was not noticing the goddesses on purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, one of the humans can see you?  Let me try, little sister.  Amosa, the larger sister, gently pushes Fortuna to the side and swim closer, until her looming head covers the whole sky.  \"Little human, wherever you are, if you can hear me, wave your arms and jump up and down!\"  You don't know if you should, but you perform the task anyway.  Other people seem to be looking at you strangely, but the face beyond the clouds locks onto you with utter amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're right, someone CAN see us!  I must share this news with Prima, she'll know what to do.\"  Suddenly emitting a high-pitched squeal, Amosa makes room for the third orcaess you have seen today.  This one was even larger than the other two, by several times even, and her black and white patterned body looked to have a sort of golden aura around it.  \"Is there something that you need of me, my younger kin?\" asks the eldest and probably most powerful goddess Prima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We discovered that one of the humans on Earth can see and hear us!\"  Now, even the great Prima looks surprised.  Quickly turning her attention to the planet, you suddenly feel self aware as the huge orcaess seems to probe your mind.  \"You are right, a human does indeed acknowledge us, and he even felt it when I looked into his soul.  This is something I have never witnessed before, my younger sisters, and unlike you, I have seen all of Earth's history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do, Prima?\" asked Fortuna, who never took her enormous eyes off you.  \"We can't just ignore something this big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrima sighed as she thought, and you could feel the warm breeze enter Earth's atmosphere and almost lift you of the ground, although it did not seem to affect anyone else.

I've heard that there are small settlements, but I've yet to find any. I have been on my own, wandering aimlessly from broken human cities to small ghost towns. Did I also mention the anthros. They're massive, bipedal creatures that appear to have animal features. I probably sound like I hate them, but I don't. With everything that's happened so far, I've been trying to avoid anything that's not like me. I heard they keep humans in zoos and stuff, mostly to protect them, but that's not what I want. I'm afraid that if I end up there, I can never be free again!<br>\r\n       Right now, I'm in one of the many human ghost towns, looking for supplies.

I peer at a bunch of unopened packs of water bottles, but it seemed suspicious, I could feel it. Food and water untouched. It's very unusual for anything to be untouched. I pull out a knife and yell \"hello?\". It was silent. I cut a pack open and take a few bottles, stuffing them into my bag. I look around cautiously, and see nothing within my line of sight. I stand straight back up and walk toward some canned foods. Just like the water, I grabbed whatever I could, stuff them in my bag, and look cautiously around. I then bolt out the door, covering my eye from the blinding light of day. My vision returns to normal, and nothing. \"Maybe I was just paranoid.\" I said to myself. I walk around in the middle of the town, and spot a small bookstore. I walk in like it's heaven. When I was a kid, and wandering around with my parents. They would let me go to abandon bookstores and let me read. It was the only thing I could enjoy. There were many problems though. We would never stay long, and I couldn't keep a single book. My Dad said it was not valuable for survival.  That's when I made my one rule, Finish every book I pick up before I leave! Back to reality, I see several great books. I pick out one on medical knowledge and human anatomy, the history on some Vietnam war, and several others. I jump up on to the cashier counter, and begin reading, losing all sense of time and my surroundings.<br>\r\n       As soon as I finish my sixth book, I feel a slight tremor. I look outside, and realize it's night. I put the book down, and run to a dusty, broken window. I see something in the distance. I walk to the door, and out only to see a small group anthros. It was dark and hard to make them out. Then I see one split from the group, and walk my way. Feeling the tremors, I run back into the store, grab my stuff and try to find a hiding spot. The tremors became earthquakes, knocking books and shelves down to the ground. Then a shelf falls on me, it just pins me, barely leaving a bruise on my body, and luckily hiding me. Then the quakes stop. I lie still on my stomach, wondering what it wanted, especially from a human ghost town. Then I heard it speak. \"HMM, LETS SEE WHAT I CAN FIND HERE?\" Then I hear something brake. \"HEY THAT LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF FOOD AND WATER!\" My thoughts were \"What! That would barely feed him or any of them!\" Then I hear sniffing.\" SOMEONE WAS HERE!\" My heart races, and sweat runs down my face. Then more sniffing. \"THEY'RE STILL HERE!\" My newest thought. \"Why are they blessed with superhuman smell and hearing?\" Then rumbling above me, allowing me to guess, It took the roof off. It flips the bookshelf off of me, I jump up, and try to bolt straight out of the building. Then a furred tower blocks my exit and plucks me out through the roof.</span></div></div>",

Its' voice was deep, so I assumed it was a male. \"Put Me Down!\" I yelled as I squirmed in his grasp. Then I felt myself descend, being placed on his mile long muzzle. I stood realizing I was knee deep in his fur. I look up, waiting for something to happen. \"What do you want?\" I ask. I was nervously waiting for his answer until I got, \"WHO YOU ARE, WHY ARE YOU IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, AND WHY DID YOU TRY TO RUN?\" \"My first answer is, none of your business, two, none of your business, and three, none of your business!\" \"SIGH... OKAY\" He replies calmly. I was expecting him to get angry or something, I know I can shot my mouth off at times, but his calmness took me by surprise. I then ask. \"Can you put me down, like on the ground?\" \"NAH, I DON'T THINK I WILL.\" \"What! Why?\" I yell. \"BECAUSE YOU WON'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.\" \"Who are you, and why should I tell you anything?\" After my question, it went silent, then out of nowhere he stands to his full mile tall height. I fall on his muzzle, then hear \"MY NAME IS FOX.\" \"Wow, what an original name.\" \"REALLY!?\" \"No, that was sarcasm.\" He gets an annoyed look, and starts walking. \"Fine, I'll tell you my name.\" I feel him stop. \"It's Akira. That's all I'm telling you!\" \"THAT IS A NICE NAME.\" \"Thanks. I guess?\" \"THAT WAS SARCASM.\" He replies. I got slightly annoyed, but I did start it, so I let it slide. \"Can you put me down now?\" \"NO, YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER.\" He starts walking again, back to his group.

Then the fear of the thought took over, and took action. I began to trek up Fox's face, and stumbled my way behind his left ear, and grasped the fur around it. \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?\" Fox asks, but I Ignored him. I... I began to remember my bad history with the anthro kind. Then I heard Fox greet his friends. \"HEY GUYS.\" \"HEY FOX, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING YOU LIKED ?\" A female anthro asked. \"YEAH\", then I heard fox speak calmly, \"COME ON OUT AKIRA, THEY WON'T HURT YOU.\" I was hesitant and afraid at first, but after a few seconds, I walked out and revealed myself to his friends. It was silent, they looked at me as if I was something they've never seen before. I looked at each of them and saw four of them. I tried to register and identify them to the animals I knew, from the books I read so far. The female that spoke to fox, is also a fox, but her eyes are a more concentrated, bright green. The second is a bear, he is the largest out of the whole group, his fur is dark brown, and his eyes are pitch black. The third one is a lion, his mane was black, and his glaring, yellow eyes are starting to give me chills down my spine. The last one is a raven. Her wings are large, with black feathers, and warm, red eyes. After I and his group finished registering each other, Fox began to introduce me to his friends. \"GUYS, THIS IS AKIRA, I FOUND HIM ALL BY HIMSELF.\"  Then the lion coldly stated, \"A HUMAN, I'M SURPRISED HE ISN'T IN THE ZOO.\" Then the word \"Zoo\" triggered me to breakdown. I was never a fan of the word, to me it meant \"Put me in a cage and look at me.\" Then Fox somehow felt my discomfort. \"I NEVER LIKED THE ZOO!\" He calmly replied. His words calmed me down, and I regained my composure. \"AKIRA, THESE ARE MY FRIENDS, THAT'S VIXEN, JON, LEO, AND RAVEN.\" I softly spoke \"Hi.\" I was still a little nervous, but they seemed okay.</span></div></div>",

I was always wandering with parents, so I never had a home.\" Then Vixen asked the question that ended the conversation. \"WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?\" \"...Gone.\" It went silent. Then I began to ask questions. \"Who are you, and why are you here.\" Then Fox answered. \"WE'RE ARCHEOLOGISTS, AND WERE TRAVELING TO A TEMPLE, WELL JUST THE THREE OF US, JON AND LEO ARE THE MUSCLE.\" \"I BET HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT ARCHEOLOGY IS.\" Leo added. \"Yes I do, it's the study of ancient artifacts and temples, left behind by the ancients.\" \"WOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.\" Raven asked. \"I read about it somewhere. Why is that surprising?\" \"SORRY, HUMANS AT THE ZOO DON'T REGULARLY DISPLAY ANY INTELLIGENCE.\" \"WELL, WHEN YOUR THROWN INTO A CAGE, THERE IS NOT MUCH TO DO.\" Fox replied. \"WHAT SO YOU WERE IN THAT BOOKSTORE READING.\" Fox asks. \"Yeah, whenever I find a place with books, I try to read every book I can.\" \"HOW LONG HAVE YOU'VE READING, AND DO YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS WITH YOU?\" \"I have been reading since I was probably six or seven, and no I don't carry books with me.\" I replied \"WHY NOT?\" Vixen asked. \"My Dad, taught me to take necessary items, books would be useless baggage, so I just read what I can and finish before I leave.\" Then I asked. \"What temple are you going to?\" \"WE'RE HEADING TO THE EL TITINIO, IT'S DOWN SOUTH.\" Raven replied. \"Oh, I was already heading that way.\" \"WHY?\" Fox asked. \"I've heard there are small settlements, I've been looking to rejoin the rest of my kind.\" When I spoke those words, they saw and felt the hope I had. This is the first conversation I've had with an anthro or anyone since my parents were around. \"WELL, I'M TIRED, I'M GOING TO SLEEP.\" Fox said. He then tried to sleep, while I sat on his head bewildered. \"Hey, wait... Are going to put me back down on the ground!\" I yelled. \"I'LL THINK ABOUT IT, JUST SLEEP THERE.\" I look around to see everyone going to sleep.

I look at Fox, still asleep while I'm about to fall of his head. \"He must be a heavy sleeper.\" I thought to myself. I decide to try to climb down. It only took me like 5 minutes to reach the ground. I look at Fox sleeping form, up against a humongous boulder. I realize how humongous he is compared to me. Then I began my trek back to the town. By the time I reached the town, it was already dawn. I began trying to look for clues ot where the people of this town went, I was thinking maybe it might lead to a settlement. I remember at the supermarket, everything there was untouched, so something must have happened. Then I walk up to an apartment building, and walk in. Then the feeling I had from the supermarket came back, it felt like something ominous was in the building. Instead of running out of the building, I walked in further, I then I pull out my flashlight and knife, for whatever's in the darkness. I pass the front desk, and to the stairs. I began to forget the true reason I was back here. I don't even know why I'm investigating the feeling. I got to the second floor, and shined my light through the darkness of the narrow corridor. I then I saw a door at the end of the hall, open just by a little. I walk up to the door, standing ready for whatever's behind it.</span></div></div>",

I didn't even know what it was. It was black, It then turned around, and gazed at me, with its' blood, red eyes. I... I felt its' bloodlust, its' hate, its'... its' darkness. Then I blinked, and then... It tried to... It began attacking me, with claws longer than any knife I've seen. I was able to dodge its' attack, then began to run. All I knew was to get out of there. I bolted down the stairs to the lobby, and ran for the light that was out the door. It then triggered some security alarm, causing the security shudders to start closing off the building. \"What apartment building requires security shudders!\" I yelled. I slide under as the shudder closed behind me, I was out, luckily. I sat there trying to catch my breathe. Then I hear the shudders open up. I get up and gazed into the darkness of the building, and there it was, glaring at me. It sat there like it couldn't come out, like it hated the light. Just by looking at it lead me to guess what happened here. I began running, just to get out of that town. I make it past a sign, and stop. I look back at the town, not even knowing what to think. Then I hear \"AKIRA!\" I realize it was morning, so I assumed Fox was now awake. I begin my walk back to Fox and his friends. Whatever that thing was, I was lucky to even escape it. </span></div></div>",

It went silent, then Fox said. \"WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE TOWN.\" Hearing that had struck fear in my heart, but then Fox reassured me. \"DON'T WORRY, I'LL KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR IT.\" I was still afraid, but it seemed I could trust Fox. \"Okay, but first, can you put me down, I have to go to the bathroom this time.\"</span></div></div>",

I sit quietly on Fox's head, until Fox asks. \"SO, WHY WERE YOU IN THE TOWN?\" \"I was hoping to find a clue to where a settlement might be.\" I replied \"DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?\" \"No, I just ran into whatever that thing was.\" I unconsciously grasped tightly onto Fox's fur. \"DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?\" I remained silent. Then I answered. \"No, I'm tired.\" \"DIDN'T YOU GET ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT?\" \"No, I couldn't sleep, I kept sliding off your head.\" \"REALLY, I'M SORRY! DO YOU WANT TO GO TO SLEEP?\" \"I don't know if I can sleep.\" Just before Fox could reply. We make it back to the town. My grasp on Fox's fur tightened even more. Then Fox paused. While his friends walked ahead. \"WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?\" Vixen asked. \"ARE YOU READY AKIRA?\" Fox asked. I was hesitant, but I replied, \"Yeah.\" Then Fox began walking through the town. I look down the side of fox's muzzle. I realized how high up off the ground I was. The buildings were barely tall enough to reach the top of Fox's toes. I also didn't see the creature, so I calmed down a little. We make it out of town in two minutes. I lie down on Fox's muzzle, and stare at the sky. His fur made it feel like I was in field of wild grass, it was warm. Then I close my eyes and find myself drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

He was hostile and afraid. I don't blame him. He's a smart kid. He knows what my kind has been doing. Ever since the humans started to die off. My kind has been capturing and throwing humans in cages. I understand that it's for their own protection, but there are better ways to handling the situation. When I went to the Zoo, as a pup. What I saw was sad. The humans were miserable, they were separated, unable to interact with each other, and I bet they have never set foot outside of those cages. We took away their freedom. Our history with humankind has never been clear. We were always separated from them, and unaware of the each others existence. I wish I can ask Akira what it's been like for him to be out here, alone, and what happened with his parents, but it doesn't seem like he's comfortable with talking about his problems. When we go our separate ways, I hope he finds a settlement. I don't want him to end up in one of those cages. I've heard those settlements are well hidden. My kind has never found any of them. It would be better if he were there.<br>\r\n       Two hours have past since we've left the town. It seemed to be the middle of the day. I gaze at Akira's tiny sleeping form. \"Psst... Hey, brother!\" Vixen whispers. \"Hmm... What is it?\" I replied quietly. \"How is the kid doing?\" \"He seems fine. He's just asleep.\" \"It's a surprise to find someone like him out here.\" \"I know, this also might be the only positive interaction he's ever had with our kind.\" \"You think so?\" \"Yeah, when I found him, he tried to run.\" \"I can see why.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Well he has been on his own for a awhile, and the only people he has ever known was his parents, but it seems like he's warming up to you a lot.\" \"Do you really think so, Vixen?\" \"Yeah, you may not know it, but your good at sensing another's feelings, and your always calm and patient with them, so it's natural for him to warm up to you.\" Vixen stated. I never really thought about it, but Vixen was right. We just met last night, and Akira already seems comfortable with me. \"I'm glad I'm doing something right.\" I said to myself. Then after three more hours, we stop at a river for a break.</span></div></div>",

I reach down to feel it. It felt like leather. Then my stomach started to growl. \"I'm hungry.\" I sit back down, and begun rummaging through my bag. I pull out a can of peaches, a fork, and a can opener, and Yes, I own a can opener. I open the can, and begun to eat my peaches. Then I got bored, and begun to sing about how much I like to eat peaches, while eating peaches. After a few seconds, I begun feeling tremors. Then I see Jon with a bunch of... I guess logs, but they're larger than logs. \"Hey, Jon!\" I yelled. Then Jon looked down at me, without saying a thing. He just stared. \"Ahh... Do you know where everyone is?\" I asked, but he just remained silent. He sets down the logs on steroids, and walks off. I shrugged and went back to eating my peaches. I gazed at the clouds in the sky. I guessed it was almost five in the afternoon. I finish my can of peaches. It felt like hours until I feel another tremor. This time it was Raven. \"Hey, Raven!\" I yelled. \"OH, HEY AKIRA!\" She replied. \"Where is everyone? I asked Jon, but...\" \"OH YEAH, JON DOESN'T TALK A LOT. LEO AND FOX ARE FISHING, JON IS GETTING FIREWOOD, AND VIXEN AND I ARE COLLECTING STONES FOR THE FIRE.\" \"Okay, is there anything I can do to help?\" \"UHH... NOT REALLY, JUST WAIT, FOX AND LEO WILL PROBABLY BE BACK IN A FEW MINUTES.\" Then Raven left. \"Okay...\" I said. I pull out my knife and begun to play with it. \"Sigh... I bored! I wish I had a book!\" I yelled. Then it started to get dark. The sun was setting, and no one was back yet. Then the feeling from town started to happen.

I sat back down and began contemplating my encounter with Fox, and that strange shadow. Before I met Fox, I never felt this way before. I feel like I'm on high alert. I should keep my guard up just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      I climb down off the bag and began walking around. I was hoping to waste time looking around. This place was a large, open field they must have picked to be their campsite I thought. Then I stood looking out toward the horizon, watching the sun disappear as the moon and stars appeared. I was always amazed by how the universe would show its beauty, while the ugliness remained underneath. The dwindling number of the human race, The Zoo, and everything that has happened so far. It felt impossible to comprehend. I always wondered what could have been, but I know it's not something I should think about. I turn back and see it. The shadow. I pull out my knife and ready myself once more. This time I wasn't afraid. I felt calm and focused. I wasn't gonna let it kill me. I stood staring back at it. I ask. \"What do you want?\" It pointed. Then replying creepily. \"You.\" It flew towards me, claws ready. Then I pull out one more knife and successfully block both its claws. It drew back both of its' claws for another attack. I dodge and began parrying each of its' attacks. Then I saw an opening and tried to drive my knife through it, but I ended up passing through it. I turn and jumped backwards to get some distance. I stood and stared at it trying to figure out how to beat this thing. I began analyzing it. It's fast, It had claws, and is intangible, but what I did know was that it hated the light. So I decided to try something. I pull out a flash grenade. It was a tiny, grey ball with a ring of light yellow around it. I arm and throw it in the air behind me. I close my eyes and tried to focus. I began to hear it as the grenade went off. It wailed as the light bombarded it. When the light died out I open my eyes. I couldn't see it anywhere. The shadow was gone.</span></div></div>",

My thoughts were interrupted by multiple tremors. \"It's gone for now.\" I said to myself.<br>\r\nI paced back to the leather bag, as Fox and Leo appeared from a brief distance. \"YOU'RE AWAKE.\" Fox bellowed. I stood next to the raw sienna, leather bag, struggling to stand as their footfall earthquakes made standing difficult. \"Yeah\" I loudly replied, baffled by the major size difference between them and me. I noticed the haul of massive fish they've brought with them. I've noticed four fish, it was understandable, the fish were the size of that ghost town. The quake ended. Fox knelt on one knee, laying his paw flat out on the ground, motioning me to hop on. I impulsively climb on, free of hesitation. It was strange for me, I hardly know Fox that well, and I'm sleeping on his muzzle and climbing on his paw without protest. He raises me to his head, I jump on, and he stands to his full height. \"HERE, I'LL GO HELP JON WITH THE FIREWOOD.\" Leo said as he handed Fox his haul of fish before walking off. \"HOW WAS YOUR NAP.\"  Fox asked. \"It was great.\" I awkwardly replied. \"How long was I out?\" \"MOST OF THE DAY.\" Fox replied with a smirk. \"Well, umm... do you want my help.\" \"OH UH,\" \"I insist, I haven't done a whole lot today. I feel awful for that, I know I might not have your stature, but...\" I fell short of what to say, I do feel awful for doing absolutely nothing and being useless. \"HOW WELL ARE YOU WITH MAPS?\" \"I know some stuff.\" Fox places the fish in a bucket. he rummages through his bag, and pulls out some decent tech. He pulled up a screen, and marked the location of the town and our current position. \"Lets see, hmm... can you zoom out a little.\" \"SURE\" Fox readjusts the screen. \"Do you know the location of the temple? latitude and longitude.\" \"UHH, NO, NOT REALLY.\" I looked at him in the eye with disappointment. \"Wow, that's not very helpful. were you hoping to wing it.\" He looked at me with a smirky guilt face.\"Do you have any information on the temple.\" \"YEAH, I'LL PULL IT UP.\" He showed the research and It wasn't what I was expecting. \"YEAH, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DECIPHER THIS LANGUAGE, BUT ALL WE'VE GOT WAS SOUTH.\" I stared at the screen with shock, the language system presented wasn't anything many seen, I wasn't common, I knew Fox didn't know it, but I could read it. \"This language is dead, that's why it's difficult to read. You got south right though.\" \" WAIT, YOU CAN READ THAT?\" \"Yeah, it's not common language. I've seen it before. My Mom knew it.\" As I looked at the screen, each symbol and mark rearranged itself in to the English language. I motioned for him to bring the screen closer to me, and I started marking the map of the humongous screen \"We should pass through this town, then move southeast from the town to this jungle. That's where it should be.\" \"ARE YOU A GOOD LUCK CHARM, CAUSE THAT WAS AMAZING!\" </span></div></div>",

Can you enhance the photo?\" \"YEAH\"  Fox enhances the photo. We both saw that most of the markings in the photo were demolished. We both sighed simultaneously. \"Where were you able to get these photos?\" I asked. \"FROM THE SAMPLES WE ACQUIRED, BUT WE HAVEN'T BROUGHT THEM WITH US.\" He sighed once more. \" IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU BOTH HIT AN OBSTACLE, YOU WANT TO FILL ME IN.\" Raven spoke as she approached. Everyone finished whatever they were doing, and sat around the campfire. The pleasant aroma of cooked fish got me famished. \"YEAH WE'VE HIT IT ONCE MORE, BUT WE GOT MORE TO WORK WITH. THANKS TO AKIRA.\" Fox replied as he grabbed his cooked fish on a stick. He took his claws and tore off a tiny piece, handing it to me. It was the size of my head. I grabbed it. I took my first bite, it was delicious and hot. I kept chowing down as Fox filled them in on the new information we've discovered. \"WAIT, AKIRA CAN READ THAT. NONE OF US OR OUR TECH COULD DECIPHER IT.\" Vixen shouted. She looked at me with shock. \"YEAH, HE LEARNED IT FROM HIS MOTHER.\" Fox replied. \"A DEAD LANGUAGE FROM HIS MOTHER, HOW CONVENIENT. AT LEAST WE KNOW WHERE TO GO. Leo stated. Jon gave a thumbs up in approval as he took a massive bite out of his fish. \"AKIRA, HOW DO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER KNOW THIS LANGUAGE?\" Raven questioned. I replied. \"I umm... It's difficult to explain, but I'll try. This language is not something that can be spoken, only read and written. Not many can read it, because you have to born to read it. It can be taught, but it's tricky for other. It presents itself as marking and symbols to others, but for my Mom and I, it rearranges itself as plain English.\" \"AKIRA, WHEN WE GET TO THE TEMPLE, CAN YOU BE OUR TRANSLATOR.\" Fox asked. \"Oh, sure!\" I replied. I heard his tail wag a little. at some point we finished eating, and Fox made his way to one of the tents. \"It's strange,\" I spoke. \"WHAT.\" Fox asked. \"We're complete strangers, but you've been kind. Why are you being nice to me? Why haven't you've turnt me in to your authorities?\" \" YOU REMIND ME OF A FRIEND I HAD AS A PUP. SHE WAS HUMAN.\"</span></div></div>",

Sometimes I wish the situation we're in was different. Before I met you, avoiding you titans was something I was taught to do, but meeting you has changed what I thought about you and the others. Not everyone is the same. I want to help you. I don't want to run or hide anymore.\" Fox plucks me off his head, placing me on his palm. Then brings me in for an embrace, I thought my life was flashing before my eyes. I heard hard thumping. \" His' tail,\" I thought to myself. He was more gentler than I thought... like him. \"THANKS... AKIRA,\" Fox replied. I hug back. Then he pulls me away and begins licking me with his enormous tongue. \"Hey... hehe... stop... please.\" I shout and giggle. Fox stops and backs away. \"OH... HEHE... SORRY! I GOT CARRIED AWAY.\" \"It's okay.\" I replied as I try to wipe the slobber off of me. It was nice though, having someone I can be at ease with. For the first time, Fox puts me on the ground.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyday and night, even in my dreams, I think about my mom and dad.<br>\r\nMy mom's name was Nora, she was human, and she left the world when I was 7. My Dad's name is Seke, he is a anthro, a wolf, I never knew what happened to him after he was arrested by his own, I was 10.<br>\r\nThe girl in the glass cage, with cries unheard, age 9. She remained in her prison until she was a woman, age 21. For 12 years of her life, she coped with her prison. Then she met my dad. she always told me he was the biggest and strongest of his pack, not that it mattered, he was always huge to me. He was assigned to care for her by the Human Protection Bureau. He was 22.<br>\r\n\"GOOD MORNING, MY NAME IS SEKE.  HERE IT SAY'S YOUR NORA, IS THAT CORRECT?\" said the warm, pitch black wolf. \"Yes, sir.\" Nora giving an unenthusiastic reply. \"LET'S START BY CHECKING YOUR WEIGHT AND HEIGHT.\"  He pulls out a scale and hooks it up to a monitor in the room. he places her on the scale. \"HMM... IT'S SAYING YOUR BARELY A GRAM. WHAT ARE THEY FEEDING YOU?\" \"Oh, I think you did it wrong, you forgot to transfer over to human measurements.\" \"OH, I GUESS YOUR RIGHT. SORRY, FIRST DAY.\" \"Hehe... haha... let me guess, I'm also your first patient?\" \"YEAH.\" Seke replied embarrassed. \"Oh, I didn't mean it like that, I'm sorry.\" \"NO, IT'S OKAY, THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE USUALLY ASSIGNED BEFORE WE GO OUT IN THE FIELD.\" \"Your different from the others.\" \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?\" \"You show how much you care. I think you'll do great.\" \"OH, THANK YOU!\" finishing up with my mom's check-up he puts her back in her cage. <br>\r\nDays going into her care, my dad felt more interested in caring for my mom. At some point, his' betters tried assigning him field work, but he would decline just to take care of my mom. No one suspected it, but he began falling for her, and she felt the same too. He felt conflicted at some point, keeping her in a cage no longer felt right, he changed.<br>\r\n\"NORA, I'M GETTING YOU OUT OF HERE.\" \"Seke, you can't, they'll catch you if you talk or act like that.\" \"I DON'T CARE, WHAT WE'RE DOING TO YOU AND THE OTHERS, IT'S NOT RIGHT, YOU DESERVE BETTER. IT MIGHT SOUND WEIRD BUT... I LOVE YOU NORA.\" \"Seke...!\"<br>\r\nHe found a way to smuggle my mom out of his job. He packed up and left everything he knew for my mom. They were successful, he traveled on foot with her, and they remained undetected. <br>\r\nA year later my mom became pregnant with me. I don't know how they managed it, but they found a way. Then at some point I came into the world. I was tiny, barely looked anything like my dad. I only got his earth green eyes. It never mattered to him though, he was filled with love. When I was in my terrible two phase, dad would fail trying to get me to sleep and nap, unless it was in his fur. Mom was the only one who got me into bed, she was the reason I got into reading. When I turned 5 dad taught me all the survival skills, he made up some games to help hone those skills. Then I turned 7.<br>\r\n\"Dad... When will we make it to one of the settlements?\" \"AKIRA, I TOLD IT WILL TAKE AWHILE.\" We make it to an abandoned city. \"Akira, be patient, the settlements are well hidden, finding one will take time.\" Nora answered. \"What will happen when we make it to one mom, Will they let dad stay?\" Dad stopped, hesitant when I asked that question. \"HEY AKIRA, WHY DON'T YOU GO TO THAT BOOKSTORE AND READ UP FOR A LITTLE WHILE.\" Dad let me down. I ran off to the store. \"HE MIGHT BE RIGHT NORA.\" Seke said as he sat against one of the buildings. \"Seke, he's just exhausted, we all are, but we shouldn't give up.\" \"BUT WHAT IF I CAN'T STAY, WHAT IF I CAN'T BE IN YOUR LIVES.\" \"Seke, you will always be in our lives. If we can't find a settlement where we all can settle down. We will make a place for ourselves.\" \"WHY DON'T WE JUST DO THAT, GET AS FAR AS WE CAN AND SETTLE DOWN.\" \"That's better. I'll go get Akira, and tell him our new plan.\" \"OKAY\" Seke replies and lowers Nora to the ground. \"AHH... Dad, Mom!\" I screamed. \"STAY HERE!\" I was in the clutches of a wolf, Dasan. Dad came around the corner. \"DASAN, PUT... HIM... DOWN!\" \"OH, SEKE ITS BEEN AWHILE, I'M SURPRISED YOU ABLE TO PRODUCE A HUMAN SON. I'M TAKING BACK THE WOMAN, AND I'LL BE TAKING THIS ONE AS WELL. YOU WILL BE ARRESTED FOR MULTIPLE CHARGES, IF YOU DON'T FIGHT IT, YOU MIGHT GET OFF WITH NOTHING.\" \"GRRR... I DARE YOU TO TRY, PUT HIM DOWN, AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN!\" The wolf put me down, and I ran back to my mom. \"NORA, AKIRA GET AWAY, QUICKLY.\" \"SEKE, I'LL TEACH YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN DEFY YOUR BETTERS.\" Mom and I ran off as fast we could. The fighting begun. I wasn't able to see what was going on, but they both could be heard from miles away. It got quite quickly. We then heard Dasan. \"HUMANS WHERE ARE YOU, YOUR PROTECTER HAS BEEN BEAT, SUBMIT.\" \"Akira to your father, see if he is okay, I will try to lure him away. GO NOW!\" I ran hearing my mom shouting to distract the wolf. I find dad on his back, claw marks all over him. \"Dad, wake up, are you okay? Mom needs help!\" he gets back up. \"AKIRA, HOP ON.\" I jump on dad's paw and he places me on his head. We make it to a bridge disconnected from the other side. mom was cornered and the wolf had where he thought he wanted her. \"DASAN, STOP!\" Dad yelled, but the wolf didn't listen. Then mom said something. \"I Love You Both, I'm Sorry.\" She jumped. \"NO...NO...NO\" Dasan muttered as he tried to catch her. I was stunned, I couldn't move, breathe, or say anything. Dad screamed and cried. \"NOOOO... NO.NO.NO.\" No one moved then I said. \"Dad, we should go.\" He looked at me, then Dasan. He ran with me fast, fleeing from the wolf. at some point we find a good place to stop. \"Huff... Huff... Huff...\" I was hyperventilating, breaking down, processing everything. Dad tries calming me down. \"Why... Dad, Why?\" I cried. he couldn't answer. I just cry myself to sleep in his fur. <br>\r\nI wake up. \"SORRY AKIRA, DID I WAKE YOU?\" I can hear the sadness in his voice. \"Dad... Are you... Sad?\" he didn't react. \"I... I AM... I AM SAD, AKIRA.\"<br>\r\nWe just kept moving. We continued, we had no choice. It wasn't always bad, we had our good days. Then I turned 10.<br>\r\nThe wolf, Dasan, he brought a pack with him. Dad held them off long enough for me to escape. He was arrested. I was alone. My mom and dad were gone. I've gone 6 years without them. I miss them both, but I have to keep moving.</span></div></div>",

Luckily for us, it's skin was over a thousand miles thick, meaning we had plenty of space to move in and make ours. Over time, the colony grew itself - we used the iron from the creature's blood to build cities, as well as harvesting any Asteroids that it happened to eat (which required a lot of protective gear to survive the stomach acids alone). It's blood plasma was distilled into a new water source. It wasn't pleasant to drink, but there was enough to supply us all without debating an alternative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all this time, it didn't seem to notice us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving forwards a thousand years, I decided to be the first man to climb out onto the surface.

It's the first day of school and you don't want to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah woke up with a start, sitting bolt upright in bed. Almost immediately she knew that something wasn't right. The dream that she had woken up from was so vivid. She was in her house, sleeping, when she was woken up by a bright light and then pulled...somewhere. She was told that she would be transferred to another universe, where she was needed. She was told not to be afraid of what was going to happen, that she would be all right and everything would work out in the end. There was no way to tell who she was talking, or perhaps she just didn't remember. They might have been balls of light, or thin, stick-like silhouettes bathed in blinding illumination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the details of this strange dream were fading, Sarah had the creeping feeling that it wasn't over. She looked around her room and immediately spotted several differences. All of her furniture was the same -- her bed was exactly the way she remembered it, and her dresser and computer desk were in their usual places -- but some things were very, very new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were pictures all around her room of some...immense creature that was part-man, part-horse. He had short, thick brown fur and gray hooves, and his mane was a brown so dark it was nearly black. His hands were rough, padded leather on the palms, and tipped with blunt, hoof-like nails on each of his four fingers. He kept modest (as much as a titan like him could) with a simple pair of overalls that were big enough to cover city blocks. Sarah couldn't get an exact sense of scale from the pictures, but she knew that this...man was immense, measured in miles the way she was measured in feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was stunning. She had no idea a being like this could exist, but at the same time she felt herself regarding these pictures with no small amount of affection. How could she feel so strongly for someone she had never met before? It was as if some hidden part of herself knew things that she didn't. She sat in bed for a few minutes, trying to figure out what else she knew about this...thing. Her mind came up blank, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what she did know. Her name was Sarah Lancaster. Her parents were Philip and Rory Lancaster, and they lived in rural Pennsylvania, where they owned a horse farm. She had one brother, whose name she couldn't remember, and he was 18 years old. She was 20, she was studying to be a veterinarian, and this life -- whatever it was -- was not hers. She didn't belong here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, honey,\" her mom called again. \"We really have to get moving. Avery's waiting for you in the Meeting Area. You don't want him to come over here looking for you, do you? You know what happened last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery. Why did that name sound so familiar?

And with that realization came a flood of memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered her parents coming home with something that looked like a small, bipedal horse one afternoon. She was told that this was her new brother, and that they would all have to move someplace very far away so there'd be enough room for him. Sarah remembered her mom being pregnant before, but it took her a while to connect the two events. One in every ten million births resulted in this sort of mega-sapient organism, as they were called, and no one knew why. It just...started happening a hundred years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when they moved to rural Pennsylvania. There was a burgeoning mega-sapiens community there, with an adjoining village where family and friends could be close by. She remembers going to school with Avery and a bunch of other students -- both human and mega -- and got along with just about everyone really well. In fact, she chose a rural veterinary college just so she could keep living at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered Avery's first day at school. His first school play. How he had become a rambunctious, willful colt and how the destruction of half the farmland outside of their village cured him of that. She remembered having long conversations with him about how tough it was to be his size, how difficult it was to be so careful. But how much harder it was to imagine hurting his family. She remembered going out on double-dates with him and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's head spun. She had to stop thinking about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents were waiting for her downstairs, looking as they always had. Philip was a tall, middle-aged man with a kindly face and light brown hair streaked with grey. His eyes were almost honey-colored, always amused and sharp. Rory was paler, with nearly-black hair storming around her head and shoulders. Her blue eyes were almost predatory, giving her a hard look that made her maternal personality all the more surprising. Both of them wore conspicuous bracelets around their left wrists; they were a quarter-inch thick on all sides, and appeared to be made out of solid metal. Lights coursed underneath the surface in a pattern that made Sarah think of circuitry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, sleepyhead,\" her mother said, reaching to usher her out the door. \"You know how impatient your brother gets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer father moved in behind her as she was being lead out of the house. \"And goodness knows we don't want him peeking in at us. He'll give the whole neighborhood a fright. Have you got your ID turned on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nID. Sarah briefly thought about it, and a phrase came to her: &lt;i&gt;interaction device&lt;/i&gt;. The metal band around her wrist would let her interact with the megas safely. They provided a quantum forcefield that rendered her immune to an insane amount of pressure, in case something were to fall on them or (Heaven forbid) one of them stepped on her accidentally. It even came with a small supply of oxygen in case an incident occurred. They automatically synced with similar devices the megas had, allowing them to be seen and heard, mitigating the ear-splittingly, bone-crunchingly loud voices of the titans and making things that much more...manageable. The same part of her mind that recalled this information didn't seem too impressed with this. IDs had been available publically for at least fifty years, with new features being added all the time. But Sarah was floored by the technology. This is the sort of thing you only saw in science-fiction novels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly checked the ID, instinctively knowing where on the smooth surface to touch. The lights running just underneath the metallic surface turned green briefly and there was a strange prickle all over her skin. Her mind was telling her it was a familiar feeling even though she had never experienced before. \"It is now. Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was so futuristic. The car that the Lancasters stepped into was completely self-run, leaving them to talk about their plans for the day as it whirred to life and took them out of their garage and onto the road. It was roomy enough to look like a small train car, with a navigational panel in the front that gave them their route, destination, weather and news, and approximate time of arrival. Even the large windows that Sarah looked out of had an option for some sort of \"augmented reality\" display. She played with it a bit while her parents talked, and learned that she had a near-instant directory of her neighborhood. She could watch herself traversing a map of her own village in real time. It was really quite cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they sped out of their neighborhood, they came upon a place that looked a bit like a train station. The front of the Lancaster's car magnetically locked with the back of the car in front of them, and there they waited for a moment as other cars attached to theirs or whirred to a stop in a side lot. People got out of those cars and joined the newly-formed train; a couple of people even wandered into their car, gave a polite greeting, and played with the augmented reality display in their windows. Some part of Sarah recognized them, but she couldn't for the life of her remember their names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only waited a few minutes before the 'train' of interlocked cars started moving. They were quickly whisked away from the village, into a beautifully-maintained buffer zone between their village and the place where the megas lived. Miles of forest gave way to fields, then rolling hills that looked increasingly deserted. Then, finally, the train came to the city of the megas around a bend.<br>\r\nIt was hard to know what she was looking at, at first. Gigantic skyscrapers stabbed the clouds some distance away from the tracks they were on. Even though Sarah could see them, they appeared to be at least a mile away on either side. They were either incredibly huge or her ID was allowing her to see things in a way she wouldn't normally be able to. Each building seemed to stretch on forever; it took her five minutes to run the length of one, even at their incredible speed. Sarah looked at the map, and it told her that this one of the mega's houses. Privacy protocol wouldn't let her know who owned it, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's mind whirled; she had been struggling with the idea of creatures so big, let alone the idea of interacting with them on a regular basis, and each new piece of information forced her to re-adjust her ideas. It seemed every time she started to get a handle on how immense they were, she was being told by her environment that these beings were bigger still. How would she react when she finally saw Avery and his friends? Would she simply go into shock? Would some part of her brain take over in her stead, the part that found this completely normal?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky darkened considerably, quickly. It was enough to snap her out of her revelrie just in time for her view of the mega-skyscrapers to be replaced with a wall of waving white fur. It landed with a cataclysmic impact, the ground rolling like a wave away from it until it came to the train. It hit a forcefield and passed underneath with minimal effect. It just felt like Sarah's stomach dropped several inches. She shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the faces in her car turned to look at her. Her mother merely chuckled. \"Excited to see Timothy, aren't you? He wanted to surprise you by meeting the train.\" She looked back at Sarah with a broad grin. \"Don't be shy, you can wave in front of your parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt her cheeks warming, though she wasn't entirely sure why. She looked out of the window and was met with the single biggest foot she had ever seen. It looked like a rabbit's foot, broadened out to fit a bipedal stance, and was immense -- even in proportion to the body on top of it. It rose like a great cliff for what looked to be thousands of feet, leading up to an ankle that stretched even higher and a great mountain of a calf even higher than that. She could barely see the knee from where she was sitting, and even that looked hazy with distance. The size of this thing was...unthinkable. Not knowing what else to do, she waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Sarah's surprise, a hand came down from the sky, filling the rest of her upwards horizon. It waggled its fingers, and both of her parents laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tim's such a sweetheart,\" her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gigantic rabbit stepped beside the train as it rode into what looked like an enormous artificial hill. The car tilted back as it seemed to climb the tracks at a fairly steep, fast grade. Sarah realized that she was almost to her destination, and that once the car stopped it would disconnect and be carried (carried!) by Avery over to their meeting area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like Sarah's stomach never recovered from that first big jolt. Faced with the reality of meeting these impossibly-sized creatures, she started to panic. What in the world was she doing here? When and how would she get back home? Whose....whose strange life *was* this? She didn't have time to think about this much before...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah's mind was still twirling when they entered the station. Several of the people who had joined them before got out and milled around, meeting other people from other villages who commuted in to interact with these titans. After hugs and pleasantries were exchanged, they filed into different cars. A shadow passed, a wall of fur descended, and one by one the cars disappeared. Each time Sarah felt like screaming. The only thing that kept her from doing so was how normally everyone treated this. Her parents chatted peaceably at each other, making their plans for the rest of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow passed over their car. The ID on Sarah's wrist activated, giving her a heads up display that included a video feed of what was happening outside of her car and information about the titans that had made it to the platform. She had no idea what camera could be so far away to take in all of the multi-mile horse and rabbit, nor so powerful that she could still see her own car and its platform between the two mountainous animals. Whatever it was, the technology had to have been far beyond anything she had experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the left of the platform was the gigantic rabbit that had followed her car from the titan's metropolis to this much more relaxed mountain range. He was listed as Timothy Hutch. He was a white rabbit Mega, apparently, and his full height and weight were listed by the heads-up display: 7 miles, 23.37 billion tons. It was difficult for Sarah to even wrap her brain around that number. Billions of tons. And it was just outside of her car, peering down at her. She had never felt so small and helpless before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to him was Avery. He was a black horse with a white stripe of fur bisecting his long head between the eyes. He was noticeably taller than Timothy and a great deal wider as well. The rabbit barely came up to his shoulder and looked to be only half his width. Even if the horse had been her height, she would have found him an incredible physical specimen. As it was, he was nothing short of deific. The heads-up display gave his stats, too. Her brother was 8.5 miles tall and weighed 62.78 billion tons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy reached for the car that was little more than a spec to either of them, but Avery nudged the rabbit's paw aside. The mega-horse had rather thick fetlocks covering his wrist and forearm, and it looked like an entire forest of white fur had descended around them. Sarah looked out the window, but she couldn't see much more than that. She returned to the video feed hovering in the air in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit was looking up at Avery with an expression of confusion and annoyance. \"I'd really like to take Sarah to breakfast.\" His voice sounded surprisingly normal considering how large he was, but the rumble of it still shook the miniscule car they were in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, dude, but they're my family. I'll take them.\" Avery's voice was deep and booming -- nothing like the way she remembered her brother. He took up the car without another word, and the Lancasters felt themselves rising a few miles in a very short amount of time. Sarah assumed there must be inertial dampeners or something in the car; they would have been flattened to the floor otherwise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view outside the window changed rapidly. At first, there was only the platform -- then there was a field of blue denim that Sarah recognized as Avery's overalls. That switched to the horse's immense chest once they got high enough, then a brief view of a bullishly thick neck, then an immense horse's snout. Finally, a deep, dark brown eye that looked like it could be the size of the moon peered in at them. It blinked, and Sarah could feel the rush of air from the movement rock the car gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, fam,\" Avery boomed. The rumble from his voice was much stronger now, shaking everything around. \"Ready for breakfast? I know Sarah's got a bit test today, so we'll have to be quick.\" The eye crinkled, and on the video display she could see her brother smiling at them. Without another word he turned and went for the shorn mountain-top that doubled as a table for these two. Sarah saw that Timothy remained where he was through the video feed. A shadow passed over the rabbit's face, and he stared at the retreating form of the horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery turned to look at the rabbit over one broad shoulder. \"You coming, dude? We don't have a lot of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim responded...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah watched in rapt fascination as a multitude of emotions crossed over the rabbit's face. She was a bit surprised that she was able to recognize so much in him, just from the twitch of an ear or the flick of a whisker. She knew that Timothy was annoyed, and then memories that weren't hers told her that he really didn't like her brother. They had conversations about this -- fights, even. It made her shiver to remember her standing on a cliff-side, the storm whipping her hair as she screamed up at a titan miles away. What's worse, he was yelling back, bits of rock falling from the mountain underneath her simply from the volume of his voice. She remembered what he looked like -- ears flattened, teeth bared. Instead of feeling afraid, she remembered being angry and frustrated. It was odd -- she really would have been scared shitless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnconsciously, she looked away from the video feed and hugged her arms against herself. Her mother noticed. \"Are you all right, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah nodded, forcing herself to smile. \"Oh, I'm fine. Just thinking about this test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRory chuckled. \"You always were a worrier. But you've studied hard and you're a smart girl. You'll pass this with no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she started the conversation, she found it easy to continue. \"Mom, it's not just any test. It's a mid-term. Passing with a B is not an option. I'll need nothing less than an A to keep up my GPA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhilip leaned over and touched her leg. \"I know how much this means to you, my girl. But you can't let yourself get worked up over it. You get nervous, you get tight. And if you get tight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you aren't flexible enough to see the answer around the problem.\" Sarah remembered that her father always told her this when she worried; it was one of those things that seemed constant from her world to this one. She had two versions of the same memory fighting for dominance in her brain -- in one, Avery was on her dad's knee while he comforted them, and in another, they were all in the vast black plain of Avery's palm. It was a strange feeling, having these memories called up from a life she didn't have. She didn't know if she would ever get used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled, a more genuine one this time, and squeezed her father's hand with her own. \"Thanks, Dad. I just....veterinary medicine is a super-competitive field these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer parents looked at each other and chuckled. \"Don't we know it. Everyone wants to be the first to crack the secret of the mega-sapiens.\" Philip shook his head. \"Well, if anyone's going to do it, it's going to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah felt a flush of pride and gratitude. No matter what she wanted to do, her parents had her back every step of the way. They were two of the most unselfish, long-suffering people she had ever known, and the made sure she and Avery had a good life no matter what happened. The fact that her brother was a horse the size of a small city brought immense challenges for them, but they had all faced them gladly. Other people weren't so lucky -- like Tim, whose parents abandoned him the moment they saw what he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe structure they were in landed on the mountain top, a soft bump indicating that Avery had rolled them to the surface and it was safe to get out now. \"Sorry about the rough landing, everybody,\" he said. Sarah felt her ID chirp and a forcefield protected her from the soundquake of her brother's voice. It still made her knees weak. \"Still getting the hang of making sure I'm as gentle as I need to be. You can come on out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I wanted to carry them. I've got a much lighter touch than you do and I aced my Human Interaction classes.\" The only slightly less booming voice of Tim rattled the Lancasters as they stepped out of the vehicle. Sarah was the last to leave, and for a moment she was blinded as the sun streamed in around her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you did, Tim, you won't let me forget about it. Still, how am I going to learn if I don't get in some practice, dude?\" Avery sounded friendly enough, but she knew it was just a show for her parents' benefit -- and hers. Tim didn't like her brother, but Avery liked the rabbit even less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true enough, I suppose.\" The rabbit relented, but she guessed it was only because he wanted to focus on better things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her vision cleared, she saw a site that should have made her insane. Filling her vision were two unspeakably immense beings, hazy with vision yet blocking her view of the entire sky before them. They were so big that the mountain top made a cozy \"table\" for them, even though it spread out for miles in front of her. Avery was dressed in a pair of blue overalls that strained around his incredible bulk, and his hands were the relative size of bricks -- incredibly, it looked like the stallion was still growing into his own body. Next to him, Timothy was noticeably thinner but still quite well-toned. He looked like he was still growing, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the rabbit saw her, he leaned down until his face was all any of them could see. Then his nose, and then his chin. One immense paw gripped the size of the mountaintop, creating and earthquake that made them all sway on their feet. \"Sarah!\" he chirped, his whiskers bobbing with excitement. \"It's so good to see you. How've you been? A pleasure, as always, Mr. and Mrs. Lancaster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRory and Philip both nodded to the mega-rabbit and smiled happily. \"Great to see you too, Tim. We're all fine here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all sat down to breakfast. The Lancasters were seated at a permanent table that had been carved out of bedrock and fitted with a display that worked quite well with their IDs. Both Avery and Tim sat cross-legged in the valley next to the mountain, filling it with their bulk. They spoke about safe things -- classes and plans for the semester, news that any of them had heard from the outside world. Their small community was still seeking representation in Congress, but it would be another ten years or so before DC was deemed safe for a visit by a Mega. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah had eggs, toast and orange juice. All of it was fresh, grown right her in the community. One part of her had never had a breakfast so good, while another thought the eggs could have used some salt. Avery had a nutrient bar made of oats, barley and honey. Timothy had one made of blueberries and alfalfa hay. She knew that they both had digestive systems that were as blended between human and animal DNA as their appearance was. They could eat meat, but neither of them really liked to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, the plates were scraped, the coffee was drained and everyone was standing up to begin their day. Timothy, of course, asked to carry Sarah to classes, but Avery quickly stepped up to ask as well -- for more practice, he said. The look on both faces told her that they had something on their minds to talk to her about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll let you handle this one, Sarah.\" Philip clapped a hand on her shoulder while Rory hugged her. \"You have a good day now. All of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will,\" Avery and Timothy rumbled. Then they both looked at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuffled her feet uncomfortably -- she hated being stuck in the middle like this. Avery usually didn't want her undivided attention unless it was really important, while...well, Tim probably just needed to be in the company of someone who loved him. Seeing Sarah with her family always made him a bit wistful, a bit clingy. She sympathized with the ache he must have felt, that pang of belonging. Maybe her boyfriend needed her a bit more than her brother right now.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sarah looked up at Tim and smiled as brightly as she could. \"Bun, Avery really could use the practice handling little old me. Mind if he takes me to school today? I'll meet you in the Quad for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's ears dipped but he managed a smile. Sarah knew that he was taking this like a personal rejection, and they would need to talk this out through the rest of the day. She sighed inwardly, but accepted that as the way things were going to go. If there was something her brother needed to tell her, then she would do her best to listen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right,\" the Rabbit said. \"Take good care of her, Avery.\" He was trying to be gracious, but Sarah could detect the sadness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, she's my sister. Of course I'll take good care of her.\" Avery, for his part, couldn't keep the annoyance out of his booming rumble. Sarah winced, but she understood why he responded the way he did. If this were allowed to continue, she thought, it very well might come to blows one of these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimothy, for his part, didn't respond to the challenge. He simply took one last look at Sarah and thundered away. His long strides took him over the horizon rather quickly, his impossible form growing hazy with distance by the time he stepped twice. A third one was accompanied by a distant thump, and then he disappeared from view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't imagine what it must be like to live in a world where you were so large you could test the laws of physics. Nothing that big should be able to exist -- at least in the way that it does -- without serious issues to contend with. Yet, here was Avery and Timothy, both impossible creatures that the world was forced to deal with. Just the thought of them took her breath away, but seeing them so close was something else entirely. She hesitated as she approached her brother's building-dwarfing fingers, the tips pressed against the cliff face as tightly as he could make them without chipping rock away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, sis,\" the horse thundered. \"We don't have all day. You don't want to be late for your class now, do you?\" Her brother's long equine face was a little harder to read, but she could tell from his expression that he was trying to keep the mood light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shimmied onto the enormous hand as quickly as she could, her body taking over with a surprisingly strong muscle memory. She had done this thousands of time, she suddenly remembered. It was no big deal. Never mind the fact that she's in the hand of a six-mile-tall horse, or that one twitch or spread of her fingers and she would be plummeting miles down to the ground. That wasn't a big deal at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery rose up to his full height and peered down at Sarah to make sure she was secure. She knew that he had an ID as well, that automatically detected for life forms in his vicinity and magnified his range of vision to focus in on them automatically. Without them, he wouldn't be able to see the mite-sized people he shared this community with, and he'd be even more dangerous than he was now. It stung her a bit to think of her brother as a danger to life in the community, but with his size it was absolutely undeniable. He could erase entire city blocks with one step from a hoof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in silence for a little while, with Avery glancing at her every now and again. She could tell that he wanted to talk to her, but he hadn't yet worked up the courage to do so. That was OK. He would speak up in his own time. For the moment, that gave her time to get used to the extraordinary thoom of his hooves and the continuous thundering of his breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't speak until they were nearly at the university, and then he stopped. He took a deep breath and sighed. To Sarah, it looked like his chest was an expanding storm cloud, solid shiny black framed against a blue sky. When he exhaled, his breath smelled of sweetgrasses and fruit. If he were any closer to small buildings, the force of it would have sheared them right out of the bedrock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah,\" he began, then took another deep breath. \"I...I don't think this is my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked at that. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I'm...not supposed to be like this. Like, a giant horse I mean. I wasn't like this when I went to bed last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart skipped a beat. Avery must have seen her go pale, because suddenly she was lifted closer to the colossal horse's face. \"Are you all right down there?\" He sounded genuinely concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no it's fine. I...don't think this is my life either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery whinnied in surprise. His ears flicked and he looked apologetic for a moment or two. \"Sorry. Are you saying what I think you're saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That yesterday you were just my bratty younger brother and we lived in a normal world without giant animals running around all over the place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery laughed at that. \"Yeah, exactly.\" He breathed a heavy sigh of relief. \"Aw man, thank goodness I'm not the only one. I thought I was going crazy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah brightened and sat up in the giant horse's palm. \"With the two sets of memories?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, like two versions of the same thing. In one I'm always in the house with you and Mom and Dad. And in the other, I'm just like...this. You have no idea how weird it is being this big. It's...it's really scary, Sare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart immediately leapt for her brother. She hadn't even considered what it must be like for someone to go from normal to a city-sized horse. Just changing to another species would be difficult enough. Adding impossible size to it would have to be...a strain to the psyche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Avery, I can't imagine what you're going through. Listen...I don't know what's going on exactly, but if it's happened to us it must have happened to other people. I'll...try to find out if there's anything going on. If I hear anything, I'll let you know. You'll do the same for me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery smiled, broad flat teeth bigger than buildings gleaming down at her. \"Of course! Aw man, Sarah, I can't tell you how relieved I am. I'm really glad I talked to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled broadly and patted the plain of his palm below her. \"I am too. Now, we should get to class before we're both late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvery thundered over to the drop-off point and let Sarah go there. She scampered away to classes quickly, her mind reeling with both the pressure of her mid-term and her conversation with her brother. What was going on here? Surely there was some sort of...consciousness transfer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and found her way to her first class. This test would need her full concentration. Even if she was in some alternate, strange reality, she would need to give this her full attention.</span></div></div>",

There's an oak walk-in wardrobe off to the side with enough space to occupy your entire bedroom as you remember it and a marble-walled box of some kind leads off from that. A set of mahogany shelves stands opposite your bed stocked full of hardback books, the kind you see in the private libraries and studies of stately homes. Finally the bedside table holds a most elegant reading lamp and, curiously enough, a fresh cup of tea. Someone left you a drink that would have to be drunk within minutes and so must've known you'd wake soon. Taking the saucer in your hand you marvel at the fine china with the characteristic blue pattern associated with the Ming dynasty. You take a cautious sip; it's perfect, everything about it is just the way you like it. Still you have to wonder what happened. There are no walls you can see nor any other features beyond the furnishings that are specifically set around your bed. How can this be your bedroom?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finish the tea and put the cup and saucer down on the bedside table before getting up, deciding to check if any of those books will give you an idea. You browse over the titles: <i>The Divine Authority</i>, <i>A History of the World</i>, <i>The Laws of the Universe</i>, <i>Civilisation: A Guide to Human Life</i>, <i>Animals and Anthros: Spot the Difference</i>, you stop when you come across a more familiar title in this lot; <i>Precious Memories</i>. You take this book off the shelf and sit in an easy-chair you don't recall seeing earlier and confirm that it's a family album. The photos are stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you find a couple of anthropomorphic animals cradling a smaller equivalent; you identify the species as fox, raccoon and the baby's a dog of some kind. The second picture shows a single female anthro bouncing a young male on her knee, both are rabbits. The third shows you as a toddler standing in the middle of a golden forest... or is it a field?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's bewildering why you've got a photo album full of furries and of you standing on oddly-coloured plains and in oddly-coloured fields or forests. One thing's for sure those anthros sure are beautiful; every one of them, male and female, possess powerful charisma that would make even the most ardent heterosexuals and homosexuals take a bisexual stance. However you find yourself completely incapable of tolerating any real romantic feelings for these beings. Suddenly you hear a magnificent voice addressing you from up above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how much those memories mean to you.\" It says. \"But it's high time you got ready for the day.\" You close the book and put it back before it's even registered that you can't find the will to disobey that voice. Looking round you discover that your bed's already made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, where are you?\" You ask, prompting the angelic voice to giggle before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up here, silly mortal.\" You look up and are blown away by the sight of a gorgeous mink anthro looking down at you. She was immense! In the distance you can see her fingers resting upon the plateau, they must've been at least a mile thick.</span></div></div>",

Your are lying in a four-poster bed, the sheets of which are a deep purple colour, and the frame is constructed out of a dark wood, which you guess to be mahogany, and has been inlaid with gold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw the curtain of your bed and your attention is immediately drawn to your surroundings. An elegant table is positioned to the left of your bed, formed out of an upturned marble pyramid, with a spiral carved into it, inlaid with gold and supported by a blue crystal frame. Resting on top of it is a small clock made of brass, hundreds of tiny gears visible on its surface, constantly rotating this way and that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to the rest of the room. The walls are constructed out of a whitewashed marble and several alcoves have been built into the walls to hold decorative items like small urns and the occasional manuscript displaying what appeared to be hieroglyphs. You see a bookcase built out of the same wood as your bed and reluctantly step onto the semi-cold marble floor and approach it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to browse the titles displayed on the spines of the various books, but none are recognisable. Many seems to be religious in nature, but do not belong to any religion you have ever heard of. You pull a faux-leather-bound book entitled '<i>Anthros, Animals, And Proper Worship</i>' out of the bookcase and examine it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe front cover has a simple depiction of a pawpad on it, while the back has two Vetruvian man-esque diagrams of a human and what seems to be an anthropomorphic fox, as well as a normal fox, all three arranged in a triangle, with lines reaching out from each of them to the other two. Puzzled, you slide the book back into place and notice one called '<i>To My Brother And High Priest</i>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retrieve it from the case and flip it open, and realise it is a photo album of sorts. A note falls out and you bend down to retrieve it.<br>\r\n It reads, <br>\r\n'<i>To my brother and high priest,<br>\r\nI know you often long for the past, and experience a great deal of nostalgia. Me and your other sisters have compiled this book for you so that you may indulge in whatever happy memories you desire, as we know you are also under a lot of stress due to your duties. Your Sister and goddess,<br>\r\nLily</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't really sure of what to make of that note. You had a goddess as a sister? And you were her high priest, as well? You slip the note back into the book and begin to leaf through it, until you come across a picture that truly stuns you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Five figures, wrapped in swaddling cloths. Two anthro dragons, one pure gold, the other white as silver with a gold underbelly. One anthro horse, with chestnut brown fur, and sparkling blue eyes. One anthro dolphin, her skin as grey as a stormcloud. And finally, an anthro vixen, her red fur contrasting with her black hands, which were eagerly grasping the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you, in the background, a toddler, beaming at your sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set the book down on the table, stunned and slightly shaken. You attempt to gather your thoughts but you are interrupted when a loud but gentle and kind voice, seemingly coming from nowhere, says to you,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Brother? Are you alright?</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Shutting it off you climbed out of bed and wiped the sleep from your eyes. That was a weird dream you had last night. You barely even remembered what it was about but that doesn't matter now. Not when you are so close...Getting up and walking over to your closet you so you could put on some clothes and get to work. You opened your closet and were greeted by the mirror on the door's inside. Apparently you stay up so long working that you fell asleep in your work clothes...again. You were glad no was around to see this and closed the closet. You then left you room and entered your laboratory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour lab was quite simply huge. It was an old aircraft hanger for Nuclear B-52s hidden in the mountains. After the fall of the Soviet Union this place fell into disuse and was put up for public auction a few years ago. There weren't many bidders and you could use a place like this so you bought it. Despite your young age you were very intelligent and gained a lot of money through your scientific exploits. A place of this size was perfect for the project you were working on. Speaking of which you turned to the pods containing your 'daughters'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking up one entire side of the hangar were 3 giant pods filled with a green liquid. Floating inside them were your daughters. You created them after splicing animal DNA with humans. You admit you had a fascination with the story <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau. </i> Unfortunately there was a slight mutation and they began to grow out of control. They final stabilized at you guessed about a 1500 feet in height. You'd been educating them through on of your inventions. It allowed you to speak directly with their minds through the various wire providing them life support. They'd already been informed of your relationship with them and their vast height difference with the rest of the world. They had expressed joy at having a father but were understandably upset at their appearance and size which would certainly make having friendly relationships significantly harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the first pod was Marie. She was a grey furred cat. She asserted herself as leader of the group given how she spoke with the others and the amount of respect and admiration they had for her. She was also a scientist after your own heart. You think it might be her instinctual curiosity giving her such and interest in science. You would have long conversations throughout the night and she'd offer a good second opinion on some of your work. You looked forward to working with her in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the second pod was Anna. She was a German Shepard and unlike her quieter sisters she was loud and quick. That didn't mean she was an less intelligent. Sometimes when you and Marie would try to find an answer to a particularly hard question she'd come in and tell you the solution. Like Marie she was slightly interested in science but admitted paleontology was more her speed. Marie then mentioned something about Dogs &amp; Bones and you swore you could see the dog girl floating in the pod blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last pod contained Clara. Clara was a brown furred dairy cow. She was more interested in medicine and humanitarian work then science. You encouraged her to follow her dreams like your father encouraged you. She was glad that you supported her and couldn't wait to bring food and medicine to the needy. You hate to admit it but once when she mentioned the word 'nourishment' your eyes wandered to the large... assets were currently pressed up against the glass. You could tell that was definitely the Cow DNA at work. Since humans didn't have udders her body improvised. You didn't think it was possible for a female to support breasts that large without them either sagging or causing back pains. Her spine had adapted and was much thicker than a regular human one so she'd have no problems there &amp; they didn't sag in the slightest. On the bright side she could provide milk to a lot of... No Bad Brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went over to the computer console in front of the pods to see if everything was ready. Yes. Today was the day. You felt a something push on your mind and you heard a female voice you recognized as Marie's say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is that you father? I trust everything is finally ready?!\"</i> she said with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is sweetie. Everything is finally ready.\" You answered back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then began to stir happily in their pods. You've been growing them for over five years. Teaching, and caring for them. All of your hard work and sacrifice was finally going to pay off. They were going have to invent several new Nobel Prizes to award you. The money from that was definitely let the girls follow their dreams like you followed yours. Who knows. They might even be awarded Nobel Prizes too someday. Final preparations are now complete. You then hit the button that would finally awaken your daughters.</span></div></div>",

As you stirred you look around to find that there was something decidedly off about your bedroom; it seemed to be a lot bigger than before and there were windows everywhere. Eventually you realise that what you're looking at is effectively the entirety of the house you're in; it's all open plan! There's only one space where there was a distinct interior wall that you figured must be the bathroom but the rest of the top floor seemed to be dedicated to your bedroom with a number of other beds, presumably for visitors. No doors separate this area from the balcony overlooking the ground floor and, curiously enough, there are stairs at every corner. Once you summon up the willpower to rise you make your way out onto the balcony and look at the open space below you. There's another interior wall lining up a bit too well with the one on the first floor which, to your mind, must be the kitchen space. The rest of the space seemed to be a living room with the alcoves formed by various columns functioning as spaces for similar non-essential living space, such as a TV space or a library-type area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you recover your clothes you make your way over to the walled-off portion of the top floor and open a surprisingly large door to find that there's not only a fairly spacious bathroom but also a separate space for dressing and even a wet room with a walk-in shower. As you do yourself up ready for the day you feel a number of steady tremors reverberate through the house, causing you to worry for a moment until you notice that these tremors are too rhythmic to be an earthquake. As you recall the rate of them as being reminiscent of footsteps you hear a familiar voice ring through the very foundations of the house while remaining at a polite and reasonable volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you up yet?\" That voice seems so familiar to you, there's something almost familial to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are a...</span></div></div>",

Rubbing the crust off it, you found yourself on a weird bed. You don't know why but if felt weird like a couch. It was too dark to see the color but you had a hunch it was white. Walking towards any direction, it took a full minute just to reach a wall. \"Ok,\" you said with a eye raised. \"What's going on,\" you said as you touch the wall. It was cold as metal as you pull your hand away surprised. \"You're finally awake,\" a male voice boom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sky got a lot darker as you felt immense weight around your side. Soon you found a giant eyeball probably 60 ft from bottom to top. You were in complete shock as the eye ball looked at you intensely when it suddenly blink in a fraction of a second. Something that big shouldn't move so fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe not again,\" it boomed. \"This is the third time this month...that blow to your head really messed you up man,\" he said as he pulled you away so you can see his full face. You can tell it's a wolf anthro, male too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...let me work my magic,\" he said as he let you go to fall on his palm. Falling down, you landed with a soft plop with a bit of pain but nothing broken. \"Sorry about that...keep on forgetting you can't survive without remembering what we learned as partners when we were kids. Holding on to the pink flesh of his palm, you and the wolf were at a table with a few steps of his colossal, padded feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting his hand, you fell rolling down his palm towards the hard table. With a hard landing, you soon stood up in pain. \"Sorry about that,\" he said as he stared towards his bare belly button before looking to his face. \"To answer your question, I'm about two miles to you,\" he said as if he read your mind. The only thing in your mind was fear. And all these puzzling questions running through your mind. \"Don't worry Mack, this won't hurt a bit,\" he said as the index finger of his right hand was falling towards you. Thinking he was going to skewer you with his long claw. You ran but it was futile as his finger landed softly but not enough to crack a rip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow dude....I ain't going to tick a claw into you or anything like that. We're best buds,\" those few words calmed you down as his finger glow blue. Comfort came all over your body as your brain starts to feel unlock. All types of memories seeped into you mind as you finally remember everything. Pulling his finger away, the wolf crouched down to see if his buddy is ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-yeah...I'm ok,\" you said reading your friend Marty mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow man...if you don't stop having amnesia I'm going to have to take you to the Doctor,\" he smiled cheerily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure and you're paying the bill,\" you said as you rub the back of your head in pain. \"Pick me up, we got to get ready for class, we just started collage you know,\" as your friends index finger and thumb gently picked you up. Letting go you fell towards his palm as you remembered how to slow down you decent with your psychic powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, we're suppose to be meeting the Alophidor sisters. That vixen has lust in her eyes when she just met you...I can tell,\" Marty smiled as he drop you off on the dresser table by your miniature dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her human partner have the same thing,\" you laugh as you friend starts getting dress and you do too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me this is a good day,\" Marty says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your ready ladies because two sexy studs are coming to start some trouble,' you said as both of you laugh in the moment of friendship. </span></div></div>",

His gigantic claw scraped a piece of meat bigger then you off his burger. While grabbing his straw and placed his thumb over the top. Pulling the straw out of the titanic beverage of soda. Marty placed it inches above you head while you sat up to take a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two were currently at one of the campuses cafes enjoying the time between classes. The last class was computer animations where both of you were passing with ease. You two worked together better then any partners in the gym. Marty's giant maw tore through his burger with a ravenous appetite. Sadly he wasn't a clean eater and had pieces of burger chunks fall around you. Even with your memories you were still in awe with this giant creature. It was a good thing you can block him from your thoughts or he'll get embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing up your lunch, Marty gave you more sip from his soda before drinking up the thousands of gallons of orange soda. After cleaning himself up, you did the same before he placed his hand by the edge of the table. Luckily you were close to the edge and walked over upon his hand. Giving you time to reach the middle, you sat down and watched as he lifted up. Turning around, you struggled to see past his titanic pillars of fingers. This time you made sure he can read this, thus moving his fingers apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you two can leave the cafe. You spotted the Alophidor girls and yelled up to your wolf friend. Of course he was one step a head of you and was already walking towards the girls. Suddenly the giant platform under you rose or quickly but you already knew what he was planning. Tilting his hand, you ran down his palm not wanting to roll down and used a bit of your powers to slow you decent onto his shoulder. \"Make a smooth entrance my bro and don't choke,\" you yelled up from your safe perch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chill man...you should already know what I'm going to say,\" Marty whispered before taking a seat in front of the vixen Veronica and her human partner Holly. \"Well hey girls...enjoying a lunch without us,\" Marty smiled as the girls giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apparently you had one without us...not very smooth for a man,\" Veronica retorted as Marty rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(And this is why we could never work),\" Mart thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Well stop grouching, Holly's waving towards you),\" you sent your pal the message as he redirected his attention towards her. Making eye contact, he smiled as Veronica did the same to you while you simply waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...can we eat by ourselves or are you planning on missing your next class,\" Veronica said with venom towards your wolf pal. His shoulder suddenly shifted while you held on the the ring of his shirt. His large hand rose up as his head fitted softly on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really...we got time to stay here a bit,\" Marty smiled easily getting on Veronica's nerves. You now remember why the relationship between you and Veronica and Marty and Holly began. It was like yesterday when you and your brother like friend Marty entered the collage campus for the first time. After having your things settled in with a private dorm, both of you decided to go over to one of the cafes for something to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it was this same cafe where you laid your eyes on a large fox walking inches by Marty holding onto her human partner. You only had a glimpse of her but her eyes landed over you towards Marty. It was the same thing but in reverse where sneaked a look at Veronica while she eyed you without catching her until Marty told you. This all happened in a second before you and Marty kept on walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, fate brought you and Marty to meet Veronica and Holly again at a party. You were placed at a coffee table where the humans can mingle by themselves. While all the titanic anthros act as a large background dancing and talking to themselves. You can only remind yourself that the scene was pretty loud. You and Holly got a chance to sit by yourselves and had sometime to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly it turned out that she had interests in only Marty. You were pretty crushed at the time and felt that Marty got both girls. But instead, this morning Marty revealed to you the giant vixen had interests in you other then Marty. What a weird combination but it was possible you thought when you snapped back to reality. Marty was stood up abrupt without you having a chance to brace yourself. You nearly rolled off his shoulder and with a panic you couldn't focus on stopping when Marty's hand fixed fell upon you lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving his thumb and index finger upon you, you were lifted up where Marty's mad face filled your view. You are pretty nervous and couldn't help to smile when Marty assaulted you with many of his anger thoughts. This wasn't the first time where you left him on his own while you were unreachable in your own mind. Having a titanic wolf bare his fangs and scold you with his large predatory eyes is a scary experience but nonetheless a normal one for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only you can figure out what was wrong...</span></div></div>",

I tried to get up, but a hand held me down again, and I turned my head to see a woman standing there with her hand on my shoulder, she was dressed in standard uniform of a nurse even the funny little white paper hat. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, you just made a dimensional jump, your body needs a little more rest,\u201d the doctor said as he wrote something down on a chart he was carrying, \u201cA dimensional what?\u201d I asked, wondering if this wasn\u2019t a poor attempt at humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA dimensional jump, the Immigration Board brought you here this morning,\u201d the man said, all I could do was stare in disbelief, \u201cthey brought your partner as well, but she will need to stay here for another day, the jump was harder on her then it was on you,\u201d the doctor said and then turned to the nurse, \u201clet\u2019s allow him to rest, we\u2019ll check up on him later,\u201d he said and the nurse nodded as they both left the room. \u201cDimensional jump? Immigration Board? Partner?\u201d these words ran through my mind as I tried to make sense of them but failed as I listened to make sure they were gone, before making my move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slowly got up finding that I was dressed in my normal nightclothes of a T-shirt and sweat pants, and I make for the door slowly and opened it. I peek out to see that it lead into a hallway, I had to shut the door quickly as I saw another doctor turn the corner that was a little ways down the hall, and I waited till his footstep faded before opening the door again and stepping out. I slowly made my way down the seemly silent corridor just waiting for someone to raise an alarm of some sort, my worries cause me not to notice till it was to late a door opening and someone stepping out, and bumped into me. \u201cTerribly sorry,\u201d the young nurse I bumped said as I spun around, I stared as she straighten her dress before looking at me, I wonder if she was going to let out a cry, but instead she gave me a small smile and turned and slowly made her way down the hallway in the direction I had just come from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blinked in confusion as I continued; this place felt strange, something about it wasn\u2019t quite right all I knew was I needed to escape, and I saw my way out, a stair way leading down that bore a sign over it reading, \u201cemergency exit,\u201d well this did seem like a emergency, so quickly I made my way down the stairs and push opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had assumed that the door would lead me outside the building; instead my jaw fell to the floor as I saw were I was. It was a giant room, everything was enormous, and if I wasn\u2019t mistake this room looks like a giant waiting room, with a long row of chairs that you could drive a semi-truck under at it wouldn\u2019t even touch the bottom of the chair, \u201cWhere the heck am I?\u201d I cried as I looked around the room. I could also see a desk were a two-story tall television stand, throughout the room I could see giant piles of old magazines, suddenly there came a thumping sound, and I felt the ground give a little shake, and I turned around toward the giant doorway as something came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes threaten to pop out of my head as I saw the creature, it was a giant humanoid rabbit dressed in a, (and I couldn\u2019t believe) nurse\u2019s uniform. The rabbit had golden fur, and I could see a look of exhaustion on her (I figured it was female) face as she made her way across the room toward me, \u201cShoot,\u201d I thought as I was forced to run for cover as the rabbit\u2019s large feet nearly crushed me as she walked over to one of the chairs and sat down, \u201cI\u2019m going to drop dead in a minute,\u201d I heard her groan as she sat back in her seat. I hide behind one of the chair\u2019s legs that was across the way from this giant creature as I look between the giant door, and the one that almost looks like a mouse hole in comparison to the room, the one that lead back to the other hospital. I knew I couldn\u2019t stay here, but I wondered were I should go, the big door probably lead to a giant version of a hospital, and probably filled with more of those giant creatures, and toward the little door lead back to those strange people, that is also when a strange idea creep across my mind, maybe I could get the rabbit to help me, although I have no idea what she would do to me if she caught me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I got to move somewhere, so which one?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I pressed myself against the wall as I watch these huge creatures that luckily seem unconcern about the tiny human that had enter their world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere am I?\u201d I said feeling my sense of reality breaking down as I slowly made my down the hall, although now wondering what I was going to do now, but my heart suddenly leapt as a voice suddenly boomed over the giant hall\u2019s intercom, \u201cattention all hospital staff, be on the lookout of a outsider human that had escape from the dimensional ward, he will be scared and confused, once found please bring him to the front desk of the ward, thank you,\u201d almost instantly I could see creature turning their eyes downward toward the floor as they began to search for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPanic filled me as I now broke into a dead run although not having the slightest clue were I was going, \u201cthere he is!\u201d I suddenly heard a cry and I look to see a giant bird dressed in a lab coat pointing with his long wing-arm at me as dozens of eyes turned toward me, and they started for me. I let out a cry as I ran blind avoid giant paws that all were making scoops at me, and without thinking I dive into one of the rooms, finding it to be the giant counterpart to the hospital room I had woken up in. I could hear the sound of the giant creatures getting close, and in a rash decision, I rushed over to the giant bed, and to my great fortune saw a rope hanging down, I look up and realized that the rope was actually a few stray stings for the material that made up the bed sheets. I quickly climb up onto the bed, and through a small hole in the cover.<br>\r\n\tI was now in pitch darkness, and I held my breath as I heard the room door open, and the sound of footsteps, \u201cI was sure I saw him enter here,\u201d a voice said, and looking through the small hole that I crawled it from to see two creature, one a lion who was scratching his mare as he looked around the room, the other I recognized as the rabbit from the waiting room. \u201cWell, we better find him,\u201d she said looking around as well, \u201cpoor thing, he must be terrify,\u201d she said and I was surprised to hear genuine concern in her voice as they left the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI breathed a sigh of relief as I stepped back from the hole feeling confused but at the same time a little relaxed, although this was the first time I realized that it was kind of warm in here as I stepped back, but that is when I felt my back hit something that was soft and warm. \u201cUh oh,\u201d I thought as I suddenly felt the thing I bumped move, and there came a low growling sound as I heard something in the darkness move, and in a heartbeat something grabbed me. I screamed as I felt myself being draw out back into the light, I found that I was now in a grip of a giant claw, and my eyes widen farther as I saw it was bring me in front of a giant face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nearly fainted as I saw the face of a dragon looking at me with a groggy look, the dragon\u2019s scales were a slivery color, and I couldn\u2019t help but notice that the dragon\u2019s slim face held a very feminine aspect to it. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d the dragon asked in a sweet voice, although at the moment I was too terrific to speak, I couldn\u2019t even make a sound as the dragon became fully awake, and got to sitting position in the bed. She then looked down at me and noticed my expression, \u201cCain what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, this was all too much for me, and I passed out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In no time someone came to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease help him!\u201d the dragon cried as to my surprise it was the rabbit that responded the call. The rabbit came over to the bed, and looked at me as the dragon held me up to her, and I watch as a smile crossed her face, and she gave a small laugh, \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny,\u201d the dragon said and I felt the dragon\u2019s anger. \u201cI\u2019m sorry dear, but I couldn\u2019t help it, your partner\u2019s fine, he just hasn\u2019t gotten used to this world yet,\u201d the rabbit said with a soft smile, puzzlement cross the dragon\u2019s mind and face, \u201cthis world?\u201d she asked looking toward the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou see in this world we anthro all have human partners, we need each other to survive, in fact you wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for him,\u201d the rabbit said sitting on the bed kind of like a mother talking to her child. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d the dragon asked, \u201cyou see you were born from him, he created you out of his imagination,\u201d the rabbit said. I felt wonder surge through the dragon, as she looked down at my tiny form, \u201cbut why was he scared of me\u201d she asked, \u201cbecause this all new to him, just picture what it must be like for him, he woke up in a strange place, and found it popular to him giant creature that he didn\u2019t know if they were friendly or not,\u201d the rabbit explained in a smoothing tone. The dragon held me close to her chest which, for the first time notice that she was tank-top, and said, \u201cPoor Cain, I feel so bad for him, I didn\u2019t mean to scare him,\u201d and I heard and heard sadness in her voice. \u201cWhat should I do now?\u201d the dragon asked looking up from me toward the rabbit, \u201cjust keep him close,\u201d the rabbit said getting up, \u201cI need to tell everyone that he\u2019s found and with his partner,\u201d she said and gave the dragon a smile before turning and leaving the room. Once the rabbit was gone, the dragon looked down at me again, and gave a soft smile as she closed her eyes. Now it was me that felt awful, but I could feel this dragon\u2019s kindness like a warm blanket around my rattled consciousness, and for the first time I felt myself relax and I drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awoke to the same feeling of warmth, and I opened my eyes to find that I was still lying against the dragoness chest, her clawed hand gently covering me like a blanket, I was gently raising and falling as the dragoness breathed. \u201cGood morning,\u201d I heard her soft voice, and I looked up to her looking down at me with her soft yellow eyes, \u201cgood morning,\u201d I answered feeling comfortable with talking to her. I just then felt a little embarrassed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said looking up at her, \u201cabout what?\u201d she asked, \u201cfor freaking out like that, I was just scared,\u201d I said abashed, \u201cit alright, I should of known better,\u201d she said looking guilty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe looked at each other a long moment, it was strange now that I was looking at her, I felt nothing but security and peace coming off of her, and her eyes shined with happiness as they looked at me. I rested my head back down again the dragon\u2019s chest, and I could feel her strong and steady heartbeat, and as I listened I felt something\u2026something that was hard to describe. It was like the dragoness\u2019 heart and my own beat as one, as if they were one and same, connected as if the dragon and I were the same person, \u201cyour heart feels so strong,\u201d the dragon said and I looked up again at her soft eyes. \u201cAnd your feels so warm,\u201d I answered her and she laughed which sounded like music to my ears, and just then I realized something, \u201cI never asked your name,\u201d I asked. The dragon looked at me, and seemed to think, \u201cmy name?\u201d she said wistfully, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have one,\u201d she said looking down at me, \u201chow about Selena,\u201d I said looking up at her, and the dragon smiled, \u201cI like that, and that will be my name,\u201d she said holding me closer to her.</span></div></div>",

I scratched my head and sighed, \u201cwhat about my family?\u201d I asked, and a sense of dread cross my mind, I may never see them again, \u201coh them, I got some good news and bad news,\u201d the doctor said scratching his own balding head. \u201cWhat the good news?\u201d I asked, \u201cthe good news is that they all made it safely to this world,\u201d the doctor said, and my heart leapt, my family was here, \u201cand what the bad?\u201d I asked, \u201cThe bad is that they were sent to a different hospital,\u201d he said looking apologetically. My mind was racing, my mom, dad, and sister was here in this world, but that also meant that they had partners as well looking back at Selena who was listening to the rabbit although her eyes kept drifting over to me, \u201cmy family just doubled,\u201d I grinned. \u201cSo where are they?\u201d I asked looking back to the doctor, \u201cI afraid it\u2019s in another city, but after your release in a few days we plan on sending you over there to meet them,\u201d he said with a nod, \u201cA few days?\u201d I asked puzzled, \u201cjust to run a few tests, standard processors, just to make sure everything fine,\u201d he said, and I sighed but nodded at least I knew they were here, and that was good to heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, that about it, I was just coming to make sure everything was alright,\u201d the doctor said as the nurse stood up and placed a hand down for him, \u201coh, if your guys are hungry, there is a cafeteria on the first floor, its free to all patients, and the food is rather good\u2026although,\u201d he said the last part behind his hand, \u201cstay away from the three-bean soup,\u201d before waving to us as he left, and the rabbit closing the door behind them. \u201cDid you hear that,\u201d I said looking back at Selena, \u201cwhat?\u201d she ask noting my excitement, \u201cour family is here in this world too,\u201d I said, and Selena smiles, \u201cthat great,\u201d she said happily her voice matching my excitement, \u201cWhere are they?\u201d she asked the same question I did, and I told her the same thing the doctor had said. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, \u201cwell as long as their safe, that all that matter right,\u201d she added, \u201cyeah,\u201d I answered.

She carefully place me on her shoulder like the rabbit had done for the doctor before leaving the room and now stood in the hall, everything looked a lot safer now that I was in no danger of becoming a stain on someone\u2019s foot. Selena made her way to the elevator, and pushed the button, and entered as soon as the doors open, \u201chold the door please,\u201d someone called as Selena held it as a male fox stepped into lift. \u201cThanks,\u201d he said a little breathlessly as he pressed one of the buttons for the second floor, before sighing as he lean against the back of the compartment, and Selena pressed the button for the first floor and the doors closed. \u201cThat was a close one,\u201d the fox said, I notice Selena giving him a weary eye, and a small frown, \u201cI told you not to stop in the waiting room,\u201d said a voice and I was surprised to see a human girl sticking half-way out of the fox\u2019s shirt pocket, \u201cby the way thank you as well,\u201d the girl called over to us, and I waved and nodded to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \t Soon we reached the second floor, and the fox leave but not before thanking Selena again as the doors closed and we reached our floor, \u201cyou could have smile,\u201d I said as we exited and slowly made our way to the cafeteria, \u201cI didn\u2019t like him,\u201d Selena said looking at me. I shrugged, but then laughed that caused Selena to grin as well as we found the door with a small sign beside it reading cafeteria, \u201cI guess this is it,\u201d I said as Selena made her way in. The first thing we noticed was it was setup like a mini-restaurant with a series of booths that lined against the walls, and small round tables in the center of the room. We could see other animals sitting at a few of the tables, eating and talking with their human sitting at miniature version of the table including food in proportion to the human size, also I notice the wide varies of ages in both animal and human. I noticed a elderly weasel who was lost in thought as his human a old woman was eating at the tiny table that stood on the counter, while sitting at another one a wolf who looked about six was laughing as her human was riding on her muzzle, both looked very happy as the wolf mother was eating her own meal while her human was talking to her as he stood beside her large pointed ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSelena made her to the counter where a cheery looking crane was standing, \u201cso what can I get you folks,\u201d he asked, Selena turned her head toward me, \u201chow about a hamburger?\u201d I said, and she nodded, \u201ctwo burgers please,\u201d she said looking at the bird, who nodded, \u201ccoming right up,\u201d he said and then added, \u201c you can go ahead and sit down, I\u2019ll bring it to your table,\u201d he said as he turned toward the grill. Selena and I exchange puzzled looks but shrugged as she first stop at the drinking fountain and got herself a cup of soda, and to my surprise there was even a mini one so I could get one as well. After getting our drinks we sat at one of the booths, and Selena placed me on the table\u2019s smooth surface as she sighed, \u201cwell this isn\u2019t too bad,\u201d she commented looking around, \u201cyeah,\u201d I said taking a slip of soda as I look at the strange landscape. Everything still looked so bizarre, everyday items now were now like something out of a sci-fi movie, like the salt shaker that stood against the wall, the once small object was now like a large white pillar to me, and I knew that it could crush me if it were to tip over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked back at Selena was taking a slip for her cup, and I judge she was drinking the equivalent to a swimming pool worth of soda without noticing, \u201cCain, can I ask you something?\u201d Selena asked putting her cup down, \u201cyes,\u201d I answered snapping back to the moment, \u201cWill you sleep with me tonight,\u201d Selena asked looking a little embarrassed, scratching the back of her head. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not, how come you ask?\u201d I asked, \u201cAlice was telling me that they plan to have you sleep in the human hospital tonight,\u201d Selena explained, \u201cAlice?\u201d I asked but I quickly realized that Alice had been the rabbit nurse. I smiled, \u201cI sure that they will let me, after all I couldn\u2019t be safer then in the hands of my partner,\u201d I answered, and this caused Selena to blush harder. </span></div></div>",

I blinked in confusion as just then another animals burst into the room, an anger looking rhino dressed in dark suit, except for that he had a bucket of blue paint on his head, he scanned the room which has fallen silence as everyone stare at the newcomer, there was something about this rhino that unnerved me, he began to search the room till he stopped at our table, \u201cdid you see a fox run by this way?\u201d he asked in a gruff voice, Selena opened her mouth to answer, but I answered, \u201che just left, there he goes,\u201d I pointed at the door. The rhino turned and rushed back toward the door, where he bellowed as he we heard him charge off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you so much, you saved our lives,\u201d said the fox as he crawl out from under the table, \u201cand might I add, you have some lovely toes miss,\u201d he added, Selena growled with anger as he sat down across from her. \u201cWould you now mind telling me, why that blue rhino was after you?\u201d I asked, \u201cWell\u2026\u201d the fox said looking a little sheepish, \u201cI believe I can answer that,\u201d said a voice, and from the fox\u2019s pocket the girl I had seen early pop out. The fox carefully scooped her out, and placed her on the table in front of me, she looked a little older then I was, her face was heavily freckled and she had long red hair pulled back in long pigtails. \u201cMiss Donna Summers, at your service,\u201d she introduced herself as we shook hands, I noticed that she had a southern draw as she spoke, \u201cand this is Roxus, my partner,\u201d and the fox smiled as he held out a hand to Selena but she was giving him a deadly look, and he recoiled it. \u201cI\u2019m Cain, and this is Selena, now what\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked, \u201cWell, you see Roxus and I are kind of new here and we were exploring and we can of\u2026bump into that rhino\u2019s ladder as he was painting,\u201d Donna explained and gave a small nervous laugh, \u201cand I reckon he didn\u2019t take it well,\u201d she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI blinked, \u201cyour new here too?\u201d I asked, \u201cyep, just arrived here this morning,\u201d Donna stated, and looked back at Roxus, but she then turned back to me, \u201cso when do you come from?\u201d she asked, \u201cCalifornia, how about yourself?\u201d I answered, \u201cthe great state of Texas,\u201d Donna answered proudly. \u201cOut of curiosity do have you heard anything about the Immigration Board?\u201d I asked, \u201cnothing beyond those are the fellas that brought us here,\u201d she responded, \u201cI see,\u201d I said with a sigh somehow I had doubted that she would know anymore then I did. Just then the voice of crane piped in, \u201chere are your hamburgers,\u201d he said, \u201cenjoy,\u201d he added and left without waiting for a responds, \u201cwell, we better get moving,\u201d Donna said as Roxus stood up, \u201cbefore that rhino gets back,\u201d she added under her breath as her partner put her back in his shirt pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard Selena give a slight grunt of indignation as they left, \u201cI didn\u2019t think they were too bad,\u201d I said grabbing the little plate were a hamburger right for my size sat next to the giant one meant for Selena. \u201cI still don\u2019t trust them,\u201d she said a offhanded tone, \u201cmaybe not, but we should give them the benefit of the doubt,\u201d I said as I sat the little table, and Selena sighed, \u201cmaybe your right,\u201d she said as we began to eat. The burger was not the best nor was it the worst, but it did satisfy my hunger although I watch Selena eat her own, and was amazed the hamburger itself was the size of a large truck, and she devoured it with little trouble.

Suddenly I felt pressure on my own arm, and I rubbed it, \u201cthat weird,\u201d I said to the doctor who raises a eyebrow, \u201cmy arm suddenly feels tight,\u201d I said wondering that going on, \u201cthat no surprise, what you are feeling is what your partner is feeling,\u201d he said. I gave him a puzzled look, \u201cyou see we are connected to our partners, we can feel it when they are happy or sad or when they are in pain, and they can feel us as well,\u201d he explained. I looked at Selena who smiled at me, \u201camazing,\u201d I said with a smile of my own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t take me long to finish the paperwork, and I handed it back to the doctor who began to look through it, just then I remembered something, \u201coh by the way,\u201d I asked, the doctor gave me a eye before looking back at the papers, \u201cyes,\u201d he answered, \u201cI was wondering if it would be alright if I sleep here tonight with Selena?\u201d I asked. The doctor raised his head and looked at me, his expression was neutral, but there was something in his voice as he answered that hinted at disapproval, \u201cI\u2019d prefer it if you spent the night in the human ward,\u201d he said, and then his expression soften as he said, \u201cjust for the first night,\u201d he said. I looked over at Selena who had been listening to the conversation, I could see her crestfallen expression at her face, and I sighed, \u201cin fact,\u201d the doctor continued, \u201cMaybe you should come back with me now,\u201d he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPanic cross Selena\u2019s face, but Alice placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, \u201cdon\u2019t worry dear its only for a short while,\u201d she said in a reassuring tone, \u201care you sure I can\u2019t stay longer?\u201d I asked. \u201cTo hear you talk it sounds like we are separating forever,\u201d the doctor said with a sigh, but then smiled, \u201cThis is just standard processor, by tomorrow you two will be able to start your lives together,\u201d he said. Alice stood up and put a hand down for the doctor and me, and I sighed as I look back at Selena who wore an expression of complete sadness as we left. Alice brought us to the front desk were we carefully deposited us on a platform were a door lead us back to the human ward.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Time passed slowly and when night finally came a voice came over the intercom informing all patients to return their rooms, and I reluctantly entered my where I lay on the bed looking up at the ceiling. \u201cPoor Selena,\u201d I thought remembering the look on her face, and without much debate I decided to sneak out, but there was a surprise for me as I opened my door. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but you have to remain here,\u201d said a voice and I found standing in front of my door was a man dressed in a dark suit something like the rhino, his cold stare quieted any protest. \u201cA guard?\u201d I said to myself, \u201cWhy is there a guard in front of my door?\u201d I wondered as I walked back wondering about this strange event, but now my mind was set I now needed to sneak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waited for any sort of opportunity, but this came when I heard the guard outside the door suddenly give a small muffled cry, and I heard something heavy fall to the ground. I stood up from my bed as the door just then slowly opened, and I found standing there was a dark robed figure, \u201cwho are you?\u201d I asked as it entered. \u201cThere is no time for talk, used the emergency exit, and go to your partner\u2019s room,\u201d the figure said. \u201cWhat about\u2026\u201d I said looking at the guard that was now propped up against the side of the door, \u201che will be fine, but go now, but be back before sun raise,\u201d the figure said. I didn\u2019t know what to do and without a word I rushed into the darkness of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slowly made my way down the hall, fearing at any moment that I would be discovered, all the time my mind was racing, who was that dark figure, why did he help me, and again why did I need a guard in front of my room in the first place? The slightest noise filled me with fear as I made it to the stairs and then slowly opened the door and into the giant waiting room, where anything looked foreboding, suddenly my heart quickened as I heard footsteps, I rushed to the roll of giant chairs and hide as I heard someone enter the room. I thought that my own breath would give me away as I heard the loud footsteps come close, but they just then stop, and I peeked around the chair leg to see a pair of giant feet and I recognized them as Alice\u2019s. \u201cRichard, are you sure that we have to do this?\u201d she just then said in a whispering voice, \u201cI afraid that we have too,\u201d said the voice of the doctor, \u201cyou know that, it part of our law,\u201d he added, and I felt myself tend up as I heard Alice sit down in the seat that I was hiding under. \u201cIt\u2019s just that there something about them,\u201d Alice said, \u201cI agree with you, if I hadn\u2019t actually seen that his partner was a dragon I wouldn\u2019t have believe it neither,\u201d Richard answered in there was a far-off tone to his voice. My heart threaten to fly out of my chest, they were talking about me as I heard Alice say, \u201cI just feel like we\u2019re doing something horrible to them,\u201d in the same tone as Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a moment pause before Richard spoke again, \u201cWell, there no sense in putting it off any longer,\u201d he said, and Alice stood up and walk to where the emergency door stood, and knelled down, and I saw the form of Richard disappear into it. Alice stood up and in I saw her put a hand over her heart, and lower her head as she said, \u201cforgive me Richard, but I can\u2019t do that to her,\u201d and walked out of the room. I swallowed hard my mind trying hard to make sense of that exchange, what did Richard have to do? And what did it have to do with Selena and me? I wondered as I waited for Alice\u2019s footsteps to fade before rushing out of the door, and down the silence hallway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens when I get to my partner's room?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I looked toward the head for the bed, and smiled as I saw Selena sleeping and I could see a sad look was on her face, \u201cSelena,\u201d I said softly walking over to her clawed right hand, \u201cSelena,\u201d I said patting one of her fingers, almost instantly Selena stirred and she opened her eyes. \u201cCain?\u201d she said looking down and see me, I held a finger to my lips to tell her to keep her voice down, \u201cCain I thought you were going to sleep in the human ward tonight,\u201d Selena said bring me close to her face. \u201cI was, but something happened,\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked trying to keep a low tone, and I explained about the guard, the dark figure, and even what I had overhead Richard telling Alice. \u201cWhat do you think it mean?\u201d she asks, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said sitting in the palm of her hand, there was a moment pause, and Selena yawned, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think there anything we can do about it tonight, we should probably get some sleep,\u201d I said and she nodded. <br>\r\n\tSelena smiled as she placed me closed to her heart, and covered me with one of her claws like a blanket \u201cgood night Cain,\u201d she whispered before with another yawned closed her eyes again, but this time a warm peaceful expression was on her face. \u201cGood night,\u201d I yawned as I laid flat against her soft chest, listening to her magnificent heartbeat, all my cares and worry seemed to disappear into it, and as sleep came to me it was almost like I slip into the beat and became a part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was awoken with a start, \u201cCain wake up,\u201d I heard Selena\u2019s voice, and I opened my eyes, I could see that it was still dark, but a noise at the door aroused me to full consciousness. \u201cI need to hide,\u201d I said, and Selena looked around as the sound of the doorknob turning seemed amplified, and Selena suddenly came to a decision, and brought me above the collar of her shirt. I didn\u2019t have time to stay anything before Selena allow me to slip down the front of it, and I felt myself slide against her soft skin before falling in-between her large supple breasts. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I could feel her warmth all around me as I was being held in place by her fleshly hills, I could feel Selena shifted a little as I heard the door open. \u201cAlice?\u201d I heard Selena say as I heard movement, \u201cwhat wrong?\u201d she asked, there was no answer till I heard the movement stop beside the bed, \u201cI\u2019m just checking up on you,\u201d came the rabbit soft voice. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Alice asked just then, \u201ca little tried, but ok I guess,\u201d Selena answered her in a calm tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a pause for a moment, and then I heard Alice sigh and then the groaning of the bed as she must have sat down on it, \u201cSelena, what do you remember?\u201d she asked, \u201cabout what?\u201d Selena ask a bit puzzled at the question, \u201cabout Cain and your childhood, what school did you go to?\u201d Alice asked, Selena paused, \u201cI knew that Cain when to school in his world before coming here,\u201d she answered. Alice said her next question with a bit of surprise, \u201cand where were you?\u201d she asked, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I guess a part of his imagination,\u201d she answered, there was an awkward pause. \u201cWhat wrong Alice?\u201d Selena asked, \u201cRichard didn\u2019t give him the shot,\u201d she said more to herself then to Selena, \u201cwhat shot?\u201d Selena asked, again there was a pause. \u201cSelena it\u2019s a part of our law, all outsiders are given a special shot, that\u2026\u201d her voice trails for a moment before saying, \u201ctakes away their memories,\u201d she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d Selena said, and I too nearly cried out but held my tongue, \u201cWhy!\u201d Selena said. \u201cBecause, the Immigration Board believes it necessary, they believe that people should have only the memories from the world they live in,\u201d Alice said, \u201cThat horrible! They can\u2019t do that!\u201d Selena said in outrage, Alice hissed to Selena to give her voice down. \u201cI know, but it part of the law,\u201d she said and then added, \u201cbut it appears that Richard decided not to give it, so Cain\u2019s memories should be still intact,\u201d she said, and I could hear relief in her voice. \u201cSelena, you must not tell anyone that Cain and you remember the other world, if you do your be in danger, and so will Richard and me,\u201d Alice said a deadly seriousness was in her voiced, \u201cI promise,\u201d Selena said quietly. \u201cAlice?\u201d Selena asked, \u201cbut how do you know about the shot? Does that mean Richard knows about the other world?\u201d \u201cRichard and I know that there is another world, but we don\u2019t have memories of it,\u201d she explained and then added in a wispy tone, \u201cto us its just a fantasy,\u201d and we heard her sigh. There was a pause, before Alice spoke again, \u201cSelena take good care of Cain, you two are very special, and I can sense that you will do great things,\u201d she said. I just then felt a shift, and suddenly I got a bad feeling, \u201cbut remember that you have a friend,\u201d and suddenly I felt pressure as I was squished against Selena\u2019s chest as Alice gave her a hug.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When I saw the contents of the room, I knew there was something wrong. The room was a plain are with a cement floor and a chair with leather straps in the middle. I looked back at Richard, who to my horror was holding a shot full of purple liquid. \"Alice thought I decided not to give you the shot but I knew you snuck out. Why should you be the one to remember the other world? I also had a life that I somehow know made me happy but now I can't remember any of it.\" He said very fast, his face was getting red. Suddenly, I remembered the bag Dirk gave me, as he back me into a corner, I took out the bag and opened it there were two kinds of pills and two mini swords. I couldn't decide which one to choose but one of them started glowing bright yellow so I grabbed it and threw it on the ground. Suddenly there was an explosion and a giant clawed foot broke through the ceiling. Richard didn't get squashed but he was thrown back against the wall and blacked out. \"What's going one?\" asked a familiar voice. It was Selena, she moved her foot back through the hole and noticed me. She put her big hand down and I climbed on it. \"Cain, what's going on?\" \"I'll explain later, now run.\" She complied and broke out in a sprint. \"We need to find the family,\" I said, hanging on for dear life on her shoulder now. \"Ok, Alice gave me a map to the hospital when she was getting me ready to leave. Now tell me what happend just now, How did I suddenly appear there?\" I explained about Dirk, the pouch and Richard. \"Wow, so those who have forgotten the other world are rally sad and jealous, huh?\" Selena said sympathetically, \"This is a terrible thing to do to people,\" I said. We fell silent for a while so I started paying more attention to the landscape that selena was running through. We were in a town that had alot of buildings built for the giants but there were always human sized doors and windows. They must be like the caffeteria, how everything was had doubles in both sizes, I thought as I saw a young cat girl playing with her human in a yard. The town was farely modern but there were no cars or streets. I guessed it would be pretty dangerous to have small and large cars. \"Hey, Selena why don't we fly, wouldn't that be faster?\" I suggested,\"Oh, I think you're right. I forgot I had wings, I've never used them before.\"</span></div></div>",

She begins to rise slowly at first but our ascent gains speed in no time at all.  I looked forward again to see that we were coming up on the edge of the city now and I saw the plains that surrounded the town.  Selena continued to gain altitude as I considered what we were going to do to get to our family.  I figured that the staff will warn the hospital where my family's at very soon if they haven't already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena must have been thinking the same thing as she said, \"What will we do about our family now?  We can't just go straight to the hospital where they are or we might get caught and you'll be forced to take that shot.\"  \"We still have the map to the city where the hospital is.  We should first go find someplace quiet to settle for now while things cool off before we try to get to our family,\" I yell, trying to be heard over the wind.  \"There's a forest up ahead.  Maybe we can find a secluded area to rest and think about how we're going to see our family again,\" Selena says, apparently hearing me just fine, despite the wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably for the best.  Are you getting tired from flying?\" I yell to her.  \"No, I don't feel tired yet.  I really enjoy flying though so can we keep going for now?\" Selena says with a great amount of joy very obvious in her voice.  \"If you want to, so long as we find a clearing before we forget why we're flying in the first place,\" I yell, hoping they aren't tracking us right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena continues to fly getting closer to the forest and to the clouds above us.  The trees in the forest were huge.  I think the trees were about twice Selena's size on the edge of the forest but its hard to tell when we were so high up in the air.  I look over towards Selena and notice a large smile on her face as she continues to flap her wings at a steady pace.  We were pretty close to the clouds now and I'm beginning to wonder as to how I can still be breathing so easily at this elevation.  My thoughts about how to breathe this air and survive are interrupted by a loud growling noise coming from behind me.  I look again at Selena and notice she has a slight blush on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never did get to eat breakfast this morning,\" she said, embarrassed.  \"I never did too, lets try to find something to eat in the forest,\"  I suggest.  Selena starts to descend and watch below for signs of potential prey or is she looking for fruit?  \"Selena, can you breathe fire?\" I ask while she continues to look for something.  \"I don't know.  Why do you ask?\"  \"If we find meat, I won't be able to eat it unless its cooked or I could get sick.\"  \"Oh, well let me try.\"  I feel her breathe in deeply as she continues to get closer to the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a rumble come from her as she breathes out and fires comes spewing from her maw.  Thankfully she was looking at an upwards angle away from the trees at the time or she could have started a fire.  \"Wow,\" I say, completely blown away by the display as Selena looks proud of her accomplishment.  Selena focuses again on the ground as she again looks for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe keep flying on and then we come across...</span></div></div>",

You heard footsteps and walking towards you are 2 people that look to be a doctor and a nurse but they seem unfazed by the sheer size of where you are it looked like everything was made for a creature a mile tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good you're up\" the doctor says, \"Mr. Alex was it?\" he continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, I guess\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry we found some identification on you although it was slightly burned, \"heh\" don't even have a driver's license and you're college age\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up\" you retort forgetting where you were for a second. The doctor smiles, \"can you walk?\" he asks. You tentativley step off the bed and you can stand and walk, the doctor nods, \"good to see you're doing so well, you're the first one we've seen to fall through and almost die\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall through what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dimensional rift, well come along, we have to introduce you to you're partner\" he says walking away. Not having anything else to do or knowing anyone else you follow the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean partner?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in a different dimension, everyone here has a partner with which they are irrevocably tied\" the doctor says. You try to get more out of him but he shuts up, you follow him out of the giant room into an equally sized hall, he counts door numbers as he passes them and you enter some sort of lobby. You looked around this seemed to be some sort of special hospital probably for those who suffered physical injuries as there was apparently a gym area with a pool and a spa if the signs you saw identifying the other 2 halls were correct. Unthankfully for you the doctor walks past those and heads down the hall marked emergency. You reluctantly follow and you hear voices coming from what you assume is the emergency room \"she's stabilizing, that means he had to have pulled through too thank god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh who's that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are the only 2 staff on hand right now, you were actually considered a quarantine case so this whole area was shut down except for us 4\" the doctor replies. He walks through a smaller door cut out of a larger swinging one, and you freeze as you look up. There was another bed in the room the same size as the others but this one was occupied and standing on either side were 2 creatures that stopped you're heart. One was male and one female, the female seemed to be some sort of gazelle if you stood it up on it's hind legs and gave it hands and a more human face, standing on the other side was a lion. You could tell simply from the mane of fur on him and he was like the gazelle but that wasn't what stopped you're heart, they were both a mile tall. They look at the monitors and you start hearing a bunch of beeping before they look down and spot you and the other 2. \"Doc settle him down\" the gazelle says sternly, the doctor walks over to you, \"settle man, they're just our partners\" he says indicating him and the nurse. \"They're, they're mile tall anthromorphs\" you yell back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh, what did you....oh yeah\" he says. He pulls out a needle and before you can do anything he inserted it into you're arm and pushed the plunger down, \"sorry but you're endangering Mollie with you're fear\" he says. You were about to ask who Mollie was when you felt yourself collapse and the doctor catches you right before you black out. You wake up slowly affected by the drug the doc injected. All you could tell was you were warm, and under something soft and furry, out of instinct you stretched and you heard a giggle, you tried to get up keeping you're eyes closed but you were gently pushed back down \"just go back to sleep\" a female voice says. You're mind was telling you not to after seeing the gazelle and the lion but the rest of you wouldn't listen, you just lay there for a bit before trying to stand again. You felt the same force but you reached up to stop it and much to you're suprise you felt the same weight finally when you were standing you dared open you're eyes. You froze at what was in front of you, it was a mouse's face, you could easily tell that much from the admittedly cute pink nose to her large ears and the whiskers as well as the gray fur, she smiles down at you, \"you're finally up\" she says. Instinct instantly takes over and you run in the opposite direction and you run straight into a wall but it felt soft, and furry. Much to you're suprise the wall shifted knocking you over onto what you realized was her palm and you were brought back to her face. \"Hey, hey why are you scared\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Giant...talking....anthro\" you reply not really wanting to upset her. She looks around before pointing at herself \"you mean me\" she says and you nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seems to think about something for a second before she nods, \"i'm sorry I didn't notice, even though you're my partner\" she says. \"I'm Mollie, and you're the one i've been waiting 18 years to meet\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" you reply quickly realizing that she wasn't gonna hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm known as an outcast, our kind who don't have a partner at birth because they ended up in a different dimension, that's what the rifts are for, to pull humans like you over so that we can finally be together\" Mollie says. She starts to tear up \"18 years of knowing you existed, but not being able to meet you, and now you're finally here\" she says lifting her palm up and gently rubbing you against her cheek. You really weren't sure what to do until she gently presses you against her cheek, \"please, just do something, I can't stand you just standing there\" she says. At that instant you froze, it was like you felt Mollie's sadness and obviously you knew you were the cause, without fear you reached forward and hugged her cheek or well what you could as tightly as you could. Mollie started crying but you could sense they weren't tears of sadness, they were tears of joy. You just stood there like that until the tears stopped and Mollie turned to face you, she sits up and holds you at arm's length \"so what do you think of you're partner?\" she asks. Mollie was only wearing a hospital gown, you saw her tail behind her and you had to admit it did look pretty cute. Everything was pefectly proportioned so you could at least tell a few things about her, she seemed to be quite slim although you hoped it was from exercise, long arms and legs led up to her slim torso. She leaned forward and reached up letting you get a good look of her backside, even her butt was pretty cute \"wait what did I just think\" you mutter. She brings you closer and pushes the shirt down and that's when you see her chest, she was pretty modest probably only a b-cup compared to anyone else her size but to her they were gigantic, you really weren't sure of a comparison. You looked up at Mollie's face, at her cute whiskers that attached to that even cuter nose and her big beautiful ears, her eyes that radiated gentleness atleast for you and that pretty little smile. As you thought this Mollie got redder and redder before she finally turned away, \"stop it, geez i've never had someone compliment me so much\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, \"can you read my thought?\" you ask, she nods and much to you're suprise you hear her voice in her head, \"of course silly, you should be able to read mine too\" she says in you're mind. You try and you can actually hear them \"ooh he's just so cute, I just want to protect him till the end of time\" she says. As you hear this all you're fear of Mollie and this place disappears, you feel a serene sense of calm and all you can think is \"as long as I have her i'm safe.\" Mollie smiles, \"you bet you're little butt you're safe\" she says lifting you up to kiss you....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were just about to kiss Mollie when you hear the swinging doors and a gasp come from behind both of you and you turn around. Standing there was the gazelle in her nurse's outfit and the lion in his doctor's attire and on each of their shoulders was you're doctor and his nurse. The gazelle walks forward and puts him down near Mollie, \"so I see you've finally gotten rid of you're fear\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah\" you reply standing back and you heard Mollie think \"screw it\" and you were pushed back into her palm as she kissed you. You were stunned for a second as Mollie's desires and thoughts hit you full on and then you felt a huge sense or relief and happiness as you kissed her lips. Mollie held it for a few seconds before breaking it and happily rubbing you against her cheek, \"i'm so glad you're here\" she says. \"Glad you 2 seem to be getting along\" the doc says and Mollie remembers they were there. Blushing she puts you down in her lap, the doc walks up after he spends a minute climbing her thigh, \"well good thing is you're both now in perfect health. which means you can be discharged right now if you want\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, where would we go?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why home of course\" Mollie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duh my house\" Mollie replies. The nurse walks up and taps you on the shoulder handing you some clothes and the gazelle hands Mollie some. The gazelle picks the doc up and the lion picks the nurse up and they leave. You were thrown up for a second landing on Mollie's fur and you turned around to see her with the gown just over the top of her head, you froze as you could see her whole chest and she pulled the gown over her head and gave a squeak as she saw you. \"You little perv\" she says shocked but kind of happy and she gently pushes you and the clothes off her and away, \"go get changed over there and don't you dare look again\" she says. You quickly scurry over to where she was pointing and although she sounded really angry you felt some part of her wanted you to look but you didn't dare. You undressed but froze as you felt something like...embarassment, you turned to see Mollie looking down at you intently \"hey\" you say stepping back. \"Sorry but fair's fair\" she says giggling before turning around, you quickly got dressed in a red t-shirt and shorts, when you turned back Mollie was sitting there in a green tanktop and a set of jeans with a hole in the back which her tail popped out of. She smiles down at you, \"well what do you think?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look great Mollie\" you say, \"and i'm sorry I made you go that long all alone, I mean I didn't even know you existed\" you say. Mollie smiles at you and lower her palm, you climb on and she lifts you up, \"all that matters is that you're here now\" she says gently nuzzling you. You hugged her nose and she giggled, \"well come on\" she says standing up. She gently places you on her shoulder and walks out the door. You find the staff waiting in what you assume is the lobby, they lead Mollie out the way you came from and Mollie stretches and sighs as the sun hits her. \"Ahhh it's good to be free\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, of course you're ok with this much freedom, i'm more for a smaller area\" you say. Mollie sighs, \"you need to go out and see the world\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, I have no idea where I am anyways\" you reply. Mollie nods, \"well time to head home\" she says. She started walking down the street and what you saw amazed you, you were essentially on a titan sized version of earth everywhere you saw titan anthros walking around carrying humans on their shoulder or in their palms, there were even cars. Mollie slightly swayed from side to side and you saw her tail match her movements. She seems very confident and you could feel the happiness roll off her like waves. \"Is me showing up really that big a deal?\" you ask. Mollie stops for a second, \"yes it is actually, it's like i've been missing half of myself without you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, although I do have to agree with you, it just feels....right being near you\" you say. Mollie leans over and you pet her neck and the part of her cheek you could reach. She sighs, \"your so small but that feels so good\" she says before starting to walk again. You laid back against her neck and just watched the scenery as Mollie walked, she made a few turns and then stopped, you turned and looked up at a 2-story townhouse. \"Well this is where I live\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You live alone?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all of us leave our families when we're young to be with our partners, but being that I didn't have one, I stayed home till I was 18 and then I moved out\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how'd you end up in the hospital?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night I got a terrible migraine so I went to the hospital, I got there about 12:00pm and then I collapsed in the lobby\" she says. You nod, as 12:00pm was when you fell asleep the night before. Mollie walks up and enters the house, she walks around showing you the modern kitchen, the living room with a plasma screen, and a king size bed in the bedroom. As well as the bathroom, which much to you're suprise had a tiny toilet and a miniature shower carved into one of the tiles. \"So, what's with the stuff for someone my size?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, every anthro has a human partner, so all the houses obviously have facilities usable by you\" Mollie says. You nod as it made sense, even though Mollie didn't have a partner till now. \"Well i'm hungry, let's get a snack\" she says. She walks to the fridge and grabs a wheel of cheese and you can't help but smile. \"Guess some stereotype are true\" you think and Mollie stares at you, \"what do you mean?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well from where I come from, a mouse's favorite food ever is well cheese\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with cheese\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, nothing, i'm just saying the similarity is funny\" you reply. Mollie cuts off a piece of cheese, \"you up for anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A grape\" you reply, she reaches into a fruit bowl and pulls out a grape, thing is it was more a boulder then a grape to you. You sigh, \"oh well at least i'll never go hungry\" you laugh before digging into the grape. You take a chunk out of it before you step back, \"you gonna finish that?\" Mollie asks, you shake you're head and she pops the grape in her mouth. She lowers her hand and you climb on, walking over to the couch and she lays out and places you down on her stomach. You lay back in the soft fur and Mollie sighs, \"hey Mollie you have a job?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, only part time, but I go to college for most of the day\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap college\" you think laying back, Mollie lifts herself up \"what's wrong with college?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I just don't have any money for it\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMollie laughs \"you don't need any money, you get to take all my courses for free\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome free college\" you think and she pushes you with 1 finger, \"nothing is ever free\" Mollie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you're classes?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to become a computer programmer\" she says. You smile as that was you're desired field. Mollie lifts you up, \"aren't you gonna ask?\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask about what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you're going to owe me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is my love enough?\" you reply. Mollie smiles, \"maybe, but you better truly love me\" she says. You nod and sit down and look her up and down, you try to clear you're mind and just think about her and how you feel about her. Mollie looks down at you as you look up at her and a smile crosses her face, \"ok I get it, you love me\" she says pushing you over with 1 finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? what did I think?\" you asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were, hugging me\" she says blushing \"and you were whispering everything you thought about me into my ear and it was all nice things and you were totally honest\" Mollie says smiling down at you still blushing. She lifts you up and puts you down on her nose, \"I love you Alex\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Mollie\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMollie puts you down on her chest and you look up as she seems to have an idea.</span></div></div>",

You drop down onto her palm and she lifts you up onto her shoulder, \"I really need to remember your there\" she says.You sit down on her shoulder and Mollie stands up. She grabs a small purse (well for her) off a table slinging it over her other shoulder before heading out the door. You look up at Mollie \"so do you all have a usual spot or something?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, they'll be so surprised to see you\" Mollie replies. You just sit back as she keeps walking, after a few minutes she makes it to what looks like a 7/11, standing there was a gator, a dragon both you could tell from shape and size were male as well as what looked to be some sort of female lizard. You could tell because of the 2 large orbs protruding out of a tight white t-shirt. Mollie walks up \"hey guys how's it going?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mollie how's it going?\" the gator asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, it's going great\" she says, the 3 friends stared at Molly and suddenly you felt very self-concious hiding behind Molly's neck and just peeking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mollie why are you so happy?\" Kate asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well because I....huh where'd he go?\" Mollie replies feeling for you on her shoulder but unable to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mollie I'm back here\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me a second I need to go to the bathroom\" Mollie says walking past everyone, you just see the inside of the store before she turns into a public restroom and she locked the door behind her. You stepped out from behind her neck and jumped onto her offered palm \"what's wrong?\" she asks lifting you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm scared\" you reply looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Mollie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same reason I was scared when I first saw you, mile tall anthros aren't normal where I come from\" you think at her. Mollie stares down at you \"do you really think i'd let anything happen to you?\" she thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no but I'm still not sure\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you trust me?\" she asks. You sigh and look up at her giant face \"fine\" you think. She smiles and gently closes her hand, she opens the bathroom door with her free hand before exiting the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feel better?\" Kate asks as Mollie walks out of the store. Mollie raises the hand with you in it \"I feel fine Kate thanks, although i'd like to introduce someone\" she says. Mollie slowly opens her palm and you looked up at 3 titanic faces looking down at you with interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your partner finally showed up\" the dragon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, his name's Alex, these are my friends Matt, Tyler, and Kate\" Mollie says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just looked up at the titanic animals stunned \"I really don't think I can do this\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just calm down and say hi, they won't hurt you, and even if they tried I wouldn't let them touch a single hair on your head\" Mollie replies confidently. You look up at her and she smiles down at you, you turn and look up at the 3 anthros \"hi I'm Alex\" you say nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez we're stupid aren't we, we should introduce our partners\" Kate says reaching up to her shoulder. Matt and Tyler do the same thing and soon 3 specks which quickly turned into human shapes were brought down above and then next to you as 3 people were placed down near you. A girl runs up right into your face \"hi I'm Janice  and these are Mark and Brad\" she says indicating the 2 guys walking over Mollie's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hi\" you reply waving slightly. The 2 finally catch up to the girl \"so your Mollie's partner, about damn time you showed up\" one says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark that's not being very nice, imagine how scared he must be\" Janice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't look scared to me\" Brad says leaning forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well i've calmed down a bit, that and I think I still have some of that sedative flowing through my system\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha they had to sedate you, holy crap they haven't had to do that in like years, hahahaha\" Brad literally falls over laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore him, seriously are you alright?\" Janice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, this isn't exaclty how I expected today to start out, but well it could be a lot worse, I mean I could have ended up like Mollie, knowing pretty much half of me that was missing was out there somewhere\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea what she was like before\" Janice says staring up at the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she was all gloomy and depressed, we had to come and pretty much pull her out of her room, she was fun after that inital hurdle was jumped but well, look at her now, she's never come activley looking for us before\" Janice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I couldn't tell from what I've seen\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMollie lifts her hand up to her face, \"Janice I know I can't blow you off but stop talking about me like I'm not here\" she says sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry Mollie\" Janice replies smiling up at the giant mouse. \"So what about you? What's your home like?\" Janice asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very....normal, no magic, giant anthros, future tech, it's just normal\" you reply. Janice laughs \"wow sounds you like a very boring life\" Janice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it kind of was, I mean it wasn't a bad life but yeah compared to one with titan sized anthros it's not as exciting\" you reply. Janice laughs \"I wouldn't think so, so what do you think of Mollie?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you've seen, the majority of us end up in same-sex pairs, girls with girls, guys with guys, pairs where it's a female anthro and a male human are very rare\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mollie's great\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? So you meet a giant cute mouse girl and all you can say about her is great?\" Brad asks piping up for the second time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine she's the cutest thing i've ever seen, I think she's beautiful\" you say. Janice smiles \"there we go that's more the honesty I was looking for\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janice\" Mollie says reminding you for the second time that the anthros were still there, you looked up to see Mollie red as a beet. You snickered a bit and she raised her palm quickly \"your not helping anything\" she says sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I supposed to tell then, that I hate you?\" you ask Mollie. She just stares at you \"no\" she says sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Mollie I only said what's true, I've only known you a few hours and most of that was spent asleep, but I feel very close to you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww\" Janice says and Kate say together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you 3 take your partners?\" Mollie asks, you felt a slight wind as Brad, Janice, and Mark who had finally stopped laughing were lifted off Mollie's palm. Mollie lifts her hand up to her face \"so what are you going to say now?\" she asks sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything you want \"kiss\" girlfriend\" you say kissing the tip of her nose. Mollie pulls her hand away and just stares at you stunned \"what did you just call me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want to be my girlfriend?\" you ask sitting down and crossing your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why so suddenly?\" she asks looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see I've already got 4 guys for competition and as I said you're the cutest thing I've ever seen.....but I guess if you don't want to\" you say. You were pushed back against Mollie's palm, \"of course I'll do it\" she says happily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up drowsily, the unusual yet pleasing dream still in your head.  It is dark, so you are sure that it is still night time.  You grumble a bit when you notice that your boxers must have fallen off while you were asleep.  You reach for your covers, and are quite confused when your covers feel more comfortable than usual.  Your bed also feels unusually comfortable; extra soft yet supple. The mattress seems to be creating its own warmth, but you do not remember buying an electric blanket.  Also, the mattress seems to be moving slowly up and down and up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly realizing that you are definitely not in your own bed, you scramble a bit but can't seem to get out of the covers.  That is when the whole bed starts to move, letting out an odd moaning sound, a strangely peaceful moan though.  You feel yourself sliding across the mattress for what is much too far to be a normal mattress.  Unexpectedly, you see a bright flash of light for just a brief moment of time before you are once again immersed in darkness.  You could have sworn that all you had seen was a wall of greys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this new area, you can hear a very soothing sound.  It sounds a lot like breathing, but you feel it more than you hear it.  You try to move again, but are still stuck in place.  The blanket moves again, and this time you behold an unbelievable sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous maw opens up wide, showing glistening white fangs, its pink tongue lolling forward.  The mouth closes revealing a black nose, which slowly turns to the side.  You see the enormous half-open eye of an enormous wolf woman looking at you.  You realize that you have become tangled in the fur of one of her fingers, since when she uses a huge claw to free you, you find yourself lying in the deep crevice of a knuckle.  Her fingers must be the size of skyscrapers.  However, what she says to you, in the most loving way you can imagine, is what amazes you the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my dearest husband.\"</span></div></div>",

And sure enough, her black curled lips engulf your body as your new wife gives you an amazing kiss.  Her lips are moist but not completely covered in drool, and you stick to her lower lip like the tiniest bread crumb.  Her lolling tongue gently sweeps over you; a single taste bud looks looks house-sized to you now.  However, you are not scared now because you remember your dream, this wolfess was the gentle titan you dreamed about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a skyscraper-sized finger, you are wiped off from the wolf's mouth, and now you find yourself going under the covers.  You stop sooner than you expect; it seems that your wife wants to do some snuggling.  You are pressed against the top of her breast in a loving embrace, and you realize that this is where you were when you had just woke up.  You look at the two monumentous hills; they are extremely huge to you, but probably even undersized compared to the rest of your new wife's body.  Your wolf wife is making tiny moaning sounds of pleasure as she rolls around in bed a bit with you in her arms.  It is very odd that you have just met this titanic lupine, yet feel like you have known her all of your life, as if she was meant to be with you.  Also, you are positive that your wife feels that you were meant to be with her as well.  Your wolfess love's body is beautiful and flawless, but you feel like her true feelings for you is her best attribute by far.

She gave a huge yawn and stretched her arms, which means you got to see how enormously long they really were.  You find yourself being lowered towards a brown dot on the sole dresser in the bedroom, and notice that that speck is actually your closet, complete with a little bench for you to sit on and even all of your shoes.  As you get dressed in semi-casual clothes, you get to watch your wolf wife get dressed, which is a real treat.  You try to get a good measure of how big your new wife is, but it is very hard to do.  Your best guess is that she is somewhere around five or six miles tall.  You only wish that you knew her name.  Until then, at least, you hope you can get away with calling her sweet names like 'sweetie', or maybe something more suited to her huge size, like, 'my precious little universe'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fully dressed but still immensely gorgeous, the wolfess offers you her mighty pinky claw, and you kiss it passionately.  You then grab onto a few strands of her silvery fur, and you were whisked away to breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreakfast was an experience you have never done before.  Your wife stuck an odd instrument into one of her sausage, like a hypodermic needle, and gave you the chunk at the tip to eat.  Another instrument was dipped into her piping hot coffee and the spongy tip was placed next to your sausage.  Apparently, your wife shares all of her meals with you.

You look at the source of the clatter, expecting a giant wolf girl or two to come into the kitchen.  However, you are completely blown away when FOUR lupine titans enter the room, each one definitely having gotten their good looks from their mother.  You have no time at all to think about how crazy this is before the youngest wolf lowers her massive paw towards you.  You automatically grab a couple strands of her fur, and then you are whisked to your daughter's chest.  \"Good morning, Daddy,\" squeals the nine year old with glee.  Not knowing her name, you reply, \"And good morning to you, my giant angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is not long before you are eagerly snatched by another huge paw.  Looking forward, you are stunned to find two matching faces stare at you from either side, and realize that you have a pair of fourteen year old twins.  The show you their love for you, their father, by squeezing you affectionately between their furry cheeks.  You end up a little tangled in one of your daughter's fur, but you are quickly rescued by your eldest daughter's helping paw.  You are in for another surprise as well; running across the pad of this daughter's finger is a twelve year old human boy, eager to give you a high five.  You return your son's gesture, then hug him too.  Your eldest daughter of about seventeen joins you two tiny humans by bringing her slightly damp black nose to her paw and gently nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother huge paw, your wife's, then picks you up and carries you to her shoulder.  You watch as she gives out hugs to your daughters as well, and the warm fuzzy feeling inside you grows infinitely vast.  She even brings your son up to her gargantuan black lips for a great big smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your offspring, and realize the irony that even though they tower over you like mountains, even your eldest daughter still looks up to you.  You remember that wolves are very social animals, so having this many children suddenly does not seem so unusual.  Plus, they all seem to be able to take pretty good care of themselves already, seeing as they are making their own breakfasts.  Right now, you couldn't be more proud, and can't wait to find out what your first day in this new, perfect world has in store for you.</span></div></div>",

I hope that our kids got good report cards this year!\"  As she left the room, you realized how much of your childrens' lives you missed out on.  You feel very bad that these huge wolf children and one human child love you, and you don't even know their names.  You hope that the report cards do come in today; perhaps they will reveal the names of your children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, a series of earthquakes signals your wife's return, and you see gigantic, city-block sized envelopes clutched in her massive hand paw.  Taking a seat near where you are sitting on the table, she starts to open the envelopes with the help of her several hundred foot claws.  Sure enough, a cascade of report cards falls out of a fat envelope, and you can't wait to see the results.  Your wife gently scoops you up in her paw so that you have a better vantage point, and you look at the gigantic typed words and letters, and make everything out in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour oldest daughter is Heather, and you are proud to see that she got straight As in her classes; she must be near the top of her class.  It is a bit funny to you that the twins Dana and Lana have the exact same grades; B minuses in math and science and As everywhere else.  Your youngest daughter Kate also has As sprinkled with some A minuses, and figure that she must also be pretty smart, or have helpful siblings.  You are a little upset to see that your son Max got a C in history, but he did well in his other courses, a good mix of As and Bs.  You notice that there is one class you do not recognize called \"Gender Interaction\".  You guess that since all males seem to be extremely small compared to anthro females, there has to be a class in this timeline's schools so that boys and girls can learn to act appropriately without accidentally squashing the tiny humans.  All of your children have As in this class, and Heather and Max both have A pluses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it looks like eveyone did a great job this year!\" exclaims your wife, and you notice that your children are all huddled close together along with you and the massive lupine.  \"How about we all celebrate the good year with a trip to the park?  It's a beautiful day, and we don't have anything special planned.\"  The huge children all seemed very excited, and even Max looked ecstatic as he jumped around a bit on Heather's thumb pad.  The children started heading straight to the front door, and you soon feel yourself rising a few miles as your wife gets up and simultaneously brings you to a comfortable seat right between her beautiful eyes.  As she walks to the humongous front door and starts to open it, you settle in her soft gray facial fur a bit until you feel yourself sink in a few feet.

These feelings could only be due to the fact that you indeed must have had the experience in this new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first kiss was with Veronica, during your third year of high school.  You had known each other since your first year at Fur Valley High, but as good friends at first.  It was at the school prom where you would realize that you were made for each other.  You had asked her to be her date that night, and she accepted without any hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Human Interaction was both of your strengths, as only those students with As in that class were allowed to actually dance with each other.  This made complete sense, as if a female anthro was not perfectly coordinated to handle a male human, or if the male was not careful around the female, an activity such as dancing could prove disasterous.  However, you two were naturals on the dance floor, her fluid movements and your stamina and footwork balancing each other perfectly.  During one dance, Veronica performed a jitterbug, her hindpaws flying over your head at dazzling speeds as you danced underneath her.  During the slow dance, you waltzed around her huge palm, her gigantic index claw leading your movements.  You two were pronounced prom king and prom queen last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Veronica carried you home that night, she mentioned how wonderful a time she had, her muzzle close to your body standing on her finger.  \"You know, this has been the best night of my life.  I'm so glad that you invited me, my good friend, it wouldn't had been nearly as enjoyable with anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then replied, \"I'm so happy you had a good time.  I wish that prom didn't have to end, just so we could be have fun and be happy forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive lips descended suddenly yet sensually, burying you in their softness.  She felt you return her kiss, the tiniest warm wet spot on her lip, and her tongue lolled out, covering you in a fine coat of saliva.

Yours was a traditional wedding, but as Veronica explained it in great detail, you realize that a traditional wedding is not what you originally considered to be traditional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your families were there, but instead of one on the left and one on the right, they were mixed.  The men sat in a aisle that was traditionally held in the paws of the groom's mother, which in this case was your mother.  Her name was still Mabel and her personality sounded like hers, except now she had become a huge otter anthro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica was dressed in a beautiful flowing gown with a three mile trail, and she carried you down the aisle.  She was crying tears of happiness that day, and she kept wiping her facial fur with tissues to prevent the 'wet dog' smell from messing up the wedding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wedding vows were different than what you remember; different tasks were directed to different genders.  Your wife's were, \"Do, you, Veronica, take Harold to be your lawfully wedded groom, to have and to hold, to protect and to care for, to love unto death?\"<br>\r\nShe, of course said, \"I do.\"  Your vows were, \"Do you, Harold, take Veronica to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to be held by, to respect and be devoted to, to love unto death?\"  You also agreed, saying, \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exchanging of rings was different than you knew.  Since it would take thousands of humans to lift a single anthro-sized ring, the ring-bearer, your cousin in this case, placed the ring on Veronica's huge finger.  Veronica still placed the ring on your finger herself; an impressive feat for such a large being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you then kissed your bride.  This kiss was even more amazing than your first kiss, as true love and passion was put into it.  As for the cake, Veronica just winks at you and says, \"Let's just say that it took weeks to clean your tux.\"  You do not hear anything about rice being thrown; very likely because that would be very dangerous for the humans.</span></div></div>",

While it was still groom's friends and relatives on one side and the bride's on the other the men sat in an aisle held by the bride's mother or by the groom's sister/first cousin.

The marriage vows were also unusual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, Veronica &lt;insert maiden name here&gt; take &lt;insert name here&gt;, to have and to hold, to love and protect, to cherish and care for, in sickness and in health, for bigger for smaller, for richer for poorer, till death do you part?\" And yours were. \"Do you, &lt;insert name here&gt; take Veronica &lt;insert maiden name here&gt;, to be kept and to be held by, to honour and respect, to admire and love, in sickness and in health, for bigger for smaller, for richer for poorer, till death do you part?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring was also a different caper.

Its even more shocking how he names you in such a loving way...but who can he be. You needed to answer back so he would have no strange suspicion of something is wrong. \"Good morning to you too, honey,\" you said with a false smile. You watched as his face loomed closer till all you can see was his mouth. Even his lips were huge to you as they light pressed against you to give you a smooch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally noticed you were naked as his large lips seem to press aginst your breast more. This kiss ended and you were quickly placed right upon his muzzle. You looked up and had a difficult time trying to look at both eyes nonetheless one. You focused on the nearest one being the right one as it focused on you. You looked up at it at awe as it stared at your naked body lovingly. You felt a cold draft and covered yourself more on blocking his view. He felt the vibe and turned to look at the titanic clock. \"Its pretty early darling...wanna have some fun or get some breakfast,\" the giant hare asked you with a soothing and loving voice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of your awes struck trance to answer his question. \"Well I don't know...what do you want,\" you played off. Apparently this life of yours put you in a loving position with someone you barely know. The sheer fact that he's the size of a city increase the fact of how weird things truly are. Are you married or is this just your boyfriend who knows. He's no danger to you but lets hope he's careful about having fun. You looked up at the giant orb as it gave you the feeling it was eying your every details. You tried to dig anything deep in your memory but nothing comes up. You can't figure any names nor your own or how you look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way he looks at you...you have a feeling your probably a looker but you still don't know. The floors under you moved up and down lightly unlike before. \"I'm not sure...the fun we had last night was pretty good and I don't wanna tire you honey,\" he said sweetly and compassionately as you felt your heart melt. He wasn't just one big titan of a rabbit but he's sweet and understanding. What a man you bagged apparently, you looked up to watch his giant pillars for fingers came down around you slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightly snatching you, the scenery around you change to a blur. You held your man's strands of fur as he moved as slow carefully not to hurt you. The motion finally stopped as you looked up at the giants upper body. Again you were at complete awe and stared at his amazing body of toned muscles. Nice tight packs covered his abdomen, strong and confident chests, huge strong arms and he was naked. The huge brown rabbit stared at you weirdly, \"Whats wrong, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, I'm just wondering how I ended up with such a man,\" you said to keep him off of suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...should I start with how we finally got to talk or when I laid my eyes on you for the first time,\" he spoke sweetly as he smiled at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really,\" you smiled happy to get a chance to understand your lover. He slowly laid back down in bed in his naked glory as he placed you softly on his bare chest. He moved his knee and tapped his foot softly on the bed as he remembered the good days. Each tap sent a deep vibration into your very body, rumbling you up inside. He rested his head snugly enough so he can look down at your small frame. His hand moved over you and acted as a larger hanger of radiating heat. You walked up a bit even though you found it to be a bit hard to travel on fur. Picking a good spot by his large thumb, you sat down snugly and wrapped your arms around your large breast to keep him from getting distracted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laughed a bit as he smiled down at you. Sending you mixed messages of love and adoration from his large eyes. \"So...how did this love story start,\" you asked as you started to feel something for this sexy hunk of a bunny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It started in high school when a nobody laid his eyes on the most beautiful girl in school name Samantha...\" </span></div></div>",

Heart-shape face, long red hair, large breast, big butt-er,\" you gave him a move-on look and he did.  \"So like I said she was a looker and every guy wanted her...from the nerds to the jocks from the gamers to the rockers. By now I would of thought so many people would of had their hearts broken by now but she kept such an air of friendliness and was able to turn them each down without much a problem. She really did knew how to handle herself and in the back of the crowd was no other then a normal brown rabbit taking quick glances of her before rushing off to class. That rabbit was no other then Joseph Ale who like hundreds of guys had a crush on Samantha Jones but he avoided all contact of her. Because deep down just talking to her acting like he wasn't interested would hurt even more,\" he told when his building size thumb rubbed against you lightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt scared you at first but you quickly recovered and snuggled against the titan's thumb to keep him happy. You looked up at the miles away face as it peered down at you. The only thing separating you was a vast plain of fur. You took a heavy wonder to how he can see something as small and insignificant as you. To you, you are no bigger then the tiniest ant to this loving giant and being able to be by his feet seemed like an honor. But as the faiths decreed love finds away even if that form of love is large enough to conquer a continent. \"But in the faiths something caused them to meet didn't they,\" you said thinking if not how would you two have met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed...love finds away and when our Joseph was walking out of the library for males right by him was Samantha waiting at the edge of the female library. She seemed in distress and couldn't get a ride to class. She called to Joseph and he wondered if he should pretend not to hear. But luckily he didn't becuase that would of been his last chance. The female library came up to his waist so he lowered down until his face came before  this great beauty. Her features were more amazing then he thought and here she is asking for his help. He wasn't sure if he should pick her up or let her walk onto his palm becuase his sensitive hands would be able to feel many details of her body but she suggested for him to pick her up and she didn't mind. So he did and began to walk towards her class when out of no where she started a conversation with him. So they continued to talk and he decided  to slow down to keep the conversation going. Finally they were at the class door and before he placed her in the male teacher's hand he said a stupid joke but she laughed nonetheless,\" Joseph continued but paused a bit to let it settle in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge hangar of your lovers hand moved as his taller-then-skyscraper fingers delicately moved around you. The soft but leathery pad of the inside of his hand was nice to feel upon when both his indexed and thumbed pinned you. You laid there in his grasped as his huge head loomed closer to you. It filled your vision as his eyes peered down at you with such love and happiness. You found his grip not too tight and moved a bit so you can show your assets. There's no point in shunning him becuase by now you had the hots for this sexy bunny. You decided you wanted to take a risk and see if you can piece the last part. \"And so they began to meet more and more and get to talk and understand each other more and more. Joseph made her laugh on countless occasions and soon enough something start building up and between them a true relationship was born,\" you told and waited to see if you got it right or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept his smile and his grasped finally release as you found yourself laying on the black surface of the tip his index finger. You laid back as he began to tell the rest. \"Indeed they did but on that day their courtship was known, hearts of many were broken. Many men placed their hatred on Joseph and sooner or later a fight broke out between Joseph and Jocks. But unknown to many Joseph was quite a fighter and his dad was a famous pro wrestler so many guys were sent to the hospital. And through all that he held his dear beloved Samantha in his left fist leaving him with only one arm. And through it all while he took a hard blow he would checked on the precious beauty being held in his hand to make sure she was safe,\" he told when he popped you down in the middle of his palm with his other hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis titanic fingers began wrapping around her forming a huge dark cave in this god-like rabbit's left fist. He curled his fingers back and his face loomed over giving a reassuring smile. You wasn't scared but you were worried by the sudden move but you did understand he was trying to show what he went through. \"And with that the dear princess was safe and no man dare to step close to you without me being around. It was custom for a male friend to only talk to a female who had a boyfriend when only the boyfriend is around or he was conscious of it and it went the other way around for a female friends. So after high school they continued their love through college sharing an apartment and getting to know each other a bit more better,\" he smiled staring directly at your chest, \"And here they are now a college couple about to graduate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nearly lost your balance when his hand moved closer and closer towards his maw. He lined you for another kiss but this time you did your part and hugged the large black flesh. \"What a tale and strange enough we are those people told in it,\" you smiled when his lips moved away and you were place back upon his snout. You felt a weird sensation from hearing this grand story told by your titanic lover. It was probably the fact that each word he spoke was soft and loving but rumbled deep into your divine soul. It was as if a giant god with the world in his hands fell in love with one tiny mortal who had no idea of his needs or how precious she is to him. It was more then magical but an absurd love between a titan and a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...shall we go off and freshen up becuase we got a whole Saturday,\" he said. Even through his eyes was that same smile only for her and she wouldn't share it to any gal for the world. </span></div></div>",

It was like looking at the clock of Big Ben from just fifty feet way when it must've been about three miles away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the time?\" She cried out, getting to her feet. Getting the hint from her miniscule form Joseph rose from the bed and returned the clock to the bedside table; his shift made Samantha tumble onto her back but she found it quite fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we get ready together,\" He asked, \"Or would you like to do it on your own?\" Samantha checked to see if he wanted to have her with him while getting ready; there was no plea in his massive eyes so she decided to do it in a way that seemed familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather a surprise to find a bathroom to her scale through a door on the wash stand. Having sorted herself out in here she found no clothes so she returned to Joseph's bathroom and was readily whisked back to the bedroom. Her clothes were in a pile characteristic of students but in the unorthodox location that was her great big bunny's English notebook. Neither of them could take their eyes off each other as they dressed; the giant rabbit's eyes almost permamently locked onto her tiny form and she was unable to admire his mighty physique as he put his T-shirt on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the kitchen Samantha was agog by the sight of it; everything had to be no less than a mile in its proportions; her mind wondered how easily she could fit into even the smallest gap.

She seemed to be a might puzzled by your greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're leaving off the teasing, then?\" She inquires, you look a trifle baffled as you cannot see how a brother could openly tease a sibling the size of a city and live long enough for it to become familiar. \"I do find it embarrassing when you call me 'Fi-fai-fo-fum'.\" She comments as she lowers a claw for you to climb on. That sort of nicknaming makes sense to you since her immense scale just cannot be ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ride Fiona into the bathroom, where she sets you down on the side of the sink. With great skill she fills a cup that is smaller than a thimble to her but is still a bucket to you. Once she sets it down you see that your toothbrush and toothpaste are set in the side of it. You fish them out and lean over the side of the cup so as to brush your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing so you can clearly hear Fiona brushing her canine teeth. The sound of her toothbrush scraping against her stalagtites and stalagmites for teeth is the sound of a large steam engine pulling out of the station. When the tap runs it is like the sound of a great unbroken waterfall tumbling into a gorge. When she takes water to rinse her mouth you hear the sound of a tsunami mixed with that of a hurricane in the distance. When she swills her mouth it is like great waves (the common beach ones) washing over one another and when she gargles it is like the sound of an erupting geyser over a rock concert speaker system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've finished brushing your teeth Fiona taps a particular space on the wall against the sink. You walk over to it and see that it's a shower door, conveniently at your scale. Looking up at your massive anthro sis you notice that she's preparing to remove her pyjamas and immediately go into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower you feel around for your clothes, not wanting to expose yourself to your elder sister, especially at that size. You hear her familiar giggle and find one of her claws kindly proferring your clothes like it was a clothes peg. You take these and dress in a dry area of the shower alcove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are both fully dressed Fiona carries you downstairs to the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

You realise that he's already seated at the table as you notice a silhouette at one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" You call down to him. The response is a stifled laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She always stops you being late.\" He answers as Fiona carefully and successfully sets you down right in the seat opposite him just as your mother comes in, every step resonating through the floor and up the tablelegs. There is a plate for Fiona and a plate for herself holding a full English breakfast that could drown London, Birmingham and Glasgow combined and that's just your mother's. She then takes a strange utensil and takes a sample of everything from her plate and deposits it on your father's while Fiona does the same for you. As you look at what you and your father are having the titans now take a drop from their cups of tea and drip it into the boys' mugs. It is strange to eat just crumbs of breakfast but it will be more than enough for you; a bit of baked bean in a drop of tomato sauce, a crumb of toast, a bit of sausage meat, a bit of bacon, a piece of egg white, a piece of mushroom and even a crumb of black pudding.</span></div></div>",

Your Mom snatches you from your titanic sister's shoulder and smooches you hard, covering you in lipstick and fox saliva. You grunt as you're pushed against your vulpine mother's skyscraper sized teeth. Fortunately, she puts you back on Fiona's shoulder. \"Have a good day at school babies.\" Says your mom. Fiona walks out the door as you shake off your mother's spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet you wish you could start one day without Mom slobbering all over you little bro.\" Says Fiona.

We're girls after all. I think your basketball team's last game had a worse effect than I thought.\" You give a confused look. \"I told Dominique to be careful with her drink. One of the ice cubes hit you on the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that explains your amnesia. But this was all too unreal.

While she throws the covers off and swings her feet out of bed you try to let everything sink in.

Boy, what a wife!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stands up with you still riding upon the tip of her finger you think what luck it is to have a wife like this. Her breasts are modest compared to the rest of her but to you they had to be five miles long each. Peering over the edge of her fingertip you see her feet in the distance; they looked quite small compared to her great long legs but, as far as you're concerned, they are the size of an English district, about eight to ten miles from her ankles to her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to your wife's face just in time before she becomes inquisitive you look at her great muzzle creasing up in a loving smile. You can't help but wonder just what her canine teeth would be like but decide that they'd have to be much bigger than stalactites. She sets you down upon a dresser and walks across to the other side of the room to get herself dressed, not at all ashamed of showing herself off to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find your clothes and some furniture (a cupboard and chest of drawers) at your scale only three feet away from where you were desposited.

In a couple of steps she looms over you and you are within arm's reach to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready, darling?\" She asks you with such astonishing gentleness in her voice that it is unbelievable that it's being emitted from a mouth as wide as the Grand Canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear.\" You reply, worried that your voice is too feeble for her to hear but, incredibly, she can hear you as well as if she was no bigger than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" She comments as she lowers a monolithic finger on to the surface of the dresser, \"Let's go downstairs for breakfast.\" Hesitantly you walk over to her finger, big enough to stop up a limestone cave, and carefully step up onto her claw, which could stratch a dyke out of the landscape you used to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe irde on your ultra-titanic wife was mind-blowing.

At the centre a tall, strangely-shaped glass skycraper rises into the heavens; the biggest vase you have ever seen so far marks the city centre that you imagine, the flowers inside could hide an entire country's air force ready for rapid deployment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long your super-grandiose wife returns with a plate in her paws.

You have 3 daughters, Lucy who's you're 16 year old sweetie, Jillian who's 14 and a bit of a problem but you'll never find a smarter girl, and Mary who's 8 and just an angel.\" She starts crying again as she realises that you won't be able to recognize you're own children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over and hug one of her fingers saying  \"Cecilia don't cry, just because I can't remember doen't mean my feelings have changed\" you say. Wiping the tears away she says \"Well dear it's about time we went downstairs and had breakfast, and it's time for you to get you're memories back.\" She gets up and places you down on the bedside table where a brown dot which you realize is a dresser sits, she then walks over to her own dresser and starts picking clothes. You try to compare how large you're wife is to yourself by comparing dressers and you make an estimate that she is around 6 miles tall. You quickly pick a long white shirt and a pair of slacks and you turn to see you're wife who is now garbed in a white dress creating a beautiful harmony with her silver scales. Cecilia walks over and offers you a claw which you grab onto as she whisks you up and places you on her shoulder. She walks downstairs into a large kitchen, about as large as some national parks. She places you down on a linoleum counter as she starts grabbing foodstuffs from the fridge and cupboards. \"You alright with bacon and eggs dear?\" Cecilia asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds lovely\" you reply as you feel the counter shake, \"what's happening?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good the children are up\" she replies staring down at you with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and see three giant silver blurs rush down the stairs till they're all standing beside their mother. Lucy who was the oldest was only a bit smaller then her mother, Jillian is a head shorter then her sister and Mary was to normal persepctive maybe 1.5 to 2 feet shorter then Lucy. When you saw her shining eyes you knew why you're wife called her an angel. Each of them gives their mother a hug and then Lucy asks \"Where's dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's on the counter\" she replies while tending to some bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found him\" Jillian cries looking directly at you, \"morning Dad\" she says with a smile on her face. \"Morning Jillian\" you reply although this causes a frown to cross her face. \"Dad why didn't you call me you're little moon like always\" she asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're father isn't exactly himself today\" Cecilia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy\" Mary says and you turn to her, she offers you her claw which you climb upon and she hugs you close to her. \"Morning sweetie\" you say as she holds you there until you're eldest daughter puts her clawed hand forward and you're passed to her. \"Morning dad\" she says leaning down and giving you a kiss. \"Morning Lucy, you're as sweet as ever\" you say. She gently pushes against you making sure not to use the tip of her claw and you just smile. \"Everyone you can play with you're father later, right now it's time for breakfast\" Cecilia says carrying 4 plates of bacon and eggs to the table. Lucy places you down in front of you're mothers plate and you notice a little table and chair that's just you're size. Cecilia produces some kind of syringe device which she sticks into her bacon and then her eggs and then places the perfect sized proportions of food down on you're table. She then repeats the process with a glass of orange juice. You dig in along with the rest of the family and there isn't much talking at first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with Dad, Mom\" Jillian asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean Jillian\" Cecilia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not acting normal, and he's called me his little moon every day for years\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well girls you see....\" she then turns to you and stares at you with a look like, don't make me have to tell them</span></div></div>",

You're three daughters look down at you stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy bends over and looks down at you with one 1 house sized eye, \"you're definitley our father, so that means that what you just said was the truth\" she says starting to break down as she says it. As Lucy breaks down so too do the other 2, Cecilia walks over and hugs them and you just sit there not really sure about what you can do at a time like this. Cecilia leads them into the living room where you continue to hear you're daughters weeping, even though you don't know them you feel really bad that you're causing them pain. After about 10 minutes Cecilia walks in with a stern look on her face and she lowers a claw down to you which you climb onto. She walks back into the living room and she sets you down and sits on the titanic couch in front of you with Lucy and Jillian on either side of her and Mary sitting in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly is going on?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dear since you can't remember you're life we'll just have to re-introduce you to it starting with the most important parts\" she says. \"You may have noticed that I as well as you're daughters are huge and not exactly human, well all females here compared to the men are gargantuan and we all are some kind of anthromorphic animal\" she says. \"As you already know you have 3 daughters they are each going to introduce themselves to you\" she says as she gently pushes Lucy forward. Lucy still looks really sad, so you stand up and say \"if it's really painful you don't have to go through with it.\" She shakes her head and lowers a claw down to you which you grab onto, the claw quickly raises to face level and she just stares at you for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes in a few breaths and begins, \"dad you've always been supporting me ever since I can remember, even though mom had to do a lot of the things a father did I still remember you teaching me to read and write, even though it took you 5 minutes to make a readable a\" she says laughing a little. \"You were always the first and last to clap during any of my performances and you even comforted me after Brian rejected me.\" She says falterng for a moment but then trying to smile again. \"So dad even if you say you can't remember anything I can accept that as long as i'm still you're \"little\" girl\" she says. You see a tear run down her face and you say \"Lucy can you bring me closer\" she does so and you jump on top of her. You run forward until she has to go cross-eyed to see her and you hug her. \"Lucy I may not remember anything but I can already tell you're a sweet, kind girl don't ever change that about you\" you say. You're pulled back and ever so gently hugged against her chest \"thanks dad\" she says bending over and putting you back on the table. Jillian is gently pushed forward and she now offers you a claw which you take. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see sadness in her eyes and she gently hugs you before beginning. \"Dad you were always trying to protect me even though you knew you were well way out of you're league. I remember the time you hid in my backpack and almost got fired to stop 2 girls from bullying me even though they could have killed you.\" she says. \"You were always encouraging me to learn and read as much as I could even staying up late to read with me. So I just want you to know I love you Dad\" she says. You get up and she stares at you for a second. \"Jillian can you lift me up for a sec\" motioning for her to bring you up to her cheek. You lean over and kiss one of her scales, \"thanks Jillian\" you say as she puts you back down on the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Mary stands up and you grab onto her offered claw. \"Daddy I love you\" she says, \"I love you too sweetie\" you reply. She hugs you for a second before placing you down on the table and running off. You shrug but she comes back in a few seconds with a piece of paper and picks you up. You look down and even though the picture is in crayon you can tell it's supposed to be a picture of you and her with a bunch of hearts surrounding you 2. You smile up at her and she smiles back, \"Thanks angel\" you say. She lifts you up and you give her a kiss on the nose causing her to giggle as she hands you over to Cecilia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling you're children have reminded you about them now it's time to remind you about us.\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Each girl was assigned a guy to watch over through their high school years, this was to make sure there weren't just a ton of random missing people but also to help get the next generation going. I remember when I picked you up for the first time you said \"principal are you sure you want to create a beauty and the beast couple,\" it made me giggle and I think that's when I fell for you. After that we spent a lot of time together not only because of school but because as time went by we found we shared a lot of common interests. I remember when you asked me to be you're muse for art class, you were such a gentleman since the men were allowed to ask the girls to pose nude for them, all you ever asked me to wear were long dresses because \"a princess has to look her part.\" you'd always say. When you first asked me out on a date I was overjoyed, even though you barely had any money, like the rest of the guys since they can't do much you insisted on paying for both of us. You did pretty well scholarly but the one class you and I both aced was relations class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I definitley don't remember that\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a course where girls and boys learn to be near each other, girls learn to watch for men and do normal activities around them like cook, clean, and dance. Boys learn how to treat a woman right and some other things\" she says not finishing the sentence. \"Anyways one of the happiest days of my life had to be when you asked me out to the prom, Only the students who advanced relations class were actually allowed to dance since there was such a chance of injury. I will never forget the slow dance, it was a waltz and even though you were dancing on my hand with my claw as you're partner you had a smile on you're face that everyone in the room noticed. At the end of the dance you asked me if I could take you to a certain tree at the back of the school. You confessed to me right then and there, and I raised you up to kiss you. You leaned forward to kiss me and I accepted it so readily I almost squished you,\" she says twiddling her thumbs a bit \"Even after that and even though you're so small I've never felt a stronger embrace as you hugged me as I was apologizing to you, you said \"it's ok beautiful, just don't make the same mistake on our wedding night or we may have a problem\" with a big smile on you're face. At that moment I broke down a little bit and you chided me saying \"hey now I don't ever want to see the woman I love cry, because that means i'm not doing my job right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she tells you about you're...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Yes pretty much another flashback/explanation chapter told from Cecillia's point of view, to make it easier after she says something within the larger quote it will say she said afterwards)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The second happiest day of my life dear had to be the day we got married, second only to each day of my daughters birth\" Cecilia says giving each of her girls a squeeze. \"We had a very old fashioned wedding, I carried my father up to the altar while you were carried up by my mother and then handed over to me. While you were standing there my father shook you're hand and said \"take good care of my daughter, I give you my blessing.\" \"She'll be more taking care of me but i'll do my best father\" you replied returning the handshake. My father was then taken over by my mother to where my sister was standing, she was holding all the male guests on a tiny wooden pew. You're mother was standing beside her and you assumed she was holding you're father she gave off the same feeling as you're mother but she had turned into a giant anthro bunny. The priest walked up to the mike and said \"we are gathered here today to join these 2 in holy matrimony, if anyone has any objections speak now or forever hold you're peace.\" The church was deathly silent so the priest went on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you Cecillia dragontale take this man to have and to hold, to love and respect, in sickness and health, for poor or for wealth, to care for and watch over for the rest till death do you part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Do\" she said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you Alex take this dragoness to love and to care for, to fawn over and love, in sickness and health till death do you part.\" the priest<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I Do\" you said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hereby pronounce you 2 husband and wife\" the priest said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exchange of rings was very interesting, my sister put the ring on my finger in place of you, but I still put the ring on you, you had to manouver you're hand a bit but when we were both wearing our rings the whole church erupted into cheers. I then leaned over and kissed you so hard I pushed you straight back into my palm, thankfully you were smart enough to lay back so you weren't hurt and you kissed me back with all you're might. The whole church erupted into cheers a second time as I held you it was one of the happiest moments of my life. We all came back here for the reception party and it was wonderful, although we did have to put the party on hold for a few minutes after you fell off my hand into the cake. I found you quickly and plucked you out of the cake. We ate the piece together and you were smiling the whole time, afterwards the champage was served and even though it was our wedding night you didn't touch the stuff. after the reception I was kind of tipsy from the alcohol you encouraged me upstairs and stroked my hair as I was sleeping. You watched over me for maybe 3 hours and I slowly woke up afterwards with a headache. \"Geez you really went at that alcohol what did you need all that liquid courage for anyways\" you asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to make our wedding night memorable\" she replies, you then leaned down and kissed one of my scales saying \"Cecilia every day with you is memorable, now can I come snuggle with you or do I have to sleep on the cover on our wedding night.\" I picked you up and brought you close to my chest and held you there making sure you were safe. \"Good night Cecilia my lovely dragon\" you said \"Good night lover\" she said.\" Cecillia finishes talking and her eyes mist up as she remembers what you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turns to you and asks \"so did you mean what you said on that night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I did, Cecillia you're the most beautiful dragoness i've ever seen, most men would kill to be near you and I was blessed enough to marry you and have 3 wonderful kids with you\" you say, \"yet I lost all that when I lost my memory, so if it hurts not having me able to remember you and if you wish it i'll leave\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alex\" she says hugging you to her chest she then lifts you up to her face and her tongue gently rolls over you covering you in saliva she then sniffs the air and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You now have my scent on you, I forgot to do that on our wedding night even though it's a dragon's most important mating ritual\" she says laughing a little. \"That scent will last on you till you die and until then you're mine and my brood's alone, got that?\" she says staring down at you with her gentle amber eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you wish beautiful\" you reply, she raises you up to her face and you kiss her and returns the favour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww that's so cute\" Lucy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad I want a kiss next\" Mary says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia passes you over to you're daughter who gently kisses you and then passes you back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great dad but how are we going to get the rest of you're memories back?\" Jillian asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something like a scrapbook we could use\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey but I never had time to create something like that\" Cecilia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense girls but did I miss anything important like you're first kiss?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all shake their heads so you ask \"so is it okay if I don't fully remember that stuff?\" you ask again. They nod and you smile at the understanding of you're children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can do for my gorgeous wife and kids to try and make up for this?\" you ask</span></div></div>",

The room is entirely red with random stuffed animals littering the floor. You notice a tv with some sort of game system attatched to it opposite the bed and you think \"damn I let my kid have a tv in their room, i'm awesome\" smiling to yourself. Jillian places you on her shoulder and then rummages through a drawer producing a mini-tv, a mini game system, a controller and a single cord that was much smaller on one end then the other. She sticks the cord into the tv and quickly sets up the mini-system which as you watched must have taken an amazing amount of hand-eye coordination. She places you down on the tv, sticks a pair of headphones into the jack and turns the system on. You turn you're tv and system on and find that the 2 systems are linked. \"Makes sense that they came up with more 'nano-tech' here given the size difference\" you think. You are up against you're daughter in an anthro dragon ball z fighting game. You laugh to yourself given that the situation you were in would make a perfect anime. You pick the main character and quickly learn that the female opponents aren't super powered, they're just regular anthro size. Needless to say you get trounced, however after that first match you go hardcore and even though you were never that good at fighters, she kept under estimating you and you got a flawless victory each round for the next 10 rounds. You feel her breath on you're back and she's staring down at you \"since when did you get any good at this kind of game, I used to go undefeated against you\" Jillian says. You rub the back of you're head and say \"Um....amnesia increases you're gaming skills.\" She just stares down at you and says \"suspicious\" and is about to question you more when Lucy pops her head in and says \"Um...Dad can I play with you for a bit?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod happy to get away from you're prying 14 year old and Lucy walks in and offers you a claw. You gladly climb up and Jillian just stares as you are whisked away. Lucy quickly reaches her room, which looked a lot more like a girls room, everything was neat and tidy and each wall was painted pink. There was a dresser on one wall and a larger bed then Jillians took up the center of the room. Lucy places you down on the bed and lays down next to you. \"So Lucy what do you want to do, for Jillian it was video games\" you say smiling up at you're titan sized daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushes a bit and says \"Dad would you mind rubbing my back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" is all you can say in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used to do it whenever I felt sad\" Lucy says starting to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, ok\" you say, \"yay\" she yells quickly scooping you up with a claw and placing you on her back. Shrugging you start rubbing the scales although you really didn't think you were doing all that much as it took you a minute to cover what you assumed was a centimetre on you're daughters back. Yet she gave off a happy somewhat roaring sound the whole time, after half an hour and you giving it you're all you assumed you covered maybe a quarter of a city block, and you sit down panting absolutely exhausted. Lucy gently turns over so you slide off her back, she then scoops you off the bed and says \"thanks dad\" before gently giving you a kiss. You blush a bit and reply \"no problem sweetie, although I may have a few kinks to work out now.\" You pull you're arm back and actually hear a slight pop, it seems Lucy heard it as well as she giggles a bit before walking out of the room. She takes you into Mary's room which although it was a younger child's room looked very neat, everything that wasn't being used was put away and you smiled knowing how good a girl you're angel was. Lucy taps Mary on the shoulder and she turns and quickly spots you. She cups her hands and you're gently passed over, you're daughter stares down at you with a giant smile on her face and she gently hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to play Mary?\" you ask her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to play house\" she says. You shrug and she quickly sets up a bunch of toys. \"I'll be the mom, you be the dad, and mr.fluffers will be our daughter\" she says indicating a stuffed rabbit many times you're size. It went along quite smoothly although there was one instance where she ran into Mr.fluffers and you just barely dodged getting squished. You then spent the next few minutes trying to calm her down and show her you were ok as it had really upset her that she well had almost ended you.  After maybe an hour of playing with Mary you hear Cecillia yell \"Kids it's time for lunch, get you're father and come downstairs.\" You grab onto Mary's claw and she holds you tight as she runs down the stairs. She places you down on the kitchen table next to Cecillia's spot and you're wife smiles at you. \"So were the girls well behaved sweetie?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were great, they took very good care of they're father\" you reply. Cecillia smiles and you look over noticing that lunch is something more simple, just peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches. You look up at you're wife with a quizzical face and she smiles, she cuts off a piece and just places it next to you. \"Eat up hunnie\" she says although you can see her vibrating from the laughter as the piece she cut off although miniscule to her was easily 20 times you're size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say\" you reply before digging into the giant piece of sandwhich, after you're full you lay back and Cecillia says \"girls don't you remember you have swimming lessons this afternoon.\" They all groan and Lucy says \"but mom we want to stay with dad,\" you see a hint of a smile creep over Cecillia's face and she says \"don't worry you're father will be fine here with me, we'll both be waiting for you when you get back.\"</span></div></div>",

They respond in kind bowing their heads and saying \"yes dad.\" \"I knew that father in you hadn't disappeared\" Cecillia says before hustling off the kids. You hear the sound of a motor and then silence for 15 minutes, you're first thought is \"alright I can totally handle having a ginormous dragon wife and kids\" however you quickly realize you're stuck on the kitchen table and then you're not so sure. You sit there for another 20 minutes until you hear the sound of a car pulling up and a door opening and closing. Cecillia walks in and sits down next to you. \"So now that the kids are gone we have the next few hours to ourselves\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great to hear\" you say smiling, Cecillia offers you a claw and you climb on, she lifts you up and gently gives you a kiss. You smile and she puts you down on her shoulder before heading back upstairs. She places you down on the bed and lies down next to you. \"So how much do you actually remember?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very much you reply....except my other life\" you whisper the last part to you're self. Thing is that dragons have really good hearing so Cecillia asks \"what was that last thing you said?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....nothing, nothing at all\" you say. Cecillia lowers her head and moves forward so she's right over you \"I heard you say something, dear you don't want me to get angry do you?\" she says letting you see the glint of a fang. You knew that she cared for you but you weren't sure about a husband who had \"amnesia\" plus there was the whole you were like a grain of sand to her thing. She gently pushes you over with a claw and traps you under it. \"Dear i'm not letting you out until you tell me what you whispered\" Cecillia says with a stern look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well I have 2 options here, her getting mad at me for not telling her which is a sure-fire thing and her maybe getting mad at me for telling her the truth\" you think. \"Geez I really wish there was a third option right now,\" you actually wait a few seconds hoping for a doorbell or something but no such luck so you sigh and say \"fine i'll tell you what's up.\" Cecillia lifts her claw off you then scoops you up with it and brings you up to face level. You walk onto her palm and sit down, she positions herself in a sitting position as well and stares at you expectantly. \"Cecillia when I said I didn't remember you that was the truth, the thing is I don't have amnesia\" you say, she looks at you strangely and says \"what do you mean you don't have amnesia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is going to sound weird but I am the man you married but i'm not, I fell asleep in my bed, last night and woke up sleeping on top of you, so in short i'm from a different reality or dimension\" you say. She just stares at you dumbstruck for a second then a smile crosses her face \"wow that's a pretty far out joke darling, you know I have a weird sense of humour but that's a little weird even for me\" she says turning away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not joking Cecillia, I really came from a different reality, I probably shouldn't be telling you this because you'll hurt from it but I will not create a relationship with you and you're daughters based on a lie\" you say. She turns toward you and you see tears streaming down her face, \"so what happened to my Alex?\" she asks you. \"He probably replaced me, I mean my life is the exact same as this one, except the women aren't over a mile tall or anthromorphs\" you say. \"There isn't a way to reverse this is there?\" she asks, \"no I don't think there is\" you say. As you say this she breaks down and gently hugs you to her face, you can't do anything but hug her as she lets out her feelings. She cries for a good few minutes but eventually settles down and then she looks down at you and says \"you're never going to see you're family ever again why aren't you crying.\" You shrug and say \"you and my girls are the same as back home, so I never actually lost my family, besides from what i've heard of you're husband my wife and kids are in good hands\" you say. \"Although he's gonna have to get used to working every day\" you say smiling a little. Cecillia looks down at you and slowly a smile crosses her face \"you really are like my little treasure\" she says, \"for all intensive purposes I am you're treasure\" you say. \"There aren't any differences between the 2 of us, from what i've heard of him except the culture, even how I met my wife was similar.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts you up to her face and just stares at you for a second, she seems to make a choice and she raises her claw up. She pushes it toward you and gently gives you a poke with the curved part, \"I need you to answer 3 questions for me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think of me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very beautiful Cecillia, plus you're eyes just radiate gentleness\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods and asks \"if you're there father will you take care of our girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, as my own brood\" you say smiling. She raises you straight up to her eye and stares at you for a few seconds and finally she asks \"will you marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you say yes, you'll become mine and mine alone\" she says giving you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course the answer is yes, although aren't the words till death do you part?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it ever talked about people switching lives\" she says, she leans down and gives you a gentle kiss \"you may kiss the bride\" she says pursing her lips and holding them above you expectantly. You lean up and kiss her putting you're whole heart into it trying to let her know you want to make this work. Strangely enough in you're minds eye as you do this you see him kissing you're wife with you're kids watching and they clap as the 2 break the kiss. Other you turns and you actually make eye contact with the guy, he mouths the words \"take care of her\" and the you nod, the vision then dissappears. You break the kiss and say \"Cecillia, I just saw you're husband, he seems fine and did the same thing we did.\" She nods and you can see the joy and relief on her face, she then lays down on the bed and places you down on her chest. You sit down and ask \"so what are we going to do about the girls I think Jillian suspects that there's something more different then just amnesia\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that could be bad\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we hide it?\" you ask, \"my family didn't seem to mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure\" Cecillia says, she snuggles you close to her and says \"so since we just got married I should know a bit more about you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I love reading, video games, always wanted a family\" she nods as you speak and seems to push you on  \"what else is there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far the 2 of you match up perfectly, but I want to give you a hypothetical\" she says. \"You have an important buisness meeting in a day but the night before you find out one daughter has her finals the next day and one of you're daughters is getting bullied what do you do?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second and say \"Of course i'd help one daughter study, and i'd probably skip the meeting to at the very least go see the principal of the school, if that doesn't work well  more drastic measures would need to be taken.\" you say, you were confident in you're answer as you had done the exact same thing and nearly gotten fired for it. Cecillia smiles and says \"you passed with flying colors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, for the sleeping arrangements i'll just sleep on the night table\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a frown appear on her face and she says \"you're my husband and you're sleeping with me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok, you don't fully know me yet...\" you are cut off as she slices into the back of you're shirt with the very tip of one claw and lifts you up. She brings you closer to her and gently licks you \"You are my dear little treasure, but you will do as you're told, understood?\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say hot stuff\" you reply causing her to burst into a smile. She places you down on her collarbone and she lays her hand over you so tat her claws cover you but don't insert any weight on you. You lay like this for a bit till you ask\"so Cecillia, no offense but how exactly do you fall for someone about the size of a speck to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they have to be really cute, and a kind person just like you hunnie\" she says. Cecillia starts singing and the song is so enchanting and soothing, \"you have a lovely singing voice Cecillia\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks\" she says giving you a little snuggle. (hehe pun) You lay like this till Cecillia looks up at the clock and says \"oh the girls swimming lessons are over i'll go get them.\" You hear her walk downstairs and head out the garage door, you sigh in relief as things had gone easily better then expected. In about half an hour you hear the door open and you hear the girls run in. Cecillia comes in and you talk about wether or not you should tell the girls the truth. You come to a decision and Cecillia calls her brood upstairs, they all sit on the bed and wait expectantly.</span></div></div>",

They lean forward and stare down at you. \"I'm not you're real father\" you say looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha I knew there was something wrong, dad sucked at video games\" Jillian says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're father's not finished talking Jillian\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't he just say he's not our father?\" Jillian asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true yet not true at the same time\" you say \"i'm not the exact man you're mother married, i'm him from a different reality\" you say. They all just look at you and Lucy says \"ok mom stop joking, we'll just remove this imposter and you can show us \" she says reaching for you. You feel Cecillia's tail wrap around you and pull you backwards. She lifts you up to her shoulder and places you down, \"you will do no such thing\" she says and you can feel the anger in her voice. Instantly her girls stop and she says \"this man has graciously offered to be you're father and you will treat him as such, just as our Alex has offered to take care of his family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so you mean this guy really is dad, and that dad is where he should be?\" Lucy asks. Cecillia nods and she just sits there dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't seem to mind when you thought I had amnesia\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but that's because we thought you were still the same person\" Jillian says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the same person\" you reply. Throughout all of this Mary had been sitting there quietly you assumed because most of what you were saying was going over her head. She sits up and crawls over to her mother and offers you a claw, you look up at Cecillia who nods and you climb on. You're placed on her palm and she gently hugs you close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give off the same warmth Dad does when I hug him\" Mary says, she looks down at you for a second with her sparkling eyes \"you are my Dad' she says before gently hugging you again. You smile like you never have before and Jillian and Lucy just look at their sister in shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew my angel would understand\" Cecillia says, she then turns to her 2 other daughters, \"so what about you 2?\" she asks. Jillian scootches over to her sister and offers a claw, you admit you were a bit apprehensive of taking it simply becuase you knew they didn't totally like you and could end you in a second.  You walk onto the offered claw and you're quickly lifted up. You're daughter just stares at you for a bit Suddenly you're splashed as a giant tear hits near you and, she looks down at you and all she asks is \"why&gt;\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what?\" you ask back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you take our father from us?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't take anyone from anything\" you say getting a little peeved \"look I was brought here just as you're dad was brought to my family, the thing is none of you has changed, sure there's some differences like taking 5 minutes to draw a letter but each of you are my family\" you say. Jillian looks down at you for a minute and gently reaches down and lifts you up, she places you down on her nose and you walk it's length and sit between her eyes. \"Look Jillian I know this has to be really tough for you, having some guy who is you're father but isn't just suddenly show up, but I promise you I will take care of all you girls and you're mother as my own family becuase from now on you are my family\" you say. She gently picks you up and says \"thank you, but we don't even know you're name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am you're father so you can just call me dad, but my actualy name is the same as you're father's Alexander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dad looks like you still have 1 girl to talk to\" Jillian says passing you over to Lucy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're eldest daughter looks down at you, and you can see a mix of fear, anger and sorrow in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So um...Dad what do you think of me?\" Lucy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In what way?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how do I look?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look very beautiful Lucy\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...thank you, I was expecting you to say something different\" she says looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare up at her when the realization hits you \"Lucy don't worry, you're father isn't going to oggle you\" you say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're not our father!\" Lucy replies quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officially not yet, but as soon as Cecillia told me who each of you were you became family\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez that's cheesy\" Lucy says a weak smile crossing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help it if it's true\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you have to prove that you're father material\" Lucy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you say with a smile on you're face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just dumped by my boyfriend and come to you crying, what do you do?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pace back and forth a bit thinking then say \"well first i'd probably give you a hug then let you cry out all you're emotions, then we'd probably talk for a bit and i'd tell you about how you deserve better or that you shouldn't give up if you truly do care for him, then probably some comfort food or something.\" you say grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was perfect\" Lucy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect for what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was exactly what happened when she was dumped\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess you pass\" Lucy says, \"but if you make my mom or sisters cry I won't forgive you\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood\" you say snapping to attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're passed back over to Cecillia's who puts you down on her shoulder and says \"so girls is there anything you want to do, I mean this has to be a big shock for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we just kind of spent the last while getting over that shock, so i'm not sure.\" Jillian says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecillia I gotta ask, in this society do men work?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No they don't due to the amount of danger\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn well that's that idea out the window\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cecilia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I thought we could go out to eat\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could do that, but the only place in the city currently set up for that has a waiting list\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, it's not like this just suddenly happened did it\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, actually for thousands of years up till the 1800s men have been little more then slaves and objects for women\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow seriously\" you ask. Cecillia just nods in reply, \"anyone have any ideas?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could play 20 questions\" Jillian asks smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the history's different that's a bit of an unfair advantage isn't it?\" you ask. \"Sorry dad but it's kind of hard to think up games given the whole size difference thing\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being small kind of sucks\" you say feeling a little down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not all bad\" Cecillia says gently picking you up and giving you a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy sits up and says \"I know why don't we just start a fire and just snuggle up together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy I don't think we've done that since Mary was 1\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the harm?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Cecillia says giving a sigh, \"but you stay close to me, I don't want anything happening to you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls run downstairs and Cecillia walks down after them, Cecillia walks up to the fireplace in the living room and fills it with wood, yet you don't see any turn on for the gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you gonna use matches or what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see sweetie she says, she scoops you off her shoulder then leans over and light the wood with a breath of flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was awesome\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What dragons can't breathe flame where you come from?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they can, but I thought you would have like evolved out of it, because they only use it for defense\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there are still male dragons\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touche\" you say, she giggles a bit and sits down in front of the fire. You lay against her neck, Mary and Jillian each lay down using 1 of their mom's legs as a pillow. Lucy grabs some blankets and covers each of her sisters in one before snuggling up in the center and covering herself with a blanket. The 3 girls quickly fall asleep leaving you and Cecillia as the only 2 up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecillia\" you say, she turns to face you \"yes darling\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I was right telling you and the kids about me or should I have just let you believe the lie\" you say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well worrying about it isn't going to change anything, besides I always loved the honest and caring part about you\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay like this for a while until....</span></div></div>",

Cecillia gently moves so her daughters heads gently fall to the floor. She scoops Mary up in her arms and heads upstairs, she enters Mary's room and places her down on the bed and tucks her in. \"Cecillia can you put me down?\" you ask. Figuring out what you wanted to do, Cecillia gently picks you up and places you down on Mary's cheek. You lean down and give her a kiss before saying \"good night angel\" and climb back onto Cecillia's claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd take care of them\" Cecillia whispers as she puts you back on her shoulder and heads downstairs. She gently picks up Jillian and carries her up to her room. She tucks her in and puts you down, you give her a kiss and stroke a white hair. Cecillia picks you up and heads downstairs, she lifts Lucy up and whispers \"ooh, she's getting a bit too heavy for me to carry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecilia carries Lucy upstairs and tucks her into bed. You're placed down again and whisper into her ear, \"have a good sleep sweetie\" before kissing one of her scales. In response she turns over a bit and mumbles \"thanks dad.\" You smile at the comment and grab onto Cecillia's offered claw. She walks back into her room and closes the door before turning the light on. She places you down on the night table and you change into a pair of red pajamas, you couldn't help but take a peek behind you as Cecillia changes, making you feel a tiny bit guilty. She flicks the light off and lays down on the bed and reaches over to get you off the night table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Cecillia as I said i'll just sleep here tonight\" you say. She flicks a lamp on behind you and looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sleeping with me dear\" she replies smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's ok, you probably need some time to get adjusted\" you say curling up. You feel something brush against you, and you look up and see her still looking down at you but there's something different, all you can see is gentleness and caring in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I supposed to go on without my little treasure?\" she asks lowering her head and focusing her gaze you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess i'll sleep with you\" you say smiling as you step onto her offered hand. She raises her hand to her face and just stares at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty defiant aren't we?\" she asks,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was always one of my problem traits\" you reply. She gently licks her hand with her tongue getting you stuck to it then picks you off with 2 fingers and puts you back in her palm. \"What was that for?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't listening to what I said dear, and I get a little peeved when you do that\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Cecillia\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you're sorry you can give me a kiss\" she says lowering her head and pursing her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want hot stuff\" you say standing on you're tip-toes and giving her a kiss. She slowly lowers her hand to her chest and you climb off, you just lay down for some reason having complete trust in the 6 mile tall dragoness surrounding you and try to go to sleep. However you feel something push against you and look over, you notice Cecillia looking down at you and she pushes against you with a finger again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well normally we'd always play a little before going to bed\" Cecillia says blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea how to do that\" you say curling up again hoping she'll just let you go to sleep but you feel a weight push against you're back again a moment later. Sighing you stand up and say \"ok fine, if it's what you really want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because you owe me for all you're put me through today\" she says, you had to admit she was right. She lifts you up and you notice that the white thing you woke up on that morning was one her breasts, she places you down in front of  her nipple and gently gives you a push towards it. \"Just do what you did this morning, it felt great.\" Shrugging you walk up the structure and begin rubbing, you weren't even sure if you're efforts were doing anything until you hear a faint moaning sound surround you. You keep rubbing until Cecillia gently pushes you back and scoops you up before placing you down on her other breast. You rub it for a while and you see her start to smile, you look over and notice she's digging her claws into the bed probably to just let you do you're duty and not take over. You stop after 5 minutes, physically spent and she gently lifts you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you hunnie\" she says giving you a gentle kiss, then placing you back in her hand after you get stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, although next time you don't need to hold yourself back\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" she says blushing crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you gripping the bed holding yourself back, if i'm not enough it's ok\" you say, \"Cecillia can you lower me down\" you say. She does so and you jump off curling up surrounded by her mini-mountains. She pokes you and you look up \"i'm sorry, you were more then enough\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it's not like i'm mad, I mean you're the one who's stuck with me\" you say smiling, \"now just go to sleep, i'm sure the girls will be more of a handful tomorrow\" you say curling back up. Cecillia picks you up and places you down, you open you're eyes for a second and notice the area under you changed from silver to white. You just close you're eyes and feel something scaly yet soft drape over you and suprisingly you feel no pressure and barely any weight come from her. \"Wow she is good\" you think falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up and stretch to the sound of birds and a beam of sunlight. You don't feel Cecillia's hand covering you so you look up and see her smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning dear\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really early, we probably have a few hours before the kids get up\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then i'm going back to bed\" you say curling up again but you feel her give you a poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a beautiful dragoness laying in front of you and all you want to do is sleep?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when you put it that way......yes\" you reply. She gently picks you up between her index finger and thumb and raises you up to face level. \"Darling since you did so much for me yesterday I think it's only right I do something for you\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ok, i'm perfectly content with just being able to be near you\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww that's sweet\" Cecillia says, her tongue snakes out and she licks you're face with the very tip of it \"you always were a little charmer, although I always was in control\" she says. She places you down on the bed and lays out in front of you, she turns her head so you can climb on and you take her cue. You climb onto the top of her head and she quickly sits up getting you tangled in her white hair. \"Oh sorry\" she says fishing you out, she places you down on her nose and you just sit there. \"So darling is there anything I can do for you\" she says while laying down but never once letting her eyes leave you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm perfectly fine Cecillia thanks\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure there's nothing I can do for you, no wants I can fufill\" she asks again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly realized what she was asking so you decided to tease her a bit. \"Cecillia there is one thing you can do for me\" you say turning to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes darling\" she says, her eyes lighting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my pants are a bit tight, but it's probably i'm just a bit larger\" you say. She quickly but carefully scoops you off her nose and placing you down on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um I need you to get undressed\" she says blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, it's just a tight pair of pants\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well...you see\" she says mumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to end the charade you say \"Cecillia I know what you want to do, but it's really ok, the vows were to fawn over and love, and I respect them even if I didn't say them\" you say. She gently pushes you over with one finger and says \"please Alex just get undressed\" you do so and she looks down at you. \"Aww you look so cute like that, I just want to hold you forever\" she says before gently hugging you. You had to admit being surrounded by her warmth did feel really nice, she doesn't do anything too radical she just runs a finger gently over you gently pushing you into her. You had to admit it felt really nice and after a bit she slowly sits up so you slide off her onto the bed and grab you're clothes. \"I'm really glad I trusted you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could have done things to me that I might not have wanted but you were such a gentleman and let me take the lead\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could have taken advantage of you how?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Contrary to what you might think in dragon tradition the wife must serve the husband no matter what\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying if I told you to let me do something indecent you'd have to let me?\" you say. She just nods in response, \"well then all I want from you Cecillia is to be yourself, an dif you ever trust me enough to be willing to take the next step then take it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" she says tears welling up in her eyes she kisses the spot where you are on the bed pushing you back into the sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey at least let me put some clothes on first\" you say as she lifts her head up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't want you to be wearing clothes when I did it\" she says in a cute voice. You get dressed and....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bedroom door bursts open and in run you're 3 girls, Cecillia covers you with one hand and they all jump onto the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey mom where's dad?\" Lucy asks, Cecillia turns her hand over scooping you up. \"He's on my palm\" she replies smiling. The 3 girls lean forward and you smile saying \"good morning girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning dad\" they reply in unison, Mary reaches forward and offers you a finger which you climb onto, she hugs you gently and you're passed to Jillian and Lucy who do the same thing. Lucy just stares down at you after the hug and slowly leans forward, she stops near you and smiles. You smile back and she says \"oh come on Dad are you really too old to give you're daughters a good morning kiss?\" You walk up and kiss one of her scales \"happy?\" you ask. \"Yes now you just have to give one to Jillian and Mary\" Lucy replies passing you over to Jillian. Jillian gently leans over and lets you kiss one of her scales \"hey dad, mind giving me a rematch since you beat me so badly yesterday?\" she asks. \"Sure, i'll just beat you again\" you reply. Jillian smirks and passes you over to Mary, she lifts you up to her nose and taps the end, you walk forward and kiss her nose. Mary giggles and says \"thanks Dad, it's been a long time since you last gave us a good morning kiss, I missed them\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad I started again\" you reply, you're passed back over to Cecillia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone up for blueberry pancakes?\" Cecillia asks. You join you're girls in yelling \"yeah\" and they all bolt downstairs. Cecillia slowly gets up and says \"I knew you'd be able to take good care of my girls, although you are kind of gullible\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but if you don't put trust in you're family then who can you trust?\" you reply. She smiles and walks downstairs and walks into the kitchen, you're daughters are already at the table and Cecillia puts you down on the table before going to make pancakes. You're girls quickly surround you and Jillian leans over staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad what do you think we should do today?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't we have a laze around at home day?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh but that's no fun Dad, besides there's so many things we could do like swim, play baseball, really anything\" Lucy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're fathers a little too small for that kind of stuff\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you too small to read us a story?\" Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, you know I don't know\" you say, Mary runs off and Lucy and Jillian lean forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can read Mary a story but not play with us, playing favourites much Dad\" Jillian says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine what do you 2 want to play, and sorry but you're dad just can't play any sports with you\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already said I want a rematch dad\" Jillian says, Lucy starts fidgeting and says \"um Dad would you mind showing me how to dance with a boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jillian you're on and Lucy i'd be more then happy to teach you how to dance\" you say. \"But why so suddenly, won't they teach you in relations class?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I kind of want to impress the boy i'm with\" she replies quickly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see, i'll teach you to sweep him off his feet literally or figurativley you're choice\" you reply smiling. Mary runs in holding the first book of the harry potter series, \"you were reading this to us last\" she says as she runs up. She opens the book and holds it up and suprisingly you can read the letters, heck it was like reading a giant neon sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be happy to read that to you Mary\" you reply smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pancakes are done\" you hear Cecillia say as she starts placing plates of pancakes at each of the girls spots. She places her plate down and rips off a tiny piece which she places down next to her. You reach over and start eating, not noticing Cecillia smiling as you dig into the blueberry. You quickly eat you're fill and Cecillia spears the rest with the tip of her claw and eats it, \"can you not do that?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww you look kind of cute when scared\" Cecillia says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't\" you say letting you're heart settle, \"ok getting used to some things are gonna take longer then others\" you think to yourself. It takes everyone else a little longer to eat since their portions weren't bigger then they were, Cecillia smiles down at you and asks \"so have you got the day planned out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Jillian wants a rematch, Mary wants a story read to her and Lucy wants me to teach her how to dance\" you say. You see a frown spread over Cecillia's face as you mention Lucy and dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's wonderful, but stick to the tamer dances, Lucy kind of has 2 left feet, you'll be safer that way\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom\" Lucy yells across the table, you look over and she's blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy don't worry about, besides guys don't mind doing dances like the waltz gets them closer to the girls they like\" you reply. Lucy flares bright red as you say this and she quickly starts eating her pancakes again. Jillian starts laughing and Cecillia says \"you sure know how to embarass you're daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's true, slow dances are the best becuase they get you close to a girl and create a good mood for a kiss\" you say. Cecillia gently pushes you over with one finger and says \"Dear I think you should stop, otherwise Lucy's gonna faint from all the blood in her head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok fine\" you reply. Everyone quickly finishes and Lucy's quickly standing behind you and says \"Dad i'm ready for my lessons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecillia i'm gonna need you're help with this\" you say as Lucy offers you a claw which you climb onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you'll be fine just guide her as best as you can\" Cecillia says. Lucy moves you onto her palm and runs upstairs to her room shutting the door behind her. She slowly lowers a claw and you do you're best to teach you're daughter the dance. You first go over the steps with her and then you tell her to move her claw up right near you. You grab onto the it and she almost moves back, startled that you'd grab right onto her claw and pretty much hug it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, woah\" you yell getting her to stop \"do not pull back, at this size that could result in some very serious injury, and i'd really rather not hear you hurt someone especially if you like them\" you say. She calms down and you guide her step by step through the dance counting \"1,2,3.\" You dance for a good 15 minutes with you're daughter before letting go and bowing to her. \"That's the waltz, you did really well Lucy\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad\" she says gently kissing the spot where you are on her palm. \"Glad I could help\" you say, \"although will I ever meet this boy?\" you ask wondering what the guy is like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....well he doesn't even know I like him yet\" Cecillia says fidgeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then tell him, I mean it should be easy for the girl to confess, it's not like you can't just walk off into a corner or something\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, but what if he rejects me\" Lucys says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then he's a damn fool to reject such a wonderful girl as you\" you say, \"hey you're other boyfriend was ok after he rejected you right?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes he was Dad, don't worry\" Lucy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well where does this guy live?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um about a 5 minute walk from here\" Lucys says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well since it's summer, you might as well go see him right now\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't Dad, i'm so nervous, what if he doesn't like dragons, what if\" Lucy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucy, settle down, if you're that worried about it i'll come with you\" you say.</span></div></div>",

Lucy smiles and heads downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom i'm going to Jamie's house and i'm taking Dad with me\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take good care of him\" Cecillia yells back. Lucy puts you down on a table and puts on a pair of track shoes designed for a dragon, She picks you up again and heads outside, she walks for a while but soon starts jogging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were on the track team\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you never really asked\" Lucy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that I know, you should tell me when you have a race so I can come watch\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww that's sweet dad but you don't need to come watch, i'm actually the slowest on the team\" Lucy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, doesn't mean I can't support my daughter\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....look we're here\" she says and you look up and see a normal townhouse. Lucy jogs up to the door and knocks with her free hand, a vixen wearing a scarlet read dress that's about Cecillia's height opens the door and says \"hi Lucy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mrs.Conners is Jamie in?\" Lucy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes he is\" she replies, she looks down and notices you \"afternoon Alex\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afternoon\" you reply, not knowing her first name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you here to watch over you're daughter?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I am, she kind of has cold feet\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's good, i'm glad you and Cecillia got together during high school, you 2 were driving me insane with you're dilly-dallying\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't rush true love\" you reply smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem if we can come in Mrs.Conners\" Lucy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes yes come in, you'll find Jamie upstairs at his computer\" Mrs.Conners says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\" Lucy says entering the house, she walks quickly up the stairs and heads directly for one room telling you she had been here before. She opens the door and you look around, you just notice a bed, desk, and a figure hunched over a computer set up in the far corner of the room. Lucy slowly walks forward and you see the figure turn around, you smile as you see the guy he reminded you a lot of yourself when you were younger. Average sized kid with glasses, somewhat tall, he seemed somewhat tired but you saw that familiar spark of inquisition in his eyes. Lucy walks forward and sits down on the floor facing the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Jamie\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Lucy, what are you doing here?\" Jamie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually i'd like you to meet someone\" she says. She plucks you off her palm with 2 fingers and places you down in front of the boy \"this is my dad\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mr.dragontale, what are you doing here?\" Jamie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well you know nothing much just came to check out the guy my daughter has a crush on\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad\" Lucy yells, you see Jamie turn a faint shade of red as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine you tell him then\" you say stepping back and to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy leans forward till the end of her snout is pretty much poking Jamie in the chest. \"Um Jamie....I welll.....my dad kind of wrecked it but I like you\" she says smiling. You see Jamie grow even redder \"well that's great Lucy because I like you too, I fell for you the moment I saw you, you just looked so elegant with you're silver scales and I always thought you're wings were cute, and...\" he trails off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't this nice, you two like each other, so Lucy you gonna ask him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie looks at Lucy in confusion and she says quietly \"um would you like to dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I can't hear you?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to dance?\" Lucy yells.<br>\r\n'<br>\r\n\"Sure but we haven't taken dance classes yet\" Jamie says. Lucy lowers her palm and Jamie climbs on. \"Actually that's why my dad's here\" she says raising him up to face level \"he's here to supervise because he was my teacher\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well what a coincidence, my mom was the one who taught me\" he says smiling. You feel footsteps and you look over and see Mrs.Conners in the doorway \"well aren't you 2 just a lovely pair\" she says standing there. She walks into the room and sits down next to you, \"well show us how much you're learned\" she says. Mrs.Conners lowers a paw to you and you climb on, she holds you up so you can see. You both sit there and watch Lucy and Jamie waltz for a half an hour before you hear a beeping sound. \"Oh sorry that's my phone\" Lucy says, she reaches into a pocket and pulls a silver phone out of a pocket and hits the talk button before holding it up to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....ahuh.....he's with me.....I guess if it's really important.....no that isn't important look i'm kind of busy right now.......fine i'll bring him home\" she says. She shuts the phone and puts it back in her pocket. \"Sorry Jamie that was my younger sister she wants me to bring Dad home right now\" she says looking kind of sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey don't end it becuase of me i'm sure Mrs.Conners would be more then happy to take me home\" you say. You see Lucy instantly brighten up and Mrs.Conners says \"do you kids mind putting it on hold for a minute or 2 while I run him home?\" they both shake their heads and Mrs.Conners stands up. She walks downstairs still holding you in one paw, she opens the door and shuts it, she stares down at you somewhat angrily and says \"ok who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look I don't know who you are but all my close friends call me vixi, and you don't smell like Alex normally does, you don't smell dragoney enough\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Augh so she can smell that well\" you say, \"look I really don't want to explain this\" you continue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"You better start explaining yourself fast or else down the hatch you go\" Vixi says snarling. \"Ok ok, I am Cecillia's husband, i'm just from a different reality, one where women aren't titanic sized animals, you're victoria right. You're Cecillia's best friend that kept trying to hook me and her up all through high school, even going so far as trying to seduce me once to get her jealous\" you say. Vixi turns a bright shade of red \"how did you know that, are you some weird stalker or something\" she says getting even angrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I just might be telling the truth, now could you please take me back, that was probably Jillian wanting a rematch already\" you say. She just stands there and keeps staring at you with a snarl on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Vixi if you don't believe me fine, kill me, eat me, whatever but you're the one who's going to have to deal with their suffering\" you say. \"Oh and no offense but if Jamie makes Lucy cry I will personally make sure he regrets it\" you say sitting down. You feel her tongue against you're back and think \"well I guess i'm dead\" but she just knocks you over with it. She looks down at you with a sad look in her eyes and she pushes against you with her nose. \"You really are Alex, only he would stand up for his family like that to me, heck it was why I couldn't seduce him\" Vixi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad you believe me but can we head back already, I know Jillian will be getting impatient and Lucy and you're son will probably be getting impatient too\" you say. Vixi starts walking and says \"i'm sorry, I was going to hurt you and you were telling me the truth, so how did it happen?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, you also have no idea how weird it is to wake up sleeping on a 6 mile tall dragoness or well talk to a 6 mile tall anthro vixen for that matter\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's different about you're reality\" Vixi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well women are the same species and same height as males, the earth is probably smaller too\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to tell Cecillia what I did?\" Vixi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you had mostly every right to do what you did, the whole eating thing not so much\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please don't tell her\" Vixi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I won't, but if Lucy ever does get married to Jamie I want you to watch over her\" you say. \"Deal\" Vixi replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna tell anyone i'm not the Alex you know are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't but I know atleast one other person has a strong enough nose to sniff you out\" Vixi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixi walks the the rest of the way back in silence, she opens the door and you see a silvery blur speed down the stairs......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Daddy\" Mary yells running up to Vixi, she holds her hands out expectantly and you're transfered from one palm to another. \"So what did you and Daddy talk about Mrs.Conners?\" Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing much dear just our time in high school\" Vixi replies winking at you. Mary shrugs and runs upstairs to her room being very careful not to drop you, she sits down on the bed and puts the first Harry Potter book in front of you. You start reading it to her and for a while she stares down intently until you get to the part about Voldemort killing Harry's parents. Mary wrapped one clawed finger around you and gently gave you a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary what's wrong?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's scary, Voldemort's not a very nice man is he?\" Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no he isn't but don't worry Mary i'd never let him hurt you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then he'll get you like he got Harry's parents\" Mary says slightly scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think Cecillia would let him\" you say smiling. Mary however wasn't convinced and for the next hour as you read to her she kept one finger wrapped around you giving a squeeze every so often when it reached a scarier part. Finally she tries to hide behind you very much unsucessfully but she pushes you over with her nose. \"Mary are you scared?\" you ask her already knowing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not i'm a big girl\" she says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary you are a big girl but it's ok to be scared\" you say patting one of the scales on her finger. She nods and says \"daddy can we stop for a bit, i'm scared\" you nod and jump onto her finger. Mary closes the book and brings you up to her cheek. You walk up and kiss one of her scales \"i'm so proud of my girl, being so brave\" you say. Mary giggles and gently hugs you to her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dad what was you're other family like?\" Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're shocked that she asked \"they were the same as you all except more my size\" you say smiling. \"Jillian was still kind of tomboyish, Lucy was a very refined young lady and you were still my \"little\" angel\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more you're big angel\" Mary says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so you have to watch over you're little Dad ok Mary\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Dad\" Mary says. She lays down and just stares at you for a bit, \"Dad why are you and all the other guys so small compared to us girls?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, it does have a lot of disadvantages but the advantages greatly outweigh them\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's so much more of my little girl to love\" you say patting one of her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're silly Dad\" Mary says while giggling. She lifts you up and places you down on her head near one of her ears. \"Dad I have an an itch can you scratch it for me?\" Mary asks. You walk up to her ear and start scratching, she lowers it and you climb up till you reach the tip which took a few minutes. You scratch the tip of her ear and you hear Mary sigh, you scratch for a good minute before Mary plucks you off her ear and puts you down on her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey if you could reach why didn't you get it?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted you to get it Dad, you always take such good care of us\" Mary says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you say while sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad can we play house again?\" Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure although can we use some smaller toys this time\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mr.Fluffers is you're daughter and you will love her\" Mary says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just called it Mr.Fluffers\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine she's Mrs.Fluffers now\" Mary says. You sigh and spend the next half an hour playing with Mary and the new Mrs.Fluffers. Everything went very well, although you think Mary might have taken things a bit too far as she had you kiss you're 'daughter.' Mary smiles and giggles as you kiss the rabbit doll, \"Dad you're so funny, you didn't actually have to kiss her\" Mary says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could have told me that before\" you say. Mary giggles again and picks you up, she runs downstairs holding you tightly you assume looking for Cecilia.  Mary finds her in the living room watching tv and she runs up to her. Cecillia smiles as Mary runs up \"Where's you're father?\" she asks. Mary holds her hands out and Cecillia smiles as she sees you. \"Hello Darling did you take good care of Mary?\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was more the other way around\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He took good care of me, he protected me when I was scared\" Mary says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you such a good father\" Cecillia says picking you up and placing you down on her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't much\" you say as it wasn't. Mary sits down next to Cecillia and lays down next to her mother using her lap as a pillow. You smile and you sit back, you hear Mary's breathing slow down and she's soon asleep. You feel a tap on you're back and you look up at Cecillia who's smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dear?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad I finally got some time to be with you, you've spent some much time with the girls lately i've only seen you during meals and bedtime\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such is the life of a father\" you say smiling. Cecillia gently knocks you over with one finger and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well it's also a husbands job to watch over his wife\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's true\" you say and you see a smile cross her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then how about I hire a babysitter tomorrow and you and me can go out and enjoy ourselves\" Cecillia says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I mean I really should see as much of the girls as I can before school starts\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you care so much for the girls but you shouldn't neglect you're wife\" Cecillia says knocking you over again. Cecillia lifts you up to her face and picks you  up before gently kissing you, she smiles as she pulls you off her lip then she licks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech why do you keep doing that?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tells others that you're mine\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might need to do that a bit more, I apparently don't smell dragoney enough\" you say. \"Oh crap\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that hunnie\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Vixi found out about me after there was an \"ahem\" incident\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of incident?\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say i'm really glad I was able to convince her who I was\" you say. Cecillia frowns and starts to get up \"No, no no, Cecillia I promised her I wouldn't let you know\" you say and she sits back down making sure not to wake Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she threatened to eat me but I got everything resolved\" you say. Cecillia looks down at you shocked before hugging you to her cheek, \"i'm so glad you're ok\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am too, Vixi said there was someone else who'd be able to sniff me out do you know who that might be\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheryll since she's a wolf she'd probably be able to sniff you out\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean Cheryll the bookworm, the girl who spent more time in the library then anywhere else?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's kind of funny\" Cecillia says. She lays down on the couch so that Mary was still sleeping somewhat in her lap and she puts you down on her chest. \"Since you'd down there can you give rub my tummy?\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try\" you reply. You lay down and stroke her stomach through the white dress, much to you're suprise it wasn't covered with scales all you felt was soft flesh. \"Guess they really are like dragons\" you say. You rub Cecillia's stomach for a good half hour and you hear her sigh the whole time probably stifling herself when she wanted to let out a more audible sound as Mary was nearby till you hear a sound.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You heard footsteps coming downstairs and Cecillia lifts her head up. She picks you up and you see Jillian come down the stairs and Cecillia tries to shush her \"Jillian be quiet Mary's sleeping\" she whispers quickly. Jillian keeps walking down but softer and she looks at Cecillia, \"do you know where dad is?\" she asks. \"He's right here with me hunnie\" Cecillia says holding you up for her to see. Jillian runs forward \"mom do you mind if I borrow dad for a bit?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" Cecillia says sighing, she places you in Jillian's outstretched hands and Jillian smiles down at you before turning around and quickly but silently running upstairs. She runs into her room and shuts the door, \"well up for our rematch Dad\" she says. \"Sure\" you say but instead of heading for the TV Jillian heads for her bed, \"um Jillian didn't you want a rematch?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you already showed you can beat me in video games\" Jillian says, she puts you down on the bed and says while smiling \"so now we're going to play something else.\" You really didn't like her smile it looked too weird, she reached under the bed and pulls out what looks like a blowtorch. \"Um Jillian what are you doing with that?\" you ask the fear showing on you're face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my real dad, you're just some replacement, so maybe if I get rid of you, he'll come back\" Jillian says lighting the torch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...now let's not be hasty, even if that does work, how is that fair, my family will be left without a father\" you say backing up as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care, I just want my dad back\" she says her face filled with sadness. She moves forward and you can easily feel the heat from the torch. \"Jillian, stop\" you yell in the most authoritative tone you can muster. Much to you're suprise she does, \"now shut that off and put it down\" you say in the same tone and she still does as told although you weren't sure why. She stands there looking at you like she's waiting for an order, \"explain yourself\" you say standing there arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I just.. I wanted Dad back, you're not him, you'll never be him\" Jillian yells before getting up and running out of the room and you heard her feet on the stairs. You fall back the fear finally setting in \"holy shit I just about died\" you think to yourself as you lay there. In a minute Cecillia was in the doorway, \"Alex are you ok\" she asks seeing you laying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peachy\" you reply, \"oh and you might want to look on the floor\" you say. Cecillia walks in and looks down and notices the torch, she picks it up \"why is this here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jillian thought if she got rid of me you're version would come back\" you say still laying there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Cecilia asks shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jillian thought if I died then the switch would reverse and you'd get you're version of me back\" you say. Cecilia looks down at you still shocked \"so wait Jillian just tried to kill you\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less, but she stopped when I said, which I think says she's confused and scared\" you say but you're words seemed to fall on deaf ears. Cecilia looked pissed, but not normal pissed. she looked like well i'm a mother dragon and you just messed with my eggs kind of pissed. \"Jillian\" she yells although it was more of a roar than a yell, you heard footsteps and you see Jillian poke her head in \"y.y.yes Mom\" she says literally shaking from fear. \"Come here, you're father's told me an interesting story, care to elaborate\" Cecilia says. Jillian slowly walks forward and looks down \"he's not my dad\" she mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not my dad, he might seem to be the same person but he didn't see me be born, or grow up, or anything\" Jillian says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jillian that does not give you the right to do what you tried to do\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it does, if he's gone then Dad might come back, and even if it doesn't atleast we won't have this fake\" she says indicating you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jillian take that back\" Cecillia yells and it soon becomes a yelling match between the 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\" you yell and both stop and look at you. \"Cecillia she has a point, I didn't see her be born, grow up, or anything a normal father sees, I saw my daughter be born and grow up, and you know what you're the god damn exact same being\" you say. \"Jillian, you're just scared, and you feel hurt right now, you're father was a big part of you're life and you're worried if i'm not, you won't be able to hang on without that support\" you say. Both of them stare at you shocked, \"what, i'm really small not stupid\" you say. Jillian just stares at you for a bit before slowly walking forward, she stares down at you and kneels before scooping you up to her cheek. \"Dad\" she says rubbing you against her cheek \"i'm sorry\" she says starting to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shhh, Jillian just let it all out, you've been a strong enough girl to hold it in this long, so just let it all out\" you say stroking one of her scales. Jillian cries her heart out for the next 5 minutes, you felt Cecillia wrap her arms around her daughter and you just stayed up against Jilian's cheek trying to soothe her. Slowly she stops and lifts you away from her a bit \"why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why what?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I just tried to kill you, shouldn't you hate me, you don't owe us anything\" Jillian says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could hate you, I could just leave as I actually don't owe you anything, but you know what i'm not going to. I need you as much as you need me, besides I love you all and what kind of father would I be if I just left\" you say. Cecillia smiles at you and gently picks you up \"that's my mate\" she says gently rubbing against you. You turn to face Jillian \"well? are you ok with me now, because i'd really rather not have something like this happen again\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes dad\" Jillian says. You smile and Cecillia puts you down on Jillian's snout. You run it's length although it took a bit and you kiss and hug the area between her eyes \"Jillian I love you, in any form, don't ever forget that ok?\" you say. You were sure Jillian smiled as her snout moved and she gently picks you up and puts you down in her palm, \"don't worry dad I won't\" she says smiling at you. \"Thanks, now if you don't mind, I think that was just a bit much for me\" you say and you pass out. You wake up to see Cecillia looking down at you concerned, \"are you ok?\" she asks as she sees you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yeah, just overwhelmed by the the mind-numbing fear of death and knowing how small I really am\" you say. Cecillia still looking concerned lifts you up saying you were in her hand, \"I have a proposal\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hear it\" you say sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want you to leave my sight, you are to stay under my supervision and on me at all times\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecillia i'm a grown man, I'm sorry but I humbly have to decline\" you say. Cecillia gently lifts you up \"oh and how are you gonna stop me\" she says placing you down on her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't\" you say standing there looking up at her, \"but why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? you're own daughter tried to kill you\" Cecilia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Key word is try\" you reply. \"I'd love to be with you every moment of every day, but I think even i'd probably get a little tired of it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but I don't want to lose you\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't, now do you trust me?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

You motion and she moves you over to her cheek, you lean over and kiss her on the cheek \"thanks hot stuff\" you say. Cecillia turns as the doorbell rings, she nods, puts you down on her shoulder and smiles at you \"thanks\" she says before you head downstairs. Cecillia opens the door and you freeze as standing in the doorway is a timber wolf in a douty outfit, spectacles, and an upturned smile on her mouth. \"Cheryll\" Cecillia says happily, \"hello Cecillia\" Cheryll replies, and she turns to you. She sniffs once and starts growling \"who are you\" she says visibly irritated as her fur was standing on end. \"Cecillia's husband, you're Cheryll the bookworm, more accustomed to the library then anywhere else\" you reply. Taking an educated guess from an experience you had, \"and I saw you're panties once in 10th grade as you tried to dodge me and tripped spilling books everywhere\" you continue. Cheryll freezes and she visibly flares red \"how, how did you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Educated guess, look this will sound crazy but I am her husband\" you say pointing to Cecillia, \"just not from a dimension where women are 6 mile high animal people\" you say. Cheryll much to you're suprise nods, \"that makes sense, you don't smell dragoney enough\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....You believed that?\" you ask stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It makes sense, no one but him would know about that incident, although just to prove it what type were they?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pink with little ducks on em\" you reply and she flares even brighter, \"alright you really are legit\" she says. You heave a sigh of relief, \"so why'd you show up?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well it's Vixi's birthday on Saturday and we're holding a party at my place at 6:00 and I thought i'd invite you 2 over\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Cheryll\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone with as good a nose as you 2 gonna be there?\" you ask, \"i'm getting sick of explaining this to people\" you say. Cheryll thinks ofr a second, \"No I don't think so, but maybe call Vixi and have her explain it to everyone including the kids, might be worthwhile\" she says. You nod and Cecillia smiles, \"thanks Cheryll, we'll be there\" she says before shutting the door. She turns to face you, \"so what's this about you seeing her panties? and why pray tell do you remember what they look like\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember because i'm a guy, heck the panties you were wearing when we first met were yellow with 2 strings in bows holding them up\" you say. Cecillia flares red, \"how, how did you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw my wife's by accident, he probably just had to look up to see them, look it's just something us guys remember, as for the incident well I could describe my version, not really sure what happened with yours\" you say. Cecillia looks down at you and sighs, \"fine you're off the hook for now, but there better not be any other incidents you haven't told me about\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as those were the only 2 you could remeber.\"Yeah there's nothing\" you say, Cecillia walks around and you find Mary still asleep on the couch. Cecillia puts you down on her cheek and you lean down and kiss her \"aren't you just a big cutie\" you saw stroking one of her scales. Cecilla leaves to go find Jillian and you heard the front door open, \"i'm home\" Lucy yells. \"In here\" you yell and Lucy runs into the room, she spots you on Mary's cheek and gently picks you up, \"ooh thank you dad\" she says lifting you up and smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything went well I take it\" you say. Lucy nods and sighs, \"oh it was wonderful, we were in perfect armony, our class is gonna be so suprised when fall comes around\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good the kid's okay\" you sigh in relief, \"what you thought i'd hurt him\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I thought I wasn't a very good dance teacher\" you reply. Lucy laughs \"dad you're a great teacher as soon as Vixi came back she applauded us and smiled although something she said was weird, she said \"good thing this one's as good a teacher\", why would she say that?\" Lucy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no big thing, she just knows is all, as well as an old friend of mine from high school\" you say. Lucy looks down at you worried, \"you're ok right, come on let me see\" she says pulling at you're clothes. \"Hey, hey\" you say pushing her claw back, \"Lucy i'm fine, that and i'm you're father I really don't want you seeing anything of that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on dad we've had sex ed, it's not like I haven't seen it all before, at a size I can actually see it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't care, that's a hands off area\" you say. She giggles and starts pulling again, \"Lucy stop\" you say somewhat growling. She does and you point to the stairwell \"put me down and upstairs to you're room, you need 5 minutes to settle down\" you say. She looks down at you shocked, and you're shocked as like Jillian she obeys and puts you down on the table and walks upstairs and you hear her door shut. Mary at this time stirs and looks at you, \"hi daddy\" she says wiping sleep from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mary\" you reply, Mary picks you up and cuddles you against her cheek, she stays down on the couch and lets you sit on her cheek. In a few minutes Cecillia comes back with Jillian \"I found her in the backyard\" she says before the each sit in a chair. In another minute Lucy comes downstairs and sits down next to Mary, \"where were you?\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad sent me to my room\" she says pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, what for?\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Invasion of personal space\" you reply not wanting to elaborate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Mary asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means.....she was bugging me\" you say really not sure how to explain. Cecillia stands up and picks you up in her palm, \"if you'll excuse us, we need to have a talk\" she says. Cecillia walks out the back door and shuts it, she sits down and looks down at you \"what do you mean invasion of personal space?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She pulled on my pants twice, first time was to check on me because I told her about Vixi and then Cheryll knowing who I was, but then I don't know\" you say. Cecillia looks down at you and laughs, \"hey this isn't funny\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is, it's not like she could see anything\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bull, crap, you can see me just fine\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we can't, you're all just little dots\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's my eye color?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hazel of course\" Cecillia says before stopping \"damn, you got me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so why is this supposed to not be a big deal?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...you see back when dragon men atleast were the same size as women, that's kind of how we learned, we observed our fathers and brothers, and that's in a small part still taught in schools, I kind of did it to my dad\" Cecillia says flaring red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecillia walks back inside and you find Lucy waiting there, she looks down \"um...Dad, i'm sorry about what I did\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh \"Lucy as long as you don't do it again\" you say. She smiles and you're passed over and she gently kisses you, you move to have her lift you up to her ears \"oh yeah and tell me when you're sisters take sex ed, I would really rather not go through that again\" you whisper. Lucy lifts you back and nods before giving you back to Cecillia.</span></div></div>",

Cecillia laughs \"you can leave for the party any time she wants, but if you actually want to get there within the year you'll just have to wait a few minutes\" she says. You sigh and sit back \"sorry, it's just that this is my first time doing this and I'm kind of nervous\" you say. Cecillia finally puts the earring on and lowers a hand which you climb onto and she lifts you up \"there's nothing to be worried about, you'll be fine, you don't think I'd let anything happen to you? Now do you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, but still\" you say, one of her claws curls around you pushing you against her finger \"It'll be alright\" she says gently, you nod and she smiles \"well now that that's settled, how do I look?\" she asks holding her hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile, Cecillia looked beautiful wearing a pure white dress that cascaded down to her feet, she smiled down at you \"you look beautiful Cecillia, a better looking dragoness doesn't exist\" you say. She giggles and lifts her hand up to her shoulder gently depositing you on it \"thanks, although you could have gone a little less heavy on the shmooze\" she says starting to walk downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I don't shmooze, I tell the truth\" you reply. She giggles and smiles as she sees Lucy \"alright now we're trusting you to take care of the house while we're away, make sure that Mary gets to bed on time alright?\" Cecillia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course mom, you and dad have a good time at the party\" Lucy replies. She leans over and you pat the front of her snout \"be good and remember there's money for pizza just in case you need it\" you say. Lucy nods and steps back and Mary runs up and gets a hug from Cecillia before the 2 oof you head out the door. The night air was cool and felt quite good, \"good thing we have the same body type\" you say as Cecillia walks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it'd be kind of funny if you didn't fit in the suit\" Cecillia replies. You can't help but nod \"so I know Vixi apparently told everyone, but do you really think she did, I mean she did know how to keep a secret\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She told everyone, especially since I told her that you blabbed on her\" Cecillia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!!\" you shout and Cecillia stopped and held her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, just because your small doesn't mean that still doesn't hurt\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but why'd you tell her? She's going to kill me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she won't, it's her birthday\" Cecillia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is true, is it still murder if a girl kills a guy?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is\" Cecillia replies sounding quite shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the grave question it's just kind of tough, it's only been a little more then a week since I came here and I haven't really had any good memorable moments with anyone save for you and the girls\" you say. Cecillia stops for a second and ever so gently pats you on the head \"Vixi's very nice and you know she won't hold something like that against you\" she says. You nod and look up as the 2 of you had made it to Vixi's house, loud music blared out an open window and Vixi answered the door after Cecillia knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you two, glad you could make it\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vixi......so look I'm sorry that I kind of blabbed to Cecillia\" you say looking down. You were suprised as Vixi laughed \"I didn't actually expect you to keep your mouth shut, I mean she's the one you trust most right? Stuck in a weird place with only one being to turn too of course you'll tell them\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you have no problems?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixi shakes her head \"just forget about it, get your butts in here your letting the cold in\" she says. Cecillia walked inside and you were surprised, the house looked totally different covered in streamers and balloons, much more festive which was a good thing. Cecillia walked over to a punch bowl and scooped some up into a glass \"want some?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, how?\" you reply. Cecillia smiles \"you probably won't like it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecillia I don't think I'll mind\" you reply. She looks at you and smiles \"alright\" she says 2 claws pinching together on your back you were hoisted up and she carefully lowered you to above the drink \"just dunk your head in\" she says. You looked up at her titanic form for a second before plunging your head into the drink and drinking your fill, you were then carefully lifted back up Cecillia's shoulder and she downed the whole cup in one gulp. \"Ok I really don't think I'll ever get used to seeing that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw come on it's not that bad\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To me you just swallowed a small town or an entire lake in one gulp\" you reply, she stares down at you stunned then giggles \"well you better not make me mad then\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even joke about that\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" she says, you nod up at her \"it's alright just you know jokes like that kind of stop my heart for a few seconds\" you say and she smiles down at you \"no more jokes like that\" she replies. You turned as someone coughed and so did Cecillia and soon you were facing a bird anthro  in a very tight fitting outfit who smiled at the both of you. You quickly searched your mind trying to remember who this bird might be. She smiles at the 2 of you \"well it has been a while, when was the last time we saw each other, probably was when I went up against the lovely Cecillia in the beauty pageant and lost\" she says her voice becoming more and more menacing as she continued. You froze as you knew exactly who this was now, and so did Cecillia as you felt her slowly move you closer and closer to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet so lovely to see you again\" Cecillia says smiling at the bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cecillia you seem to be doing well\" Janet replies smiling one of those wicked smiles only a total bitch of a person can pull off. Thankfully or less so you seemed to be totally forgotten as the 2 women faced each other. \"So you seem to have done well, getting yourself a family, 3 girls and a wonderful husband. Oh wait that's right, this isn't your husband\" Janet says pointing at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea what your talking about\" Cecillia replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't play dumb\" Janet all but hisses \"Vixi told everyone that this isn't your real husband and some sort of clone or something, I wasn't really paying attention as it involved you\" she says staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh \"look Janet can you stop being such a bitch, just becuase I rejected you and went with Cecillia to the homecoming dance doesn't mean you have to be so vindictive\" you say. Janet stares at you stunned \"how, how did you...\" \"simple, I am her husband but as Vixi said, I'm from another universe, where women are a bit....smaller, now seriously Janet can you just stop already I'm sorry but I like Cecillia, not you\" you say. Janet just stares at you stunned \"I...I\" she turns and runs away without finishing and you sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly just happened?\" Cecillia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell from my experience Janet sincerely liked me back in high school, but I chose you over her, seems she still kind of carries a flame for me after all this time\" you say.</span></div></div>",

You also hear a sound like a small car engine running all around you, so you sit up and look around. All you can see around you is white and you swear you can see some large shape off in the distance. You get up and walk around you're \"bed\" starting to get annoyed that you can't seem to find you're way out and the engine noise is still running. \"This is probably the guys pranking me, covering my room in white carpet and sitting outside in Dave's chevy\" you think to yourself. You start rubbing the \"carpet\" trying to follow it to an end and you hear the engine sound increase. \"Geez I have no idea how Kyra is sleeping thorugh this, she's probably in on the joke\" you think to yourself. The engine sound hits a peak and you feel the whole area shake, you grab onto part of the carpet and just stare in awe as a clawed finger the size of a small skyscraper descends toward you. You close you're eyes and feel yourself pushed back, yet you're not dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure know how to wake a girl up\" you hear the voice come from above you. It sounded like you're fiancee Kyra but yet there was a humbling tone in the voice. You feel yourself knocked over and then lifted up by the massive finger and when you open you're eyes you're looking at a giant feline face. The feline in front of you yawns revealing a cavernous mouth with stalactite sized teeth and a tongue to match. The feline just stares at you before saying \"you're sure being quiet this morning, I know i'm a beauty but you don't have to go speechless everytime you see me.\" You smile as that comment confirmed that this gigantic feline was you're fiancee.</span></div></div>",

You're mind was racing at top speed, you're fiancee even though she seemed to be the same, over night had become a gigantic feline although you always had a thing for anthros this was a bit weird. You're startled out of you're thoughts when you feel her lean over and gently push against you. You turn toward her and are gently pushed back into her pad as she gives you a kiss. You don't give any resistance as she obviously knew what she was doing since you weren't dead, you kiss back as she was you're fiancee and she moves back a bit and giggles. Her tongue snakes out and she gives you a quick lick getting you from head to toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You more awake now?\" she asks you still staring down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess\" you reply, she lays back down, snuggling you against her furry breasts and she gives off a contented sigh as she does this like you being there was doing something, she then puts you down on her stomach. \"Could you rub my tummy some more?\" Kyra asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure whatever you want kitten\" you say starting to warm up to the situation, \"This doesn't seem too bad\" you thought. You start rubbing the fur in front of you and Kyra starts lightly purring telling you what that engine sound you heard before was. \"So what time is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh about 10:00am my little treat\" Kyra replies. You weren't totally comfortable with being called a little treat. \"Could we change the nickname Kyra, no offense but i'm a little uncomfortable with it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry, I forgot you almost ended up in my sandwich last night\" she says nonchalantly. You freeze and she just stares at you for a sec, you then proceed to lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I have to be brought here, why did my fiancee turn into a giant feline, why why why\" you start saying to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hunnie are you alright?\" Kyra asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i'm not alright, over night my whole world's turned upside down, my fiancee's a titanic cat, i'm small enough comparativley to be a kitty treat and I don't what's what anymore\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you puzzled \"What do you mean, are you unhappy with me?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but last night I remember falling asleep next to my normal sized fiancee in my normal sized bed, now I wake up and my fiancee's atleast a mile tall\" you say sitting down and holding you're head in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weird because I remember falling asleep to my normal sized fiancee yesterday too\" she says smiling a mischevious smile at you. You knew Kyra liked to play pranks on you that's why you suspected her to be in on the joke but this was a bit much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember everything?\" you ask. She nods in reply, and smiles again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then why did you say that?\" you yell at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see her ears droop and her tail which had been swishing from side to side stopped moving, \"I thought it would be fun to mess with you a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyra no offense but this is no laughing matter\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know I always wondered what it'd be like if you were this small\" she says giggling, she gently pushes you over with one finger and pins you. \"You always were so cute but now you're even cuter\", she says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're totally ok with this? how large are you anyways\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently picks you up and looks at you,\"i'd estimate my height at 6 miles\" she says smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't beleive this\" you say, \"I mean i'm happy that there's more of you to love but this is gonna be hard to adjust to\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't think it's so bad, I mean i'm already adjusted\" she says gently kissing you again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well good for you, I'm the one stuck at the size of a speck\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww is someone feeling a little cut down to size\" Kyra says snickering, you just glare at her. \"I guess you aren't the big man of the house\" she says starting to really laugh. \"You really ended up with the short stick\" she says starting to laugh so hard she has to hold onto her sides. She flings her arm up and you go flying straight at the bed, \"i'm going to die\" is all you think as you hurtle toward the pillow yet you just hit it with a small whump sound. Kyra quickly runs up, \"are you ok?\" she asks with concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, i'm not hurt\" you say standing up, \"although i'm pretty sure if I hadn't hit the pillow i'd be dead\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry\" she says gently picking you up and giving you a smooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can forgive you Kyra, I mean you've gone from scaring the life out of me to almost killing me in the span of a few minutes\" you say. She places you down on one of her breasts and proceeds to curl up around you making sure not to hurt you, she then begins to purr. You turn away from her and say \"no Kyra, no matter how cute you are i'm not sure I can forgive you, this is kind of a big deal\" you say. She lays like this for a while before you hear a sniffling sound come from behind you. \"Kyra that isn't going to work\" you say sitting there until you are hit by a gian tear knocking you over. You look up and even though tears are streaming down her fur she stays curled around you. Sighing you say \"Kyra, please stop crying, I was just a little mad since this is kind of a lot to take in\" you say. Slowly the tears stop and she just stares at you for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i'm not in trouble?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're still in trouble, you still scared the living daylights out of me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently lifts you up and places you down on the bed and just stands on her front paws looking down at you. Then she licks you repeatedly, \"better?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" you reply, prompting her to kiss the spot where you are on the bed 10 times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Kyra i'll get over this, but right now I just need some time to think\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But while you're thinking you're still mad at me and I don't want that\" she says in a whiney cat voice. You just sit there and she nudges you're back with her nose, you just ignore it but she keeps doing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not helping...\" you turn around and say but trail off as she's looking at you with those big pleading eyes cats make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I forgive you\" you say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay\" she yells scooping you up she gives you another kiss before dropping back on the bed, she places you down on one of her breasts and says \"You have free reign over me for the next little while as payback.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok well there's one thing I want you to do for me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what?\" she replies<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to go take a shower\" you say. You see her freeze up as you say this, \"guess there's more cat in her then I thought\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But....but... you have to get wet when taking a shower\" she meows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my request Kyra are you going to do it?\" you ask smiling now that you finally had a chance for revenge. She picks you up and places you down on the sink counter and you walk up to a discolored part of the tile which you soon figure out by touching it is a glass door. You open it and find out it's you're shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok i'm going to have a shower at the same time, but if I don't hear yours you're in a lot of trouble\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and what are you going to do about it\" she says staring down at you and even giving a little puff pushing you backwards for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No rubs or scratches period\" you say. Instantly she jumps into her shower stall and you smile knowing you had some kind of leverage, although you hoped you wouldn't need to use it. You enter you're own shower and start it, however you don't hear anything else. You stick you're head out and see Kyra silently trying to escape the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back in there\" you say, she walks back into the stall and you know she started the shower as you hear a yowling sound. You take you're shower and find a small stack of towels in a little alcove. You exit you're stall to find Kyra standing there dripping wet and looking somewhat miserable but she grabs a hair dryer and quickly dries herself off and she looks a lot better and happier after that. She picks you up and hugs you, \"you're really fluffy Kyra, and really warm\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks, but you owe me so many tummy rubs for that\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you say, she walks back into the bedroom and puts you down on a small table next to her dresser, you find a mini dresser on the table and quickly put on a pair of pants and a plain white shirt. You turn and find her standing there in a white tank top and a small pair of shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good Kyra\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" she says, she picks you up and walks downstairs into a kitchen with a table the size of a small city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you down on the table and turns on a tv where a anthro tigress was standing and you noticed a little man standing on her shoulder. \"The weather will be sunny with a small chance of rain\" the tigress says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So ready for breakfast?\" Kyra asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you say</span></div></div>",

She walks up to the fridge and grabs the necesscary ingredients and places you down on the table. You notice a mini-table that you run up to and sit down at, Kyra quickly has the bacon and eggs ready and places a plate down. She looks around and grabs some weird device which had the word food on the side. It looked king of like a syringe, she placed one end in her bacon and placed the other part over you're mini plate and hit a button. The machine took an ample portion out of the bacon and transferred it over to you, she repeated the process with her eggs, and she just fills a cup that was you're size with a single drop of orange juice. You both dig in and the table is quiet for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food's as good as always Kyra\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, i'm glad you're enjoying it\" she replies. You quickly finish and drink you're fill of OJ before Kyra picks up the tiny glass and drinks the remaining drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great\" you say, walking closer to her, she turns and places her own dish on the counter before scooping you up. She walks into the living room and lays down on the couch, placing you down on her stomach. She gives you a gentle push with one finger and you start rubbing her belly. You soon have her purring up a storm and all you can do is smile, \"man this was not how I expected today to start but as suprises go I guess this one isn't so bad\" you think. Kyra picks you up and says \"I have an itch, would you mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scratching it, not at all kitten\" you say. She places you down on her back and you start rubbing getting ooh and aah sounds out of her as you hit some sweet spots. Finally you hit the spot she was talking about and she raises her rump into the air causing you to grab onto one of her hairs to keep from falling off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, lower it, lower it\" you say. She lowers her rump and you stand back up, \"sorry\" she says looking down at you. \"I'm sure, now try not to get too into it this time ok\" you say. You start rubbing the same itchy spot and all you can hear is her contented purring, you stop after 2 minutes and walk back to where she put you down, she picks you up between thumb and foreclaw before placing you down in her left palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you darling\" she says giving you a kiss. She lays back and nestles you into her fur just above her breasts and sits back against the couch ant turns the tv on. You sit there together and watch a show about relationships, although half way through the show stopped and it required Kyra to put in a valid credit card number. You spent the next half hour watching a very thorough walkthrough of how to have children and another half hour for more pleasurable things like snuggling, foreplay and even how to take a shower together. You both sit there afterwards and Kyra gives a little cough before saying \"well that was very informative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah kind of seems like it was made for us\" you say. You just lay back into the warm fur and gently stroke some of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what kind of things do you want to do?\" Kyra asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine with just sitting here for a while, is there anything my kitten wants to do\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I want to try a few of the things we saw in that show\" she says giving you a little nudge with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh like what? i'm pretty sure you don't want to get near water again Mrs. fraidy cat\" you say jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not a fraidy cat, it's just I have a problem with water is all\" she says, she picks you up and lowers you into her tank top \"besides I thought you could spend some time with my girls\". She closes the tank top, not giving you a chance to protest and you felt her sit back, you were surrounded by her chest which you were pretty sure comparativley were a lot bigger then a c-cup now. You walk up and look over her chest, you couldn't help but feel you're pants tighten a bit as just the nipples were bigger then you were. \"Hey let me out of here Kyra\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you give them a massage honey\" you hear her reply. Mumbling you walk up to the nearest one and start rubbing the soft flesh, instantly you hear a soft moaning come from outside. You put more force into it and you hear the moaning get a bit louder, after a minute Kyra reaches in and pushes you over to the other one. You rub for a few more minutes and she fishes you out and holds you in her palm. \"That felt great, better then when you were bigger\" Kyra says smiling with a flushed face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you enjoyed it\" you say sitting down but you look kind of downtrod. She lowers her face till she's really close to you, \"what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I feel kind of bad becuase I won't be able to help raise the kids as much as i'd like to, that and i'm not sure I can work with a computer when i'm smaller then the keys\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still have me\" Kyra says gently hugging you to her cheek. \"Thanks love\" you say giving her a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for my little guy\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you've warmed up to this so quickly\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I love this, except the whole aversion to water thing, but I can just lick myself clean\" Kyra says giving her arm a lick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well you got the good deal\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and having a city sized fiancee isn't a good deal?\" Kyra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess\" you say blushing a bit. Kyra picky you up and walks upstairs laying out on the bed she places you down on her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do you want to have the wedding?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you've been my fiance for a few months and that was only because I was saving for a ring, but since I won't be able to afford it now, there's no point in worry about it\" you say. You sit down and look up at her, \"Kyra I love you, even as a titanic cat, heck it makes you even cuter, so will you marry me?\" you say. She just looks down at you in shock, and you were worried for a bit since she didn't answer. \"Of course I will\" she yells, hugging you lightly then kissing her where you were about 5 times. She stands up and runs off, you hear a dial tone and then her saying \"hi Mom, I have big news.....no I didn't dump him,he just proposed. You'll what? pay for the wedding...oh mom thank you...if you can have it set for next sunday that would be great, thanks mom.\" Kyra walks in and just stares at you with a giant smile on her face, \"since you told you're mom the good news, can I call my parents?\" you ask. She carries you over to the phone and dials you're parents number. You hear you're mothers voice over the phone and say \"hi mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Alex, it's been nearly a year since you last called\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I just called to tell you i'm getting married to Kyra next sunday and I wanted you and dad to be there\" you say. You then have to cover you're ears as you're mom screams in joy, you hear you're dad come on and say \"we'll be there, just let you're brother know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call up you're twin, he agreed to come and you also learned in the 3 months since you last saw him he had gotten himself a fiancee named Carrie who was a 5 and a half mile tall dalmatian and that she'd be coming along as well. You then phoned up you're little brother who you found out was dating a fox and she'd be coming as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my family's all set\" you say. Kyra gently picks you up and carries you back over to the bed, she lays down and places you low on her stomach before giving you a little push towards her shorts. \"Hey what are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was just thinking you could use some practice\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be just fine, although I need you to go out and buy me a relationship video\" you say. Kyra goes out and buys one and you spend the next probably 2 hours watching the pro-creation part over and over because you wanted to be able to give the one you loved children and well you really didn't want to die while having sex. You then spend the next little while slowly acquianting yourself with the nuances of pro-creation with the kind of size difference and you learn that you were so small you were just able to walk in and even when she closed up you had comfortable room. Although only walked in as far as her hymen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You barely did anything\" she complains as you come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saving the real thing for our wedding night\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine, but it better be good\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will be I promise\" you say. She picks you up and places you on her head, you give each of her ears a good scratch as re-payment. Afterwards you just sit there happy as can be that you were finally getting married to the love of you're life.</span></div></div>",

You walk over to you're dresser and quickly get dressed in a black suit with a tie although you always hated the things. You look over and see Kyra wearing a traditional white wedding gown that went down to her paws. She notices you staring, and quickly moves forward covering you with one paw. \"It's bad luck to see the bride before the ceremony\" she says, picking you up and covering her paw. You feel her walk downstairs and out the front door, she gently drops you into you're tiny seat and you buckle yourself in and she starts the vehicle. \"Don't open you're eyes until we reach the church ok?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" you say keeping you're eyes closed, you drive for about 5 minutes when you hear the engine cut out and you unbuckle yourself. Kyra scoops you up into her paw and you hear her open the door, \"ok you can open you're eyes now\" she says. You open you're eyes and see her smiling down at you, \"are you nervous?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I, i'm getting married to the love of my life, by the way that dress looks really beautiful on you\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks darling\" she says walking forward, you look around and notice all the girls standing there. They follow Clarisse into the building as she walks to the front of the isle and they sit down, you look around as you didn't see the priest and you see everyone turn around. Walking up the aisle is a green scaled dragoness a little taller then Kyra, she walks past her and heads straight to the podium, she lowers her hand to the podium and you just spotted the priest get off. You hear the reverb of a microphone system activating and you then hear the priest's voice. \"We are gathered here today to join this 2 together in matrimony, if there is anyone who should object to this, speak now or forever hold you're peace.\" The church is deathly silent after he says this and he continues. \"Kyra Kittendale do you take this man to hold and watch over, guard and protect, in sickness and health, for better or worse, till death do you part?\" the priest asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" she says, you giggled a bit under you're breath at her last name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexander do you take this woman to care for and support, to dout over and love, in sickness and in health, for better or worse, till death do you part?\" the priests asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" you say as soon as he finishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I now pronounce you husband and wife, you may now kiss the groom\" the priest says. You're pushed backwards as Kyra kisses you and the church erupts into cheers. You look up at you're wife and you see the dragoness from before, she gently grabs Kyra's ring finger and slips a ring around it. She passes a pillow to Kyra which she passes to you. You grab the ring off the pillow and slip it on. \"Well it's official, you're stuck with me now\" you say jokingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you won't get into any trouble\" she replies. Kyra's surrounded by a rabbit in a black dress about her size, a vixen in a silver dress and a dalmatian in a yellow dress. You aren't sure what they want until you see 3 specks on their palms and you're father and 2 brothers are placed down near you. You look up at the rabbit who you now know is you're mother and smile. You're twin runs up and gives you a high five, \"it's about time you 2 got married, I thought me and Carrie were gonna get hitched before you 2 did\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, well better late then never right\" you say. You're little bro stands to the side, you look up at the vixen and say \"nice catch, don't let her go.\" You're father walks up and hugs you, \"congratulations, I knew you 2 would get married eventually\" he says. He looks up at Kyra and says \"take good care of my boy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sir\" she replies. You're mother bends over and says \"One down, 2 to go\" jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it won't be long\" you say. Each girl picks up their respective man and they step back, Kyra walks up to the podium and places you down, you grab the mike and says \"the reception party is at our house, so just follow us\" you say smiling. Kyra gently picks you up and walks out of the church into you're waiting car, she gently gives you a kiss before putting you down and starting the vehicle. She seems kind of twtichy on the way back so you ask \"what's wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just so giddy, we're finally married, that means you're all mine and i'm all yours\" she gives off a squeal after saying that prompting you to cover you're ears. She stops the car once you get home and opens the door and you're house if fully decked out. \"I hired some people to set up the house while we were at the wedding\" she says shyly. \"Good, because I know I couldn't do it\" you reply. Guests quickly start showing up, you sit on Kyra's shoulder and welcome people as they come in. The party reaches full swing very quickly, there was no alcohol due to the dangers it could cause but there was so many different kinds of food from veggies to sea-food, bread to steak. You were kind of disappointed when it came time to cut the cake as you couldn't do the honor with Kyra but you quickly brighten up as she places you down near her piece. You quickly eat you're fill of cake and she picks you up and places you back on her shoulder before devouring the rest of the cake. The party winds down in an hour or 2 with most people leaving with a comment like \"well we should let you have some alone time\" or \"let's let them start the night of passion.\" The clean up crew quickly arrive, and they leave within 15 minutes. After they have left Kyra shuts the door and looks down at you with a sly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no reason, it's just time for the fun\" she says still smiling. She walks upstairs and places you down on the bed before slowly taking off the wedding dress. She lays down next to you and waves at you're clothes \"take em off or i'll cut em off\" she says. You quickly take the suit off and she nudges it to the side with one finger, she quickly nudes you toward her opening and you look up at her. \"Just want to get right to it do you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my husband so you need to take care of you're pussy darling\" she replies slyly pushing you inside. You spend the next few minutes inside rubbing and caressing, although you had to rup through the hymen to get deeper in, you hear a sound like rushing water and you're swept out in her juices. She looks down at you and says \"oh god, that felt amazing, you probably got off really quickly being surrounded by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um actually, I wanted to wait for you're answer to a question before doing that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the question\" she asks purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyra do you want kittens?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do, I can't wait for the pitter patter of little paws on the floor\" she replies. You go back in and within a few minutes had done what you needed to do, you walk out and she moves around so she's laying on her stomach looking at you. \"I didn't feel anything, are you sure it'll work?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure it did, but I never tried this kind of thing before so i'm not sure\" you say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up slowly not wanting to really move. You had already gotten used to not working, but you still went with Kyra to her job as an accountant because it was \"safer.\" You really went just to hang out with the husbands of the other women that worked there. You had to admit being the smaller one did have it's advantages although you never really exploited them because you knew Kyra would panic and worry herself to death if she didn't know where you were. Kyra for her part had stopped playing pranks on you and she had already overcome her aversion to water, she even sang in the shower from time to time. Finally you decide to get up and you look over at her digital clock and see that it's about 8:00am so Kyra needed to get up for work. You lay down and start rubbing her chest \"come on Kyra wakey wakey time to end you're catnap\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm\" she replies starting to purr, she rolls over and you have to grab onto one of her hairs to keep from falling, that was another good thing about being here. You were sure that you're upper arm strength had atleast doubled in the past week. \"Hey come on now wake up, I really don't think I can hold on forever\" you yell. Kyra turns back up and starts moving around, you see her eyes slowly start to open and she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning love\" she says still purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning\" you reply \"I still don't know what's wrong with me sleeping on a bed on the nightstand, Jim does it and his marriage is just fine\" you continue standing up,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well Jim's no fun, besides how could I ever fall asleep knowing you weren't right there\" she says gently poking her stomach and you with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fine, besides I wouldn't have to keep holding on to you're fur just because you keep moving every time I try to wake you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you and I both know you love sleeping with me\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well fine, then can I sleep somewhere where I won't fall too far even if you turn\" you say. You see a very mischevious smile cross her face \"ok, one safer spot coming right up\" she says. She picks you up between 2 fingers and places you down between her breasts, \"there now you'll have a smaller fall and you'll atleast have a soft landing\" she says still smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I guess i'll sleep here from now on\" you say smiling back. You look down and notice that there her chest atleast to you're eyes seemed to be protruding a bit. \"Hey Kyra have you been eating any fatty foods?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasps \"I always take excellent care of my figure, I have to look my best for you\" she replies smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well I might not be a doctor, but I think you're pregnant\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEE\" she squeals and she gently picks you up and puts down on the bed and runs into the bathroom. You hear rummaging and you don't hear anything else for a minute until you hear another squeal come from Kyra. She runs back into the room and smiles down at you, she leans forward till her nose is pretty much touching you and she just stares at you for a few more seconds. Without warning she pushes forward kissing you and then pulling you off her lips as she lets go, she puts you down in her palm and says excitedly \"you're a daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great news, now I just need to know how to raise a kid bigger then I am\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I bet you'll be an excellent Dad\" Kyra says smiling, \"ooh i'm so excited, now i'll have more then 1 little guy to watch over, hmmm I wonder if I can practice by mothering you\" she says smiling and you could tell much to you're own chagrin she was serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh heck no, no way\" you say. \"Kyra you'll be an excellent mother wether you have practice or not\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right I will\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout 9 months later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure fully what was happening. You had already called the ambulance as Kyra collapsed after saying that it was time. You hear the front door open and you yell downstairs and then hear and feel footsteps, in run 2 emts carrying a gurney, one picks you up and puts you on their shoulder while the other lifts and straps Kyra onto the gurney. The 2 of them head downstairs as quickly as they can and they load Kyra into the ambulance. The emt who strapped her onto the gurney jumps into the back while the one who's shoulder you were sitting on heads to the front. She gets in and starts driving and asks \"so how are you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty scared, it's not a good feeling being unable to help the one you love\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry we'll take good care of her\" the emt says. The ride to the hospital lasts ten minutes and when you get there 2 nurses and a doctor run out with a stretcher. Kyra is quickly transferred over and you're passed over to one nurse while the other one and the doctor wheel her in. You expect the nurse you're with to follow but she slowly walks into the hospital and walks up to the front desk, \"hey Clarisse this man's wife is giving birth can you get the necesscary paperwork?\"  the emt says before placing you down on the counter. The woman at the front desk nods and grabs using a pair of tweezers a tiny set of papers that she passes to you and then she passes over using the same tweezers a tiny pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir I just need you to fill these out, this is just standard information that we'll need when we discharge her\" she says smiling. You quickly get to work, writing down information, signing on dotted lines and you soon have the paperwork finished. \"May i go see my wife now?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman types at a computer for a bit before answering you \"she's probably in the middle of giving birth right now and only medical staff are allowed in at that time\" she says. You start pacing back and forth for 10, 20, 30 minutes finally the receptionist gets annoyed and hands you a magazine which you sit down and start reading. 10 minutes later the nurse you saw before walks up and says \"Mr.kittendale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me\" you say standing up. She lowers a paw to you and you climb on. She walks quickly to a room with a sign over it saying \"delivery room\" and she opens the door. A smile instantly breaks out over you're face as you see Kyra laying there holding 3 bundles each one normal child baby size to a female. The nurse walks over and puts you down on her shoulder. \"So I have 3 lovely baby girls\" you say beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually not quite true Mr.kittendale\" says another nurse, she leans forward and you notice a tiny bundle on her finger. You climb up and grab the bundle before climbing back down. \"Ok I stand corrected 3 girls and a boy\" you say still beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Alex i'm so happy\" Kyra says leaning over a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too, I know it's kind of sudden but do you have any names picked out?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I have all the girls names picked but I wasn't sure about a boy's name\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Zack\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great name, are you ok with the girls being named Clarisse, Betty, and Danielle\" she asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're wonderful names, very cute just like their mother\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you big softie\" Kyra replies. You wait around and in a few hours Kyra is discharged from the hospital.</span></div></div>",

It was finally you're you're kids 16th birthday, you woke up slowly as Kyra's chest was still the comfiest bed in the world. You move a bit so you can see the clock and it blazes 8:30am down at you. That's when you hear the sound of three earthquakes. The bedroom door busts open and in runs Clarisse, Betty and Danielle all smiling. Betty was the first onto the bed always being the athletic one, you weren't sure how many trophies for track meets and the like you had for her. Danielle was next and she was definitley the brains of the family, at 16 she was already asking questions that stumped you and that was saying something. Finally Clarisse slowly walked up to the bed, even though she was the shortest and shyest of you're daughters she was just so kind and gentle that it didn't matter and her hand eye coordination was amazing. She could pour you a glass of juice while everyone else including Kyra had to dunk you're glass in. You turn back to the nightstand and you see Zack sit up in bed. He had slept with his parents all his life, mostly because you were the one who worried about him as you had mainly taken care of him. Since Kyra was usually so busy taking care of Danille, Betty, and Clarisse it fell onto you're shoulders to take care of you're son. You did all the normal things play catch, joke about, you even showed him how to use a computer once you learned there were ones male sized (nano tech much). Kyra stirs and sits up prompting you to grab onto her fur \"morning mom\" the three girls say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning girls\" Kyra replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, a little hand\" you say as Kyra stretches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry\" Kyra says lowering a hand to just below you letting you drop onto her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mom\" Zack says standing near his bed as Kyra leans over to put you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning sweetie\" Kyra replies gently picking Zack up and giving him a kiss before setting him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe after 16 years you can't remember that i'm there\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" Kyra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it was a bloody miracle I survived the first few years as you'd bolt up whenever you heard one of the kids crying, thank god I can apparently fall onto the bed from that height\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, stop bugging Mom I mean today is a special day\" Betty says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and what day would that be, let's see it's not a national holiday...\" you trail off as you pretend to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad it's our birthday\" Zack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that's right happy birthday\" you say hugging Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey no fair I want a hug\" Danielle says moving near the table and reaching a hand out, you step onto her finger and she holds you up to her cheek where you hug her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday sweetie\" you say. You're passed over to Betty who hugs you a bit too eagerly and then you're passed over to Clarisse who hugs you so gently you had to hug her back instantly just so she'd hug a bit more. Finally you're passed back over to Kyra who by now was holding Zack on her palm pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on girls it's time for breakfast\" Kyra says, there was no work as luckily you're kids birthday ended up on a weekend. You're daughters run downstairs while Zack sits next to you waiting for Kyra to get moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Dear\" Kyra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Mrs.Fluffy\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you to stop calling me that\" Kyra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's cute mom\" Zack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See he likes it\" you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you have to come up with something else, and until then no breakfast for anyone\" Kyra says pouting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on Kyra is it that big a deal\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, now hurry it up you're making you're kids hungry\" Kyra replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten can we please just go have breakfast\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'd you call me?\" Kyra asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten, it's short for Kittendale\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh it's so cute, thank you dear\" Kyra says gently kissing where you were on her palm pad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not to interrupt but can we go have breakfast now\" Zack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" Kyra says getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Jack how's school going\" you ask as Kyra walks down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So got anyone you like yet? How about that Mare that's assigned to take care of you, what was her name again/\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elaine\" Zack says blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you think of her?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, that's embarassing\" Zack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now we're you're parents, you want to hear right Kyra\" you ask her ears pointing towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I want to know who my little guy likes\" Kyra says before you enter the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Dad i'll tell you later, I don't want my sisters to know they already have the size advantage over me\" Zack says as you enter the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" you reply. Kyra puts you both down at the mini table you had on the larger one. You're 3 daughters lean in and smile at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad what were you and Zack talking about\" Betty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn super cat hearing ability\" you think, \"nothing Dear just guy stuff you know birds and bees that kind of thing\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so does Zack like someone\" Danielle chimes in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we were talking about the more technical side to birth\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww\" they all say and go over to Kyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dad\" Zack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, although I am gonna have to tell you how to do that eventually, I really hope that days a ways off\" you say sighing a bit. \"So what do you think of Elaine\" you ask again prying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's very nice, she takes good care of me and she seems to like me, like that time...\" he trails off and blushes a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what time, come on i'm you're father\" you say leaning over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well one time she put me down on a counter and it seemed like she forgot me as she dropped a pencil, she leaned down to pick it up and well she wasn't wearing any underwear and I got a full view of her lower regions and i'm sure I saw her head turned around watching me and she smiled\" Zack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I remember the first time I learned Kyra was interested in me let's just say she was a lot more direct, and it ended up with 1 or 2 scratches on my body\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying about me Dear?\" Kyra says walking up with plates of toast and eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just telling Zack about how met\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you mention the part where you showed up with you're mom as the driver\" Kyra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really dad\" Zack asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you might not have been able to tell it but I have a bit of a vision problem which prevented me from getting my Driver's so it was that or show up by bus\" you say trying to defend yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear it's not that bad I thought you were quite cute\" Kyra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure\" you say, you're daughters giggle and so does Zack. \"Fine so you're fathers kind of lame when it comes to romance\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were able to get me weren't you\" Kyra says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kitten\" you say starting to eat. Breakfast was pretty silent except for you're daughters talking about boys, and school, and girl things which didn't really interest you that much. Within a half hour everyone was finished eating and it's time for you're kids birthday party. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girls had specifically asked for a family party for their 16th birthday as you always described their other parties as, \"much too dangerous for the men of the world.\" Kyra picked you and Zack up and everyone moved over to the living room. \"Alright so what does everyone want to do first?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Presents\" the 3 girls yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine, might as well get that out of the way first\" you say. You turn to Zack, \"Zack i've been watching over you for 16 years, i've watched you grow up into a fine young man so it might not seem like much\" you say as you take off you're high school grad ring. \"Take it, I know it won't fit on the finger of the girl you like, but well it'll do well enough as a proposal\" you say handing him the ring. Zack stares at you shocked \"but Dad I can't take this, isn't this what you \"gave\" Mom?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sweetie i'm fine with it\" Kyra says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack just take it, I'd rather you had it when I can see you wear it with pride and happy then when i've passed on you say smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Dad\" Zack says running up and hugging you. You heard you're daughters go \"aww\" and you smiled hugging you're son back. Kyra pulls a small box out of nowhere although you were sure she just hid it in the space between the couch cushions. Kyra hands the box to Zack and he opens it, inside is a gold plated watch with Zack's name engraved on the back \"Zack Kittendale\" yeah the kids took Kyra's last name not yours but you didn't mind. Zack stares up happily at his mother and she lowers her cheek to him and he runs up and gives her a hug. Kyra lowers her paw to the couch and you and Zack are deposited on the couch cushions, Kyra walks into another room and comes back carrying 3 boxes in her arms, she hands one to each girl. All 3 of them rip into the boxes and each pulls out a set of matching earrings and a ring, \"the earings are for you to to catch the eye of any boy you might like, the ring is like you're father's idea to be able to propose to them\" Kyra says. You're 3 daughters run up and hug Kyra and you went \"awww\" at the nice moment. Each girl puts their earrings on and they all turn to stare at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So dad what's you're present\" Betty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap, this is the moment i've been dreading for 16 years\" you think. \"I don't have a present for each of you, well not a material one anyways. All I can offer each of you, as my daughters, is my support, if you ever need someone to hold onto you're secrets, a shoulder to cry on, or just someone to laugh with well i'll always be available no matter what\" you say. Clarisse slowly walks up and smiles down at you, she lifts you up on one finger till you're facing her for the most part face to face. \"Thanks dad\" she says before nuzzling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome\" you reply and you're other daughters seeming to get jealous each gently pick you up and hug you in turn. Finally you're sitting on Becky's palm pad, \"Dad can I well use you're present now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and dad are going to go talk\" Betty says turning and running out of the room, she runs upstairs to her room and shuts the door. You always marveled at how many trophies, medals, and the like adorned the walls and shelves of you're daughters room. Not to say it wasn't a bit girly as there were a few of her favorite stuffed animals still scattered around. Betty walks over to the bed and sits down before placing you down on her shoulder. Betty sighs \"dad, i'm not sure I can tell you this\" she says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I won't judge you no matter what\" you say already expecting what she'll say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad there isn't a boy I like, I mean there's the boy I take care of and he's nice, but I don't like or love him, i'm a lesbian\" Betty says looking away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and stares at you shocked \"you're...you're not mad or anything?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, so who's the lucky girl my daughter has her eyes on\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dad, actually she's a dog anthro, her name's Janice and she's on my track team\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the problem?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't it weird that I like girls instead of guys?\" Betty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, but i'll say 2 things, do you feel any weird urges about you're family member\" you ask, betty shakes her head. \"That's good, also i'm glad you like this girl, but if she's not a lesbian, then you shouldn't force her ok?\" you say. Betty nods \"actually dad, she's kind of the reason I found out I was a lesbian\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well then I hope the 2 of you can make each other very happy\" you say. You swing you're legs for a bit \"so is it ok if I tell the rest of the family?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? why?\" she asks confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think it's better if they learn this now rather then you're girlfriend just showing up at the door\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Dad, but can I be the one to tell them\" Betty asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" you say. Betty walks out of the room and she heads downstairs. She makes the announcement and much to her suprise but not yours everyone was very accepting. Kyra walks up and gives her a hug \"Betty i'm glad, you always seemed like you had something on you're mind, and now we know what it was\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom, thanks so much dad\" Betty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it's what i'm here for\" you say. You heard what sounded like a whisper and you see Clarisse staring at you \"um...Dad can I borrow you for a sec?' she asks. \"Sure\" you say. Clarisse gently picks you up before heading upstairs, you reached her room quickly and you sighed as you entered. Clarisse's room always calmed you as she based it off a field putting down a green carpet at the shock of Kyra and giving the room sky blue walls and ceiling. Clarisse gently sits down on the bed and lifts you up to eye level. \"So what do you want to talk about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's this boy I like\" she says and you nod. \"He doesn't even know I exist even though i'm near him all the time\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He the kid you're supposed to watch over?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, his name's Rick and he's just the cutest little person\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I thought that was my position\" you say getting a small smile to cross her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still cute dad but he's cuter\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the problem is even though he's near you a lot, he doesn't seem to notice you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't even look up at me, and everytime I try to talk to him he just turns away and looks out into space or does something else\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but crack a smile \"Clarisse he knows you exist he's just as shy as you are\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asks suprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You silly cat, I know this will seem weird for you but you need to be kind of forceful. Lift him up so that he can't help but face you before starting a conversation, it's not like us guys have a lot of options once a girl's decided on a course of action\" you say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try Dad\" Clarisse says. She gently nuzzles you for a bit before getting up and heading back downstairs. Everything seemed to be going well, everyone was joking and having fun including Zack which made you smile.</span></div></div>",

She smiles and Danielle takes you upstairs, she heads into her room which always mystified you. All along the floor were cables attached to computers, other then the bed only the night table and the immediate area around her closet were cleared of items be it technical or scientific. Danielle sits down on the edge of the bed and looks down at you. \"Dad, you and mom aren't normal\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I mean we're not the average parents but that doesn't mean we aren't normal\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean you and mom have never gone on a date, you're always wary, at our events, and it's never been just you at parent-teacher conferences. You always look at us, well with a reverence in you're eyes\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I can't believe how big my little girls have gotten\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom's always looking for you, I see her eyes dart from side to side trying to lock onto you, and when she does they instantly soften, you never dance, swim, or do any of the other stuff we were taught as basic things in relations class\" Danielle says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, \"Danielle you're a very smart girl, but you're mother and I have kept some things from you and you\u2019re brother and sisters  for you're own good, it's part of our past and it doesn't need to be told\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle lifts you up and frowns \"dad, please tell me, you really want to keep secrets from you're own daughter?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine Danielle I\u2019ll tell you,\" you say. She lowers you onto her palm and stares intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason me and Kyra never do stuff like that....we don't know how\" you say. Danielle cocks her head confused, \"this will sound insane, but we're from a different dimension, and we seem to have transformed to fit this one. Kyra used to be my normal sized 5ft 6in wife, she was not a cat, or 6 miles tall\" you say. Danielle stares down at you shocked, \"but, that can't be true, you were always so accustomed to us\" Danielle says. You nod, \"well it's a hard thing to hide, but it was easy as I saw all of you and Zack grow up, I excepted my responsibility as you're father readily....even if it meant my life\" you say looking at her. Danielle lifts you up, \"what do you mean you're life?' she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had so many near death experiences it's not funny, but i'd face them all again and 100 times over if it meant I got to stay with my wife, loving son and my precious daughters\" you say. Danielle lifts you up and her eyes were misting \"oh daddy\" she says gently cuddling you, \"Danielle it's ok, although I need you to keep this a secret now\" you say. Danielle smiles and stands up \"sorry dad, I can't do that\" she says. She walks out of her room despite your protests and walks downstairs, you find the rest of the family in the kitchen and much to you're shock they had eaten the whole cake, \"sorry but we were really hungry\" Kyra says as Danielle walks in. It wasn't like you were going to eat any cake anyways as it was made of cat treats but you were still suprised. Danielle sits down and smiles, \"so mom, dad told me all about you 2\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Kyra asks freezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your and dad's secret\" Danielle says moving you over and placing you in Kyra's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, I am adopted\" Zack says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not adopted\" you yell back  \"Look, she's right we have been hiding something from all of you, but it shouldn't really effect anything. We're not from here, we grew up in a dimension where women were the same size as men and not animals. It's why we didn't do a lot of stuff, as well, I didn't know how\" you say looking down. \"So that's our secret\" you say looking up at Kyra. Zack as well as you're other 2 daughters stared at you and he shrugged \"so what?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You don't care?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's interesting news, but it's better then learning your adopted\" he says cracking a smile. You would have hugged him if he wasn't sitting at the other end of the table. \"So is that why you were always so careful, I mean I honestly don't remember you ever lut us play with Zack when we were younger\" Betty says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was more a father's instincts, that and yeah it was a little part of that, I love you girls with all my heart, but I know what kids my size could do, and you're like 5,000 times that\" you say. Clarisse looks down at you and, \"wow you're pretty brave dad, so what was it like finding out Kyra was so big?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra tries to hush you but you stop her, \"back then she was kind of a prankster, I still remember the first prank you played on me here, what did you call me again...oh yeah my little treat\" you say looking up at her. Kyra blushes, \"yeah well you got me back pretty good\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you take a shower, suprised the neighbors didn't come running from your yowl\" you say smiling. It was really freeing, finally being able to talk about this kind of stuff without worrying about what your kids would think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...dad, how'd you 2, ya know, learn to make kids?\" Zack asks. You just stare at him across the table you're mouth wide open, \"uhmmm...tv, videos, and well look this isn't something we should be talking about\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, you were a little explorer in there, even went down the wrong way once if I remember correctly\" Kyra says and now you as well as your daughters were blushing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we please change the subject\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you have to rub my head\" she says picking you up and gently dropping you on her head. You start petting her and she instantly starts purring even though the actual area you were petting was so small to her it was laughable. \"I never asked, can you really feel this?\" you ask Kyra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it feels so good, you're hands running through my fur, over me, even though you're so small they're so warm and comforting\" Kyra says laying forward with her chin on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, you said that you can't do anything like dance that kind of thing\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean we can each individually dance given ample room between us, but not together\" you reply. Clarisse smiles down at you, \"do you want each of us to teach you, Danielle hear from her tech club we're even coming out with computers made for males, although they're not that strong\" she says. You were shocked, it had been 16 years since you had graduated college and you really weren't sure if you could get back to it. \"Oh, that seems to have sparked your interest, so what do you say dad? Betty and Clarisse can teach you the more physical stuff and i'll teach you computing if you'd like\" she says. You were overcome with emotions so you looked down, \"how did I ever get blessed with such wonderful daughters\" you say on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" Zack yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus a wonderful son\" you yell back and that seemed to make him happy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I think we should go with the things like dancing first, I mean I've gone 16 years without computers, I can go a bit longer\" you reply. Clarisse nods and gently picks you up \"alright Mom you and Dad need to come with me\" she says gently putting you down on an open paw. She walks up to her room and puts you down on a dresser as her and Kyra push her bed off to the side temporarily leaving a size-able floor for the 2 of you. \"Alright Mom I want you to pick up dad\" Clarisse says, Kyra gently picks you up and puts you down in a paw. \"Alright you two, the first dance we'll be doing is the waltz, both of you know the steps right\" Clarisse asks. Both you and Kyra nod and Clarisse smiles \"good well then mom you need to put one of your fingers near dad\" she says. Kyra does, actually pressing the digit against you gently to make sure that she got it right, \"alright Dad now you need to hug Mom's finger\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?\" you reply looking up at her but she shakes her head, you sigh and hug pretty much just the claw of Kyra's finger. \"Alright now you 2 jus follow the steps, mom you just need to move your finger accordingly along with your feet, don't worry since dad's attached himself to your claw there's no chance of you hurting him\" Clarisse says. Kyra slowly stared following the steps with her feet before her finger started to move and you moved yourself along with it. It was actually quite nice although it did feel a bit weird hugging a claw but otherwise you thought it went very well. Clarisse claps furiously as Kyra and you stop moving \"that was perfect, I've never seen a guy and girl do that so well first time\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what can I say my little man is talented\" Kyra says smiling down at you \"back at you kitten\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright well we should also teach you 2 how to do some of the more, romantic dances\" Clarisse says. Kyra moves her claw back and stares at Clarisse \"you mean like the tango?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes like the tango, although dad I'm sorry but you'll have to be in the female roll\" Clarisse says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dad do you really think you can dip Mom's claw, I mean all you have to do is hold on and fall back\" she says. You sigh and look up at Kyra who giggles \"oh don't worry cutie, I'll take good care of you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha\" you reply standing up and hugging her claw. The tango along with a few more dances went over very well so much so that Clarisse was happily clapping by the end \"you 2 are great, you're not bad at this kind of dance atleast just not very accustomed to how it works\" she says. You nod and Clarisse gently picks you up and puts you down on the floor, now for the other kind of dance, don't worry we'll start it slow, just one of those old fashioned kick dances, this one you just need the right distance for\" Clarisse says. Kyra stared down at you and you looked up at her \"don't worry, I trust you\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyra nods \"alright let's try\" she says, everything was going well, that was until Kyra tripped, it was like time slowed down as her body fell towards you, you saw her try to shift her weight but you knew that wasn't going to work, you closed your eyes waiting for the end and nothing, you opened your eyes and you saw light although it was filtered through something, must have been Kyra's dress. In a second you heard Clarisse \"oh god, oh god oh god, mom don't move, don't move you might have missed him\" she says. In another second you heard paws on stairs and then a scream as you guessed everyone see Kyra on the ground and Clarisse in hysterics, \"Hold it\" you shout and the room became very quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, are you ok?\" Clarisse asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, kind of glad I got you signed up in those aerobics classes now Kyra\" I say chuckling a bit. \"Alright now Kyra you need to slowly stand up and no one on pain of death get anywhere near where her dress is till she's stood up\" you yell. Kyra slowly stood up and then quickly squatted looking for you \"down here\" you say waving your arms. She quickly locks onto you and 2 claws pinch your shirt and lift you up \"your safe, your safe\" Kyra purrs ever so gently rubbing against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spun around and looked at Clarisse \"I ah think we'll stick to the other dances\" you say. Clarisse nods \"well I think we've done enough for today, what with that scare, we should go to sleep\" Kyra says as you hadn't noticed but a couple hours had passed since you began. Everyone nods and Kyra hands you over to Clarisse and goes and gets changed into her pajamas first before coming back, she takes you and Zack into your room and turns as the 2 of you change. She then gently picks Zack up \"good night my cute son\" she says giving him a small kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight mom\" he replies as she puts him down near his bed and he climbs in. Kyra shuts the lights off before sitting back down on the bed she reaches over and gently picks you up and kisses you \"I am so happy your safe\" she says before gently putting you down in the groove between her breasts. You felt her breathing space out but you couldn't get to sleep, I mean you knew that you could die at any time here but this was the first time you had ever gotten close to dying. You just laid there for probably half an hour till you sighed and started to gently push against Kyra's chest. \"Mmm not now hunny I want to sleep\" Kyra mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyra you lazy cat get up, I need to talk\" you whisper. It took you another minute of incessant pushing and whispering to finally get her to lean herself up and hold you up to her face in her paw \"what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I realized something today\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Kyra asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I'm powerless here, me, Zack, every guy in this whole world exists because you girls let us, because we serve a purpose, if you could recreate without us you'd probably just get rid of us like you would bugs\" you whisper looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never, I love you\" Kyra whispers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to look at her \"Kyra I'm a speck, I'm less than a bug compared to you\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you might be a speck, but your my cute speck\" she replies her tongue snaking out and the tip gently licking you. \"Now what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I think I'm having a kind of mid-life crisis, I realized that if I can't even protect myself how am I supposed to protect my son\" you say sighing. Kyra gently lifts you up to her cheek, \"don't worry he'll be fine, I'm sure about it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah as long as he keeps her happy, Kyra if us guys ever had you mad at us you could just squish us without a second thought\" you you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never, I mean I've been mad at you plenty of times, like that time you skipped work and got yourself in trouble because you went to Clarisse's school to confront her bully\" Kyra says.\" You look up at her and smile \"sorry It's just I was most scared about what would happen if I had died, I mean I would have been no more then a tiny stain on you and that's well about it\" you say. Kyra gently cuddles you to her cheek \"your a lot more then that, your a loving and devoted father and the best husband I could ever ask for, now stop worrying and go to sleep\" she says gently putting you down on her chest. She started to gently purr and sing a soft lullaby, you just laid there and were soon put to sleep by the love your wife showed for you. </span></div></div>",

You feel your forehead to see that your head was wrapped in bandages. Your arm was covered in similar bandages but it didn't seem broken. \"What?\" You then look at your surroundings to see you were in what looked like a hospital bed. \"Oh good,\" says a voice. \"You're awake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and then you let out a gasp. Standing above you was a really large anthromorphic ibex dressed up like a nurse. You let out a slight scream. \"Where am I? What's going on?! Why are you so big?!\" The nurse waves her head to shush you before lowering her huge face right above you. \"Calm down. You just recovered from a serious injury. That head of yours took quite a whallop.\" \"Yeah,\" you thought to yourself. \"It must've.\" This couldn't be real. The ibex nurse then picked you up and inspected you as you crouched down in fear. \"Good news,\" she said. \"Your injuries have completely healed up. I've already called your girlfriend to take you home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend?\" you asked. You turned your head and looked in shock and fear. Into the hospital room walked an anthromorphic hyena woman. She was dressed in a black leather jacket with small tight black shorts, fishnet stalkings and she had a vicious looking smile on her face that showed her razor sharp teeth. She also had bright scarlet slicked hair that reached past her waist. But what really frightened you was that she was as tall as the giantess nurse, if not taller. The nurse handed you to this hyena woman who smiled down at you. This hyena was your girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

You try to walk back but she puts her fingers over you to block any chance of escape. \"Ah-ah,\" she said. \"Don't you want out of this dump. Thanks for taking care of my man, the little guy's always getting into trouble.\" \"Men,\" said the nurse with a laugh. \"Don't I know it. Just make sure nothing else happens to him.\" Your hyena girlfriend nods her head but looking at that toothy smile and those mean looking eyes make you think you were better off in the hospital.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon that giant hyena is walking you out of the hospital stroking you with one of her skyscraper sized fingers. You tremble in fear and she immediate notices. \"Don't tell me you're afraid to see your sweet Summer,\" says the hyena as she shakes her hips and looks down at you with a seductive smile. \"You know I'd never hurt you.\" She says that like she wouldn't, but her appearance suggests otherwise, especially with her long pierced tongue. \"Yeah right,\" you say. \"Put me down. Stay back. You can't be my girlfriend!\" You gasp and realized you probably shouldn't have said that. You are so dead. Or not, instead, Summer simply felt your head with her thumb as she shook her head. \"You must've got whomped worse than I thought. Don't you go getting amnesia on me now. You dig?\" You don't know if this is supposed to be a good situation of a very bad situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Summer is taking you downstairs, you see more animal giants, all female. The receptionist is an anthromorphic chameleon woman, in the waiting room is a serval woman and you see a water buffalo nurse carrying a make doctor on her shoulder, a male human doctor. You could not believe this. But before you could ask questions Summer walks you outside up to her motorcycle. At this point you're beginning to think maybe this situation isn't so bad. A biker chick. Nice choice. But then Summer rubbed her chin. \"Now,\" she said. \"Where to put you. Can't have you getting double amnesia.\" Summer lets out a sinister laugh as you tremble in her grip.

You've always liked my 'front compartment', haven't ya, babe?\"Summer winked down at you as she titled her hand downwards, sending you tumbling across her palm and scrambling to find a foothold or something to latch onto to keep gravity making you go splat. You zoomed past strands of fur as thick as tree trunks, a pad of skin that could've been a wasteland as black as coal, and yet you couldn't grab onto anything because the hyena girl had inched her hand ever so gently away from you, that one inch too far for you to grab onto anything. Summer obviously knew how to handle tinies like yourself, she had done this to you before, or, that's what you think. Your mind's still blank and reeling at the fact of the multi-mile high giant anthros everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you left the safety of her palm and began to free-fall through the air, spinning and flailing your arms wildly in hopes that you could act like a bird and stay aloft, you looked down, finally understanding the meaning of Summer's 'front compartment' allegory. Protruding proudly from her chest like two bulbous mountains, clad tightly in leather, Summer's breasts came together into a luscious line of cleavage, eagerly awaiting to catch your minute self. You fell faster and faster, almost like a careening rocket, only to land not too roughly in the V formed by her breasts, causing you slide downwards until you were firmly planted in between her bosom.\"There we go!\"She cackled so high above, her booming laughter ringing in your ears.\"Ya comfy babe?\"She asked as she adjusted her top, wiggling her chest around to make sure you were deep in there, nice and snug.\"Yeah...I'm...good.\"You replied, blushing slightly, but almost enjoying the feeling of the enveloping soft warmth around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cackled once more before getting on her bike, revving it up and zooming off down the street. You didn't even feel a hint of vibrations from the vehicle you were so deep in her chest. At least that meant you were safe. But as you began to survey your limited perspective of your surroundings, you found that you couldn't move. You were sandwiched between two immovable objects, no matter how soft they be, they were much, much larger than you. With a sigh, you simply laid back and enjoyed the ride. Summer's fur was that of a rustic brown, speckled with black spots here and there, and you could even make out distinctions of orange coloring in the fur. You took it that since you were small you could make out those kind of details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride continued on for a while, interrupted occasionally by Summer's incessant laughter. Did she have to do that because it was a hyena thing? You guessed so, but you didn't want to bring it up. Getting on the wrong side of your supposed girlfriend would be a bad idea. Getting on the wrong side of your<i> gigantic, dozen-mile high girlfriend</i> with razor-sharp fangs was the worst idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the bike slowed down and stopped. Summer reached into her cleavage and popped you out, settling you on her fingertip. She brought you up to her eye, her massive pupil staring down at you with a hint of glee and playfulness.\"Alright hon, we're gonna....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uh, that's fine.\" Summer barks her motorcycle in a parking lot in back of an apartment building before walking into the building. Summer places you safely in her breasts again and makes sure you're in nice and tight before walking in herself. As she is walking forward, she passes by another anthro girl, this time a lioness anthro listening to headphones who simply waves to Summer before going on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer soon reaches her apartment and unlocks the door before walking inside. She takes you out of your cleavage and places you on the coffee table before your giant hyena girlfriend hangs up her coat. You look around the place to see that it's surprisingly neat. You thought that the place would've been messed up given how Summer was a biker chick. Guess you can't judge a book by its cover. Then you look on the mantle to see a photograph of Summer as a teenager, except her hair was neater and she was wearing an outfit you'd expect from a schoolgirl with pink highlights instead of the black leather jacket and pants she wears now. What the heck happened with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you notice that in the photograph Summer is with another hyena anthro that looked taller than her. You take it that was her mom, but what was weird was that Summer's mother had a human on her shoulders that looked around her age. You take it that was Summer's dad. Not much of a stretch given Summer was apparently your girlfriend. Then again, you haven't seen a single male giant anthro. You were in a world where men were the lesser sex in more ways than one. It was frightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can wrap your head around this, Summer lifts you in the air again and places you on her shoulder. \"Come on Babe. I better get something cold for that wounded head of yours.\" Summer then walks into the kitchen and you have to hold onto the hairs on her shoulder so you don't fall a dozen miles to the hard ground below. You're nervous about how she is taking you everywhere. \"Come on Summer,\" you say. \"You can just leave me on the table.\" Summer shakes her head. \"Bad idea little dude. Last time I left you out of my sight, you wind up in the hospital.\" She had a point there, you had just gotten out of the hospital and from what Summer said, it was due to your own actions. You couldn't imagine yourself doing something so crazy, but then again, you didn't know what you were like before getting hurt like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer places you on the kitchen table and roots around in the fridge as you're given a few of her moon sized leather clad ass with her tail wagging around. You gotta admit, for a twelve mile high hyena, she was a total hottie and very caring despite her intimidating appearance. You're glad she's your girlfriend. Soon, Summer produces a bottle of soda from the fridge and pours you a small thimble of the drink before sitting down at the table herself. You nervously drink your soda as Summer takes a small piece of ice to apply to your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling better babe?\" she asks as she smiles and shows her terrifying teeth. \"Much. Thanks uh Summer. Just one question given I probably have killer amnesia right now.\" \"I could tell,\" said Summer with a hint of worry. \"You haven't been yourself lately. So, what's your question sug?\"</span></div></div>",

I'm not the kind of guy who would risk my life.\" Summer sips her drink again and lets out a loud belch that forces you to cover your ears before she speaks to you again. \"Who are you kidding? That's exactly the kind of guy you are, or rather were. I even warned you not to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't sound like she was lying based on the look on her face. According to your giant hyena girlfriend you were some daredevil. Given your girlfriend <i>was</i> a biker, it would make sense. Summer then puts her knee to the table as you climb her stocking covered leg and takes you up to her face. \"What exactly was the dare?\" Summer let out a grunt and slapped herself in the face. \"You were lucky you weren't killed. My dingo friend Billie, she dared you to ride one of her hubcaps down Dark Side's Drive, the most dangerous road in the county. Big surprise. The hubcap came off. Billie hadn't gone to the mechanic like Annabeth told her too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. You took a dare that could've killed you. You couldn't believe you were like that. Thank goodness you were still alive. It looked like Summer really cared about you as she places you on her nose big enough to land a plane on. \"You know men shouldn't ride down Dark Side's Drive.\" \"What's that supposed to mean?\" you ask. \"Men aren't good enough to drive down Dark Side's Drive?\" \"Men aren't BIG enough to ride down Dark Side's Drive.\" Says Summer in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, that's what I thought. So all men are my size?\" \"Yep,\" says Summer right before she breaks into laughter. \"My Dad was once stuck between my Mom's toes for three days.\" Then you realize something, if Summer's dad was a human, that meant your mom had to be an anthro since men were the size of germs to the anthro women in this world. \"Summer, what am I?\" \"Huh?\" \"You know Summer. What kind of anthro is my mom if children in this world are the same species as their same sex parent.\" \"Oh,\" says Summer. \"That's easy.\"</span></div></div>",

That's odd, you'd think it would be your family that wouldn't be wild about you dating a biker, but if Summer's high school picture was anything to go by, she wasn't always like this.

What were you thinking. Summer was going to take you to her friends and if they were half as wild as she was, you could be in big trouble. But as she walks in, Summer strokes your head again and gives a slight frown. She was worried about your head injury. You figure that even if she's a giant hyena, she's still your girlfriend. It's unlikely she'd put you in any danger. Maybe this won't be so bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer opens the bar door and you look in fear at the type of anthros inside. There were five of them dressed similarly to Summer and on the backs of their jackets written in bold red letters were \"FIRE HOUNDS\". You were looking at an all girl motorcycle group. Either a very good situation or a very, very bad situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst there was a tall black furred jackal woman (even bigger than Summer) with silver colored hair playing a game of billiards. She even looked like she was wearing an eyepatch. You cringe as you watch her and even try to hide up Summer's sleeve. There was also a wolf woman with brown fur and long black hair. She was noticeably overweight and was half drunk at the bar table. At another booth there were two anthros; a tall fox woman with curly dyed cyan hair and a beauty mark playing a card game with a green haired dingo girl who was wearing a pair of shades as she looked at her cards closely. The fox was quickly losing patience from the expression on her face. Finally, by the jukebox was a blonde haired coyote girl who was picking at her fangs with her claws. You thought to yourself that Summer must hang with a rough crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug on Summer's fur slightly and Summer pulls you up to her ear realizing you wanted her attention. \"Summer,\" you say. \"I don't know about this.\" Summer let out another laugh. \"What are you afraid of babe, they like you.\" That's exactly what you were afraid of. As Summer walked in, her footsteps alerted the jackal woman who turned around and gave a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis jackal girl smiled and showed her huge teeth that you hope you never have to see up close. \"Summer,\" said the jackal. \"I haven't seen you round here in days. I hear your boyfriend just got out of the hospital.\" Summer let out a laugh. \"Sure did. Come on babe, you remember Annabeth don't ya?\" Summer holds you out and you tremble in fear as Annabeth looks down on you and smiles. You expect her to hurt you but instead she waves down and then takes a closer look. \"That's one nasty knockin' he took. Maybe that'll teach him to be more careful.\" You couldn't believe this. You may not have remembered anything regarding your hospitalization but these colossal canine chicks were making it out like it was your fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer then let out a sigh. \"I think he might have amnesia.\" She said. \"I gathered that part,\" said Annabeth. \"He hasn't made his crack about my breath yet.\" You don't imagine how anyone could taunt a biker chick the size of a city and survive. \"I believe it was usually something about being able to turn men into stone.\" You hold your mouth because Annabeth wasn't kidding. She was breathing hard on you and it was terrible. You assume and at least hope it was the stench of alcohol.\" Summer pulls you away from Annabeth and gets you away from that jackal. She didn't seem to appreciate her breathing her rancid breath on you<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a crashing noise and Summer and Annabeth turn to see the fox and dingo girl wrestling on the ground. \"Billie you no good cheater!\" yelled the fox. \"You were hiding cards up your sleeves again.\" \"Get off my case Carmen,\" said the dingo in an Australian accent. \"You're just a sore loser is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnnabeth let out a groan as you tremble in Summer's hand. This was bad. A cat fight just broke out. A giant catfight. You really hope you don't get mixed up in this. \"There they go again,\" said Annabeth. \"Always fighting.\" Summer let out a growl and eyed both of those canines. You hear that growl and your knees knock. You almost dread what might happen next.</span></div></div>",

I'll bet you're thirsty after that trip to the infirmary.\" \"Uh yeah,\" you say. \"I could use a drink, a good tall drink.\" You let out a sigh and look around the bar. The dingo girl turns up the jukebox as Billie and Carmen keep fighting and Annabeth runs up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer takes a seat next to her wolf friend and places you on the bar table. The wolf woman lifts her head and then rubs the side of her face and lets out a cough. \"Oh,\" she groans. \"I feel terrible.\" \"Hey Rahne,\" says Summer. \"I see you already got hammered. How many beers did it take this time.\" Rahne lets out a sigh. \"Only one.\" Summer laughs loud and you run in fear that she'll pound the table, but all she does is grab herself by the chest. \"Geez. You can't hold it.\" Rahne just lets out a scoff. \"Hey, I do better than that Fireball of yours.\" \"Fireball?\" you ask. \"What's going on Summer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Summer could say another word Rahne pushes her off her stool and holds her head up to you, coughing as she holds her stomach. \"You know what I'm talking about small fry. How do you think you got in the hospital in the first place ace. It didn't even take one beer and you... you really did it.. you... oh,\" Rahne holds her stomach and walks away as Summer gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Rahne,\" she says with a laugh. \"Hey Annabeth! Did you remove her wheels yet.\" Annabeth then knocks Carmen and Billie's heads together before she opens her mouth and reveals a wrench hidden under her tongue. Summer then snaps her fingers and the barkeeper comes forward. You look up to see the bar hostess was a titanic anthro cobra girl with a ruby in her forehead and a bald head with pierced fins at the side of her head. \"We'll take an order of cokes Manjula. Can't take any risks with my little man.\" As Summer is talking with the barkeeper, she rubs your head with her oversized finger. You close your eyes but you should realize by now that Summer would never hurt you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barkeeper nods her head and gives Summer her drink before she holds out a finger. You see she is carrying a human sized glass and you take it before she takes a eye dropper. Too bad Manjula misses and splashes soda over you.\" Summer tries to fight the urge to laugh but then she loses it and cackles at your predicament. You let out a grunt and then Summer brings you up to her lips and licks off the soda, bathing you in her saliva. \"Hey!\" you yell. \"Hey! Hey! Don't lick! Hey!\" Summer gives you another look of concern. \"You always like it when I lick you baby. I'm worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a sigh as Summer places you down. You don't want to worry your girlfriend anymore than you already have, so you smile and drink your soda and Summer smiles back and then proceeds to drink her drink as well. It was sort of scary. Summer's glass was big enough to hold an ocean to you and she was swallowing it down. You doubt she'd eat you, but with those sharp teeth and the fact that she claims to lick you on a regular basis, it was unnerving. But then you swallow your fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Summer,\" you say. \"I know I haven't been well....\" \"Acting like yourself?\" asks your hyena girlfriend as she rolls her eyes towards you. \"Can I blame you? You suffered a major head injury. It's sort of better this way that you're not yourself.\" Summer was making it out like you were some kind of troublemaker. Why would she think that, she was the size of a city to you? You decide to ask more on the matter. \"How come I'm the only one in the room who isn't... you know, a colossal beast?!\" Summer spews her drink back into her glass and breaks down laughing. \"Duh-uh!\" she yells. \"You're a man ain't ya.\" \"You mean all girls in this world are as big as you are!?\" \"Big? Are you calling me fat?\" Summer asks as she shows you her teeth. You shiver and shake. You might've accidentally insulted a dozen mile hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch but then Summer lets out another laugh before she rubs your back with her pinky finger. \"I'm just messing with ya sug. Yeah. That's how it works. Men are tiny and chicks are huge. Needless to say, we gals rule the roost.\" Then you get a horrific thought. \"If that's true than how do we...\" \"Well,\" said Summer. \"Let's just say it involves a bathing suit.\" \"Let's change the subject. Why can't I remember a thing about this crazy world.\" Summer gives a sad look and then lets out a sigh. \"So you really want to know...\"</span></div></div>",

It's either that, or the mouth.\" Summer's huge teeth and long gaping tongue were what finally got you to comply. It wouldn't be a good idea to tick off a twelve mile tall hyena, especially one of questionable sanity. \"I'll be good.\" You mutter. Summer lets out that cackling laugh of hers again and forces you to cover your ears with your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Oh, almost forgot.\" Summer reaches into her jacket pocket and takes out what looks like a helmet just your size. \"Can't be too careful hon.\" You put the helmet on and Summer places you in her back pants pocket before zipping you almost all the way in. She left a little bit open so you could get some air, but not enough for you to fall out. \"Comfy?\" \"Uh-uh-yes.\" \"Good.\" Summer laughed loudly and revved up her bike as you got on. You grab onto the fabric of her pocket quick, because you're probably in for one wild ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer took off at high speed and even at your small size, you could feel the vibrations. This was humiliating. You're riding in the tight pants of a giant hyena who you're told is your girlfriend. If that was true, you really needed to rethink your taste in girls. You decide to climb up and look out the hole to get a closer look at this new world. You see just how tight you're in. Summer's backside had to be the size of a couple of moons at your size and you could look up to see that her red underwear was showing. You don't like the situation you're in but at least you can whistle at the nice view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't just Summer that you were interested in. Everywhere you look you see more and more giant anthros down the street and if that weren't curious enough, every last one of them was a girl. You remember some creatures had strange sexual dimorphism but this was too weird. Before you could see anything else, you let out a grunt and Summer's tail bludgeons you in the face, knocking you back into the pocket tumbling. As you finally reach the soft bottom, you thank your lucky stars you were wearing a helmet. Heh, guess giant monster or not, Summer was looking out for you. Maybe this wasn't as bad as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you could think anymore you feel a skid and get further shaken up. Summer must've stopped the bike. Summer got up and reached in to fish you out of her pocket. Your head was still spinning as you looked up at Summer's smiling face. One look at those sharp teeth again makes you scream and you even grab your chest. \"Enjoy the ride hon?\" asked Summer. You let out a grumble but you manage to hide your irritated face from your giant girlfriend. You're just glad the ride's over. \"Did you have to drive so fast?!\" Summer just nudged you slightly with her thumb and knocked you back before pinning you down and stroking you a few times. \"Settle down Fireball,\" said Summer. \"We're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh great, where did that crazy hyena take you?</span></div></div>",

You manage to pull yourself out and then you see something really weird. The scaly green ground appears to twist and turn and go for miles. You decide to walk out and see what's going on. You walk for what you assume to be ten minutes, but you still don't get anywhere. You just keep walking for whatever reason and wonder what kind of ground it was beneath you. It definitely wasn't grass or dirt and it was too soft to be rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel the ground moving and let out a scream. What was that, an earthquake? You hold on tight and then see that the end of this 'road' is sticking up in the air. \"What's going on?!\" \"Oh,\" said a female voice in a slight British accent. \"You're awake love. It's about time.\" \"Huh?\" That voice sounded strange, almost as if it was hissing. \"What's going on?\" The voice let out a sigh. \"Good grief.

Though she wasn't long like your snake wife. Your mother was an enormous crocodile anthro with bright teal scales and black tattoos on her yellow underbelly. Your mom was also hourglass shaped with short blonde hair in a Bob haircut that was already beginning to gray. You knew for a fact your mother was in her late forties but she barely looked like she was older than Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom looks at Jennifer and glares slightly. \"Hello Jennifer,\" she says as she shows her skyscraper sized fangs. \"How nice to see you.\" She was being sarcastic as she said that. Jennifer gives a glare back and lets out a hiss. \"Hello Emma. You oversized handbag.\" Yikes, you knew some in-laws didn't get along but your mom and your wife seemed to hate each other. \"I still don't know why Stevie married a legless freak like you. I'd rather have him hooked up with an herbivore.\" \"At least he's picky that way,\" said Jennifer. \"Unlike his old man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth your Mom and Jennifer give cross looks at each other before you clear your throat. \"Uh Mom?\" you ask. \"That you?\" Suddenly your crocodile mother switches her scowl to a smile and turns to you. \"Oh,\" she says. \"Hi there Sweetie. Just came in to check up on you. After all, a mother cares when her son gets hurt on the job.\" \"Huh?\" you ask. Then you realize something. The reason you didn't remember the giant anthros was because you must've had a work related injury the day before. What the heck happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear tremors and see that your crocodile mother is walking right towards you and lets out a coo. \"Hello there Stevie,\" she says. \"Give your Mama a kiss. Your mother picks you up and much to your wife's chagrin takes you to her large crocodile lips to kiss you. You're covered from head to toe in your mom's saliva and even gag on it. But it's one thing if you were married to a snake, but for a crocodile to give birth to you? In this world women were giant beasts. But you couldn't remember anything. Should you tell your mom and wife you have amnesia? But do you really want to worry them?</span></div></div>",

I don't remember either of you being so enormous.\" Your mother and Jennifer look in confusion and then look at their own bodies.

Uh Mom, if you won't mind, I'd like to ask my first question to Jennifer.\" Your mother nods her head.

No, it was too warm and the desert would be cold at night, providing it was even night. As you walk forward, you feel the ground shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to tumble and yell loudly as you travel down this soft ground.

You're scared beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the owner of the eyes turns on a lamp and you see you're looking at a giant light purple furred bat woman. She was very chubby and appeared to be at least twenty miles high. She brings you up in front of her chubby face as she gives you a toothy smile. You gulp as you look at her teeth. She must've been a vampire bat. \"Good morning honey.\" This bat woman says to you in a surprisingly high pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me,\" you say. \"I don't taste good.\" The bat just lets out a laugh that blows you down on your back. \"You silly goose.

Always making jokes. I don't know why Ma doesn't like you.\" You shiver at that thought. If you had a giant bat wife, there was a possibility of having a giant bat mother in law and you shake your head at such a dangerous thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then as you're shaking, you look up to see Angelique is taking you closer to your lips and opening her mouth to reveal her terrifying teeth. You give a slight scream. Could she be planning to eat you despite what she just said. Before you can even think, your wife sucks you into her mouth with her lips and then presses you against her teeth with her large tongue as it moves up and down and even wraps you as you're drenched in saliva. Then you realize something. Angelique was giving you a kiss, a rather weird kiss, but then again she was much, much bigger than you. You even had to hold onto your underwear as Angelique tried to pull them off. But then she licks you vertically and at this point you were beginning to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Angelique pushes you back into her lips as they pucker and you let out a groan because it appears that she's sucking you like a lifesaver. Fortunately for you she spits you back into her hand. You look up into her face to see her giving the same sweet smile as when you both woke up and then you give a smile yourself. Can't upset your wife. Especially not your <i>twenty mile high vampire bat wife</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You taste as good as always Honey. Sorry for the puckering, you cut your finger a little and you know how I feel about your blood.\" You let out a sigh but then shrug your shoulders. \"My own fault for marrying such a beautiful vampire bat.\" You didn't fully remember anything, but you realize that it would be a good idea to play along.</span></div></div>",

You're in awe at the beauty in front of you, but then you see Angelique's hand reaching down at you. You let out a grunt and try to fight it, but your wife manages to remove your underwear before she steps into the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Angelique places you in a safe place on her lower lip before turning the water on. It's like meteors of armageddon with water molecules that size and you panic but Angelique puts her hand over you and pulls you down. You let out a sigh of relief. Of course, titanic or not she was your wife and she wasn't going to let you drown in the shower. But then she does something really kinky. She picks up a bar of soap and rubs it against your entire body. It tickles slightly especially down below but you fight the urge not to laugh. \"Angelique!\" you yell as you giggle. \"Stop that! That tickles!\" Angelique smiled and nodded. \"You always say that, and then it gets more fun from there on. Once you were covered it soap, Angelique runs your lathered body over her huge belly and then moves on to her breasts. You can't help but feel turned on as she rubs you hard, but it only gets better from there. Angelique uses your soap covered self to scrub her lower regions, her planetary thighs and cheeks and a few other places. You felt like you were in paradise and you felt like your nose was about to bleed. You better not let it lest your vampire bat wife suck on you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the shower was over, Angelique gets dressed and dresses you up too as you both go down for breakfast. Angelique makes a stack of blubbery pancakes and breaks off a tiny piece for you. As you eat your breakfast, you continue to look up at your wife. She was a big beautiful woman who put several continents to shame. She could squish you with little effort or swallow you whole and not feel it, but she was as gentle as they come and was very caring. Why didn't you remember this. You'd think that you'd remember having a wife that made you look microscopic, especially if she was a vampire bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Angelique looks down at you and seems concerned. \"Something wrong Honey?\" she asks. \"Uh,\" you say. \"No, oh no. Nothing.\" Then you notice Angelique is still looking at you with concern and seems nervous. \"Honey,\" she says. \"I have something to tell you.\"</span></div></div>",

A giant bat for an in-law and according to Angelique you two don't get along. You step back as Angelique lets out a sigh. \"I know you and Mom don't like each other that much, but you gotta understand, she never liked anyone I ever dated. Besides, I'm sick of you two always at each other's throats. Try not to lose your temper with Mom this time.\" You didn't remember Angelique's mother enough to know if you could keep that promise but Angelique was making it out that her mother was someone who was hard to get along with and you let out a groan. \"I'll try.\" Is all you can say. Angelique brings you up to her mouth and gives you that same sucking kiss as before. Getting married to a gigantic bat will take some getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Angelique places you in her titanic gorge sized cleavage and flies up into the air. You thank your lucky stars that you are in so snug in her breasts because you had to be a thousand miles up in the air. You looked down to see more titanic anthros like your wife. A wild boar driving a motorcycle, a hyena walking along the side of a jackal and even an owl flying past. The strangest part was all the anthros were females. \"Angelique,\" you say. \"Honey? Where are all the men.\" Angelique let out a laugh. \"Silly, you can't see men from up here. They're not noticeable on land from this high up.\" Oh great, all girls were titans and all men were practically germs. You were assuming that if that were true, your mother had to be an anthro and girl anthros gave birth to female anthros and male humans. You guess that makes it easy to know what your kid will be. \"We're here!\" yells Angelique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelique takes you down to an old fashioned gothic style house, your mother-in-law's house and then she knocks on the door. \"Mom, we're here.\" Angelique's mother opens the door and you take a good look at her. Your mother-in-law was every big as big and heavyset as her daughter but was a blue furred vampire bat with brown-reddish long hair and was wearing a band around her forehead. She surprisingly looked barely older than her daughter but was obviously in her 40s-50s. Then your mother-in-law turns to you. You hope that no trouble is started.</span></div></div>",

I better go get you some medicine.\" As your stegosaurus wife walks towards the kitchen you look at her massive cheeks. You remembered seeing Jerrica not only open a beer bottle with her buttocks, but carry a beer can between them as well at one point. Her posterior was your favorite part of her, but now it looked big enough to smash an entire city and its surrounding countryside. Then there was her huge tail that ended in several spikes the size of skyscrapers. You rub your eyes and then look at the shelf to see a photograph of you and Jerrica at your wedding. Jerrica was holding you on the tip of her finger as she licked you, and from the looks of it, you enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut why couldn't you remember your own wife being a dinosaur. Before you can wrap you're head around the situation, Jerrica heads back to you carrying a few tiny pills small enough for you to swallow. How such a massive woman was able to see them was beyond you. \"Here you go sug.\" You take the medicine Jerrica gives you and swallow it with your tea as you cough. \"I hate pills,\" I said. \"If only they made them easier to swallow.\" \"You oughta try the ones they make for us girls baby.\" Says Jerrica as she looms over you, placing her titanic breasts in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a nervous laugh and then switch your fingers. Your wife immediately realizes there's something bothering you. \"Can't remember little old me can you?\" You let out a gasp. \"What?! How did you...\" \"Yep,\" says Jerrica as she swings her tail in the air and uses it to scratch the back of her neck. \"That's one of the symptoms of Mesozoic Flu. You forgot who you are babe.\" She was taking this surprisingly well. At least your wife was concerned about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain a lot,\" you say. \"What do you mean?\" asks Jerrica. \"Well,\" you say. \"Jerrica, honey.\" You let out a cough before drinking some more tea. \"Why are you so big.\" Jerrica lets out a laugh. \"Oh sug. You like your gals big, my little chubby chaser. I remember you stayed in my underwear drawer for three weeks straight back when we were dating. You like some dino booty.\" \"Not that Jerrica,\" you say with a grunt. \"You're a dinosaur. A stegosaurus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" says Jerrica. \"That. Well, sug, we live in a world of weird dimorphism. All men are bite sized cuties like you dumpling. While gals are all big like me and come in a wide variety. I once had a college roommate who was a big old mammoth girl.\" Jerrica lets out a laugh and you laugh as well. You realized what was going on. You live in a world where women are multi-mile high animal giantesses while the men were less than ants to these big beauties. You bet your marry is smooth as silk because no man in their right mind would anger a wife the size of a planet and live to tell the tale. But this world was all too new to you, along with your stegosaurus wife.</span></div></div>",

This spinosaurus girl was Jerrica's niece, which meant she was your niece. \"Hey you,\" says Jerrica. \"How's college?\" \"Oh, everything's fine. Except for psychology.\" \"I thought you signed up for creative writing.\" \"I did,\" grunts the spinosaurus girl. \"But that stupid advisor recommended it without checking to make sure it was available.\" Jerrica shakes her head. \"Let that be a lesson to you,\" she says. \"Academic Advisors are always inept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the spinosaurus girl walks forward and you try to hide under the covers of your bed, but then the spinosaurus still sees you. \"How's uncle John doing?\" she asks. Jerrica lets out a sigh. \"Your uncle has a severe case of Mesozoic flu.\" \"You're kidding?!\" yells your niece as she shows her giant fangs. \"That's more dangerous to guys than it is to us girls Aunt Jerrica.

You look around to see what appears to be a chalk white mountainside all around you. You think you're in a cave but it's too narrow. You manage to budge forward, grunting all the way, when you realize something is pressing against your lower body. It was wrinkly but soft and dark blue with what appeared to be white skull marks. \"Huh?\" you ask. You look directly above to see a white object that looks like a tree. You're guessing it is with the thick fur-like foliage covering the tip and then you look up the mountainside to see that there is a purple star on the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inch forward and then begin to climb the mountain and find that its surprisingly soft. \"What kind of mountain is this?\" you ask. You just keep on climbing and climbing for three hours, only to huff and puff in exhaustion because you're not even a fraction to the top. But as you look up, you see the mountain turning from white to black, but it looked more like fabric. \"What's going on. Ah.\" Suddenly something grabs you by the back. You turn and see what appear to be giant pale white fingers grabbing you by the shirt. You try to shake free, by the fingers hold you tight as you are taken to the other side of the bountain and then you see something weird. These giant fingers were attacked to a giant arm that was covered in a purple and black striped sleeve and you're brought around to see what looks like a pair of breasts big enough to build several cities, on just one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe breasts appear to be wearing a black shirt not attached to the sleeves and the shirt appears to have nylon fishnets underneath, visible at both the cleavage and the sleeves. Beneath these breasts appear to be a huge sagging belly with a double pierced nipple. Then you're brought higher and scream in fear because you're looking at the face of a thirty mile high hippo woman. She had chalk white skin and long black hair with a purple streak in it. She has black mascara and lipstick and her left nostril is pierced. You look down to see this hippopotamus goth giantess is very obese even for a hippo. If she were human sized she would weight one thousand pounds and it showed as her leather skirt appeared to be ready to snap apart. However the hippo girl just smiles at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey little man,\" she says. \"I felt you crawling on my cheek. Believe me, it would take a month for you to get a quarter of the way up. You men are teeny but oh so scrappy.\" \"Put me down,\" you say. \"What's going on?\" \"Oh,\" says the hippo girl. \"You silly. Is that any way to speak to your fiancee?\" \"Fiancee?\" you ask. You then look down to see this hippopotamus was wearing an engagement ring and you were wearing one yourself. You stutter and stammer and the hippo girl lets out a giggle you wouldn't expect from a hippo even if she wasn't thirty miles high. \"Don't worry. You've still got six months before the ball and chain. But in the mean time, I think you need more rest. A few more hours will do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your gothic hippopotamus girlfriend reaches back and pulls back her panties before dropping you back in. You let out a grunt and yell as she snaps her panties and places you cramped but safe between her titanic cheeks. Being engaged to a hippo goth will take some getting used to.</span></div></div>",

You remember that she was a goth and that she was on the heavy side so her being a hippo wouldn't be too much of a change given the weight you remember her being at. But why was she thirty miles high? Unless she was always this big and you just didn't remember it. But you knew it had to be Ingrid since you distinctly remember that star tattoo on her right butt cheek.

Your hippo goth girlfriend stops in her tracks and scratches her backside, squeezing you in the process before she squeezes her cheeks together to pop you out as you grab hold of her panties. Then she puts a fingernail close to you. You recognize her purple painted fingernail with skull decorations on it and jump on before she lifts you up in front of her large snout. \"Something wrong baby?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Ingrid right?\" you ask. Ingrid rolls her eyes and lets out a sigh, showing her skyscraper sized teeth and her city sized tongue with a piercing in the center of it. You step back to avoid the risk of falling into the hippo's mouth and getting swallowed. \"You're still not feeling well are you sweetie,\" says Ingrid. \"You were sick for some time.\" \"Sick?\" you ask. You must've had a fever so bad it effected your memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid sits down on a bench to speak with you, causing the steel bench to bend in the center under her massive weight. \"Yes,\" says the titanic hippo goth. \"My name is Ingrid and yes I am your fiancee. You act like I forgot I was a hippopotamus.\" \"I remembered you being as big as a hippopotamus but not being thirty miles high.\" \"What do you expect? I'm a girl.\" \"So all girls are big enough to live on in this world.\" \"Yes they are,\" says Ingrid. \"And you <i>do</i> live on me. You live in my belly button. Your fever must've wiped out your memory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I remember meeting you in high school. I remember opening the door for you.\" \"How could you?\" asks the hippo in disbelief. \"You're so small, you could live underneath my toenail.\" You then give a look of disgust. \"So why was I in your butt.\" Ingrid gives a worried look. \"I thought you liked it in there. Perhaps you'd prefer a ride in my mouth today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask. \"Hey.\" Ingrid places you in her mouth under her tongue and then strokes the top of your head with her tongue as you scream. \"Relax little man,\" says the hippo giantess. \"I'm not going to eat you. You are going to be my husband in six months. Besides, you've been in there hundreds of times.\" With that she slams her mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake with every step your thirty mile high hippo fiancee was taking and you fall face first into saliva. You shake your hair off and you have to hold onto her gums. But then she tosses you in the air with her tongue and you have to grab onto her stud. According to her, you enjoyed being in her mouth. You were probably better off in the other end. Suddenly Ingrid's stepping stops and her mouth opens and you see she has arrived...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You've been in before, but you didn't remember the scale. \"Here we are sweetie,\" says the giantess hippo as you cover your ears before her mouth closes again. You stand on her tongue piercing as you hear your fiancee take out a key and unlock the door. It was frightening to be on this silver island in the middle of a pink ocean inside of a hippo's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ingrid told you she wouldn't swallow you. Besides, hippos were herbivores. Ingrid walks inside and then she opens her large mouth and hold out one of her purple fingernails right up to you as you walk on top and your hippopotamus fiancee takes you out of her city sized mouth. You were relieved as the fingernail big enough to build a town on was taking you away from your fiancee's mouth. But surprisingly, her breath was very sweat, sort of like peppermint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIngrid places you down on the coffee table and then she sits down on the couch, her entire massive rear taking up the whole love seat before your girlfriend smiles at you and waves her black hair with the purple highlight. You begin to drool but wipe your mouth. A BBW goth girl the size of a city and you two were engaged. \"Feeling better baby?\" Ingrid asks. You give a smile so as not to offend your thirty mile fiancee. \"I'm okay Ingrid. Thanks for... you know, not eating me. Kinda weird to be in my girlfriend's mouth.\" Ingrid lets out a laugh as her huge stomach jiggles. \"Relax. I wouldn't eat you and even if I did you'd be safe. Men are immune to women's acids. Remember that time you fell into my beer at the bar and it took you three days to climb back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake at that thought. \"Not funny Ingrid.\" Then you both hear a snapping noise and Ingrid looks to see her skirt broke off much to her dismay as the hippo giantess lets out a sigh. \"Not again.\" She moans as she reaches for a stapler. \"When are they going to start making hippo sized skirts.\" As Ingrid was fixing her skirt, you look around to see the gothic decor. The curtains were black, there was a rug shaped like a dinosaur skeleton, the lamp had a monstrous face on it and the walls were painted in a patchwork style as you whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you look to the mantle to see several photographs. There was one of Ingrid and her roommate, Lilith. You remembered Lilith. She was a goth girl like Ingrid and the two of them were best friends since high school. Though Lilith was a little weird at times. From the photograph, Lilith was also an anthro now. An anthro mammoth who was just as fat as her roommate. Then you see a photograph of Lilith's parents. While her mother was a hippo anthro like her daughter, she wasn't as pale and had long blue hair. Ingrid's father, a human like you was sitting on his wife's shoulder, proving that it was only girls who were giant anthros. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you saw your prom picture. You were on Ingrid's shoulder and Ingrid was wearing a black sparkling evening dress with black roses as she smiled at you. You smile because you had a good girlfriend here, even if she was a titanic hippopotamus. \"So sweetie,\" says Ingrid with a smile. \"Now that you've recovered, what do you want to do now?\" You actually had to think about this.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing a black jacket and a shirt with a bloody knife on it and long black and white striped pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Lilith,\" says Ingrid to her mammoth roommate. \"You're awake. Lilith rubbed her forehead with her trunk that you saw had one pierced nostril. \"Oh hi Ingrid. Hi there Eric.\" You take it Eric was your name.

Don't you like the idea of having a little man crawling all over you. It's especially fun when I put him in the backseat. It tickles. You should get a boyfriend Lilith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilith lets out a huff and then she begins to gag and lifts up her trunk. \"Uh-oh,\" says Ingrid. \"Take cover quick sweetie.\" You look up and see that Lilith is about to sneeze. Before you can get to cover, the mammoth goth giantess sneezes and you get caught in a gust of wind and yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric!\" yelled Ingrid. \"Are you okay.\" \"I'm fine,\" you say. \"But I think I'm in somebody's mouth.\" \"Who's?\" asked Lilith. \"Please be in Ingrid's mouth,\" said Lilith. \"Last time I swallowed you I had to deal with you walking on my spleen for three days straight.\" Swallowed? Lilith and Ingrid had both swallowed you before? Given their size it was unavoidable and you guess that men were immune to the anthro giantess's stomach acids. But you weren't in a stomach.

You manage to get out from under the big object that you're under and you stand up, but then you see the ground beneath you is bright blue. It's also unusually soft for some reason. You look behind yourself to see a pillow right behind you and it was huge, it had to be a mile tall. Before you knew what happened, you see a shadow over you and look up to see a giant gray and white furred husky girl with a wart on the side of her face. She was a pear shaped thing with bright blue eyes and she was dressed in a maid's outfit as she looked over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Master.\" She says. \"Master?\" You ask. \"Wait I...

Each strand of her fur is as big as the world's biggest tree and as you look down on her monster sized butt, you see that she had to be at least eleven miles high. She was a titan.

I have a job.\" \"A computer job where you work at home sir?\" \"Exactly why do I need a babysitter?\" Janet lets out a barking laugh. \"Because you're a man.\" You gave a look of shock and then you smell something cooking as your maid reaches the kitchen. That smelled like Callie's pancakes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run and move the strands of Janet's fur and you see something really strange. In the kitchen cooking pancakes was a collie anthro your age. She was even more pear shaped than Janet and with a bigger rear that her long red and white hair reached down to. The collie turns and reveals she is wearing a pair of glasses. Janet smiles at the collie girl. \"He's alright Mistress Callie. But I think his fever left him with minor amnesia.\" \"Callie?!\" you yell. \"Hey honey,\" says Callie. \"You feeling alright?\" \"Uh Callie,\" you say. \"I knew you had thunder thighs, but why are you a seventeen mile high collie? And why do we have a humongous husky as a maid?\" </span></div></div>",

You then hear loud vibrations and crashing noises. You let out a grunt. \"I'll bet that's Trini stomping about.\" You were referring to your younger sister. You remember having to stay with her in her house because you couldn't find any apartment open after you graduated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mind living with your sister, but she had a tendency to make a lot of noise. \"Trini!\" you yell. \"Keep it down, it sounds like an elephant out there.\" \"Well duh,\" said Trini in an unusually loud voice. \"What do you expect? That's what you get for sleeping in my navel.\" In her navel?\" \"What are you talking about?\" \"I thought I was being nice letting you sleep in there after you were in that wreck. I told you not to let your friends drive you to work.

As you're sucked into the vortex, you feel the vortex lifting you into the air and holds you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see that your sister's house was magnified in size. It looked like whoever was living here was exactly seventy miles high. You look and see your sister Trini has transformed. She was now a seventy mile high Asian elephant girl with long black hair with yellow highlights and yellow lipstick. You remember your sister was fat and it showed with her huge belly. She was wearing black leather pants and a yellow jacket with a black and white shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp loudly. \"Trini!

Your father was a human your size but your mom was an Asian elephant giantess like Trini. The only difference in their appearance was that your mother was wearing glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was one photograph of you and Trini and another elephant giantess. This giantess was a tannish skinned African elephant with large tusks and long brown hair and orange highlights in the hair. She was holding you with her trunk.

And as you came towards the end of driveway you saw looked around a little bit before you saw a small human sized garage which was already open and waiting for your car. Once you had drove your car inside you turned the key thus turning the car off. You then proceeded to get out of the vehicle and walked towards the trunk of your car to get your bags out of it. But while you did this you began to think back on how you ended up at this giant house in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a few months ago when you received a job at a local college to be a librarian of sorts for the school. When you got the job though you were a bit worried that due to your small size compared to the anthros that it was going to e tricky being in charge of library. However, once you had entered the large room though and asked one of the other librarians where your workstation was (just in case you had one) the giant anthro bear picked you up and took you a large table. And upon being get on the table you were taken aback when you saw a human sized desk and chair with a computer and telephone on top of it. (just in case you had to call a student to remind them when their book/books were due)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this prompted you to ask the bear who had made or gotten those items for you. You were once again surprised when you were told that a professor by the name of Tim had made these things for you. Along with that you also found out that he was in charge of the home education classes. And so once you had found the number for the home ed room you dialed the number and waited for the professor to answer. To your relief there were only two rings before a deep voice answered from the end. Hearing this prompted you to ask if you were speaking to Professor Tim? When he answered yes you told him that you were Will and that you just wanted to thank him for taking the time to make all of these things for you. You heard the professor let out a light chuckle as he told you that it was no problem. Once this was done you were about to say goodbye to him, (just so that he could get back to teaching his class) but before you could he stopped you when he said that he wanted to meet you after his class was done. You agreed to this before you both hung up your respective phones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was midafternoon when you looked up upon hearing one of the doors to the library being opened. Once you had done this you felt your heart skip a beat when you a giant and well muscled anthro whit rat look around a minute before his bright blue eyes saw you. After that day the two began to talk whenever the rat wasn't teaching a class, and if you weren't that busy either. And as you did this you both found out that you had quite a bit in common whether it was movies or active/hobbies that you part took in when not working. And last week was when the two of you decided to go from just friends to boyfriends. Which of course led you and Tim to put a side a weekend to hang out together at his place. (which he had promised would have everything you needed)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly broke out of your memories as you took out your bags and proceeded to walk towards a door in the small garage. Upon doing this you now found yourself in a giant garage. Not really knowing how long it would take you to get to the front door of the room. To your relief you saw a human sized phone next to the door you had just left. Once you had grabbed it you dialed Tim's house phone number, and after a few rings you heard the muscled rat's voice when he asked, \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Tim, it's Will. I'm here for our weekend together.\" You replied, as you rearranged the phone putting it a bit closer to your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good I'm glad you're here. Hang on, I'll be come out to the garage to get you.\" The rat stated, before you heard the phone on the other end go quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a light laugh as you hung up the phone and waited. Thankfully though you didn't have to wait long though as the front garage door opened up to reveal the giant white rat. But when he walked towards you, you couldn't help but blush deeply upon seeing that he was wearing nothing other but a towel which made you assume that he must have just gotten out of the shower. And once he was only a little away from you, Tim got down onto both of knees so that he could see you better. Once he had done this you saw his usual warm and kind smile as he asked, \"I'm glad you got here without any trouble Will. So are you ready to spend the weekend together?\"</span></div></div>",

You should change out of your pajamas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, you go back to your room and put on some clothes.  Who were the Threshers?  Could your brother have misheard your parents?  After you finish tying your shoes, you ask your mother, who is checking the mail.  \"Mom, Billy said something about the 'Threshers' inviting us to breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, isn't that kind of them?  We're lucky to have such friendly neighbors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the Threshers were your neighbors.  However, the last time you checked, your neighbors were the Hendersons.  You decide to go to your father, who is thumbing through the newspaper.  \"Dad, do you know when the Threshers moved into the neighborhood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Daniel, we moved into their neighborhood.

You are confused when you see nobody outside, just a lumpy green wall that moves very slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly very frightened.  Looking up, you see an extremely long curved surface attached to the green wall, much higher up than your house, and the surface extends to far behind your house.  The surface lifts up a hundred feet and moves back several hundred more, and you see that it is a toe, a raptor's claw.  Before you know it, your family is quite literally picked up by a teenage raptor girl, namely Hillary Thresher</span></div></div>",

Hillary has a relatively thin build covered by a tank top and gentle facial features, and you guess that she is a few years older than you.  You don't know how she managed it, but she had just scooped up your entire family in one of the talons of her fingers without completely smashing anyone to pieces.  The rest of your family waved back at her, but you are too shocked to do anything.  \"Oh, Daniel, you don't look so good,\" Hillary spoke, \"I hope you haven't gone down with anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel's just fine, right?\" asked your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" you reply uneasily.  Hillary still stares at you a bit concernedly, but continues stomping towards a humongous yellow painted two story house.  You are amazed at the size of this house; your own house could probably slip under the front door!  Not only was it huge for its size; it probably had more rooms than your house as well.  The Threshers must be pretty well off for raptor anthros.  As Hillary takes one step onto the porch, you realize why your family couldn't have come themselves; no human could ever make that step without a helicopter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHillary reached out one of her huge clawed hands out and grabbed a T-Rex shaped knocker, rapping it three times on the gigantic door.  In no time at all the door swung open, revealing three more colossal raptors.  The two adults were a head taller than their daughter, and Monty, who looked quite young and very jolly, was only half Hillary's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hillary, great, I see the Smiths are all here!\" spoke the mother in a calm voice.  \"I just put breakfast on the stove, so why don't you hand me Mr. and Mrs. Smith and you kids can hang out a bit?\"  Hillary eagerly thrust her thumb claw next to your parents, and they held on tight to the thick talon.  As quick as a wink, your parents were whisked away into Mrs. Thresher's scaly clutches.  Your brother Billy looked like he was already having a swell time wedged in Hillary's claw, but you are very frightened, because you are positive than even if these raptors mean well, they couldn't possible interact with you or Billy without completely pulverising you.

Miss Thresher, may I go with Billy to his room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that's okay.\"  A huge talon swiped your brother away and lowered him into Monty's hands.  As the youngest member of the Thresher family scurried out of the room, a gigantic clawed hand shut the pastel door behind him.  You feel the wind rush in many directions as Hillary collapsed on her massive fluffy bed, to be replaced by her warm breath as she lowered her towering face to your minute form nestled under her talon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Daniel, those midterms were something, weren't they?\" she spoke, her stare drawing ever closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you are presented with something you are familiar with.  You really did finish midterms just yesterday, even though you didn't have neighbors this huge yesterday.  \"Actually, I found them to be not too bad.  History is just memorizing a bunch of dates, and math and science just kind of come easy to me.  I admit that World Literature was kind of a doozy, though I think I did well on that essay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I totally agree with you on World Literature,\" replied the titanic dinosaur teen.  \"Although I wish I was as good as you at science.\"  Her face continued to draw even closer, until you were sure that you were being held directly in front of her eye.  It is so huge and powerful, you can hear her muscles move every time she blinks, and her slit pupil seems to pulse within a range of 300 to 400 feet thick.  This intense stare is really starting to frighten you, and Hillary seems to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Daniel, are you sure that you're all right?\" she says, bringing her eye even closer.  \"You're shivering and sweating; do you have a fever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-no, I not s-s-sick,\" you stutter, completely intimidated despite her concerned tone.  Nevertheless, your world suddenly flips upside down as you are dumped into a scaly palm several square miles large.  You are suddenly pressed deep into the palm by the finger you were once in, and you can hear Hillary say through acres of scale and bone, \"Oh my, you're heart is racing.  Yet I'm sure your parents would have made you stay in bed if you're sick...\"  Suddenly, her eyes widen, and looking over at your iota of a frame in her palm, she says...</span></div></div>",

As Hillary's eye above you flutters a bit, you can't help but flinch from the though that you will be blown off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Daniel, there is no need to be so shy about it,\" spoke the humongous raptor.  \"In fact, I think I can admit to you now that I feel the same way about you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly frozen in place by this bit of information.  It just seems so wrong for a raptor who could crush skyscrapers to feel any emotion at all towards something the size of a speck of dust to her, expecially if that emotion is some sort of love.  Yet Hillary's huge nose is starting to nuzzle you right now, as she giggles lightly.  Now less afraid of her, you start to think that you may actually find her attractive in other ways, like her light giggle and her friendly personality, but there is just something odd about a human and a raptor having this sort of relationship.  You don't want to hurt this dino's feelings, but you have to let her know that something just is not working for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hillary, um, this is nothing against you or anything, but,\" you start to say before being hushed by Hillary.  \"I know, Daniel, you are worried about what everyone else would say, seeing a human like you and an anthro like me, together like this.  I think it may be early to think too far ahead into the future, but I think that if we can be friends, like so many others, there is no reason why we can't be more than friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear Mrs.Thresher call you two as well as the other children down for breakfast.  Quickly rolling off of her cushy bed, Hillary heads down to the dining room, where the smell of bacon and sausage fill the air.  It's obvious that this raptor family is carnivorous.  As Hillary lowers you to your place setting, you cannot get the image of you and Hillary being together out of your head.</span></div></div>",

Hillary gives you a little bit of each from her plate, plus a drop of her cow's milk, before she starts devouring her massive stack of protein.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the raptor family were civilized among your family and ate the same kind of food you do, they were savages at the dinner table, swallowing huge quantities of food and making loud snarling noises.

A giant claw reaches in and presses you down so you stick to it, then draws you out of the pink cavern.  You can't help but think: was Hillary kissing you?  Her look at you with her huge eyes seem to say that it was a kiss; as she hands you a damp towel and soap to wash off the saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picks you up and starts carrying you somewhere.  \"Um, Hillary, where are you taking me now?\" you ask the colossal teenage dino, unsure of what she has in mind.  Hillary giggles and replies,</span></div></div>",

As you gazed at the television screen documenting the event live, you still could not believe was actually happening. Was this all a dream? It didn't feel like it. Maybe it could have been a hoax or a joke? You highly doubted your brother and the entire news media team would do something like this just to fool you. No, it was happening, and it was happening fast. The massive, sky-filling hand was coming down upon earth faster and faster, closer and closer, until you could make out details. Heck, you didn't even have to look at the television anymore to get a good view, you could look outside your window now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gazed upwards, you found that the closest thing of this astronomical hand was the thumb, so you focused on that. It was humanlike in appearance, yet covered in fur that gradated from light brown to a blended orange color, coming to a tip with pointed claws at the end of the digits. All of a sudden, there was a massive boom that echoed across the planet and a giant shudder that nearly knocked you off your feet. Once you regained your composure, you looked outside to see on the horizon that the thumb and forefinger of the hand had made contact with earth, holding the planet steadily. Good god, how massive was this anthro?! You were truly terrified to believe that a creature held the entire human race right between their fingernails, and apparently, everybody was okay with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro must have had great dexterity, as it moved the earth very gently, and you hardly felt like you were moving at all. The sky seemed pitch black for a moment before it was replaced with an eye. It blinked a few times, sending a mighty wind across the face of the earth with every bat of an eyelash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, look at all of you! I didn't realize humans were so...tiny.\" A mighty, booming voice thundered overhead, yet having an odd, feminine undertone. Okay, the anthro was a girl, that much you could make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, lemme just give you guys a better look at the one who's gonna be taking care of you all today.\" The titaness bellowed. There was a slight shuffling with booming noise effects, and the sky became clear once more. The anthro must have settled the earth farther away or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked to the sky once more, and there she was. She was a hyena, a wide, toothy grin on her face. She was clad in torn and tattered punk rock clothes that barely covered her well-defined curves., from a tank top with some rock band logo on it down to black boots that covered her paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey everybody, I'm Sasha, nice to meet you all!\" She cackled with a familiar hyena's laugh.</span></div></div>",

Looking over the edge of her gigantic pinky you see that your house and gardens are covering only a fraction of a table in what must be Diana Franklin's home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana carries you through the house, giving you a good view of the giant home and all that lies within it. Even when you try to look past the sheer scale of it you find that it is bigger than your house proportionately as well as literally; it seems that the Franklins live in a mansion for all accounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Diana enters a dining room where a large (even to her) dining table stands, only laid out for breakfast at one end. Here you can see some of the other Franklins. At the head of the table a charismatic mature-looking dog is reading what must be a giant version of The Times (Diana's father), on his left you see a teenage bitch wearing suprisingly tasteful clothes and looks about 19 or 20 (Diana's eldest sister), next to her a younger bitch sits in what appears to be more 1960s style clothing (Diana's second elder sister), opposite her a young puppy smart clothes awaits for the meal to start (Diana's brother) and next to him is a bitch who seems to have a strong cheery optimism about her (Diana's younger sister).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from his newspaper, Diana's father sees her and then looks upon her pinky to see you and your parents attempting to stand after that swift trip through the giant house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've picked them up.\" He comments to his daughter with a hint of humour in his voice and facial expression. \"Good morning, little 'uns.

Once your parents are seated Diana carries you round the table to the chair opposite her younger sister and sets you down in a solo chair at a much simpler table where you can choose whether to look at Diana, her younger sister or the rest of her family.</span></div></div>",

Their daughter was an anthro like her mother, but her birth reaveled the likelyhood for human children. Human females will rarely give birth to anthro children a 10% chance. Anthro females however have a 50/50 chance of giving birth to either species.

As you lay under your mattress and covers you hear her voice above you saying \"Now you know I hate having Rai do that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRai? Who was Rai? Your question was answered as you crawled out from under your mattress and was greeted by your mother who was sitting on the shoulder of a humongous Raichu. This raichu was apparently the one who tipped over your bed. You remember the strange dream you had last night but to think it might be reality was just mind boggling. You were about to ask how could pokemon exist when a equally big Agumon walked in. This agumon was apparently female from the large breasts on its... her chest. On this agumon's shoulder you could see who you believed was your dad. It seemed like Digimon also existed here. Pokemon and Digimon were you favorites things ever and to live in a world where not only did they both exist but made humans seem like dust mites. You think you're going to like it here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so deep in thought that you almost missed what your dad said. \"We're going out for a few hours. Shouldn't you be...   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As my parents and their Mons left I took a look at my surroundings. My \"Room\" was apparently a small platform on the wall of a much much larger room. Inside the room I could see that it had the design of a teenage girls room with pink sofas chairs and a bookcase with magazines and books. I chuckled when I say that most of the magazines were about male pokemon, digimon, and even humans. Back in your old world (if it was even real) you played pokemon games all the time on your Gameboy and later Nintendo DS. In every single pokemon game you played every single wild pokemon you ran into was female. It seems like even here your pokemon and digimon were female. Looking around your little platform you saw a small bookshelf with 6 pokeballs on it. Walking over to the bookshelf you picked up the pokeballs and walked over to the edge of the platform. Hoping for the best you tossed the balls in the air. A bright white light filled the room blinding you momentarily. As your vision returned you noticed 6 giant figures standing in the middle of the room.  Your eyes widened as you got the first look at your Mons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quite simply beautiful. Panic began to set over you when you realized you didn't even know their names. You began to rack your brain for them until you remembered you DID know them. Somewhere deep in your heart you knew exactly who they were and that they'll always love and protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Lucy. A Fun-loving and slightly hyper Lucario. She was your first pokemon and bit of a trouble maker. She along with all of your Mons went through puberty much earlier and quicker than humans. Evidence of this was her large D-cup breasts and well toned legs. (Since she knew you for so long she thinks your the one and only guy for her) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Minerva. A Gardevoir. Her pokemon species and very hot body hides the fact that she is a total tomboy. Instead of reading magazines and talking about boys with the other girls she is playing sports or video games with you. A bit unfortunate since her G-Cup Breasts and large rear would guarantee her any boyfriend she wanted but she didn't seem interested in them. (What you didn't know was that She was interested in one boy: You)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of you Pokemon was Lia. A shy Latias. You always wondered what an anthro latias would look like and now you know. She was a bit on the smallish side compared to the others but no less huge to you. Her hands were like normal human hands but with four fingers and she stood on 3 toed digitigrade feet. Her breasts were a CC-cup .Her wings slightly smaller and tucked behind her back. (She has had a crush on you since you first caught her and has been working up the courage to tell you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Digimon you ever caught was Rena. A tough girl Renamon. She's a tough girl and bit of an athlete. A side affect of this is that she replaced the normal purple gloves of a renamon with black fingerless gloves. Her favorite sport was boxing and wasn't afraid to demonstrate to anyone. Male Mons were her usual punching bags since her DD-cup breasts and lightly muscled body made her the target of many advances. (Unknown to you was that she was saving herself for what she considered her alpha male: You)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Aya. She was a rather adventurous Biyomon. She was always off flying somewhere. Sometimes you would fly with her in a special seat she would wear over her neck. You were a bit embarrassed riding in it though since it put you right between her D-Cup breasts and your mother pointed out that seat wasn't too unlike the one she used to carry you as a baby much to biyomon's amusement. (She's had many wet dreams at night of you both doing something else involving her breasts) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not least was Serena. This sly little Gatomon had the nasty habit of popping up out of nowhere. You thought teleporting was Rena's thing but at least you could still hear her coming. Serena was different. She could make it so she wouldn't make a single solitary sound which is a huge achievement since to humans a Mons footsteps would put the Richter Scale to shame. (Most of Serena's time was spent trying to come up with a way to confess her love to you. She also knows of the others feelings due to her frequent spying and eavesdropping)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you knew who your team was you had full confidence that you could live in this world. Another thing was eating at you was could Mons talk in this world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It appears that these two lands developed separately for millennia before first contact was made. There then followed a war triggered by a military assault upon an explorer from the land of giants, the anthropomorphic inhabitants of which are termed 'Titans'; however this war didn't really last long because, for all of humanity's technological development, no weapon they can craft can harm a titan. What basically happened is that humanity would send an expeditionary force to bring down the titans, but they never reported back having been captured usually within a week, and the titans would send envoys to try and make peace but who were attacked in a reactionary move that provoked them to just grab the assailants and go home. Peace eventually came due to popular protest from human civilians, appalled by the 'casualty rate', where a new enlightenment age began as the titans now had the opportunity to show the humans just what their society was like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titans' homeland, apparently named Gargantua, had been at peace since its unification some 50,000 years ago, all the jobs that needed to be done but which no one likes doing were typically done in some magical way allowing the titans to engage in more academic pursuits. It turned out that the humans who became POWs were given conditions of internment that were at least five times better than those laid out in what you knew as the Geneva Convention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, in these modern times, titans and humans...</span></div></div>",

Outside, you see many people running across the hall, screaming and searching for the exit. You try to call them for help but you know it wouldn't work. You stood there as the pod have unwillingly launched you off the wrecked ship and into the unknown. You looked ahead and could make out some of the other pods now leaving the ship.

Then it hit you as to who this is and your heart sank. It was Chrysalis. Here though? She was an antagonist in the show... She was wearing a Black Leather Jacket and some tight Jeans. Admittedly she was something of a goddess to you. Not just in size, but in looks. Her gorgeous Emerald hair sparkled in the sunlight and waved in the wind. Even from here you knew it would be silky smooth. Her eyes were like sparkling jewels that one could get lost in. Her figure was most impressive as well. Even if you were at your normal size, she'd be easily two heads taller then you. She had at least H-cup breasts and sizable butt. Her hourglass figure was something to behold. You figured that a better figure meant more love. but her largest feature, other then her size, was that the saying \"She's got Legs\" would be the understatement of the year. Her's went on for miles, literally and figuratively. <br>\r\nYou were so enraptured by her beauty that it took you a good few seconds to notice she was looking straight at you. You figured you were in trouble, then she gave you a smile. this smile was nothing you'd expect from her. it wasn't an evil one that filled you with dread. it was almost a loving a smile that calmed you.

We wouldn't want to hurt ourselves, now would we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were freaking out.<br>\r\nChrysalis shouldn't be here. Didn't she hate Starlight's guts after what she did? What the fuck is going on?<br>\r\nThe gigantic hand curled around your minuscule body and dropped you suddenly into a dark, warm place filled with a soft fabric. A loud zipping sound could be heard, telling you that she must've dropped you into her coat pocket and closed the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrysalis' deep, sultry voice filtered in through the thick leather, albeit a little muffled. \"Alright Glimmer, I got what I came here for. You can consider this a small down payment for your role in the destruction of my hive. The next time I see you. I'm still going to beat you to within an inch of your life, but this time. I won't slice you up with my claws..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks?\" came the bewildered reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a small pause before Chrysalis continued.<br>\r\n\"And don't take this to mean I'm going to go soft from your so-called \"friendship\". We're not friends, and I'll thank you to remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud drone from outside began to sound, and it began to feel ever hotter inside the felt lined pocket. Suddenly, a bright green flash surrounded your whole being, and you felt yourself being thrown back, colliding with the soft wall. The zipper rapidly unzips and you're lifted back out into the open air by a harsh green glow.<br>\r\nWhen you look back at Chrysalis you could see her expression had completely changed. There were tears in her eyes and her mouth was formed into a gentle smile.<br>\r\nShe redeposited you back onto her outstretched palm, finding it difficult to speak through her starined sobs.<br>\r\nWhen finally she spoke, her voice barely came above a whisper, and was choked with emotion.<br>\r\n\"I can't believe it. I can't believe I finally found you. My dear, sweet little...\"</span></div></div>",

After conquering the Earth, the Ancient Gods and their subjects were installed on this planet and built their cities. The few humans who survived were reduced and tucked in these exhibitions as if animals bunch.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nFaithless so look for a moment, that story you seem absurd but before testing you only have a say:<br>\r\n-what has to do all this with Eddy? <br>\r\n-Eddy hated living in this exhibit, that hate came from his father Harold, he was who plan how to escape from here. So you know Eddy family had access to old documents, one of them Codex Arcanus indicates how Exchange minds. <br>\r\n-Exchange minds? \u2013 you say confused - how can be possible that? <br>\r\n-The spell itself is very limited, only works if the other person is an exact double. <br>\r\n-You want to say! - shout annoying - nothing of what you say makes sense! <br>\r\nThe man lost the patience with you: <br>\r\n- is that you've not looked at in the mirror! - and telling his partner add \u2013 Norman show to Mark Thompson his face with the mirror and a photo of Eddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised to know that unknown man know your name, but this was in the background when Norman you pass the mirror and the photo. It turns out that Eddy not only had the same surname but that he was exactly the same to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-For you understand - said Norman - the universe to you remember is just one of infinite universes that exist in the multiverse, every universe has a different timeline, it is very rare that there are two versions of the same person. Eddy family discovered that they had dozens of doubles in other universes and one to one exchanged with them you minds, after of a transfer a henchman of the family was in charge of eliminating  the victim. When was the turn of Eddy him achievement to transfer but its another I  no could survive has the transfer, for this Eddy had to return to his body, killing the other I. During three years Eddy tried seventeen times with the same result. <br>\r\n-How then Eddy could exchange his mind with the mine?- you question curious. <br>\r\nNorman look at teammate and after a few seconds he response you:<br>\r\n-Eddy discovered he had a deformation in the brain caused by an accident as a child during months cruised in dreams searching the multiverse has some another I which had a similar defect-after a pause add \u2013 my and Frank following the orders of Eddy, we destroy all books and necessary gadgets for the transfer of minds. <br>\r\n-Why you helped him! - annoying questions to Norman<br>\r\n - Eddy knew other spells while the was here ever could disobey him. <br>\r\nNamely that never could return to your previous life you feel all your strength just, without hesitation you get has cry in your previous life had a girlfriend, friends and a great family, in a single night had lost to always. <br>\r\nFrank and Norman to see you cry cannot avoid feeling pity for you. Frank approaches you and tells you:<br>\r\n-listening Mark, i know that this is difficult for you, but if you listen us, you will see who live in this city isn\u2019t that bad.  <br>\r\nTo hear those words you decide: </span></div></div>",

You get out of your bed and start heading to your closet, but the closet is ... gone?  You look around your bedroom, and you realize that all of the doors are gone!  All that's left is the window, but you live on the seventh floor of an apartment building, so that won't do any good.  You look for a telephone, but instead of one you find an intercom button.  You don't remember this, but at least you can call someone for help now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing down the button, you yell, \"Excuse me, is the management there?\"  Immediately you hear a crackly female voice you don't recognize giggle a bit before answering, \"You don't have to be so formal, Chuck.  Well, I'm glad your finally awake, did you forget to set your alarm clock?  I told you that I would be cleaning the apartment today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, don't come yet, I'm not dressed appropriately!\" you shout into the intercom, not wanting any kind of woman see you in messy clothing without shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how much you want an extra set of clothes, Chuck, but I told you that I can't afford to get another set in your size.  Besides, I spent a good deal of cash on our intercom, and many people in the city are already horribly jealous of that.  I'll be there in a minute to get you out of your apartment so I can clean it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that the woman would not return your next message, you wait by the window, not knowing what else to do.  It does look like a good day, it is very bright and the weather looks beautiful.  You look down, and unusually there are no cars out.  In fact, the whole city looks barren.  Where could everybody be?  The woman did mention that there were many people in the city, and you remember there being at least half a million individuals based on the last census.  Suddenly, the brightness around the city goes dark, and an unusual sliding sound is heard.  You wonder what kind of freak weather change could be occuring and look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with a loud popping noise, your room heaves forward, exposing it to the outside air.  It is very odd that your apartment now acts much like a drawer; you wonder how the management could have set that up without you noticing.  It's even odder that the entire sky is black, white and pink, and moving straight towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no time to panic as your apartment lurches high into the air and flips upside down.  You fall about twenty feet before landing on a soft pink part of the sky.  Except that this is definitely not the sky, it is a huge feline paw!  You can see your apartment above you gripped gently between two huge pads, each one many times larger than the apartment itself!  Looking down, you see a black and white striped wall of fur that makes your city seem very small in comparison.  You also notice that there is a glass dome next to the city; it looks like it could make a snowglobe of the town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Chuck, now that your up, why don't you join the rest of town with breakfast so I can get to work?\" spoke the humongous white tiger woman above you.  Picking you up in two massive pink pads, you are whisked into a little tray by the city and lowered in.  You smell eggs and sausages, and everyone seems to be mad at you for your tardiness.  You are very confused, but strangely unafraid.  It's almost as if your previous, tedious life of a pencil pusher has been, dare you think it, vastly improved.</span></div></div>",

All of your attention is directed on that huge white tiger woman; you can't seem to think about anything else.  Some people try to talk to you, but you only answer with little grunts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow can anyone not admire the hugeness of this anthro?  She is very attractive and looks very strong and muscular, yet at the same time she is so dainty and gentle when she cleans the city.  The entire city could be demolished by one swipe of her massive paw, yet she deftly handles each building like a pro.  Even the largest skyscraper in the city isn't even half the height of one of her finger pads, yet she can expertly scrub each floor with a brush on a long handle, then gently wipe every corner with the tiniest yellow cloth.  The way that she places those buildings down so softly, you have no doubt that there isn't a single piece of furniture out of place in any of the buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sip some more coffee, and realize that it has gone cold.  You look around, and all of the half million or so people are avoiding you.  You don't know why, so you ask a prominent looking lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we avoiding you?  Humph!\" the lady remarked rather rudely.  \"I didn't know you needed people to talk to.  I know, why don't you ask your 'girlfriend' to get you some human friends!\"  The lady stormed away in a huff, and you reason that she's probably just jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon, people were being scooped up by the thousands as the tiger woman placed them on a soft pillow-like object in town square.  Well, it would take far too long to place everyone in their apartments separately, so this way is probably to cut time.  Soon, everybody is back in town except for you, and the anthro tiger now reaches for you.  However, you are apparently not going back to town, as the tiger carries you to...</span></div></div>",

For an anthro, you thought of her pretty cute.  She finally stops at her place looking down at you as she opens door with a smile on her face. Entering the house, she closed the door behind her as you assume this is the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for a living room, it is huge. The ceiling looked like it was past the sky and beyond. The nicely colored white and black furniture with a fake white and black tiger rug seemed to you like skyscrapers. \"It's pretty small but I hope you don't mind chuck,\" she blushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Small...you kidding me...it's like a freaking country,\" you said in awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's probably from your view,\" She smiled as she went towards the couch and took a seat.

For all it's wonderful features, it is still, in fact, a very nice cage for your new owner to keep his pet in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when, for the first time, you hear his voice, both as a subsonic rumble all around you and coming from the speaker in your belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Is this thing working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but look up at the towering being now, wincing as you realize that he's gotten the earstud that allows for proper communication to work.  Anything he says while wearing the stud, you'll hear, and vice-versa.  Your voice cracks a bit as you reply, a reminder that you've hardly spoken twelve words since your arrival on this world. No sense in talking when no one can hear you. \"Yessir.  I can hear you just fine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive cat stoops, his face seeming to fill the entire sky as he looks down at you in the house, a wide grin splitting his muzzle. \"No need to call me 'sir'.  It's Antiony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod dumbly for a moment before realizing that he can't actually see you, still trying to work your head around the situation. \"Oh. . . okay, Antionysir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat can't help but chuckle at that, but he clearly understands your nervousness. \"Well I've got some news, my little friend . . </span></div></div>",

Her Light green eyes stare down upon you as a small smirk emerges upon her muzzle. The top of her head was adorned with blond locks of hair, that was styled into a ponytail. She wore a simple sleeveless white shirt as her hands rested upon one another on top of the desk. \"you know, you really need to work on your sleeping habits.\" She teases with a small giggle to follow. \"I mean, how else do you expect to get a good grade in math?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudging by her overall friendly demeanor and playful attitude towards you, it seemed as though she was some sort of friend of yours.

You asked if I could help you study for the math quiz coming up later this week?\" she reminds you while giving your stomach a playful poke with her furred finger. As you backed up slightly from the light force of the poke, you continue to stare up at her still in utter confusion. Here you were stuck in some odd predicament with some gigantic anthro vixen you hardly knew anything about. Despite how strange this event was for you, it seemed like the best thing you could do at the moment was simply play along with whatever was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"o-oh right!\" you quickly nod and feign a smile while looking up at her. \"how could I forget about that test coming up?\" you lie while mustering a chuckle. \"guess I must still be half asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, you always do doze off in class now and then.\" she chuckles while grabbing a piece of paper from the sides of the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you watch her prepare her materials, so many questions began to emerge inside your head. Who is this odd huge vixen? Exactly who is it that you're pretending to be? and most importantly, just how did you end up here!?

Time quickly began to fly by as the two of you went over some rather simple math equations together. Not wanting to seem strange like earlier, you tried your best to answer the questions slowly, even going as far as purposely making the wrong answer just to hide your true identity.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Seeing as how you hardly knew a thing about your supposed family, let alone how this odd world functioned, you decide it would be best to stay with Gwen for the time being. \"Well, I guess it would be best to stay with you for the night.\" You reply. \"I mean, it's already late like you said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looks down upon your small form and gives a nod. \"Alright then.\" She acknowledges your answer. \"Your family already knows that you stay with me most of the time, so there really isn't any need to call them up.\" She states as she makes her way to a humongous dresser and carefully sets you on top. \"besides, you spent the night many times before, so another night wouldn't hurt.\" she chuckles as she begins to clean up the small mess upon her desk. As you wait upon the top of the wooden surface, you take the liberty to look about the interior of Gwen's room from your position. In appearance it looked completely identical to any average teenage girl\u2019s room back on Earth. Adorning the green colored walls were a mixture of posters and framed pictures of figures and places that you had no idea about. As your gaze soon focuses upon the dresser top you were standing on, you realize that a small set of stuffed toys were arranged right beside you along with a rather large framed photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with Curiosity, you make your way towards the large rectangular frame in order to get a better view of the image within. The colored photograph was clearly a portrait of Gwen, obviously at a much younger age, yet there was something about the photo that immediately caught your attention. At first you were curious as to why she appeared so close in the photo, but with some closer inspection, you realize that there was something upon the palm of her raised hand. As you stare closely upon the odd figure, your mouth nearly goes agape as the odd thing turned out to be none other than you! While it was indeed hard to comprehend, the tiny person within the photo was an exact mirrored version of you, though at a much younger age. The unexpected sight suddenly gets your mind thinking at full steam of your predicament. Were you stuck within some sort of strange alternate dimension where anthros and humans lived side by side? If so then just what happened to the supposed 'you' of this universe? As your mind began producing question after question, the voice of Gwen quickly snaps you back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while since that day huh?\" Gwen asks while staring down upon the photo from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your gaze backwards to face the massive vixen while trying your best to hide your confusion. \"It sure has.\" You reply while giving a quick nod. It seemed that now was the perfect opportunity to catch up on some history that you supposedly shared with her. \"While I do remember getting the photo taken...my mind is still a bit fuzzy about what else happened that day.\" You say before taking a small glimpse back at the photo. \"Mind reminding me what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGwen looks down at you somewhat flabbergasted but soon began mustering a small giggle. \"Did you really forget?\" She teases while giving your sides a small poke. \"It happened seven years ago. When we first met.\" she says as she places her right elbow upon the dressers surface and uses her hand to support her chin. \"You transferred schools halfway during the year and ended up in my middle school class. At first you looked completely shocked, seeing as how this was the first school you ever attended where both anthros and humans were in the same building.\" She says while recalling the nostalgic memory. \"You needed a student to show you around the school and help you out...So, I was the first who offered. After talking a bit, and finally managing to get you comfortable around anthros, we soon became friends...in fact, you were the first human friend I ever made.\" Once Gwen concludes her story she looks down at you with a warm smile and gaze. \"And as you can see, we've been friends for quite some time.\" She laughs, causing you to join in on the small outburst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Thanks for refreshing my memory.\" You reply while chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I'm going to get ready for bed.\" Gwen slowly stands upwards to fetch a small pile of clothing besides the dresser. \"I'll be right back, so just stay here alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't really have any other place to head to.\" You respond, causing Gwen to let out a burst of giggles as she exits her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she finally leaves, you sit down upon the dresser top while letting out a long sigh. Pretending to be someone else, especially someone who you had very little knowledge about was an extremely daunting task. As you reflect upon your attempts at imitation, you can't help but wonder if the 'you' from this universe was stuck facing the same situation. That is of course, if there was actually a different 'you' at all. As you begin to wonder if you could even manage this strange masquerade act, you can't help but continue thinking about Gwen for some reason. While she's an extremely caring and smart friend, you ponder if she would actually believe you if you told her that you actually came from a different world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought was quickly interrupted by the sound of her door opening.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a sigh of relief, you watch as Gwen soon reenters her room garbed in a pair of light blue cotton short shorts, and a yellow shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"sorry to keep you waiting.\" she apologizes while an awkward smile draws upon her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"it's alright Gwen.\" you immediately reply as she makes her way towards your location. Like before, she slowly places her massive hand down right besides you allowing you to make your way up on her padded palm. As soon as you were within the center of her ginormous hand, she gingerly lifts you upwards so that you were leveled right to her chest. While you did manage to get a good look of the interior of her room, you can't help but wonder just where you will be sleeping for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Gwen?\" you call out, managing to gain her attention. \"Where am I going to sleep for the night?\" you ask curiously while trying to keep a firm standing ground upon the leathery surface of her palm. Gwen once again stares down at you with a confused expression stuck on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"you know, you've been acting really strange after that nap you took earlier.\" she admits causing a small nervous shudder to run down your spine. \"but since your so curious, you'll be sleeping with me like always.\" she replies causing a shade of red to emerge upon your cheeks. Sleep with her!? You repeat inside you head with utter disbelief. While it was indeed quite a shock to find out where you were sleeping, it was even more shocking just how much she was okay with the idea. Your surprise soon turns to worry as you began to wonder if it truly was a safe idea to be sleeping with her. With her gt size, you could easily end up getting crushed with the smallest of movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm... No offense Gwen...\" you stammer awkwardly while staring downwards slightly. \"But do you really think that's such a good idea?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what do you mean?\" she asks with a tilted head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...what if I probably get squashed or something?\" you explain.\"I mean, you could easily crush me without even knowing.\" while you were being dead honest with your question, Gwen soon begins to giggle as if thinking it was probably some sort of joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"don't be ridiculous!\" she chuckles. \"whenever we sleep together, you always end up being a-ok. I mean, when did you start becoming so cautious around me?\" she jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as it was hard to believe, you ultimately decide to take her word on sleeping. \"Just making sure.\" you reply as if trying to go along with the supposed joke. Gwen soon walks her way to her gigantic sized bed and begins to lay her body upon the purple comforter. As she was making herself comfortable upon the beds surface, she makes sure to keep you firmly in her grip insuring you wouldn't fall. Once she was positioned, she then gently sets your small body down on top of her stomach. As soon as you make contact with her shirt you can't help but notice just how soft the surface was. Whether it was the fabric of the shirt, or Gwens fur underneath, you carefully lie your body down to experience the incredibly comfortable sensation. Once your back makes contact with the fabric of her shirt you feel your body rhythmically move upwards and downwards with each breath Gwen made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Comfy?\" She asks while staring downwards with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very.\" you admit while shuffling your laying position a bit. Gwen chuckles in response causing the whole area of her stomach to bounce you lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm glad my body is soft enough for you to sleep on.\" she replies before slowly petting the top of your head with a finger. Now that she mentioned it, her body really did seem like the best replacement for a bed, at least in your opinion. \"good night Toby.\" She mutters in an exhausted voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night Gwen.\" You answer back while staring upwards at the ceiling. Within minutes, Gwen's soft shirt and warm body soon drew you into slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curious as to whether Gwen was still fast asleep or not, you avert your gaze above you in hopes of getting a sight of her massive face. Rather than viewing upon the massive vixens muzzle, your eyes instead stare upon the massive two mountains that were Gwen's breasts. Flustered from the sight, you quickly turn your head towards the left to face the wall of her room. as your embarrassment slowly begins to die down, you take the rhythmic breathing below you as a sign that she was still fast asleep. Not wanting to interrupt her slumber, you decide to simply lay upon the soft surface of her stomach for the time being until she finally woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a couple minutes, you soon began to hear a low moan emanating above from Gwen's head. Taking that as a sign that she was about to wake up, you carefully sat up on her shirt while turning your body behind. While the sight of her chest was indeed hard to overlook, you try your best to avoid making contact with the two massive hills in hopes of not being seen as a pervert.just when you thought she was about to sit upwards, Gwen soon did the unexpected. Within seconds, you soon begin to feel yourself tilt towards the right side of her stomach. It didn't take you long to shockingly realize that she was starting to turn her body in her sleep. As you feel your world begin to shift from the sudden movements, you soon find yourself tumbling down the vast valley of fabric that was Gwen's shirt, towards her bed. In moments you soon find yourself landing on the soft surface of her blanket, luckily unharmed. Your short moment of relief was soon short lived as her huge stomach soon rolled it's way on top of your tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were trapped in complete darkness, you were sure that you were dead from Gwen's unconscious rolling, or so you thought. Uncertain of where you were, you move your hands and legs underneath the cramped yet soft surfaces around you to realize that you miraculously managed to survive getting crushed by Gwen's body. The only problem now was just how were you going to escape from underneath her? There's no telling when she'll wake up, and due to you being stuck somewhere underneath her stomach it would be extremely challenging to find just which direction to head towards.</span></div></div>",

Despite hardly even knowing which direction led where, you ultimately decide to let your instincts guide you underneath the massive shirt towards freedom. After choosing a random direction to head to, you begin to crawl your way between the two soft surfaces amidst the darkness. If there was one thing you were extremely grateful about at the moment, it was the fact that you managed to have a bit of room to crawl successfully crawl underneath Gwen\u2019s body. If she was a tad bit lower, it would be nearly impossible to crawl, let alone move a single muscle against her and the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes passed by as you continue your trek underneath the ginormous vixens frame, yet to your disappointment there was still no sign of light around you. Could it be that you were simply crawling in circles? Or maybe you took some sort of wrong turn not to long ago? Either or, it seemed as if trying to find the way out was the equivalent of finding a needle within a haystack, a really huge haystack that is. As you continue onwards, you soon began to notice that the fabric of Gwen\u2019s shirt above you slowly began to descend towards you. At first you think that it\u2019s probably some part of Gwen\u2019s stomach lying extremely close to the mattress, but as you went further ahead you soon notice that the surface of her body was extremely soft compared to earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStrange\u2026\u201d you mutter to yourself as you experimentally give the odd surface of her body a small push with one of your hands. As soon as you apply force against the shirt, you soon notice that your hand began to get a better feel for the odd surface. It was extremely soft to the touch no doubt about that, but it also carried some sort of odd feeling to it as well, almost as if it jiggled slightly from your touches. As you began to question just where you were, a rhythmic sound emanating not too far soon catches the attention of your ears. The sounds were that of simple low thumps, beating in a rhythmic pattern almost like a heart. Within moments your eyes soon widen with shear disbelief as you finally got a good idea of where your location was. Judging by the soft area of Gwen\u2019s body and the sound of a supposed heart, you were without a doubt somewhere under her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive blush emerges on your face as your body was soon met by the gentle touch of one of her colossal breasts. While this was without a doubt the closest you\u2019ve ever gotten to a girls chest, you never expected to end up being so close to one in a predicament like this. As much as you were flustered from this awkward moment, you nervously begin to wonder just how Gwen would react seeing you so close against her chest. Fearing just how angry she might get, and whether or not you would be ultimately unharmed, you quickly began to squirm your way towards the left of your location. Thanks to her chest above you, you were able to tell whether or not you were straying off path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter squirming as quickly as you could underneath her, you luckily manage to spot a faint light not too far from your location. Without the least bit of hesitation, you scramble your way towards the illuminated area where you were soon greeted by the sight of Gwen\u2019s green painted wall. With a sigh of relief and low chuckle, you quickly pull yourself free from underneath the yellow fabric of Gwen\u2019s shirt and out onto the top of her mattress. For a few <br>\r\nmoments, you relish your victory in escaping before turning your head to gaze upon her form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you was indeed her massive breast just as you predicted, but towards the left of your position was her huge head lying comfortably upon her pillow. With a low moan, Gwen slowly shrugs her shoulders upwards before drowsily opening her eyes. As soon as her large orbs were opened, she averted her gaze downwards where she immediately began scanning the area. As soon as your body was within focus, a large smile emerges on her muzzle as she stares down upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning Toby.\u201d She greets in a soft, yet exhausted tone. \u201cSo how did you sleep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026it was soft.\u201d You admit with a small chuckle, hiding the fact that you spent almost all morning trying to escape from underneath her body. Gwen simply giggles at the answer as she begins to sit upwards on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwell...ready to go get some breakfast?\u201d she asks as a toothy grin begins to emerge on her muzzle.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And then blink again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFully opening your eyes, you aren't quite sure what you're seeing. And endless forest of chocolate brown... hairs? rose up into the sky, filling your field of view. Every way you turned simply showed more titanic brown hair fibres. Figuring you may as well and cry out for help - for all the good it was likely to do you, perhaps someone else was trapped in this bizarre location - and draw in a breath, preparing to shout...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you can't. No sound comes out. Frantically grabbing at your throat,  you run your fingers up and down it. Nothing seemed to be amiss, but how the hell were you now mute!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel the entire world slowly shifting, the ground quickly tilting to an almost vertical level. Helpless, you fall through the forest of brown hair, the air whipping past your ears as you fall. Suddenly, the ground rushes up to meet you, and, instead of being flattened into a pancake, you were perfectly fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMind you, the ground was very wierd as well. A dark greyish black plane that stretched on for miles, and felt both somewhat hard and somewhat soft. Just as you were wondering whether you had gone insane and were trapped in some bizarre hallucination, a shadow is cast across...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearfully looking up into the sky, you see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearfully looking up into the sky, you see an utterly titanic horse's muzzle descending at a rapid rate, tilting until the mile wide eyes can focus on you. A voice that sounded like it belonged to a goddess harmlessly boomed from up above, the sound waves somehow not pulverising your body where it stood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Morning, Specky! Oh, you look so cute today! Come here and give your mistress a big hug!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jaw hangs open slightly, the colour long having drained from your face. Unresponsive, you stare up at the muzzle with pure, dumb, awe. You... Knew who this was. Or rather, who it had been. Before waking up in this insane reality, you had owned several pets. One of them being a chocolate brown mare named Bella. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed that now, you were the pet. And either you were the size of a microbe, or Bella...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to think about how big she was, it made your head start to hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella peers down at you, concern somehow recognisable on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Specky? Are you okay?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to shiver almost imperceptibly. You barely notice, but Bella easily feels the tiny vibrations from your comparatively miniscule body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnclosing you within her fist, Bella brings her hand up to eye level, opening up her palm to reveal your cowering form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I knew amnesia was relatively common for humans, but I didn't think...\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel the weight of a city block sized finger gently rubbing your back. Heck, it could have been the size of a city itself for all you know, you have no way of grasping the scale Bella had grown to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Don't worry, Specky, it's okay...

It was not until you put on a heavy set of jeans and a shirt that you started to see something was wrong.  What made you realize something was wrong was that all of your furniture seemed to be on a huge wood floor.  There was no hallway for as far as you could see, but all of your stuff appeared to be in one corner of a gigantic room.  The walls seemed to go on for miles.  Light was filtering into the room from a window that looked larger than your family\u2019s farm was supposed to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think that you are just having a weird dream, but when you pinch yourself nothing happens.  Now you are starting to get a little nervous.  \u201cMom, dad, are you there?\u201d you call out.  There is no response.  \u201cMary, Tom, where are you?\u201d you yell to your brother and sister and receive no response.  \u201cJace, come here boy,\u201d you call out to your border collie in the vain hope that he will respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing master,\u201d you hear an unfamiliar voice respond from what seems like miles away.  You wonder what could make itself heard over that distance.  Then something comes into view.  It was absolutely huge and headed straight in your direction.  The creature kind of reminded you of your dog, except he was walking on two legs and a good 70 miles tall.  You were paralyzed at the sight of the massive canine which made you look like something less than a speck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked what must have been hundreds, if not thousands of miles within a few seconds.  Then he got down on all fours and you saw that he was wearing a dog collar.  On that collar was a dog tag with the name Jace etched into it.  It did not seem possible, but this unbelievably huge creature was your loyal and lovable dog Jace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJace\u2019s muzzle was mere inches from your face, filling your entire field of vision before a huge pink tongue darted out and gave you the biggest lick you had ever experienced.  Your entire body was covered in a thin layer of dog drool, but it made you fell safer around the humongous dog.  He was obviously trying to show you his affection and that was much better than him stepping on you or trying to eat you.  \u201cGood morning master, are you ready for me to take you to breakfast with the rest of the family?\u201d Jace asked in a warm, friendly manner.</span></div></div>",

Lightly grabbing you with the index finger and thumb of his right hand. He placed you in his left hand as he stood up. You were gasping for breath by how fast all this happened. Even though he did it as slow as he can. He can't sop the physics of different sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking with you in his cup hands. You sat down know you can't stand without falling over. It was an amazing sight to watch your own dog carry you in his dome size hands. Especially the fact that he can talk shocks you more then his size. \"So master, you want to play before we head down to breakfast,\" Jace stops to ask you as his puppy like eyes weighed you down with cuddliness. You knew that there is no way a massive creature like this can play with a speck like you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you wanted to do it for some reason. A feeling of you wanted to see how you play with Jace these days. He's you're loyal dog and is still loyal to you even though you can easily be his pet standing at his toes. \"Well master,\" Jace said as he turned his head to add more to the affect. It was risky and dumb but yet you don't want to let your boy down...you know you're not scared of him if you say no but you don't want to let him down. \"Please,\" Jace said knowing you were thinking about it. </span></div></div>",

You are at first a little worried that you are going to get squashed, but the square mile of pink softness stopped a foot above you.  You wait for a bit before Jace replies, \"Go ahead, master, grab a strand of fur.\"  Unsure of what you were doing, you reach above you and grab the tip of a silky brown strand.  The fur is very thick like a tree trunk, and you can't even wrap your arms all the way around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then recognize the game as \"Tug of War\" as Jace very lightly drags you across his paw.  You try to pull back, and amazingly you are able to stay anchored in place.  You are astounded that your dog can control how softly he pulls his finger so well, almost as if he knows exactly how weak you are compared to him.  Jace does keep his promise, and after only a minute of this, he suddenly jerks slightly, causing you to lose your grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour loyal friend carefully carried you into the kitchen, placing you on a tall table.  You notice the commodities of a normal sized kitchen arranged on a small spot on the large table, and you start to make a bowl of cereal.  You are not very hungry, as you are too shocked by the fact that Jace is a seventy mile anthro.  The rest of the family is already up, and you realize that Jace must have carried them in here as well.  You go to your place at the table, and amazingly you find the place set.  You realize that Jace must have done that too, and you silently thank him as you start to dig in to your cereal.  Jace meanwhile gets an enourmous box of dog food from a gigantic cabinet and pours thousands of tons of food into a dog bowl.  You find it odd that Jace is suddenly so humanlike, and yet still does lots of the things he used to.  He is surprisingly well mannered at the table, yet he is eating out of a dog bowl.  He is certainly as smart as you, if not even smarter now, but still sees you as a master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce breakfast is over, it's time for morning chores.  Jace scoops you up in his paw and starts to carry you to the enormous front door.  It is then that you remember that today is the day when you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You know that you have to feed the chickens today.  That should not be that bad.  The bags with the chicken feed were normally pretty heavy, but with a giant dog like Jace to help you out this should actually be pretty easy.  You do wonder how the rest of your family is supposed to get around this huge house until some of the other family pets show up.  Jace was not the only dog that the family owned.  He was just the dog that you had always considered your dog.  Your parents and your brother were each taken by a different dog and your sister was taken by the family cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a second surprise for you when the family cat arrived.  She was not as large as the dogs, but she was still huge and walked on two legs.  If you had to guess she was a large compared to the dogs as she used to be.  That made her considerably smaller than Jace, but even then you were still only a speck compared to her.  You wondered if she could talk too.  Jace was already carrying you off to your daily chores though and you would just have to see if she could talk later in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJace carried you to a door made to his size and you tried to look at the ground.  You wondered if there was a smaller door for you down there.  If there was you were too far away to see it from here.  It probably did not matter though.  If there was ever an emergency and you did not have Jace or one of the other pets available you doubt you would ever make it to the front door.  Many of the rooms in the house must be over a thousand miles long.  Even if you were driving in a car it would take the better part of a day, if not longer than a day just to travel across one room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise Jace paused at the front door and he just looked at you.  That was when you remembered he needed your permission to go outside.  You said it was alright for him to go outside and he eagerly opened the door and headed for the storage closet that had the chicken feed in it.  When you saw the huge bags of chicken feed you had to assume that the chickens were giants as well.  There was no chance that you were going to be able to carry one of those bags and you were not surprised when Jace grabbed the bags and headed to the chicken pen on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chickens immediately started moving toward the fencing when they spotted Jace.  As the bags of feed had indicated those chickens were huge.  Once again, the chickens were only as large compared to Jace as they used to be before you woke up today.  That did not mean all that much to you since that still made them well over 20 miles tall.  It took you a while to notice that all of the chickens had hands on their wings and that they looked a little bit thinner, a little more like a human.  \u201cGood morning master.  Hi Jace,\u201d the chickens chorused.  Even the chickens still acknowledged you as their master for some strange reason.  You would have to get a hold of a history book to figure out how all of this came about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJace started tossing chicken feed into the pen and the chickens still pecked it off the ground like they normally do.  You did not want to get in the pen with those chickens though.  Even a small piece of chicken feed was over a thousand feet long.  You wondered why Jace even brought you along with him if he was going to do all of the work.  Then, when Jace was finished, he looked at you with those big eyes of his and you realized he wanted something.  Well, Jace was a dog and you figured there could only be one thing that he wanted.  \u201cGood boy Jace, you\u2019re a really good dog,\u201d you said.  Jace responded by waging his tail and giving you a little lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had some other things to do today, but you thought about sticking around and talking to the chickens.  It was not everyday that you woke up in a world of giant manimals and you really might want to start asking some questions about how things work here.</span></div></div>",

Beckoning the rooster over, Jace slowly set you down on a massive feather on its wing.  Jace waited patiently as the rooster strutted into the hen house along with the rest of the chickens.  As soon as he entered, you ask the huge fowl your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, rooster, I've been wondering, why do all of you huge man-animals obey humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rooster chuckled a bit, which sounded a lot like clucking, before replying, \"Because, humans are our masters, silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean why bother taking orders from someone so much smaller than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no reply to that.  Instead, you try a different approach.  \"Let me word this differently.  What do you animals like about humans?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, many of the hens in the coop chime in, obviously itching to answer this question.  <br>\r\n\"Oh, humans are so smart and decisive all the time!\"  <br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree Mabel, you humans seem to know everything!\"  <br>\r\n\"I like that they're so kind to us too.\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly!  Like how they showed us how to build this hen house!\"<br>\r\n\"All that, plus you are all so tiny and cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are amazed at all of the praise you are getting from the hens.  They do not even sound like they are trying to suck up to you; you can tell that they speak what they really feel.  Mostly, they talk of how smart humans are, so you realize that humans must have used their knowledge as their main tool to assume command of the anthros.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rooster, with you still hitching a ride on one of his feathers, struts over to some of the nests.  As he makes a round, the hens all say that they unfortunately do not have any eggs.  As you are about to ask why, the rooster responds...</span></div></div>",

That comment really struck you.  How could they possibly expect you, a tiny little human, to handle the weasel when they did not think the rooster, that looked large and powerful to you, could handle the weasel?  The rooster could pluck you off his feather right now and you would not even count as a snack to the massive bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rooster just guffawed before turning to you and asking, \u201cSpeaking of which, how do you plan on handling this weasel master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, um, well, you see\u2026it\u2019s a secret,\u201d you stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, you can tell us,\u201d said a hen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right, you know you\u2019re the biggest gossip on the farm Cathy,\u201d said another hen.

At least you managed to get out of there without having to explain how you planned on defeating the colossal weasel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJace was waiting for you patiently outside of the chicken coop and you were once again astonished by his size.  After being around all those chickens it was hard to imagine that Jace was considerably larger than any four of them put together.

It appeared the giant dog was just as attached to you as he had been when he had been normal sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nuzzled you a bit and gave you a couple of little licks once he had you back in his paws.  It was nice having such a sweet giant dog, but his breath still smelled pretty bad and you were now covered in dog drool.  You were going to have to remember to tell him to take it easy whenever he got a hold of you.

That's it, Bessie! A pretty common cow name you chuckle to yourself. Jace finally reaches the barn and walks around to the side of the barn door, to a door specially fitted for humans. Jace sets you down and then calmly lies down to wait for your return. You stand outside the human door on the enormous barn, gather up your courage, and then walk inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the building is slightly dark and the air is cool,but it really smells. The air has the typical foul farm animal barn smell to it. You'd think after all these \"years\" of living on a farm you'd be used to it, but you guess you're not. You decide to continue walking in, you have to travel down a long tunnel before popping out into the enormous main room of the barn. Looking around you see that the main room is not divided into seperate stalls for some reason. You figure the reason is is that Bessie is the only animal in here. Well you think, you don't acutally see Bessie. The barn contains some different sections to it, like smaller rooms, but without being closed off. Bessie must be sleeping in one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for something, there has to be something. And then, you spot it. There's some kind of button panel against the wall to your right. You spot a large blue button that says \"Wake Up Call.\" Seeing nothing else, you press it. Upon pressing it a large buzzer rings once and then stops. Then the rumbling starts. The very ground beneath your feet begins to quake. Bessie walks in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first thought is \"Holy cow!\", your second is \"Woah Bessie!\", and  your third thought is \"My cow is hot! And massive!\" Bessie is the single largest creature you've seen all day. She has to be thousands of miles tall! And she's not really a cow anymore, she has the body of a women, a very hot women you might add, with the features of a cow. She has patches of white and black fur, no horns, and no udders. She walks upright on legs that end in hooves and then she has arms that end in hands. You also noticed for some reason porportionally she's bigger than a normal cow after mentally comparing her to Jace, who barely comes up to the top of her hoof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you didn't really focus on these things, what you did focus on was her massive, heaving breasts which shook and swung with every titanic step. You feel your pants begin to get a little tight, but that soon ends as Bessie draws nearer because, you're afraid. The ginormous cow walks right up near you (relatively) and comes to a halt. Your breath begins to shorten as you feel your instincts begin to take over, making you ready to run at any moment, at the first sign of danger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, but can't see anything past her titanic titties. She then makes a move, crouching down and bending over. Her massive face comes down near yours until her muzzle is almost touching you. You see her eyes looking down at you kindly as she gently says with the force of the heavens, \"Good morning master.\" Her breath rushes past you with much force and you stare at her a moment before saying, \"Good morning Bessie.\" You are suprised that she can even see you, let alone hear you, at your size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth again to speak and you look at her teeth, each one big enough to crush several cities. \"Are you ready for milking master?\" You stare at her for a moment and then say \"Yes.\" Bessie looks at you expectingly and realizing that you were supposed to do something you turn to the button panel and see a button labeled \"Milking equipment.\" You press it and then hear something slide open far above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBessie stands back up, grabs two milking contraptions, and then attaches one to each of her breasts. Once done, she looks down at you again and you turn to button panel once more. You press a button labeled \"Milking\" and then you hear massive machinery begin to chug millions of gallons of milk from her gigantic breasts.</span></div></div>",

You try to get up, but realize that your body is immobile.  The dream you just had continues to dance in your head, and no matter how hard you try, you can't shake it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, your body slowly starts to rise off of your bed!  You have no control over moving your body, so you can only stare at the ceiling in fear as it moves closer.  You hear your bedroom window slide open, then you are maneuvered in midair towards the portal to the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as your head is exposed to the chilly air of the wee hours, you notice something absolutely mindboggling floating in the sky; a giant ship.  It is not a saucer, but more shaped like a conventional rocket.  It seems to be floating using an odd unseeable power, and you realize that you must be having another odd dream or you are being abducted by aliens.  The ship is massive; it extends almost from horizon to horizon, yet must be several miles in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body then starts rising up, up, up to the spacecraft.  You are glad that you cannot look down, as the view would be very frightening.  The air becomes cooler, but for some reason not absolutely frigid like it should.  You are even only wearing your boxers, which should make your body more exposed to the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon see a hatch that the eerie light emanates from, and you don't doubt that that is where you are heading.  Sure enough, you float inside the ship, and suddenly everything goes dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou regain control of your body as soon as the lights turn off, but you are obviously no less fearful.  You hear odd movements outside that seem to come from all around you.  Unexpectedly, a door opens in front of you and you stumble into an odd room.  You see other humans in here; ten including you, and from their appearance they look like they have all come from different parts of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, you ask, \"Can anyone tell me what's going on?\"  You don't even realize that half of these people are women and you are still in your boxers, though they probably would be too shaken to notice.  One woman says, in an Australian accent, \"Nobody here knows whats going on.  From what I can gather, we all woke up from a weird dream about giant man-animals to find themselves floating towards this huge ship in the sky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find it very unusual that everyone has had the strange dream you did.  Suddenly, everyone starts shouting as the walls of the roomto lift up.  You soon realize that you are in the presence of a pair of absolutely enormous draconic anthros!  You are all inside of a little glass box, levitating in the air before two faces, which you see as one male and one female.  The creatures must be several thousands of miles tall!  As your senses knock you for a loop, a single sentence forms in your mind: \"Do not fear us, Earthlings, for we come in peace.\"</span></div></div>",

Currently radio transmissions were not registering any response, in spite of accounting for a ten-minute delay at this stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a number of rumours circulating about throughout the day but little else was heard until the evening news, where you learn that the apparent spaceship was now in orbit around the Earth, moving faster than its altitude would suggest. Other indications suggested it was a massive vessel of 500 miles in diameter and longer than the diameter of the Earth itself. Amazingly it was having no gravitational influence on the world. Reports came in indicating a raised military alert status as a precautionary measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore information didn't get through until 10 o'clock when the final news report of the day told of a final achievement in radio communication. Indications suggested that the aliens inside the vessel spoke at least English if not other languages of Earth, although they could've been in possession of translators of some kind, and that they were expressing peaceful intentions for them to study life on Earth in exchange for sharing knowledge about their own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext morning you were just about to set off when a phone call came through. A gruff voice told you that the aliens had apparently managed to pick out specific civilians they wished to meet and you were on the list. Stunned you talked for a while before it became apparent that the military were the ones who had decided to alert you to this fact, a jeep was on its way at that very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it arrived you had packed sufficiently for a week's holiday, expecting to be out of the house for more than a day or two.

The longer you stare, the  better your vision gets. You slowly realize that what you thought was the ground was actually a nightstand in a giant bedroom that extends for what must be dozens of miles in every direction, with a ceiling that is at least one hundred miles high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking your head, you call out into the vast room. \"Hello? Where am I?\" You shout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like our little man is awake girls!\" a female voice echos from another room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! It's been days since he's come down with that fever.\" A second voice says soon after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know how men are. Their tiny bodies are more susceptible to illness than ours.\" says a third voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wonder who those voices belong to, tremors rock the room as the door on the far side of the room opens. You let out a gasp as a massive anthro tiger that is easily seventy miles tall walks in. She has her jet black hair tied in a ponytail, with just a hint of red lipstick applied to her orange and black striped face. She's wearing a tight black t-shirt that contours around a set of F-cup breasts, each the size of a large city. Looking down, a pair of blue jeans do little to hide her shapely hips, and you can see the hint of a thong poking out of them as she steps aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight behind the tiger is a comparatively shorter anthro mouse who is roughly fifty miles tall. Upon looking at you she lets out a squeal of delight and does a small twirl, her long pink hair spinning around her grey fur as she does so. She's not as curvy as the tiger was, with a pair of breasts no bigger than a C-cup, but more than makes up for her smaller chest with an absolutely massive ass that could flatten a metropolis. Her shorts don't even cover a quarter of her thick thighs, and a sports bra that fits her well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the first two anthros were huge, they both pale in comparison to the ninety mile tall anthro cow who follows behind them. Wearing nothing except a pink pair of panties, the massive black and white spotted bovine is voluptuous to say the least. Sporting what looks to be a gigantic pair of M-cup breasts that could house a small country, a huge belly, and an ass that extends behind her for what must be miles, this cow also has the friendliest look of them all. When she catches sight of you, a grin spreads across her face as she silently adjusts her short green hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mind struggles to comprehend the scene in front of you, the mouse approaches and deftly plucks you from your bed with her titanic fingers. Bringing you to her other palm, she gently drops you down onto the massive grey plain as the tiger and cow bend over to get a closer look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is our little husband feeling today?\" the tiger says. Looking at the titanic anthros staring down at you, it finally hits you - you're married to three gorgeous anthro women!</span></div></div>",

Darling, can you remember us?\" She looks back at the other two girls before continuing. \"It's rare, but sometimes when a man comes down with a bad case of the flu, they get amnesia. I don't think Darling remembers who we are!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head at the explanation. \"I'm sorry, but I can't remember you guys at all. I don't even know what happened to me. For that matter, how are you even as big as you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that question, the tiger lets out a deep laugh that shakes you to your core. \"That flu really must have done a number on him if he can't remember that! All women are this big sweetie. Men are just teenie tiny specks, while us girls get to tower over you. Some of us are bigger than others however.\" With that, the tiger tussles the hair of the shorter mouse girl next to her, who frowns slightly at the movement. \"Hey!\" the mouse exclaims. \"I thought I told you to stop that.\" \"I'll stop when you stop being so cute about it.\" the tiger replies. The mouse blushes at that statement, before looking back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember our names at least?\" she asks. After you shake your head, the mouse sighs. \"Well, in that case, let's see if we can jog your memory a little bit. How about you do the honors, since you are technically his first wife Natasha?\" the mouse gestures at the tiger woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA massive grin spreads across Natasha's face. \"It'll be my pleasure, short stuff.\" Without another word, she picks you up off the mouse's palm and not-so gently drops you into the middle of her mountainous cleavage. While you struggle to get your bearings among the titanic strands of hair, Natasha softly strokes you with the tip of her claw as she tells her story. \"As you just heard, my name's Natasha, and as much as these two pout about it, I am your first wife by the order that we met you. It was back in kindergarten, and I was away from my mom and aunts for the first time in my life. So you can imagine I was pretty terrified. Come lunchtime, I was crying at a table by myself, when lo and behold, a tiny little speck of a boy approached me and said he didn't like to see me sad. He asked me if I wanted to be his friend, and ever since then, we've stuck together through thick and thin, my sweet, kind husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha chuckles. \"By middle school I knew I wanted to marry you. And since the law says that a man could have more than one wife to account for the gender imbalance, I knew you would be in my grasp no matter what.\" With that, Natasha forcefully pushes your body down into the depths of her breasts, surrounding you in miles upon miles of soft, furry flesh. \"And I just LOVE how much you squirm when I put you anywhere. Makes me feel like a predator, playing with my tiny prey before a meal. You really know how to turn a cat on, don't you hubby?\" Natasha moans in pleasure as you struggle between her breasts, but before she can start to make the most of the moment, the mouse reaches underneath her t-shirt to pull you out. After a couple of seconds of desperate fondling, the mouse smirks as she quickly pulls you out of the furry mountains, which is disorienting to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what's the big idea! Me and hubby were having a good time just now!\" Natasha pouts at the mouse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know,\" the mouse sighs. \"But maybe save that for later when we're not trying to get him to remember us, OK?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha continues to frown at the statement, but nods her head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, the mouse looks back to you. \"Anyways, back to the topic at hand. My name is Catherine, and I'm the second of your wives if we're going by the order in which we met you. While I didn't have the pleasure of knowing you before high school, I definitely remember the <i>pleasure</i> after it.\" Catherine blushes at that last statement before continuing. \"It was after I had just finished a workout at the school gym, and I was in the change room getting out of my gym clothes. As I was... putting on my underwear, I felt a little itch in my ass, but thought nothing of it. I kept feeling something while I was walking home, so I ran up to my room to check it out. And that's when I found a certain someone trapped in between my cheeks. I was embarrassed, but if I was being honest, I liked having a man trapped down there. It made me feel...\" Catherine lets out another sigh. \"Powerful. And I'm so glad you keep making me feel like I did back then everyday for the rest of my lives.\" At that, Catherine turns around and smacks her ass, grinning while she looks at you lustfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush as she tells the story. \"But why was I in the girl's changing room in the first place?\" You ask. At this, Natasha giggles. \"I may have forgotten to pick you up again after we had some private time together at school.\" she says. \"Catherine brought you back to me, and after some discussion, we decided to date you at the same time.\" Catherine smiles at that. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I'm so, so glad I got to meet you. I can't imagine what my life would have been like\" With that, Catherine pulls you in for a kiss. Your entire body is pushed against a pair of lips so big that you could land planes on them. You kiss back, which you assume would not be felt, but Catherine only moans and sucks you into her mouth in response. She tosses your body around with her monolithic tongue, coating you in saliva as you desperately try to hold on. As frightening as the experience is, it's also pleasurable, and you can't help but grow aroused at the situation you're in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Catherine's mouth opens as another tongue pushes it's way inside. The moans coming from both women echo in the wet cavern, as they wrestle to try and grab a hold of you. Before long, the other tongue retreats, carrying you with it. A moment later, and a single white finger presses into your body, sticking it to the furry appendage with ease. And as it retracts from the mouth, you stare up in awe as the cow woman gazes at you with an aroused look in her eyes. You try to move, but the saliva prevents you from doing anything outside of a pitiful shake. Her snout playfully nudges you as she lets out a booming laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's my turn now honey,\" the cow booms. Her voice is deep, shaking you to the core with both its volume and the clear arousal behind it. \"I'm Bessie, and I met you when you were just out of high school. It was at the beach, and I had just finished a modeling job and was looking to relax for a few hours. I had sat down to order a drink at a bar, when I heard a little voice call out to me. Looking around, a saw a speck smaller than a grain of sand jumping up and down on the table in front of me. You told me that you were with your family, and one of your aunts - I think it was the lizard one - had left you behind just as you were leaving. Said that you needed to find another girl to date, cause two wasn't good enough for a charming young man like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did you do?\" You ask. \"Well, I did the only thing I could do honey,\" Bessie smirks. \"I asked if you wanted to have a good time, and after you said yes, shoved you straight down my panties. Figured that I could kill two birds with one stone. I could relax, and you could see just what a big, beautiful woman like myself was capable of. While I had dreamed of something like that moment for years, having you inside me was like a whole new experience. Right then and there, I discovered just how much I liked to be in control, and fortunately, you were OK with that. After we both had our fill several times over, I brought you back to your family and introduced myself as your newest girlfriend. That was five years ago, and after awhile, you asked all three of us to marry you. And ever since then, we've been living together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bessie finishes her story, Catherine approaches you. \"So now that you heard all of that, can you remember us now?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on it, you had begun to remember each of the girls. You remembered how Natasha would sneak you over to her place so you could help her with her homework and her 'needs'. You remembered Catherine taking you to one of her kickboxing matches, watching as she took down an opponent nearly twice her size before she smuggled you out in the back of her shorts again. And you remembered taking you shopping for high end clothes for her modeling job, sometimes keeping you out in the open, while other times leaving store employees wondering why she was sweating so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you nod. \"I remember you guys. How could I possibly forget my beautiful wives.\" At that, each of your wives smile in delight, happy that the amnesia isn't permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank the gods,\" Catherine says. \"I was beginning to worry about you hubby,\" Natasha says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you're still stuck to Bessie's finger, you take a moment before deciding...</span></div></div>",

At the very end of your dream, more and more titanic anthros started to appear, and all of them were absolutely gigantic.  It was if millions anthros that were billions of times your size were focusing directly on you.  You remember more: every one of them was smiling broadly and were trying as hard as they can to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, and suddenly notice that something is wrong.  You are not in a bed, but something else very soft.  It feels like cotton, but the weave is too good, since you cannot feel it at all.  Also, it is very large; about one hundred feet thick, and you cannot tell at all how long it stretches.  You walk to the side, and notice that it is a hundred foot drop to the ground, which does not look like the ground at all; far too smooth and perfect, plus it is also white.  You look up to the ceiling, and it looks like a normal ceiling, but seems too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at a wall, which must also be very far away, and you see an impossibly huge poster.  You notice your body on the poster naked, and you panic, suddenly aware that you are naked as well and no clothes are in sight.  Underneath the embarrassing image are the unusual words, \"The Amazing Femto!  Meet Earth's Littlest, Most Beloved Angel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it be that you are Femto?  And why are you suddenly the 'most beloved'?  You do not remember doing anything special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the loudest noise you ever heard broke the eerie silence of the room.  \"Femto, it's time for your biggest adventure yet!\"  Looking at the door far, far away, you see an anthropomorphic fox woman, a very good looking one at that, enter the room.  The fox walks closer and closer, and with each step you see her look relatively larger and larger.  Whenever you think that she is close enough, she just takes one more step closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she is so close and so big that you can hardly see any of her.  When she finally stops, she rests her hand on the smooth white surface below the object you were sleeping on, a few miles away.  However, even then her black fingers seem to extend forever towards the sky.  This is impossible, the fox must be thousands upon thousands of miles tall!  Her claw alone could probably fit one, no, three cities on it, and it is slowly approaching you!  This is when it hits you; 'femto' is a prefix used before some sort of measurement to indicate some very small fraction you can't remember.  You were sleeping on cotton; to be precise a single strand of cotton.  Somehow, you have become the smallest living thing on Earth, probably even smaller than mircoorganisms, and apparently, everyone else on Earth is an anthro that adores that fact.</span></div></div>",

You can hardly move from the amazing size of that claw; it must be over a mile away, but it already completely blocks out everything in front of you.  The tiniest imperfections in that claw should be maginified intensely, but it still looks almost perfectly smooth and shiny; that fox has a great manicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the very tip of the claw plows into you; and you feel like a whole planet is pushing against you.  The world moves very fast as you are suddenly whisked in front of the fox's face.  You feel like you are glued tight to her claw as her moon-sized head scans your feeble, exposed body.  You feel so insignificant right now; her eyelids alone are about a mile thick, and you can almost see all of Earth's population crushed to nothing every time she blinks.  Her red fur looks more like gigantic plateaus; you could fit a neighborhood on the tip of one of those strands.  And yet this giant of giants, who shouldn't even be able to see you, looks at you like a priceless treasure, a tiny bauble worth protecting; possibly even as a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I managed to get you on the first try this time, Femto!\" boomed the anthro fox.  \"Now we can finally begin your world tour.  Imagine all of the different anthros around the world wanting to meet you in real life!  It's absolutely amazing how a single, almost unnoticeable creature like you can inspire a whole generation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you realize that your dream is coming true.  The fox goes to the door much more quickly than she entered, and you see a bunch of other anthros make way for her as she walked through a hallway.  All of them looked at you adoringly as you clung to the tip of the fox's claw.  As the anthro opens another door, you are suddenly blasted by an intense amount of noise.  A huge crowd of anthros were cheering your new name, \"FEMTO!\" repeatedly as they looked at the fox move towards a long, long limousine.  Your carrier got in the limo, and she puts you...</span></div></div>",

You feel like you are skydiving, even though you are in actuality falling only a couple of inches.  When you make contact with her palm, you bounce a bit before coming to a rest.  The mammoth vixen continues to look at you in awe as you look out at the endless expanse of her black paw.  Her fingers and thumb, each many times larger than mountains, seem to fade into the distance.  However, something strikes you as odd; you should have been squashed many times over by the things that you have gone through today.  When she picked you up, her claw must have been traveling in access of 500 miles per hour, and when she walked down the hall, you should have been flattened by the air resistance as she traveled at least Mach 10.  Also, that fall of several miles should have pulverized you, and you didn't even sprain your ankle.  You don't even recall hearing any sonicbooms today.  You realize that it must have been you who has shrunk, but that still doesn't explain why you are still alive.  Could it be possible that you really have become a tiny angel?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour, the fox carrying you gets out of the limo and onto a planet-sized private jet.  As she sits down, she reaches into her bag and takes out a small map of the world, though to you it might as well be actual size.  The world is still Earth; you recognize all of the countries, and they still have the same names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, Femto, were going to be all over the globe this year!\" exclaims the enormous fox, gesturing towards the map with her other paw.  \"You see, right now, we are here,\" she continues, pointing to somewhere in Kansas or Nebraska.  \"However, by the end our first ride, we are going to be all the way over here!\"  You watch as the fox's enormous black finger points to...</span></div></div>",

You hope that Japan is still similar enough to what you have heard about it before you woke up in this odd version of Earth.  Although you doubt that you would be heard by the titanic fox that is carrying you around, you try your luck, and shout up, \"What kinds of things am I doing in Japan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the fox turns her massive head towards your voice and answers you.  \"You have a lot of fans in Japan, Femto, and they are actually holding a Femto Convention in Tokyo tomorrow.  Lots of anthros will be there looking forward to meeting you, taking their picture with you, getting your autograph; you know, lots of the things you do at home.

However, before you can think of anything, your mind is deafened by the roar of the jet engines as the plane takes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plane ride is surprisingly very much like the plane rides you are used to.  Most of the time you just lay back on the fox's paw, which lies in turn on her shirt as she naps a bit.  She is woken for the in-flight meal, a country-sized sandwich.  She shares a tiny bit of the salami with you, even though that tiny bit happens to be the size of several skyscrapers.  You quickly learn that even gigantic airline food does not taste good at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, the plane lands, and your giga-sized caretaker suddenly starts carrying you towards her pants pocket.  You see that it is lined with hundreds of square miles of cotton balls as you tumble into the soft darkness.  From way up high, the fox explains, \"I'm sorry, Femto, but I don't want to start a ruckus if anyone sees you on the street today.  I'll let you out as soon as I get to the hotel; the people there are already expecting us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait in hope that the trip will be short as the fox gets up and starts to walk somewhere.</span></div></div>",

You could always ask your hot fox friend (is she your bodyguard, agent or something else?) but you reckon that would lead to some akward questions. Best to hope that you might be able to gather things piece by piece on your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, thinking about your current ride as she sways her hips back and forth to your arrival point is getting you a little hot under the collar, if of course you had one. A fox she might be, but a superly hot fox at that, and you don't mind thinking a lot of possibly naughty thoughts about her. Still this is coupled with the thought of impossibility - at this size you have little chance of being a good enough lover and whilst she might consider you a friend, you'd think it difficult to get her to consent to the stuff which has run through your mind. But again, if you truly are the only human in a world of titan-sized anthos you can hardly help to want some kind of romantic company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there's the problem of your memory loss. You can't discount the slim chance that somewhere in this world you have a wife or grilfriend or significant other, and your current mode of transportation may not be her. But still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that your speed has decreased in the last minute, and outside the sounds of cars and shouts have been replaced with a quieter level of background noise. If you were a betting man, you'd guess you'd reached the hotel lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more minutes of slow careful steps and the sounds of a door opening and closing, you hear a rumble of movement from above and your cotton ride is picked up. You are initially dazzled by the sudden burst of light after a good hour by reckoning of pocket darkness, but you soon see the familar and smiling face of your beautiful Fox Anthro. \"Ah, nice to see you're ok Femto. So then, we've got the rest of the evening free and there's a couple of hours left before you should get some sleep for tomorrow's signing session. Is there's anything in particular you'd like to do, Femto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are stunned that such a huge creature would give you free reign over your time frame, and though you could be a hundred percent you got maybe the slightest hint of a romantic offering in there, but then maybe you're reading into her worlds too much. So you have a choice - you could either risk akwardness and ask to explore your protector more closely, or else opt to get some questions answered about what you are and how all of this might have started.</span></div></div>",

You should not be able to be heard, nor should you be able to <i>exist</i>. You should've fallen through your vixen protector's pores at this size, and you should've died from your several mile falls, not to mention the impossible speeds at which you've moved, and the impossible collisions that didn't even bruise you. This was, for lack of a better term, <i>completely</i> ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet...the sight of your fox protector was kind-of exciting, you had to admit. If you and her were regular size, maybe things would be different, but as it stood, single strands of fur seemed to stretch out before you like monoliths of red and orange. The fact that she was offering to let you explore her was an exciting prospect all on its own, but an incredibly dangerous one. How would she even find you afterwards? Or retrieve you? She had to carry you around in a mess of cotton balls just to keep you from getting too shaken up, and yet here you were, about to climb on her body directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you were totally going to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, unsure of what to say, you just meekly point towards the monstrous mountains that were her breasts. To your continued surprised, she seems to know exactly where you're pointing, and smiles, lowering you towards them at a rate of what must've been hundreds of miles per hour, although it certainly didn't feel like it. Using her other hang, she unbuttons her top slightly, revealing enough cleavage to get any man interested. And you were about to get lost on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, your foxy friend stops lowering her hand at about breast level, although in order to actually reach them you'd have to walk for miles, and then skydive for even more miles. Sensing this, she looks down at you and smiles. \"The ride ends here, Femto. Promise me you'll be careful alright?\" \"No promises.\" Rolling her eyes, your world seems to explode as she tilts her hand and you begin your free fall. The sight of her exposed breasts approaching rapidly is intoxicating, and in moments (although they seemed like minutes) you touch down on the surface, having fallen between a web of fur that seemed to drape across the sky like a forest, leaving your world drenched in darkness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around in awe at the sight. It was like you were on an alien world. Large, orange, coiling ropes spiraled up into the sky, darkening the immediate area as light rays beam down through the gaps, creating what appears to be an alien forest. The ground was peach colored, and quite soft, the pliable material pushing inward with each step. This was probably the skin of her breast flesh, which was a very weird thing to contemplate. You were on one of the breasts of your giant secretary/bodyguard/lover/?? and it was completely unrecognizable at your scale. You weren't even turned on, it was just exhilarating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts were interrupted by the deafening sound of the fox woman giggling above you, the sound waves seemingly traveling through your body. \"I can feel every step of you down there, Femto. I'll try and get some paperwork done before the signing tomorrow while you're down there...try and be careful, will you?\". Suddenly, a large gust of wind seems to spawn in the dense orange forest, and you're forced to cling onto another piece of fur to avoid flying away, the force of the wind threatening to send you flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, it was the fox girl walking towards the chair and table in the hotel room, sitting down and pulling out the necessary papers and tools from her bag. In doing so, her slightly unbuttoned breasts jiggled slightly, which, to you, felt like a terrifying earthquake, the force of which was equal to, or greater than that of any of Earth's worst earthquakes in all of history...and yet you're completely fine, somehow. Finally, the continents you stood on seemed to begin resting as her cleavage found a sitting position on the table itself, as the fox woman began to actually start working. If your luck held, they'd stay this way for a few hours, giving you ample time to look around. So...what was the plan, anyway?</span></div></div>",

The fox was planning to go shopping, but then she remembers reading a famous club that was nearby, and both her and you were going to have the time of your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the fox's walking, you were hanging on to one of the strains of hair until you could walk around. As you look, you now know where exactly you're at. Right in front of you was your protector's womanhood, it so massive that it look like it could swallow a planet and still have more room for second. You were nervous, but you decided to climb it and see what wonders it has in store for you. As you enter, you see that the tunnel inside her womanhood looks like an endless abyss. Before you could do anything else, your world shook so violently, it felt like the apocalypse is shattering your world and throws you deep within the love tunnel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attractive protector made it to the club, and already she felt excite. The first thing she did was enter the dance floor. If you could see how she dance, you would have been head over heels with her. Her dancing was so mesmerizing that it caught a lot of people's attention. Some of the guys would try to see if they could get her attention, however, your protector already has eyes for a certain man, and he's already deep within her. She was having the time of her life, while you on the other hand was bouncing around the fleshy tunnel. Every time you slam against the wall, you were making the fox stimulate without her knowing it. A tiny form of liquid was already showing and when you slam into it, you realize that now you're stuck. Your protector doesn't even notice as she continues to dance the night away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours in the club, the fox finally decides to head back to the hotel.

You feel nothing, you see nothing, you are alone, completely helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear odd muffled echoes, and you listen intently, as they are the only stimuli you can notice.  They sound like voices, many different voices you do not recognize.  You catch some of the louder, stronger sentences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's condition is stable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Diverting power at one hundred percent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm detecting brain waves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, you feel your whole body tingling with some sort of unknown energy.  It makes you feel alive now, better than you have ever felt in your life, though you still can't move or see.  At least you have no doubt that you are alive.  You guess that you had a stroke or something and must currently be in an emergency room.  The muffled voices grow excited and pleased, and you know that you are going to make it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting a heartbeat, bodily functions are normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've almost done it!  Just a little bit more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, it's starting to move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your lungs attempt to take in air, but instead of oxygen you get a breath full of fluid.

Three, two, one, zero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you are falling, and land on a stretchy surface.  You feel fluids emptying around you, and you cough up the fluid in your lungs, taking in much needed air.  You feel sore, but still very healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices are no longer muffled, and seem to be rejoicing.  Hearty laughter, shouts of victory, the slap of high fives, all of these sounds are clear and loud.  You feel your sight start to return as you look at blurred white surroundings.  You see something move before you and assume that its the doctor that saved your life.  You get up and walk towards the figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, it's walking already!\" cries a voice from elsewhere.  \"This is incredible!  Surely the greatest biological success in history!  Quick, see if it can talk too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a presence before you, and feel like you are watched, so you say the first thing that comes to mind, \"Um, thanks.\"  You immediately hear loud gasps, followed by enthusiastic clapping.  You feel yourself rise, then a towel of sorts wipes you off.  Now you can see, but wish you didn't, because before you is the huge face of a giant bear, which should easily stand at least a mile tall.  The giant head looks your way and opens its maw to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your, welcome, H-1, and welcome to life!\"</span></div></div>",

The science team jumps back, startled, and starts to make a number of rushed statements to each other as they hurry to stations set all around their laboratory. You don't catch what they're saying over your shrieking, and you don't catch what they're doing because you're running across this... surface in the other direction as fast  as you can.

Your fear, already at an absurd level, spikes through your body from your head to your toes. You think you're going to die, if you aren't already dead. Your heartbeat and heavy hyperventilating is the only sound you can hear in the darkness of your chamber. As you wait for some gruesome fate, your mind starts to swirl. Maybe it's the adrenaline wearing off, you think. It progressively gets stronger as vertigo kicks in. You lose your balance and fall on the ground.

It illuminated the inside with a soft green-bluish colour, you also took notice to the surface you were resting on. The floor and the dome seem to be made from the same material. A white substance with a soft elastic feeling, almost like memory foam. Suddenly, everything comes back to you, those monolithic creatures.

Family, friends, work, school, despite your familiarity with these concepts, none of them seem to have any memories attached to them. \u201cWelcome to life... Welcome.. to.. life...\u201d You began to mull these words over, you were having trouble comprehending what it meant. \u201cHow do I know all these things if I can\u2019t remember any of it?\u201d <br>\r\nYou didn\u2019t want to believe it, but you felt as if you never did experience these things, you wonder if you\u2019re even alive. Before your mind  could spiral, a static voice began to fill the dome. \u201cG O O D  M O R N I N G  H-1 !\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jump out of your skin, almost flinging yourself into the air.

Also, you are VERY loud!\u201d<br>\r\nThe speaker transmits a static that sounds like someone tuning a radio. <br>\r\n\u201cI must apologize once more, I didn\u2019t take into account of your size; I hope this level may be more suitable.\u201d <br>\r\nYou stand uncovering your ears. <br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s much better- Wait, my size?

It was an unusual shade of blue and everything was blurry. You tried to swim away but then you realize that you're trapped in some sort of enclosed space. Sort of like plastic. You try to question your newfound surroundings but you can't even utter a single word. You try to look out of your encasement and see a strange glowing light but you couldn't go to it if you tried. In the light you see a strange figure, somewhat humanlike, but large and with an unusually shaped head. Before you can do anything else, the figure comes closer and you twitched because whatever that creature was, it was huge, just one of its eyes as obscured as they were at the moment, were the size of a moon to you. You crouch back in your enclosed space as the creature came closer and then something even stranger happened. Your enclosed space opened up and the fluids drained out. You were in pure fear as the strange creature loomed over you. \"Stay back!\" you yelled. \"Where am I? What's going on?!\" The figure then stood up fully and revealed its true height. This creature had to be a few thousand feet tall, even its pinky fingernail was the size of a football field compared to you. But you also notice that this strange beast appears female in body shape. Very plump but still with an hourglass figure and wearing a large lab coat. The figure takes off her mask and you see her as a huge anthromorphic albino white rhinoceros with two horns, bright red eyes and long dark purple hair. She puts on a pair of glasses and looks down at your cowering form with a smile. \"Success.\" She said.</span></div></div>",

Vivian smiles a gently, making your heart skip a little. \"Nothing right now, but once I'm done studying you a little I'll find something.\" You step back. \"Studying?\" you ask nervously. The rhino giggles. \"Of course! You're an extinct species brought to life! I need to make sure you're in good physical and mental condition, then I can show you to my colleagues.\" This makes you tense up, but she shushes you with her massive finger. \"Its okay, you're not some object, but I still need to show off my discovery.\" She's pretty convincing with that smile. It makes you trust her completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian stands up and walks over to a table. As she walks away you can see her figure even in the lab coat. That hourglass shape looks good and you can tell that underneath there's a great ass. When she returns she's holding two tiny pairs of tweezers. \"Okay, just hold still.\" she says, and grabs one of your arms with the instrument. The other one grabs your other arm and she begins moving you around, kind of like a puppet. She does your legs too, lifting them up and bending them at the knee. \"Okay, muscles and joints are fine.\" she mutters. While her face takes up most of your view, you can see past it enough to glance at her breasts. under the lab coat she's wearing a sweater that makes her voluptuous boobs more pronounced. You feel your penis begin to stir and Vivian notices. \"Hmm...\" she grins. \"Hormones seem to be fine.\" She's smirking at you but when her eyes glance at your crotch they glaze over a little and she looks horny for a split second before snapping out of it. \"Huh...\" she says and writes something down. You stand there, covering your crotch in embarrassment, not noticing what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext she grabs a clipboard and sands over you. Staring up at her form is mind blowing. She's like the size of a planet! \"Okay, can you remember anything about your life/\" she asks. Now that she mentions it you don't. You can't even remember who you are. \"Memories of previous life gone, but cognitive skills and knowledge remain.\" she notes. She notices your slight panic and taps the ground in front of you. \"its okay, you have me. We'll make you some new memories.\" This calms you down and you give her a smile that makes her grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian walks away and thinks to herself as she writes on her clipboard. \"S-1 seems to be very trusting of me, calming down almost instantly when I try to soothe him. It may be a result of awakening to a new life. I was the first being he saw, so he latched onto me, almost like a hatchling.\" That's fine though, once your settled she plans to take good care of you.

You wriggle as much as you can, the few inches of movement alerting you to the presence of similar tubes entering your body at various points. You manage to register the fact that you were surrounded by a liquid of some kind. It wasn't water, it was... Too thick. It was also pleasantly warm, but that does nothing to stop a powerful shiver from shooting down your spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere were you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't see much, only a few feet in any given direction, almost like you were deep sea diving. You strain your right arm forwards, the jack implanted directly into the left side of your wrist jostling unpleasantly. Feeling around your mouth you discover an airtight rubber seal connecting to the tube, almost like the one on an oxygen mask a military pilot would use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hold on... We're getting delta waves.\"<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"You heard me. Look, we've got a heartbeat as well, in addition to multiple brain wave frequencies.\"<br>\r\n\"So, you're telling me that thing is alive?\"<br>\r\n\"Precisely.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to look around but your head is constrained by the mass of wires feeding into and out of your neck and head. Where the hell did those voices come from?! And why were they do loud?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Heart rate elevating, should we apply sedative?\"<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe in and out, quicker and quicker. What the hell was going on?! Where there other people here, and why had they called you a thing?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damnit, it's not working, he's having a panic attack!\"<br>\r\n\"Give him another dose, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathing slows as you calm down, questions buzzing through your head but no longer seeming critical or existential in nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What should we do?\"<br>\r\n\"I have no idea, it wasn't supposed to develop intelligence this quickly!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should release him?\"<br>\r\n\"No!\" \"It's too risky!\"<br>\r\n\"I think he's ready. You've seen all the work the biologists put into him, he can withstand almost anything. And if he's exhibiting neural activity, he's most likely awake. And very frightened.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, how about we hold a vote? If we vote not to release him we can just put him into a coma until we're sure he's  ready, then just flush his system and take him out.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, then. All those in favour of releasing the subject?<br>\r\nAnd those against?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. You win, professor, and while I respect the work of our colleagues I still think we should err on the side of caution. This is, after all, an unprecedented situation.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to release you? That was good. You could get some answers about what was happening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Draining fluid.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm fluid you were submersed in began to recede, slowly taking its warmth with it until you managed to stand rather than float, feeling cold, wet, and vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Alright, Atto, let's hope you can handle this...\"<br>\r\n\"Atto?\"<br>\r\n\"Ten to the power of minus eighteen? Anyway, it's better than Yocto by yottametre.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various jacks and plugs connected to you fall out simultaneously, the small holes where they had been implanted healing instantly. Then the blackness you can see for miles is interrupted by a flash of light as what you assume to be two massive sections of whatever chamber you're in grind open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, you step forward, testing the strength of your leg. Swallowing, you begin to talk out of the chamber, nervously looking about for any sign of life. You clear your throat and call out, \"Hello? Is anyone there?\" As you walk, hoping to find the source of the voices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My goodness...\"<br>\r\n\"He can already speak?\"<br>\r\n\"Wow...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are shivering slightly by this point, your body having grown used to the warm fluid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Look, he's shivering! Should I...\"<br>\r\n\"You may, but be gentle. He's resilient, but we're not sure just how resilient.\"<i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to ask the voices for assistance when you are suddenly engulfed in a mass of what appears to be rubber. Flailing ineffectually, you breathe a sigh of relief that quickly catches in your throat when you are released. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering over you in the most literal sense possible, was a small crowd of undescribably titanic anthropomorphic animals, one of which was holding you, on...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of her finger, which seemed to stretch outwards in every direction for hundreds of miles. You gulp, looking up into the planet sized face of the dolphin you was holding you, as her caring voice rings out from every direction you can process:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the world, Atto! Heh, you may want to sit down for a bit...\"</i></i></span></div></div>",

You see small flashes of light but that is it. \"What is this place?\" you ask yourself. As you move your fingers, you gasp because you appear to be submerged in water, if not a similar fluid and yet, you didn't seem to have any trouble breathing. \"Where am I?\" you ask. \"Why is it so wet.\" You then feel around and feel something weird. It was rather long and almost tube like but when you pull it, you grunt slightly, as if the tube was somehow attached to you. Then you freeze in place because you hear a mild and faint throbbing sound. You swim around as much as it's possible and feel a large wall that feels surprisingly squishy but really large. From what little you could see, the wall seems to go on and on for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then let out a yell but there doesn't appear to be anyone who can hear you. \"How could this be?\" you ask. \"I don't remember being... wherever this place is... last night. What did I do last night?\" As you're wondering to yourself, you feel strange vibrations emanating through the wall and you cover your hears at the sound. \"What is on the other side of this wall?\" you ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the wall, is a large and bloated stomach that is being poked by a rather large hand with pudgy fingers. Both the stomach and hand belonged to an enormous anthropomorphic hippopotamus woman who had to be at least a few miles high. She had fuchsia-colored skin and black hair worn in a bun. She was wearing a lab coat, a black skirt and a teal tank top as she tapped her stomach. The hippo woman was in a lab with tons of strange vials and was soon approached by a large and bactrian camel woman who appeared to have long red hair worn in a ponytail with a freckled face. She was wearing a lab coat as well and a pair of glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still can't believe you're seriously going through with this, Jessica,\" says the camel woman to the hippo woman. \"The idea that you're using your own body to resurrect a long extinct species.\" \"This could be the only chance, Pepper,\" says Jessica, the hippo woman. \"To the camel girl. By injecting DNA from a human fossil into my womb, I am growing a human being inside of myself. I modified the serum to speed up the gestation so that the human will come out of me fully grown when its ready.\" \"How will you tell, Jessica? You're a hippo with a large stomach so I can't really tell if you're pregnant or just fat like you usually are. Besides, what you're growing inside you is a creature 1/10,000th of our height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blows on her finger. \"It will work. I predict it will only be a few more weeks. Then, once the project is successful, we will repeat the process, using heavy anthro girls like me to incubate the new humans. Project Appleseed will work.\" Jessica pats her large stomach to emphasize her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no way of knowing, but you were growing inside this planetary scientist hippo lady's birth canal and in a few weeks you'd be ready to come out.</span></div></div>",

And the sound of rushing air going in and out from a far off outlet. \"Okay,\" you said a bit freaked when the land under you suddenly jerked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh is that you Sam,\" a loud voice said from out of no where. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you,\" you yelled up to the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha...very funny,\" the voice said sarcastically when a huge shadowed pillar raised in your view. It seemed to be thirty miles long. You simply just stared at it in shock as millions of questions ran through your mind. Watching the pillar grab something, it reminded you of a arm or it was actually was one. What this disembodied arm grabbed was like a gigantic version of a sports watch. \"Jeez, its only seven am, good things its Saturday right bro,\" the voice said as it set the watch down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do, you accepted whats going on until the chance arose for more info on this matter.

His gaping maw was filled with sharp teeth taller then any skyscraper. It soon dawned on you that you were sleeping on a titanic wolf like human who is presumed to be your brother. You tried your best to think of what possible reasons can be for this. Your mind was left blank of any memory of the past in fact there was none. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrapped in your own mind, you couldn't figure out why you can't remember anything at this moment. Have you suffered to a loss of memory. Is this gold like anthropomorphic wolf really your brother. You have no choice but to play along not wanting your brother who ever he is to wake. \"What's with you Sam,\" the wolf asked as his foul breath watched over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh dude...your breath is the strongest weapon ever,\" you whined without control. You just realized you have assaulted your giant brother as you felt the scene around you turn to a blur. Next thing you know you were being stared upon one angry eye. Being so close, you couldn't help but think you can get loss in the sea of a eye. His one pupil can hold a small neighborhood as it stared at you angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, I think you should be a little nice to your brother Jack. Don't you think Sam,\" Jack said as his voice vibrated through your very fiber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh...sorry about that bro,\" you smiled nervously when his eye blinked. Something so large shouldn't be able to move that fast you thought when you flinched back spooked. Your brother easily saw this and couldn't help to smile. Moving you back so you can see his full face, something wasn't right with the toothy smile he was giving you. \"Um...any chance you may let me on the joke,\" you asked as fear crept inside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't be scared little bro,\" Johnathan smiled as his titanic body lifted up. Moving his feet upon the floor miles away from you. He sat there on his vast bed keeping you in front of his maw. \"Too bad mom isn't around to save you now bro...I wonder what should be a good punishment. Licking my feet or between the toes or while I take my shower you'll take one in my mouth,\" he pondered as he licked his lips thinking which should be more humiliating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ehhh...what about neither,\" you asked trying to wriggle out of Jack's grasp. Taking a look down, there's always a chance the bone-shattering fall with kill you painlessly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try bro but mom will kill me if you were to fall. If your not going to help me choose I guess I'm going to have to go for the best one,\" Jack chuckled making up his choice...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You rather put up with his feet then be stuck in that dark abyss of a mouth. Jack saw you staring into his maw and couldn't help but smile. \"I guess taking a bath in my maw is a bit to harsh but I do like a good foot message in the morning,\" Jack smiled. Making up his choice, life around turned into a blur again. Soon you were were left off onto the ground before you brother's titanic paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis paws were close to human if it wasn't for the long claws, the pink paws under and the fur on top. Not wanting to spend your time studying this titan's feet, you started running as you heard laughter all around you. \"Jeez bro, I can't even tell if you are running,\" he mocked as he watched you running barely making progressed from his feet. His one little toe can crush a whole block with ease but you kept on running. Five minutes later you were out of strength when you fell hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...don't tell me that's all the progress you can do,\" Jack's annoying voice ranged in your head. If there is one thing you know now is that you two are pretty much how two brothers are but a bit more extreme. Flipping over on your back, you faced Jack giving you a toothy smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you, you ass,\" you cursed but he continued to smile. \"I'm telling mom for this,\" you threatened thinking who ever your mother is that she'll teach Jack a lesson. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really...I was thinking of just a foot rub but now you got to lick my pads and between the toes. And through the whole progress you'll remind me how tasty my feet are and you are glad that you have such a honor,\" Jack described your punishment as his right foot left the ground. Watching the pink flesh of his foot raise above you, you couldn't help but imagine being crushed by billions of flesh with an easy step. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laid their frozen while he flexed his foot and wriggled his toes. You stared into the large folds of flesh you will easily be lost in without a trace. You won't be surprised if a small village lived between each individual toe. Theres a better chance of that happening then it being clean and tidy. \"I see you are enjoying the view...well let me give you a close up,\" just like that it fell upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do is raise you hands as if it would stop by magic. But nothing that big can be stopped with a easy will. Luckily your brother can as the sole of his foot stopped from a mere inch away from you face. \"I don't feel any licking or hear any compliments,\" Jack said as you forced your self to comply. Sticking away your pride, your tongue escaped your lips and made contact with his sole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that suppose to be...unless you want to end up sleeping in my running shoes after my nightly jog. You better do better,\" Jack threatened backing up his words with his voice alone. Hearing this sent you into a licking frenzy as you ignored the horrible taste. You continued licking as you paused from the sound of his toes scraping aginst the floor in pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh...why you stop bro. You are doing a great job unless you want to compliment the taste of my feet,\" Jack voice vibrated through your bones as you start thinking of words that can keep him happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my powerfully brave brother who is better then me in every way...you feet are those to die for,\" you sugar coated with everything on top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well...you finally realized your place little brother. I knew I'll soon crack you if you are sleeping in this bed with me,\" Jack chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh brother,\" you sighed under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For such a good compliment...I'll give you the honor to snack between my big toe and the one next to it,\" Jack replied as you watched thousands of feet of pink flesh pass in front of you. Finally you face was free of the pink wall as his foot finally fell softly inches   away from your on feet. Taking a good whiff, the smell was pretty horrible as you a wall of dried sweat appear to be in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god,\" you stared in disbelief. You can finally see your brother's smiling face with the walls of his toes blocking the view of the rest of his body. You couldn't believe how vast your brother is since his head stood up in the heavens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little bro start eating,\" he orders down at you watching your every move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just for one little thing I have to go through this,\" you yelled up upon your feet. You felt silly as if you were just merely yelling up into the heavens. Sadly you brothers face was occupying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean...I been putting up with your slick month all week,\" he yells back in anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what you couldn't think of a good come back,\" you yelled back up pissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter...you're still going to-,\" Johnathan cut himself off when he heard the door knocking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys...what's going on in there...open this door,\" a female voice yelled through. Yo couldn't help thinking that this must be your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your safe for now...if you don't say a thing I'll forgive you and you'll won't have to eat between my toes,\" Jack said down to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really...I want retribution for this,\" You yelled back folding you hands to prove a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find...anything but don't tell mom,\" you bargained as the walled of his toes were removed from around you. You then spied your brother's titanic foot land with a boom a few miles off. You can only say wow under your breath as you think of how small you are compared to this being. How can you be remotely connected to this godlike wolf who has to struggle just from not crushing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he grabbed you carefully with his thumb and his index finger. You soon was dropped in the middle of his right hand as you took a seat. Closing your eyes as the wind whipped aginst your face, your brother soon was unlocking the door and opening it. You couldn't believe your eyes for what is the sight before you.  </span></div></div>",

By the way your brother sounds when speaking about her, your unknown mom is always on your side. Trying your best to peak through Jack's fingers, you didn't have to when it turns out your mom is taller then Jack. Actually, she wasn't a wolf at all, she was a lioness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey mom...what's wrong,\" Jack asked playing dumb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what's wrong I heard yelling,\" the landscape of a mother folded her arms waiting impatiently. Looking up at your brother towards your mom, it turns out he only comes up to her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, I'm being bullied by a dwarf giant,\" you quietly muttered to yourself hoping they didn't hear. Somehow your mom noticed your voice but unable to hear exactly what you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you say something honey,\" she asked as she bent over to get a closer view. You couldn't lie on the fact that your mom has a great figure and gorgeous eyes. Even with a smile miles wide, her sharp teeth larger than any building you can think of. Yet, staring into her caring eyes, you knew deep down if this is your mom then she can never hurt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing mom...me and Jack were fighting again though,\" you chuckled looking up at Jack face cracking into a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mom but its just a harmless accident,\" Jack said forcing a smile to move a point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really,\" the lioness said to herself a bit suspicious of the two. \"As long as its not nothing serious...right Sam,\" she redirected the statement towards you. Pinning you between revenge or fear of your brother. Suddenly you felt her cold stare miles away and looked up to see that's she quite serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...if you don't count having your brother force you to lick his feet serious,\" you told as the pillars around you started to come upon you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son of a-I mean mom he's lying,\" your brother stated trying to defend himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-Hand him over,\" she demanded. You watched as the fingers around you moved back. Until it seemed like a flat plain that would take an hour to walk from end to end. You looked up as the titanic fingers of your mother fell around you. Using the point of her claw. She picked you up by your shirt as the scene around you turned into a blur. This is going to be something that will take while for you to get use to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself in front of your mom's caring face as her muzzle came closer and closer. The thought of being eaten sent you in fright when you stopped before her black curved lips. What she presumed to be a small peck was a bit of a rough wide for you. She couldn't help but getting saliva all over you. \"Awww...what did Jack force my baby to do,\" your mom cooed as Jack snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do,\" she snapped slapping your brother across the hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOM,\" both you and your brother said together disagreeing with your mother's action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\"  your mom asked after placing you upon her muzzle. Safely perched among the tall tree-like strands of fur. You can actually see how short your brother comes up to your mom. As if seeing it from her own eyes, your brother seemed small and vulnerable in front of your mother. It was a good thing she was looking down on him or you wouldn't be able to see him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do a thing,\" he whimpered as his eyes started watering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, I would actually believe that if it was someone else,\" she stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch,\" you said, \"I see where I get my mouth from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that honey,\" she asked, rolling her massive eyes upon you. Looking up, this was pretty frightening scene having large feline eyes on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said that Jack really was an ass towards me,\" you said not being careful with your words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" Jack yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's right Sam...no language please,\" she asked reinforcing this with her giant eyebrows crunched together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom, I meant that he forced me lick his feet for just telling him that he needs to brush his teeth,\" you told not telling the whole truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said it a lot ruder then that,\" Jack argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter, go ahead and take a whiff mom,\" you yelled standing up, pointing at Jack to prove a point. He growled back when mom slapped him across the head again. You couldn't help to laugh from, the titanic shock wave that would wipe a whole nation used on your brother. Holding onto a stand of hair as your mom bended over, you held your breath her muzzle came down to Jack's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant flow of air was sucked up into her nostrils like a hurricane on steroids. \"Woo man, Jack have you even brushed your teeth at night. I can still smell last night's meatloaf,\" your mother whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, you see I can explain,\" Jack mumbled trying to find a way out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother...you'll be doing you brother chores and my chores for a punishment. I allowed Sam to sleep in your room so he doesn't have to sleep in mine at his request. I'm not going to take this back away from him but I might have you moved out to the living room couch,\" she ordered as your brother let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you always got to stick up for Sam,\" Jack whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean...he also has to pay for that slick mouth of his,\" she revealed. Your face went pale as a question went through your mind. What is your punishment,\" you asked.      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You turned around and faced your mothers carnivorous eyes. Even as a predator she has caring, blue eyes that looked at you lovingly. But you saw a gleam in it and you knew that your mom must of planned something devilish for you. Her eyes brightened up and you couldn't help thinking about the rows of teeth taller then skyscrapers were being shown in her toothy smile. \"I got a good idea...why won't you help Emily for her special project,\" your mother announced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of project,\" I asked thinking it won't be so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you at the breakfast table but at the mean while,\" your mother paused before pillars of her fingers fell around. It still scared you a bit from the shadow they cast down upon you. A shadow that can block the light of a small city even. But you reminded yourself your lioness of a mother would always love you. Pinning you between them, you were lifted carefully and fell upon dark trees you presumed to be your brothers head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now...you two be good to each other and freshen up. You have a busy day today,\" she announced before lowering down. You were more afraid of being covered in lion saliva then being crushed by her tendered lips. The scene around you turned all black, pressing you down on your stomach softly. You can feel this was a more passionate kiss for you and your brother together. Even though you can't help but to enjoy it but the saliva was too much for you at the moment. Another thought passed in your mind that Jack must be getting a great view of our mom's cleavage. \"Lucky bastard,\" you mumbled sure that no one heard you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your mother brought her lips back from her wet kiss smiling before exiting out the room. You and Jack together cried out, \"EW!\" Not another word came between you and Jack. You both brushed up and showered, finishing up at the same time. It was a good thing they had a mini bathroom for your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dressed yourself with camouflage shorts and a black shirt with black sandals. Jack was wearing jeans with a green shirt, bare foot though. You sat there on his shoulder half expecting him to grab you and stick you between his toes. But he made no such move and just kept on out the room and down the stairs. You figure you lived in quite a big house if it was scaled down to your size. Nice mahogany floor and banisters with three rooms other than yours up here in the second floor. You went down into the hallway by the door you presumed to lead out of the front of the house. For you this hallway stretched for miles but is easily stepped through in seconds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou entered the dining/living room seeing the whole family. You noticed most of them were all carnivores accept one. You sighted a large Hyena male laughing with you mom and thought that that must be your dad. Next to him was a large Arctic female fox probably in her twenties who was laughing with your mom and dad. What took your attention the most was that her humongous breast bigger then your mom bounced with the beat of her laugh. You ripped yourself from staring hoping this was your sister Emily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite of Emily was a young female bunny you presumed to be younger than you. It was strange how out of this carnivorous family including you being an omnivore that the youngest of them all can be a easy meal for the family. Who you thought to be your dad looked up to see Jack and you. \"What took you boys so long...we were practically starving,\" the hyena announced smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry dad,\" Jack said answering your suspicions. You also figure for a hyena and the farther of a family, he must be quite a relaxed and humorous guy. The tone of his voice answer that for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sit down and lets eat, and try not to wolf down your food,\" your dad joked as your  mother chuckled. You can sense that Jack didn't enjoy the joke too much. He picked you up to put you down by your food. Turns out there was a miniature table your size with a complete array of food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for you too Sam,\" your mom commented. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack may be a wolf but your a pack of them...jeez,\" your dad added embarrassing you.You couldn't help think that you can't eat that much since your pretty thin and well built and your family each can swallow you with your breakfast and dinner together. Heck, they can inhale a whole house without noticing. Out of all of them your stomach growled and bringing all their attention towards you even the Arctic rabbit whose been zoning out through the whole thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we just eat,\" you yelled before digging into a stack of pancakes. They didn't argue and joined you with the wide amount of food in front of them. It was an amazing sight to you and couldn't help to stare while eating your food. Other than your little sister eating up a leaf, your family turned into a scary bunch of titanic monsters. Even though they tried their best to be civilized other then Jack who doesn't give a rats ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness who mothered you probably your whole life bit into some bacon and sausages. huge chunks of meat fell off upon her lips or muzzle or onto the table below. Great quantities or meat were lost pass her lips chewed down easily by her powerful molars. Your dad was much worst ripping through an egg sandwich. It wasn't a pretty sight with the constant rain of bread or eggs. Your sister Emily wasn't so clean herself as she ate bacon and eggs. Pieces of her breakfast your size fell down into the depths of her cleavage. To be lost there between two warm and cozy mountains of a loving sister. You envied them and started dreaming what it would be like to fall in there. The growl of your stomach interrupted your thoughts as you started eating again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After breakfast you were enjoying the commotion among your family. If there's one thing you know, it isn't a boring family. It was your dad and Jack arguing as if this wasn't the first time. You can relate that as the oldest males of the family they become competitive. You held your ears from the shouting among your dad and Jack. The amazing part is that it started from whose going to win tonight's foot ball game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see the annoyance in your mother face with all this loud yelling. This was still new to you so you tried to enjoy the male testosterone smack down. This went from entertaining to scary when Jack stood up high above the nonexistent clouds. He raised his foot and landed it yards away from you as if ready to jump upon the table ready to fight. This was so fast while shock wave and the wind sent you spiraling in the air. You were not noticed by none of your family as you fly miles pass the edge of the table towards the floor. Out of no where a land of vast whiteness filled your view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a soft landing but it was enough to save your life. You were out of breath and unable to flip over on your back to see your savior. Soon you felt the world spin into a blurry darkness and fainted. Later...your eyes fluttered open from a dreamy state \thinking it was just a simple dream. Sadly it wasn't when you looked up to see the ceiling many miles away. \"What happened you asked,\" sitting up and looked around. Indeed you were on a vast land but if your memory served you right. You are not in Jack's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door of two towards your right opened up to reveal a naked white fox tending to her hair. Each of her steps shook deep into your body as she faced her bed. From the position you were at, you couldn't see her face pass gravity defying mountains. Which seemed to be bigger without being confined by tight clothing.. You forced yourself on your back to actually see all the way up your titan of a sister. The amazing sight in front of you couldn't be ignored as your manhood stood erect. Your eyes traveled down her large stomach smooth with well toned packs. Finally your eyes stopped at the cave of her woman hood blocked out by overgrown fur.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see someone's finally awake,\" a heavenly voice filled with a full grown woman's voice. Suddenly the white landscape started disappear past the bed's edge leaving her breast and up. You decided to take a glance at her puffy nipples large enough for a town. \"I hope you don't mind me being naked. My clothes these days are getting to tight and mom can't afford clothes for my size at the moment. Besides....your enjoying the view...right,\" she smiled back easily noticing what's perking up in your pants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm-I-I I mean I-I,\" you stuttered as your face went red hot. You moved back a bit trying to cover up your erection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok little bro, we're an adoptive family remember and besides...we all know mom strips naked in front of you when your home alone with her...unless that's a lie from Jack,\" you sister cooed. You were relieved that she didn't mind but a bit weirded out about what she said about you and mom. It's true that we're an adoptive family but its amazing that your mom would reveal herself probably knowing your attracted. If there's one thing you know right now...this is one messed up family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened downstairs,\" you brought up to change the topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know the usual, Jack and dad got in a fight again and tried to shred each other apart in the living room and then mom ripped them apart and gave them a beat down,\" she chuckled as you can imagine it. \"But they carelessly didn't notice you were there and Jack nearly crush you. But instead he sent you flying towards your death...it was lucky I was watching you through this whole thing. So when I saw you flying I quickly jumped over and caught you,\" she said very serious and menacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face was indeed a fox but with a few changes you couldn't put you finger on. Her blue eyes were of those of an angel and fit well with her white fur. But to see it fold up a bit in anger and disgust didn't stop the beauty but made it scary. It was strange how she was scolding them so much like a real mother. It was even more strange that she kept a watch on you more than your mom. Her face finally lightened up a bit when her hands fell on the bed miles away from you and her head rested on them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though they were miles away they still filled part of his view. \"Thanks...Emily,\" you wanted to thank her but you still wasn't sure if she was Emily. You took the guess and saw that her face was a bit lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok little bro, what are big sisters for if their not there to help when needed,\" she smiled warmly. You thought Emily was so warm hearted towards you as if a real mother. She loved you as much as mom and didn't mind the fact that your attracted towards her body. In fact she's glad that you do and enjoys how you stare. You are glad that you've been raised by the two who cared for you so much and hoped that your dad was the same. It hurts even more that you can't remember any fond memories as your eyes start to water. Soon a tear fell before you can ripe your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam....what's wrong,\" she asked caring and lovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up into her warm eyes knowing that if she has children they'll be well taken care of. You sniffed a bit before you spoke, \"Please don't tell anyone but I think I loss my memory,\" you revealed to her. Instead of seeing complete love in her eyes, it was replaced with a worried look. She seemed more worried than she should and looked away as if she was hiding something. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You can't remember a thing,\" Emily asked in a worried tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None sis...nothing at all then waking up on Jack's chest this morning,\" you told her seeing she really was worried. You watched her massive head move up off her hands and the right one came towards you. By now you were use to being picked up by titanic fingers of your family and you soon found yourself facing your sis eyes. You look down to see her sit on her bed as it sinks down. Your mind couldn't imagine how it can take so much weight but there are more things to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww little brother,\" your sister cooed as her lovely blue eyes watered like a sparkling sea. She placed you on the palm of her hand as she gently stroke your back with her finger. It was an amazing feeling like a full back massage but the best part was that it was calming your nerves. Something crossed your mind when your hand reached out to stop her stroking. That would of been a foolish mistake to stop something that big even if its moving upon you slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut strangely you stopped your sister's miles long index finger with only your right arm without much a struggle. You would have to think about this later but there are more important matters. \"Sis...promise me you won't tell anyone,\" you ordered her more then ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean don't tell anyone...mom and dad should know so we can figure something out,\" Emily said sternly but you didn't back down so easily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know....but-,\" you said calmly until Emily interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you don't know...what if this can be something serious like migraines or something deadly, amnesia can't happen like a snap of a finger,\" Emily raised her voice over you not giving you a chance to defend your self. You knew she may be right but you're not going to let her out speak you like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you shut up and listen...this is pretty hard on me you know. All this love with no memories of you or anyone only makes it hurt even more. You can't tell me anything without experiencing it yourself,\" you yelled at her shocking her completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bro-,\" you interrupt her this time.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that there can be risks but at this current situation and I hate to say it but you all are new to me and I need an idea of who you all are to me,\" you can tell those last words hurt her badly but she needed to hear this. But she kept her composure and tried her best to understand. \"I don't want any of them to worry and I don't want you to worry...I'm not a kid you know, I can handle myself,\" you finished watching ever gesture in Emily's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand what you mean Sam...I'm sorry for yelling at you....I didn't know you were going through so much,\" Emily apologized while climbing up on the bed. After resting her back against a whole pile of pillows. She then placed you on top of her left breast which shocked you a bit. Too you it was huge forest of strands of fur that are two times your height. Luckily she delicately placed you on a clump of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh,\" you mumbled not able to think up anything to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok...memory or not you still the little, horny, runt of a baby brother, Jack always tease as I always beat him up for,\" Emily smiled. You're happy to see that she doesn't think of you no different but you won't mind having a bit more respect then being called little bro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis but....what time is it by the way,\" you asked noticing it's dark outside the windows with only two lamps giving light to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....it's actually midnight and way past our bed time,\" Emily joked like it was nothing. But for you it was a whole day wasted and you barely no much about this family you are in then what seems to be the surface. She finally noticed the solemn look on your face and knew her mistake. \"I'm sorry bro...I told them we will be working on my project so you had all the time to rest up while I worked on it a bit by myself,\" she said but it didn't make you feel any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault...I'm just happy I can start tomorrow with you there to help me out. Or at least you can fill me in on a few things right now,\" you asked laying down on the top of these tree like strands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....where should I begin,\" she smiled turning off both lamps as it took you time to adjust to the dark. Even in the dark her great blue eyes were still a magnificent sight. You couldn't lie, it rivals mom's caring but playful eyes but you haven't got any alone time with her.  Actually, you can't make any assumptions just yet until you are alone with each one of them and know them better. \"There's a lot to speak of little bro and I'm kinda tired....doing my project without your help is a bit hectic,\" she said sadly as her blue eyes started watering again as if failing you at your moment in need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't take this much love from a person you barely know but yet it feels like she's been in your life for the whole time. \"Its ok....but before we off to bed-,\" you couldn't finish what you were saying when the \"earth\" under you started shaking. Strangely you feel like you were rising in the air as Emily curved lips came closer and closer. You finally figure out she was lifting her massive breast with her left hand to give you a kiss tonight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea alone got you hard as her soft lips pressed you down the fur. This time it wasn't too wet but nice and moist. You couldn't help think how heavy her one breast is to lift. Probably matches the weight of a whole gallon of milk at her size. But you can tell it was easy for her with a well tone body like hers. She wasn't completely all muscle but enough to keep her nice and curve and well tone. In fact...she was in better shape then you. You don't even have one trace of a packs but just a flat normal stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long passionate kissed ended as her lips moved back. You were disappointed and wanted it to last a bit longer. You noticed that she was still holding up her breasts staring at you lovingly. \"If you ever need anything I'm here and if not...the rests of the family too...even Jack a few times,\" she chuckled as you slowly descended back to your normal attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks sis your the bests,\" you yelled up as her fingers came down at you again. Plucking you up, she gave you a quick wink confusing you a bit as you wonder what was she planning. You watched her remove many of the pillows so she can lay down flat with only one. You thought she was going to place you on her sexy abdomen or between her giant mountains of milk knowing that you'll enjoy any spot. She did you one better and completely surprise you as you found yourself on her plateau of a nipple.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night bro and I tell you all I can in the morning,\" Emily said closing her eyes to rests. You couldn't help but smile, at where you are on her large nipple. She placed you perfectly where you can either stare at her face. Or trace every line on her well toned abdomen, dream up any fantasies of her woman hood, or just follow the curves of her hips and legs. If only you were a bit bigger....she'll probably allow you to explore her body a bit. Heck...she'll probably encourage it and make it into a fun game between you two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took time to see every detail of her from the tip of her nose down to her strangely sexy toes. Everything about her was perfect or at least almost close where even her light snoring was heavenly to listen to. And the rhythmic beating of her heart and the up and down motion of her chest started to loll you to sleep.  After what seem like thirty minutes of glorious eye candy, you finally went to sleep ready for the next day. You really have the best adoptive sister any guy can get or close at least close to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was early morning where the family left leaving you and your dad Hank. It was awkwardly silent on the breakfast table as your dad grabbed breakfast for the both of you. Luckily your sister told you enough about your family. You really owe her one of these days and is determined to pay her back in anyway you can. But for now you watched the walls of your titanic father' bare chests. It seemed impossible to understand how large these people are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely can see the movements of his chests as it moved up and down as he breathes. The silence finally ended as the hyena in front of you grabbed the loaf of bread by you. \"Want some,\" he asked urging for some chit-chat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply smiled, from what your sister told you about this gray and brown hyena is that both of you two haven't get along much. Yeah you're still a family and there aren't any agreements between you two. But unlike your mother, he doesn't get as much attention from you as he wished. Since you're pretty new to this family you might as well set things right. \"No thanks...hey um dad,\" you said standing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waited tell his fingers smoothly fixed themselves around you. Softly they lifted you up in front of his eyes. Unlike your mother or sister they were more fiercer but playful and child like. \"What is it son,\" he asked as eyes got brighten. You watched as he placed you on his nostril as he went back to buttering his slice of bread. The ground under you felt soft but luckily not wet. You took a seat on his nose thinking up for something you and your dad can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna go somewhere since it's just us two,\" you suggested as his large eyes moved from the bread to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...I'm not really sure,\" you told him not knowing what is the world outside this house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we just take a walk around the city,\" he suggested when he took a bite out of his bread. You were forced to hold you ears as the loud noise of you father's huge teeth grind bread. \"Oops,\" he said a bit muffled. He grabbed you again but placing you upon his palm a bit to close to his mouth. \"Sorry about that,\" he flashed a toothy smile as meteorites of wet bread fell around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared sternly at your father ignoring his large teeth. He finally noticed your stare figuring out his mistake. He placed you down wiping his mouth with a napkin. \"Maybe we can eat something at the city but first,\" he said grabbing you a bit briskly. It was all a blur until you finally found yourself on clean and smooth surface. You looked around to see that your in the family's bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour dad was only wearing some sweat pants with his muscled upper body bare. You watched as his hand fell around you to grab his toothbrush. Putting on some minty toothpaste, he started brushing at a rapid pace. The sounds were too loud as it vibrated through your very core. After a minute of agony, your dad spitted into the sink washing his mouth out in water. Using the mirror he checked for any traces of bread. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...Sam,\" your dad called out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What,\" you asked wondering what he wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know I'm a stickler for clean teeth and...there's a piece I can't get. Can ya-,\" your dad asked but you interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" you told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon,\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you tell him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...pretty please,\" your dad said lowering down as his eyes watered. He placed his hands together trying to pull off his best pleading face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY,\" you yelled. That was a big mistake as your dad gave you toothy grin. You soon found yourself in a horrible predicament trying to run away from his fingers. It was futile as he snatched you up and brought you up in front of his cavern of a mouth. He pulled you up in front of your eyes before speaking, \"Is it okay if I get the lemon...we all know how tasty you are Sam.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust put me on your damn tongue so I can get this over with. Moving you down into his mouth, he drop you yards down onto his wet tongue. It was disgusting to you to have saliva up to your waist. It was a good thing you were on the tip or you'll drown in your dad's spit. You kept your balance as his tongue moved under between his upper molars. There you saw a piece of bread as large as your head. \"It's pretty strange how that rhymes,\" you chuckled pulling it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got it,\" you yelled as the tongue moved you to the back of his throat. You tossed the piece of bread down the to the abyss below. You couldn't help but think how horrifying it would be to fall down there. Finally Hank's tongue moved you out of his mouth onto his palm. Luckily you were close to the edge as you climbed down using the house size buds as help. \"That was disgusting,\" you told him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say something but I couldn't stop thinking about how good you taste...we should do this again,\" you told you grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to kill you...I'm going to kill you slow and painful,\" you hissed covered in hyena drool. Suddenly both of you hear the door from below open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder whose here,\" he asked.</span></div></div>",

You watched the hyena leave as the gooey and slimy but minty saliva crawls down your body towards the floor. You look around at the vast land of polished marble. Well...at your size you can still see a few cracks and pits embedded in the floor. You try your best to shake of the saliva hoping something like this won't happen again. At leasts you see your dad more as an fun but idiotic man then a stern one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut let's hope he isn't a clumsy one around you when you mistakenly slipped and fall hard on your butt. It wasn't a hard fall becuase of the saliva but it was wet with a sick \"PLOP\". \"You got to be kidding me,\" you growled rubbing your soar butt to find the gooey mess all over you hand. You heard the light giggles of a girl when you turned around to see a titanic snow rabbit. You remembered her from the dinner table but couldn't recalled her name. You did noticed she was quite cute and well develop but couldn't shake the feeling she had the body of a sixteen year old. But you already knew she was twelve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi big brother,\" she said excitedly while her high and cute voice was a bit too loud for ya. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis,\" you winced rubbing your ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops sorry,\" she apologized as her continental body zoomed forward. Her face moved above as she looked down at you, becoming your sky and horizon. You did agree she was quite cute with her large blue eyes, button like nose, her curved and soft lips. You did notice something weird, her blue eyes reminded you of Emily's. It wasn't caring and lustful but playful and praising like a little sister looking up to her big brother. You found it pretty weird to be called big brother when you're smaller then a speck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem...where have you been anyway,\" you asked curious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just getting groceries,\" she replied before moving back. \"Um here,\" she said before offering a piece of a napkin, \"Dad said you may need it before he left.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than-What...he left,\" you replied a bit surprised. You watched your younger sister's giant finger pressed a piece of napkin into the floor.  To her it was tiny but to you it was the size of a mansion that came up only to your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...he got an important call so he had to leave,\" she said, \"You might wanna take off your clothes since their soak.\" You looked up strangely at your sister as she turned away blushing. You couldn't help but chuckle and decided to just go with it for now. Beside, you can tests this as a way to see how she feel towards you. Even though you don't know much about her at the moment you have some strange feeling when her loving eyes stare at you praisingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure but you don't have to turn around if you don't want to,\" you said simply trying not to be modest yourself. You watched her titanic figure turned away anyway. You stared into her back, following the huge flow of hair reaching down towards her butt. Her snow white hair also reminded you of Emily when you got suddenly got hard just by thinking of her. You continued looking downed towards her giant fluffy tail leading into the crack of her butt. Her tight jeans cut off the rest of the view. You had to admit, for a twelve year old she has a nice butt with growing curves around her hips. Finally, you were done and placed your clothes on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't mind be naked except being cold. You had a fit body anyway with a flat stomach, strong legs and arms with a sizable chest. If you didn't know it you would call yourself at physical fitness. That was until you watched your landscape of a sister pulled off her top shit and turned around. Your mouth fell towards the floor to see she too had well developed packs and a size C breast too. She kept her bra but began removing her pants until there was only her pink undergarments left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't control how hard you were getting as your little friend came up to say hello. You were total shock...too shock to stop staring and pay attention to your manhood. How can your little sister thats only twelve be so well developed and hot. If only you knew her name. \"It's Buns,\" She smiled standing at her full glory with her hands to her hips. She looked away smiling as her cheeks turned beat red from your constant stair. Finally you slapped yourself out of it and turned away embarrassed yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um sorry about that...Buns it's just,\" you said trying ot think of an excuse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay big brother...I didn't think it would be fair if you were naked by yourself,\" she answered still blushing. \"If you want I'll put my clothes back on,\" she offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it's okay...hey wait...why did you tell me your name,\" you asked turning around in control of your manhood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I'll tell you after we get you some new clothes...I don't want you to freeze,\" she said. Before Buns fingers fell around you, you stopper her to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buns...if you want you can go naked,\" you said taking a guests that she wants to strip nude with you. Of course you weren't fully comfortable with this but you considered the fact that anthro's like to be naked and free among their family. Well...some of them that is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks bro but I don't want to make you uncomfortable...you are new to this world after all,\" she replied picking you up before popping you before her lovely lips. You watched as your world were swallowed up by the moist and black lips of your \"little\" sister. You couldn't fully enjoy it as questions from Bun's response puzzled you. You wiped the thought for a moment to enjoy this long loving kiss. You couldn't help as you manhood perked up against your sister's soft lips. This didn't stop her as her kiss last longer until if finally ended. Out of all three kisses from you female family. Buns felt the best the all around. \"I hope you enjoyed that big brother,\" she smiled down cutely at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared back up at her, flat on you back into her soft palm. \"Yup...that was awesome,\" you said giving thumbs up. You watched Buns large blue eyes focused down on you praisingly. Again you felt the familiar love you got from Emily and mom but different in its own way. It felt more like it was respect mixed with the love. Respect of a young girl looking up to her brother but you didn't feel that way. How can something as tiny as you be looked up too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're the one who watch out for me the most big brother,\" she said as her faced moved miles away as she walked towards your room. You felt each step shake through out your whole being. You looked up at her puzzled as if she can read your mind...no...maybe she's just guessing what you're thinking. Emily probably told her about whats going on...did she? Stopping before you and Jack's room, Buns looked down as her eyes quavered as if worried about something. You looked up into the sea of an eye that belong to your own little sister as she held your own tiny life in her hands. You start to think that usually normal young girls will abuse something like you especially home alone. But apparently Buns must love you much not just ot care for you but show respect and call you big brother.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong sis,\" you asked looking up into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....I think its time you should know with the current situation you are in,\" Buns said confusing you. You watched as you're raised higher and higher up before her magnificent blue eyes. \"You see bro,\" she paused, opening the door and then popping herself on the bed. You heard the loud scream of trillions of pounds of pressure pressing down on the bed. \"Um....you see bro the truth is...\" physic </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"The thing is....\"  Buns trailed off as if she was a loss for words.  You looked up into her eyes but you couldn't pull the same little trick she had earlier ad had to accept sitting there and waiting for a responce.  You looked around her room and noted the walls were a very soft and light pink.  There was a white strip of crown molding around the wall at the carpet which seemed to connect all the way around and use the door fram as a connector across the gap in the wall where the door happened to be.  Buns sighed and you shifted back to look up at her.  Her eesseemed to be looking into ours, a deep feeling you never felt, like she understood you.  \"I shouldn't be telling you this but. . . you were adopted yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?!\" You went from resting to sitting to standing in one sudden motion.  You shock keeping you silent as your hurried responce to stand ended up with you tripping on yourself and falling back to a sitting position, remaining there in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised her other hand up and put her index finger behind you, using the back of it to pet you as you tried to put the pieces together in your head.  Her eyes seemed to glow with sadness that showed how she felt for him right now.  \"We were told to act and treat you like you have always been with us, though also act like you had been with us for longer... Mom said it would help you adjust quickly and accept a happy new life faster...  But I wasn't sure that was true.\"  You sat there listening to her as your mind tried to throw some reason and light into this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... My amnesia is really just me not knowing who you are because...\"  You messed with your fingers for a second or two, \"...In reality I don't know who you are to begin with?\"  Buns blinked her big blue eyes and nodded.  \"I'm so sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to just curl up and preend this was all a dream, despite the fact she was holding you and petting you right now.  A slight chill rushed through your body, reminding you that you still didn't have any clothes.  Buns noticed the slight shiver and stopped stroking him, \"Oh of course!\"  She whispered as she shook her head, \"We need to get you dressed in something...\"  She shifted off her bed, the springs moaning as she shifted herself off the bed and walked around to a small desk by a lone window in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set you gently down on the flat wood as you still got over your situaton in your head, her hands moving across her desk to look for something that she obviously misplaced.  \"Ahhh...\"  She gave a small sigh as she drew an odd box out from one of her drawers ad set it near you.  It was a dresser.  You snapped out of your thoughts and stood up, opening the hinged doors to see various clothes inside.  Once again you heard the sound of Buns shifting herself around so she didn't look, and instead of pressing matters you hurridly got dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to see that she had stealthfully slipped away from the dest and was proceeding to put her clothes back on as well.  You looked down at your new clothes, a black T-shirt, with an unzipped blue sweartshirt and dark blue jeans.  The belt caught your attention when you first picked it up to put on, since the jeans were only slightly too big.  Its band was made from a fading brown leather with a bronze sea serpent for the head of the belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had walked to the edge of the desk and sat down, kicking your feet in the open air before looking up to see Buns walking back over.  She held her paw out just underneath you and you were unsure if you wanted to slide off.  Just then, a furry wall pushed against your back and you fell into her waiting palm anyways.  You landed on your feet as your knees bent to absorb the blow and fall forwards onto your stomach.  After a few moments you filled around to see her other hand waving its fingers at you from the desk as you heard her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile went across you face as you pushed what you had learned to the back of your mind.  \"Big brother...\"  You flipped around to look at her, \"... Could you just act like I never told you this?  I mean...\"  You suddenly thought about what she did for you and how she did what she was told not to do... If you gave her up or suggested in any way you knew... Seeing her punished was not someting you could ever even want to imagine.  \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled again as a muffled thump of someone getting home reached your ears.  \"Emily is home...  I guess you should go to her to help her with her project now...  I'll take you there.\"  She was cheering up and you got comfortable on er paw as she turned around and left her room, looking for Emily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything passed by faster than you could ever go, but by now you were used to it.  Buns walked up to Emily's closed door and knocked on it with her other hand.  \"Hold on a sec!\"  You could hear her voice calling from inside as the muffled thumps of her feet reached the door.  The door knob turned and it swung inwards, but only just enough for her friendly and familiar face to poke out.  She looked at Buns then noticed you in her palm, \"Oh there you are!\"  Her slight raise in voice made you wince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grimaced and slipped a hand to her mouth ans whispered, \"Sorry...\"  Now her hand moved out to you and her massive fingers surrounded your body as she picked you up and moved you inside, pausing so you could slightly catch buns waving to you, \"See ya around big brother.\"  At that she turned and seemed to almost skip to her room.  You could hear Emily chuckle and saw her slowly shake her head as both it and you moved back into the room.  You notice there is a dest with some papers on it, that must be a part of her project...  When you turn around you also realise that Emily is naked once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself starting to get an erection and her eyes lit up but your blank stare as she knew what you were probly thinking.  \"You look good today too.\"  At least she was nice enough to say something and get your attention.  You rub the back of your head with your hand and look back up into her blue eyes, \"So what is this project I keep hearing about?\"  She smiled and walked over to the desk, placing you in its white, smooth surface a little ways from the papers as she sat down and picked a pencil that was amazingly larger than you were.  She grinned as you were shocked by its shear size and she reached over with her otherhand to grap you once more, yet you made no motion to run.  Perfectly fine around her and trusting in what she was doing, and soon she placed you down on the top of the paper she was writing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just finishing the written half of the project then we can move on to the part where I need your help.\"  She talked slowly to you as she seemed captured by what she was writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis!\"  \"Hmm?\"  She hummed her answer as she glanced up at you before going back to her work, \"What is is little brother?\"  She finished writing on the page and gently lifted it up from the back giving subtle tugs that slid you backwards onto the next sheet of paper.  You repositioned yourelf, flinching when the pencil seemed to land really close by and move just a few yards infront of you.  \"I've been noticing this, but why is it you and Buns are more motherly to me than mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped writing to look at you, her deep blue eyes showing some hint of sadness to your \"memory loss\" but it felt good to play the part and act like it is from the amnesia.  She sighed and set the pencil down, picking you up to put on the palm of her hand and hold you up infront of her face, her warm breath gently blowing past you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it was back when you were adopted... I think Buns was, about, five years old.  Jack was the only middle child and found time to try to pick fights with me and her when ever we thought we finally had some peace.  Mom and dad were thinking of adopting again and on the way there Buns saw an orphanage for humans and wouldn't settle down until we went there to look...  So we stopped by and the owners managed to get all the kids outside to look at...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuns was giggling and bent down and began to pet some of the others, they shied away from her large size but eventually they started to get better... Until Jack got bored...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snuck up behind her and pinched her side, causing her to spring up in fright, and to his desired effect, sent the kids screaming and scattering as her feet almost fell upon them.  Everyone fled except one little boy, who seemed angrey at Jack, walking up to his feet and trying in vain to try and punch him or teach him a lesson.  Jack reached down and picked him up roughly and dangled him high in the air, even higher than the orphanage was tall.  He started to shake the boy roughly and was hurting him badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuns tried to reach and take him from Jack but her roughly kept her away.  Now me and mom came forwards to stop him, but he turned to run and tripped overhimself and the boy went flying.  I managed to catch him before he fell too far and held him close, petting him and whispering to him that everything was alright.  Despite all this drama we adopted him, and that is how you came into our family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed by her tale, almost believing it to be real as you stared up into her soft blue eyes.  She is smiling and as she leans forwards you read her intentions and get ready as her lips press into you.  The kiss is nice and moist, just like the last one, and once again you wish it would last longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like all good things, it had to come to an end and she slowly pulls back to look down at you, \"From that day on I always watched over you and protected you from Jack while Buns continued to love you and appreciate what you did for her...And now... Back to work after that nice break for both of us...\"</span></div></div>",

The model CAN be to any scale, however it has to be perfectly scaled. That's where you come in. I am going to scale my building model to your size. With your help I can make sure the scale is perfect.\" Emily smiles revealing her mile long teeth, \"Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head. This isn't going to be as bad as you thought, at least you are better off with your punishment than Jack. Emily pulls a piece of paper out of her desk drawer and sets it down. \"Here is the a basic sketch of what I am going to make.\" You walk over to and then onto and then around the paper to examine the building sketch. It appears to be just your basic skyscraper with a pointed top. Emily looks at you, \"What do you think?\" You move your eyes from the paper to her and then give her a thumbs up, \"I like it...though...\" You look back at the paper, \"...nevermind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cocks her massive head to the side and her blue eyes seem to pierce into you, \"Though what?\" You sigh and look back at her, \"Its nothing. Forget about it. Its a stupid idea.\" She brings her head a little closer to you and gently says \"I don't believe that your idea is stupid. I really want to hear it.\" You sigh again, \"Well, I was thinking...\" ,she nods,  \"...that to make the building more, uh, no offense, imaginative and beautiful, you could give the pointed top of the building a spiral going up to the tip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But its a stupid idea, you don't have to listen to it or anything...\" you quickly say. She looks silently at you for a moment as if pondering what to say. Then she smiles and says, \"I like it.\" You gape your mouth at her, \"But why?!\" Emily responds, \"Its a great idea, it will make my model look much better and my teacher will give me higher marks for it. You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, it really is a great idea.\" You reflect on her words, \"Thank you sis.\" She smiles quickly and then says, \"Now lets get cracking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor next several hours you work, Emily does most of the actual building while you give your input when necessary about the scale and any other thoughts you might have.

Its about half a foot tall when compared to Emily, but to you it stretches on for miles upward and it is also several miles wide. \"This is going so well.\" you think staring up at several hours worth of hard work. Right now Emily is working on some more of the structure for the building. Each time a level or floor of the building is done, Emily carefully picks you up and you check to see if the floor is scaled correctly. If it isn't scaled correctly then Emily has to fix it. Fortunately though Emily has some real talent for this and you've only had to fix about 7 floors so far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Knock* *Knock*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Emily both look over to the door. \"Come in.\" Emily says. The door opens and your lioness mother walks in with a plate stacked with food. She smiles and says, \"How's it going with the project?\" Your mother gracefully ignores the fact that Emily is stark naked. Emily replies, \"It's going great here mom, Sam is really good at this.\" You blush from the compliment and say, \"I'm not doing that much, Emily's the real builder here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother chuckles and says, \"Well, I thought my hard workers here could use some lunch.\" She sets down the massive  plate and you see that it is filled with a wide assortment of meats. Your mom then says, \"Well I'll let you two get back to work now.\" She bends over to give Emily a peck on her forehead before turning to you. She bends over, bring her massive head down to you and her lips engulf you in a gentle kiss. Right before she gives you the kiss though you finally snatch a quick look her massive cleavage, you really missed out when you couldn't see it last time she gave both you and Jack a kiss. After the kiss, she stands back up, turns around and then walks out the way she came saying \"Good luck.\" before she closes the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily pulls the plate of food closer and rips off a \"small\" piece of meat for you and sets it in front of you before digging in herself. While you eat off of your car-sized piece of meat, you can't help but watch Emily wolf down her food ravenously, her sharp and pointed teeth easily tearing the meat to shreds before she swallows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally she notices you staring and she looks at you questioningly, \"Something wrong?\" You only shake your head no and turn back to eating your own meat, still watching her eat out of the corner of your eye though. You soon both finish up and continue your work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several more hours you are done and you marvel at the beauty of a model that you helped make. The building is absolutely gigantic, it is about a foot tall to Emily and about 1/4 of a foot wide, but to you it is miles tall and wide. An engineering marvel. You grin at the masterpiece. You feel a touch on your back and then a rub as Emily gently moves her mile long index finger on your back. You turn your head to look at her and she smiles and says, \"Thanks for you help Jack.\" Emily brings her head down and then gives you a warm, slightly wet, kiss. Emily then straightens back up and looks at the clock, \"Oh look its...</span></div></div>",

You then start to remember your morning with Jack and shiver with the thought of suffering like that again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" She asks you. \"Um well, I don't really feel safe sleeping in Jack's room.\" You say nervously. \"Hold on, why were sleeping in Jack's room?\" Emily asks. You then give her a confused look. Emily sighs and says \" You were supposed to sleeping in Buns' room. She already had everything set up for you.\" \"First of all why didn't Buns say anything at the table this morning? Secondly how did end up in Jack's room then?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Buns is um.. how do I say this, she kind of scared of Jack, for her and your saftey.\" Emily says. \" Why would she be scared for our saftey.\" You ask while she takes a sip of water that was placed on her desk. \"Well, you already know this but Jack is a bully. Buns was always bullied by Jack when they were younger. She knew if she said anything Jack might you and herself, so she kept quiet.\" Emily replies. \"But that still doesn't explain how I got into Jack's room?\" You respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be funny Jack normally took stuff out of our rooms while we sleeping\" she says while you walk onto her palm. Emily then soon gets up with you in her palm and walks to your \"little\" sister's room. She then puts in a bed placed on a nightstand next to Buns' bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight little brother. Sleep tight\" she says as she walks out of the room. You look over to your sister tossing and turning while she sleeps.  You soon lay on your and start to think about your life and family. You then feel the earth move beneath you. The bed is then hit by some invisible object and is knocked off the nightstand and smashes onto the floor, while you are trapped in a soft object: Buns' paw. Your sister then pulls towards her chest and holding you like your a stuffed animal. Your sister feels so warm, while her fur is so soft.

After a while she gets over her crying and starts to talk about school tommorow and how you'll have so much fun together.<br>\r\n\"Wait how can we go to the same school together. You're twelve and I'm (insert age here) Besides I'm human and your an anthro.\" you ask. She then looks down at you with her big blue eyes and says \" First of all humans and anthros go to the same school all the time. Also I'm in the same grade as you because of my really high grades\". By this time you were really surpised Buns was so smart. Suddenly that lie your sister told about your adoption came into your mind. You soon tell your Buns the story, and she looked like she was going to cry. <br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry brother. I lied about you being adopted a few days ago. I heard about your amnesia and I thought that making that lie would make you feel better about remembering us.\" she says tearfully. <br>\r\nThis takes a while for this to sink in. You start to fell a surge of rage building inside you. You look up to see Buns crying and all the rage vanished. You then hug her and say 'It's alright Buns, your just looking out for me\". \" You mean it?\" she asks. \"But Buns, I have a question. How did I lose my memories then?\"</span></div></div>",

You listen intently as she tells you how it happened. \"You lived in a small town called Bear creek. You had two brothers a sister and two loving parents. Since third grade you were constantly bullied until you became extremely depressed. You had stress and anxiety coming out your ears. In a sense your family was perfect but at the same time and as Jack would say your family put the FUN in dysfunctional. Your older brother was a blonde athlete but at the same time you and him fought constantly causing you to shy away from him. Your little sister and brother got much more attention than you so you isolated yourself from them because you beleived you were \"unworthy\" to be loved. Your stress rises and you began to contemplate suicide. After an attempt you were rushed to the hospital and you never really recovered emotionally. You had crap self esteem and you intentionally isolated yourself from others. The doctors noticed your love for animals and decided to go with the \"anthro program\". that was when you were 8. The program meant It meant you would be adopted by us until you were cured. Your family in the end ditched you in the program making mom and dad your \"real\" parents. For the first time ever you were at complete bliss. You began to laugh and joke around again. That was until you wondered how you were born to someone not even human let alone miles taller than you. You began to sink back into your depressed rut again. The doctor said that taking one dose of the memory stopper would isolate the negative thoughts until the died out.\". You were stunned you never thought your life was so sad. Buns wiped away her tears from her watery eyes and continued. \"now it seems you were overdosed and can't remember anything.\" You climbed down from the bed and said \"th...thank you Buns. At least we know how I can't remember anything but who should I tell?\" Buns thought for a moment and said \"I know you should talk to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly your teen brother walked into the open room! He looked around checking for his older sister before entering then walked over  to the bathroom which, unfortunatly for you, pathed beside his older sister's bed. Before you could react, this shaggy black wolf covered countries of distance before you could blink and suddenly you found a shadow the size of a continent fell upon you before you were hit by your teenage brother's paw. However, luckily the paw's print had landed on you and he was big enough that the surface area distributed enough laid out pressure that hardly any effected you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the paw rised you could see the world fly by at an alarming pace. When the paw began to head down you realized the problem and screamed trying to flatten yourself against the fast approaching carpet. You felt a huge amount of pressure which caused many bruises and a lot of pain as pressure was vented through tiny you to the floor, but not enough to break bones and kill you. This continued for two more steps but then you noticed a change, the floor was no longer carpet, but tile! Your brother stopped moving suddenly, and his paw twisted around so he could lock the door. You gasped as the paw you were on twisted around and threatened to smear you on the tile but lucked out and you were inchs higher from the tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brother began moving again, but this only continued for a few more steps till his feet planted down on the tile. You braced, preparing for more steps but seconds passed and the foot continued to stay still. Now that he wasn't moving you could hear his inner body working, a faint heartbeat, valves in his feet shifting, it was almost releaxing and you releaxed for the first time since you got into this situation. Unknown to you, your brother had a small itch on his leg and was about to move a foot to scratch it while he brushed his teeth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you were flying again as the foot raised, opening your eye's expecting to see tiles you were shocked to see some sort of black carpet? As you got closer you realized this was actually your brother's fur! You were rubbed against your brother's fur and noticed it was actually quite dirty! After the foot left, you looked around and after looking up, you noticed your brother was wearing a pair of loose black boxers and a well defined shape that could only be a case of morning wood...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever your being gave an itchy feel and your brother's paw returned to do a better job and you screamed as dirty fur smothered you,  however his paw flicked you and you felt yourself flying until you hit a surface. It was white though had a layer of faint dirt, the kind that only appeared on bathtubs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up you saw your brother finishing with what you now found out was him brushing his teeth. He spat out the liquid and it looked thousands of times bigger than the Niagra Falls to you. He turned to you and you began jumping trying to catch his attention but you were about half the size of crumb to him and his response was taking his vest off, he was taking a bath,  you knew there was no chance of getting out of this bathtub so doubled your efforts to get his attention, staring at him you noticed he was completely ripped for a teenager, brief memories flashed showing him being top for PE at his high school. Now shirtless he began the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically you tried to alert your brother but he wasn't looking and he began taking off his boxers. His package freed itself from the prison of his boxers and he was still half erect! You noticed how huge his package was, each testicle was the size of a country and his cock was longer than millions of skyscrapers top to top! Your brother had gotten into puberty early, and was fully developed by now being an actual man even if the law didn't see him so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he moved and you saw him turn both taps on. The hot and cold taps began spouting liquid at insane rates, and you saw a tsunami of water come towards you at breakneck speeds! Suddenly it hit you and you felt yourself pulled underwater. You struggled to stay afloat and came so close to drowning before the adrenaline hit and you got aflot. The water rised quickly but you managed to rise with it, constantly tredding water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually managed to survive this long! You thought maybe you could survive until finally a shadow dropped and you saw your massive brother descend upon you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could tell whatever you were looking up at was a dalmation from the white and black spotted fur as well as a female, because you were well in between her breasts but you barely process what you were seeing. She had to be 6 miles tall from how large her face was as well as having arms and legs, you were sitting in the chest space of some titanic anthromorph dog. This girl smiles down at you warmly and you felt a little calmed. There's just one problem with this, you don't have any sisters even though you're mom always wanted one. \"Knew I shouldn't have gotten drunk last night, even though it was my 18th birthday\" you say pinching you're arm, \"ow\" you say as it hurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning bro\" she says in a singsong voice, you look up at her through the fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning...uhhh\" you pause not sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda\" she replies. \"Don't worry you'll get used to it soon\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so glad I finally have a brother, it was worth bringing you here\" she says smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, WHAT?\" you yell at her. You hear a noise and turn to see her bedroom door open, in walks another dalmation, also female but a head taller, so you assume it's her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks up and smiles down at you, \"good morning\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't answer instead opting to stare at Amanda, \"explanation now\" you say in as cold a voice as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W,well I always wanted a brother, but my parents became unable to have anymore kids, and there is no adoption, so my dad built a teleporter and brought you here, and it well exploded after 1 use\" Amanda says. In walks another dalmation as Amanda says this. This dalmation was obviously male making him her father, you turn and glare at this individual and he shrinks back, which would have been pretty funny as he was over 5,000 times you're size but given the circumstances it wasn't. Amanda's mother sits down beside her and gently picks you up and puts you in her palm, but for some reason you don't get vertigo from moving what must have been half a mile in a second. The male dalmation walks up, \"hey there. I know you're kind of freaked but um since the teleporter exploded, you well can't go back\" he says trying to act calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you can feel right now is anger that won't stop burning and as soon as the male dalmation finishes you bite into all of them. \"What is this some sick joke? So find something so much smaller then yourselves and take it's life from it. I had a dreams, friends, family and you ripped that away from me and now you're telling me I can't go back. So what your'e daughter wanted a brother, there's a little thing called adoption, and if that doens't work like she said, well then you have no right, no fucking right, to take me from my home.\" you end you're tirade and just stand there. Then the sheer weight of what you just said sets in, you fall forward onto hands and knees and tears start falling, all you're strength disappears and you fall forward. You just lay there weeping, you were sure all of them were staring at you, you just lay there and cried you're heart out when much to you're suprise you felt something gently press against you. Ammanda's mother was gently stroking you're back, you just laid there till the tears stopped and you look up at Amanda's mother, \"can I....have some time to myself?\" you ask. She looks over at Amanda who nods and she puts you down at the center of the bed. Amanda and her mother get up and follow her father out of the room. You just sit there taking everything in, you look around the room, it wasn't anything much, you know normal girl's room, pink walls, old stuffed toys scattered everywhere. You honestly judge the distance between where you were and the end of the bed and if you could reach it in less than an hour as you knew the fall from the bed to the floor would most likely kill you. You shake the thought away, \"I am not killing myself, no matter how bad it gets\" you think. You just lay there for probably half an hour, you cried twice more but didn't really care at this stage. You heard a door open and in quietly walks Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sits down on the bed and stares at you, \"um....I don't know you're name\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's Alex\" you reply. Amanda reaches over and tries to pick you up but you back up, you glare at her and she freezes. She unfreezes after a second and gently picks you up and puts you down in her other palm, you turn away from her and you feel something large and wet press against you're back for a second before you're pushed forward and Amanda licks her hand as well as you. You turn and stare up at this giant Dalmation girl. \"Just leave me alone, you and you're whole fucking family, you stole my life\" you say adding as much malice to the statement as you can. Amanda stares down at you shocked, and then you're shocked as she starts to cry, \"i,i'm sorry\" she manages to say in between sobs. You stare up at her and you feel all you're anger and sadness disappear, you sigh and stand up. \"Hey come on stop crying\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're right, i'm just..a...selfish.....monster\" she says crying again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, no you're not, you were just lonely\" you say. Amanda slowly stops crying and stares at you, \"why, are you being nice to me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you said I can't get back, so might as well make the best of it, besides you are my adoptive sis from today on aren't you?\" you ask. Amanda stares down at you shocked, \"i..I\" she can't answer all you can see is this huge grin on her face. You look her up and down, \"oh yeah Sis, you might want to put some clothes on\" you say. Amanda blushes and puts you down on the bed, she races over to a dresser and was soon standing in front of you in a tight fitting white t-shirt and a pair of shorts. She turns and stares at you, \"well what do you think?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you asking me?\" you ask. She shrugs but you saw a smile on her face, 'because I want you to think I look good\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does woof give you an answer? you ask, \"but seriously you look really good\" you say. Much to you're suprise Amanda blushes, \"thanks\" she says gently picking you up and putting you down on her palm. You sit down and Amanda starts walking through the house, this is when you start thinking about things like \"why haven't the sound waves destroyed me or just her breath sent me flying\" but you shrug, \"you were teleported through dimensions, crap like that doesn't really matter much does it\" you think. Amanda walks downstairs and goes into a kitchen that was just huge, the table could probably hold you're home town. Amanda's father looks up from a giant newspaper and smiles as he sees you with her, \"glad to see you're up\" he says. You stare at him and sigh, Amanda's mother starts to stand up, \"sit\" you say and she does. \"Look, i'm...i'm sorry\" you say, \"I know this was a lot to take in, but I shouldn't have gotten as mad as I did\" you continue. Amanda's father shakes his head, \"don't worry about it, you had every right, oh by the way i'm Tom and this is Clare\" he says indicating his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can just call me Mom\" Clare says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh....thanks\" you say. You look at the table and see three giant plates of bacon and scrambled eggs as Amanda sits down and deposits you on the table. \"So how do I eat? you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" Amanda says, she cuts off a tiny portion of the bacon and the eggs putting them in front of you, you can't help but laugh as even though the pieces were miniscule they were 20 times you're size. You walk up and eat you're fill before Amanda licks up the remaining food getting you with her tongue as she does. \"Hey watch it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you just look as tasty as the food\" she says and you freeze for a second before she laughs, \"I meant you're cute, geez\" she says. You laugh nervously but truth be told you're heart just skipped about 5 beats. Everyone else soon finished and you sat there staring up at you're new family. Clare smiles at you and says \"Well kids it's.....</span></div></div>",

You stare up at Amanda, \"uh what do i do about clothes and well showering and all that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly, you don't think we didn't prepare the house for when you showed up\" Amanda replies. She heads upstairs and first takes you to the bathroom, she puts you down on the marble counter and you see a tiny indent in a tile. You walk forward and notice it's a door with tinted glass, you don't even ask how it was made, you open it and look inside seeing it was a shower stall. You look at Amanda and she smiles, \"well i'm going to take a shower, so you take one too\" she says. You nod stunned and you enter and strip putting you're pajamas outside, you take a quick shower laughing a little bit as all you're stuff was just slivers of the normal sized item. You grabbed a \"towel\" and dried off before sticking you're head out and freezing. Amanda was standing there dripping wet seeming to forget about you, you quickly grab you're pajamas and she turns and realizes you're there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek\" she screams and you shut the door and you heard something smack against the door probably a towel. You quickly got dressed but waited a minute, you opened the door to see Amanda standing there and she smiled a bit \"um...sorry you had to see that\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what i've known you less than an hour and i've already seen you naked twice\" you say smiling unable to contain yourself. Amanda gently picks you up still smiling, \"stop it\" she says blushing, you laugh and she walks into her room, she puts you down on a night stand and you notice a tiny dresser. You walk over and look over all the clothes, you grab a shirt and pants and quickly notice how fuzzy they were as well how everything was either black or white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Amanda what's with the clothes?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they're all hand-sewn, my mom's really got good hand-eye coordination, and well I provided the materials\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh now this is fur that isn't murder\" you think. You get dressed and realize afterwards that Angela had watched you get dressed and undressed, \"hey\" you say staring angrily at her after you were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but if you get to see so do I\" Amanda says smiling. She picks you up as well as a school bag and heads downstairs where you find Tom standing there in a suit, \"i'll drive you 2 to school\" he says. Amanda follows him out the front door and she climbs into a silver sports car being mindful of you in her palm. She sits down then puts you down in her lap being careful to just cover both of you with the seat belt. Tom starts the vehicle and starts driving, \"so how come you all know english?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah the english language, you know what you're speaking right now\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about, you're speaking dog\" Amanda says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look can you just draw me an a, or the equivelant of\" you say and she pulls a peice of paper out of her bag and draws a normal lower case a.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok it seems to be one in the same\" you say and the topic is dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah don't worry, the school's very small about 100 people, and the faculty know you're coming\" Tom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I kind of have a reputation\" Tom says, \"so they weren't shocked\" he continues. You started to get a little worried, Amanda and her family seemed nice but a whole whack of other people. Amanda seeming to sense you're fear leans over and gently presses against you with 1 finger, \"it'll be ok\" she whispers and you hug her finger instictually causing her to giggle. All too quickly the car stopped and Amanda stepped out and waved to her dad with her free hand. Her hand was now mostly curled up so that you'd be caught if you fell, she walked through from what you saw of it a normal high school. Rows upon rows of lockers, brickwork, a foyer, everything seemed normal just huge, oh and there was the near constant clicking sound of claws long and short on the floor. You felt Amanda stop and you looked out from between her fingers, standing in front of her was a kangaroo morph in a modified buisness suit so her pouch still stuck out. The kangaroo leaned forward, \"hello Ms wags\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Ms. Roo\" Amanda replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're father called and said I should hold a school wide announcement as you were bringing something special to school today, where is it?\" Ms.Roo asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right here\" Amanda says opening her hand and lifting you up, Ms.Roo stands there shocked, \"hi\" you say. Ms.Roo lowers her head and looks at you, \"hello\" she replies nervously not sure of what you're going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I don't bite\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the announcement, what is he?\" Ms.Roo asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human\" you reply. Ms.Roo extends a hand, and you're carefully passed from one individual to the next, Ms.Roo turns and walks through the halls of the school with Amanda on her heels. She walks to the back of an auditorium and up a flight of stairs onto a stage, she walks through a curtain and you're blinded for a second. In front of her was probably the entire populace of the school and Tom was right there was 100 giant anthros if that. Ms. Roo taps a microphone with her free hand and you heard muttering as Amanda walked to stand next to Ms.Roo. Ms. Roo cleared her throat and starts speaking, \"welcome students, I know this is sudden all though we're only a week into the new term, we have a new transfer student. This transfer student is a boy, and he will be living with Ms. wags behind me\" she says. You were getting kind of nervous and started fidgeting, \"So i'd like everyone to come up on stage so he can introduce himself in person\" Ms. Roo continues. There was a lot of muttering and Ms. Roo passed you back to Amanda who cupped her hands together, when she moved them you heard 100 gasps of suprise as the whole school saw you although some were kneeling to get a better look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" a boy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey i'm not an it, i'm a person\" you say and he freezes and stares at you like you were gonna shoot him or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww he's so cute\" was the general consensus from the girls. \"What's you're name?\" asks a tiger morph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex wags I guess since i'm now her adoptive brother\" you say pointing at Amanda. You were bombarded with questions for the next 10 minutes, you answered the best you could, although you kept as much info about home as secret as possible. Ms.Roo smiles down at you and gently picks you up, \"I know this will sound strange, but can I carry you around in my pouch for a bit?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" you and Amanda and the school say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I haven't been able to have my own Joey yet and I always wanted to be a mother\" Ms. Roo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...am really not sure\" you say. Ms. Roo looks down at you sadly and you sigh, \"fine but only for 30 seconds\" you say. You were carefully dropped inside her pouch, it was warm and you had a lot of room to move and Ms.Roo hopped around for a bit, \"it works, I really do feel like a mother, how are you my little Joey\" she asks opening the pouch and looking down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine \"mom\"\" you say humoring her. Soon the 30 seconds was up and Ms. Roo carefully passed you back to Amanda, \"thank you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem\" you reply, soon all the students were making requests, the guys wanted to do things like give you high fives or have a chess match while the girls usually wanted ot just cuddle with you because they found you cute. Amanda however wouldn't allow any more requests instead she headed for home room. In the hall she stopped and looked down at you, \"so how Ms.Roo's pouch?\" she asked trying to act nonchalant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warm and comfy, good for a kid, probably a good place to sleep, not a good place for a teenager\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda then asks you bluntly, \"do you mind if I carried you somewhere else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" you reply. Before you knew what was happening Amanda had carefully dropped you in between her cleavage and you were landed in her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you\" you say but Amanda cuts you off and gently holds you in place. She walks to homeroom taking purposeful steps causing her chest to bounce and you feel her sit down and she pulls you out. You glare at her and she smiles \"sorry\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what are you jealous\" you say and you're suprised she flares red, \"maybe a little\" she says looking away a bit. The first bell rings and in streams about 10 other students who all moved they're desks closer to Amanda's. You're first class of the day was....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ms. Roo walks in and Amanda pulls out a math textbook or what you assumed was a math textbook from what you could see as well as pulling out a calculator. She puts you down between herself and the book and Ms. Roo coughs \"now class turn to page 153 in your books\" she says and Amanda starts flipping pages. You could see the board and book from your vantage point on her chest but that was about all you could do. This was grade 12 pure math, you need a calculator to be able to do this stuff. You sit back and sigh inwardly, the class goes on with Amanda not noticing any problems. You tried to keep up and did as much mental math as you possibly could but it was a futile effort. You sighed again and this time Amanda heard it, \"what's wrong?\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a calculator to do this\" you say. Amanda looks down at you and you knew there wasn't much she or you could do. The rest of the morning followed this pattern, I mean the globe had a horizon for you although it did let up at lunch. Amanda carefully removed part of a sandwhich and put it down near you as well as letting a drop of juice fall into the groove of the tray making it pretty much acted like a trough for you. You dug into the piece of sandwhich and easily drank your fill of what you figured out was apple juice before Amanda licked up the piece of sandwhich and the drop of juice was deposited with the tray. Amanda spent the rest of lunch just snuggling with you, it was actually really nice, she just held you to her cheek and let you pet her. You sighed again and Amanda turned and looked at you, \"what's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll say it right now, I can't learn like this, no calculator so I can't do math, the globe in history has a bloody horizon for me\" you say and you sigh again. \"What's the point in me being here, I mean if I can't learn i've got no future and you'll just drift further and further from me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Amanda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'll go to college, get married, and i'll just be left here\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda pushes against you with the tip of one finger, \"you won't be left here, as for marriage well, you aren't my real brother\" she says. You laugh out loud at this, \"oh so what i'm going to marry you in the future and you'll take care of me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't want me to?\" she asks. You freeze and look at her, \"really, I mean look at me, i'm a speck\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I am the reason you came here, besides your a nice guy, I mean do you know what you could have done?\" she asks. You do know as a few thoughts had crossed your mind but you had pushed them away instantly. \"Besides I am already taking care of you, so don't worry about it, or do you not want me?\" she asks. You looked up at you new adoptive sister or and you started to think about it. \"Don't do it, this whole world is crazy, just jump and end it\" part of your mind said. \"Amanda seems very nice, she is the reason your here, but she hasn't tried to hurt you, but is it guilt?\" the other part of your mind said. \"Giant hot dog wants to take care of you go for it\" the 3rd part of your mind said. You sigh and look at Amanda, \"Amanda I want you to answer me honestly, do you really mean that, or do you still feel a little guilty for bringing me here?\" you ask. Amanda stares at you shocked for a second and then she looks down, \"I mean it, but I do still feel sort of guilty, I made it so you lost your whole life and now you can't even start a new one here, you were right before I really am a monster\" she says. You sigh and look at her, \"Amanda I already told you I took that too far, but I do want you, if you'll have me\" you say. Amanda lifts her head and smiles at you and gently licks you. You laughed and she kept licking you till the bell rang for 3rd period. Amanda gets up and heads to third period which was gym, she smiles down at you, \"your in for a real treat\" she says. You were about to ask why when she walked into the girl's locker room, everyone turn as Amanda enters and you immediately shut your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda what the hell are you doing?\" you whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on now, it's not like you haven't already seen a girl naked\" she replies much too loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, who has he seen?\" you hear a girl ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, twice actually\" Amanda replies you weren't sure what to do, it wasn't like you could get off Amanda's paw. You finally opened up your eyes and thankfully all the girls you could see were still clothed as well as Amanda, although they were all smiling at you. \"Uh hi\" you say not sure what else to really do. A tabby bends down and smiles at you \"Hi i'm Elizabeth\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh nice to meet you\" you reply soon you were introduced to the other 9 titan sized anthros in the room. Amanda opens up her locker and pulls something out before putting you down on the ledge and smiling at you, \"remember no peeking\" she says before shutting the door. You sigh in relief, yeah there were some slits you could have looked out from but they were below you, I mean it's not like you didn't want to look, you wanted to look a lot. But your survival instinct was overriding everything at this moment as well you watched a lot of anime and you knew what usually happened to perverts. You heard them start laughing, \"hey Amanda, did you get bigger?\" Elizabeth asks, seems they had now forgotten all about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not\" Amanda says and you heard her give off a yelp and a moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, it sure feels like you've gotten bigger\" Elizabeth says. You were kind of freaking out and you heard laughter as well as a bunch of movement. You sighed as you weren't sure them forgetting you was a good or a bad thing. You sat there for 10 minutes, it was really weird as every so often you'd hear a moan or what sounded like a whimper. Finally you had enough \"hey you all about done yet?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap we forgot all about him\" Elizabeth says. The locker door is opened and Amanda sticks her head in and she offers you a finger which you climb on. You were brought out and thankfully all the girls were dressed in a white t-shirt and gym shorts although they were all staring at you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you hear?\" Amanda asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of things, moans and what sounded like a whimper\" you reply and they all stare at you shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you not tell anyone, the thing is most of us except Ms fussy pants over here kind of bat for both teams\" Elizabeth says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I saw nothing, and I heard nothing, as long as you don't tell the guys i'm in here while you change, even if I stay in that locker they'd still want to kill me\" you say. \"Deal\" Elizabeth says extending a finger, you touch the fur with your hand and shake. Amanda smiles down at you, \"you do know your exempt from Gym right, you'll be staying with the teacher Mrs. spots\" Amanda says as her and the other girls leave the locker room and enter the gym. Amanda walks up to Mrs. Spots who was obviously a leopard but what suprised you was she was a snow leopard. Amanda taps her on the shoulder and she looks first at Amanda then at you in her hand \"wow he really did bring over a tiny creature, hi i'm Mrs. Spots the phys ed teacher\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex wags, at your service\" you reply and she chuckles before Amanda gently picks you up and places you in Mrs. Spot's palm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mrs. Spots put you down on her shoulder and seemed for a few minutes to forget about you as she barked orders at the students. Thankfully she wasn't one of those hands on gym teachers as you were sure you couldn't hang on if she started running. She walks over to a bench and sits down and seems to forget about you as she almost jumps up when you sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head tilts and she stares down at you \"something wrong? Your not even running the course\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the eye you could see \"Can I ask you a question?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your teacher, so sure\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can any of you care? I mean I am literally a speck compared to you\" you say. Mrs. Spots looks stunned by the question for a second and then she seems to have an answer so she looks calmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can care because I know what it's like to have to look up at people, you might not believe it, but I was the runt of my litter and I have to look up at most people\" she says. You admit, you hadn't been able to tell that, but then again you had to look up at everybody. \"You seem like a very nice kid, you've just been thrown a very big curveball, I know you'll be able to beat it though because you seem like the kind not to give up\" Mrs. Spots says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mrs. Spots\" you reply and she nods and goes back to watching the girls run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tiffany your falling behind\" she yells a few seconds later. You sat like that for the majority of the period although about half way through you got up and had your own little run, trying to figure out how the whole fur thing worked. Her fur was you know pretty tall, but it was still only about knee height to you when from your calculations it should have been above you, like tree height above you. You finally gave up trying to figure it out as it just wasn't important and went back to sitting. About 5 minutes before you assume the bell was supposed to ring based on what you had seen with period lengths in this school Mrs. Spots stands up and picks you up between two fingers transferring you to her palm. She walks into the building and straight into the girls locker room heading for what you remembered was Amanda's locker. She opens the locker and lifts you up to the little platform and puts you down, before you could ask she says \"I always run with the girls for the last 5 minutes, so I think you'll be safer here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so too, thanks Mrs. Spots\" you say. She nods and shuts the door, you just sat there for a few minutes when you started to hear voices. Suprising you was they were talking with that frenzied excitement girls only speak of in the presence of other girls, it seems Mrs. Spots had either not told Amanda you were there or she had forgotten you. The latter thought was disspelled as Elizabeth asked her \"so where's your \"little\" companion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Mrs. Spots says he's in a safe place and I trust her\" Amanda replies. You were about to speak but thought better of it, for some reason this felt more like well you were an actual dude stuck in the girls locker room kind of scenario. The chatter became mostly girl talk for a minute until you felt something hit the locker you were in and you heard Elizabeth ask \"Amanda your not getting away this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it Elizabeth, I have someone I like\" Amanda replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really, and who might that be, I know a few guys have hit on you but I thought you always turned them down\" Elizabeth says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It, It's actually Alex, he's so trusting and he's just adorable at that size, plus it's my fault he's here and well...\" she trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what?\" Elizabeth asks prying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just, really want to make sure he's safe alright, that and he was such a gentlemen when he saw me naked, he didn't stare, he didn't try to push it, he just told me and that was it\" she says. The room went quiet for a few seconds till you assume Mrs. Spots walked in as the next thing you heard was Amanda saying \"Mrs. Spots can I have Alex back now, we need to get to our next class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean have him back? He's been sitting in your locker waiting for you for the last few minutes\" Mrs. Spots replies. If the locker room was quiet before that was said then it was deathly quiet afterwards, Amanda slowly opens the locker and looks up at you her eyes locking onto you. She takes her clothes out, shuts the door, changes in probably 5 seconds and then lifts her hand up and gently grabs you. You were transferred to her shoulder and she just left the locker room, you looked up at her as it was weird she didn't say anything. Your last 2 classes were thankfully english and what seemed to be latin class. You tried fruitlessly through out those 2 classes and the walk period between them to get Amanda to talk to you, something, but she wouldn't respond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the final bell for home rang and Amanda got up after copying the homework, she moved you onto her shoulder and just walked out of the school. \"Isn't your dad picking us up?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can only drive me to school, always too busy to drive me home\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became silent for a few seconds and you inwardly sigh knowing you couldn't let this go on. \"Amanda, I'm sorry for eavesdropping, I should have spoken up\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stops walking and stares down at you \"you shouldn't have heard that, I can't like you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not, something wrong with me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her head \"no, something is wrong with me. How can you not hate me, I took your life from you, how are you not absolutely terrified of me, I could squish you like a bug\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to squish me like a bug?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not\" she replies quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to hurt me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there's no reason for me to be afraid\" you say. She sighs and looks down at you \"I have to ask again, are you sure you want me? I mean what if I got angry and hurt you, or or....\" you couldn't help yourself you started laughing. \"What's so funny\" she says glaring as best she could down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amanda that concern just means you really do like me, look even though you're the reason I'm here, your my protector and I'm really thankful for that, that and your the cutest girl I've ever seen\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, think I'm cute?\" she says sounding quite startled at the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head \"so can you stop being so down on yourself, I want no other then you to protect me, because I'd only trust someone I love to protect me\" you say. You saw a smile play at the edge of Amanda's lips and 2 fingers gently picked you up and put you down in her palm. You were raised up to face level and she pursed her lips together \"I think your a bit too big for a normal kiss to work\" you say. She sighs \"fine get to the edge of my palm\" she says. You do so although you were a little freaked out by the sheer drop you saw and she lifted her hand till it was touching her lip, you lean up and kiss her lip for a few seconds and strangely enough she seems to feel it as she sighs. You move back and she gently moves her hand over to her shoulder and deposits you. She then decides to.....</span></div></div>",

Amanda instantly stood up and gently scooped you up from the table. \"Sure mom.\" Amanda said very excited. It was a very amazing experience been carried around on Amanda's finger. The black pads looked like an endless landscape to you. \"Ok this is the bathroom.\" Amanda said snapping you out of your thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shown everything from the sink to the toilet to the bath. \"Um, how am I going to wash?\" you said looking up at Amanda who had a thoughtful look on her face. \"I don't know but I'm sure dad will be able to make something for you.\" You couldn't help but smile up at your sister. \"She's been so kind and gentle, maybe things wont be so bad after all.\" You thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shall we go to the next room little bro.\" Amanda said teasingly. \"Sure, big sister.\" You teased back. Amanda smiled down at you as she left the bathroom turning left. \"Amanda!\" You heard a familiar voice shout before you were sent flying through the air. Judging from what you could see Amanda and Clare had almost bumped into each other, but Amanda's sudden stop was more than enough to send you flying off her finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you and Alex ok?\" Clare said slightly stepping forward  unwarily knocking her boobs against you which sent you flying back to Amanda. however instead of going forward you went down. \"Yes mom we're fine.\" Your sister said unaware of your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to scream as you fell to the floor but your voice refused to work. All you could do was close your eyes and prepare for impact. You felt the wnd get knocked out of you as you hit the carpeted floor but nothing seemed to be broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cant believe i survived that.\" you said gasping for air. Looking up you saw that you were between Clare and Amanda. \"Hey down here!\" you shouted hoping that they would hear you. You looked away thinking that they didnt hear you but suddenly things got dark which caused you to look up and see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You also see that she's a panther girl with short black hair. \"Okay, lets get some breakfast.\" she says as she places you in her palm. With that she gets up and begins walking. From your vantage point you see that she was in bed, and you must have been sleeping on her. She walks through a hall and down some stairs, then enters a kitchen. \"Good morning guys.\" she says as she enters the room. At the table you see two other girls. One is a lioness with long auburn hair and an impressive bust, while the other is a leopard with blond hair. The leopard must be younger than the others, as she's smaller than them.  Although she's still a giant to you. Also in the room you see a a woman who appears to be a tigress. She's bigger than the others and has red hair done up in a bun. Not to mention she has quite a voluptuous figure. \"Hey you two, sit down for breakfast.\" the tigress says. \"Thanks mom.\" your panther sister says and sits at the table. \"Morning.\" the lioness says giving you a smile. The leopard greets you as well and you realize from the vibe that these girls were your sisters and that the tiger is your mother. This is too strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tiger passes out the food the other three cats converse amongst themselves. You learn more about them from what you piece together from their conversation. The lioness, named Lena, is the oldest sister here and is nineteen years old. The panther, who you woke up with, is Penny, and is seventeen, a year older than you. The leopard is Leslie, and she's fifteen. You're still blown away by the situation but have to accept it. You're part of a family where you're mother and three sisters are all giant felines.

As far as you can tell, they eat like normal humans. They do eat a lot of meat though, which makes sense considering they're all carnivores. There's a lot of bacon and sausage on your plate compared to the eggs. As you dig in you feel a presence right above you. You look up to see Penny's black furred finger coming towards you. She wipes some food off of your face and give you a smile. \"Hey, let him eat!\" Leslie says to her. \"Relax, I'm just helping him clean up. You don't mind, right bro?\" Penny counters. \"Its okay, really. Thank you Penny.\" you say. \"You're really helpful and you even make a good bed.\" When you say this Leslie and Lena stop eating. \"Bed?\" Lena asks. I thought we agreed it was too dangerous to have him sleep on us! We're only supposed to have him somewhere near us!\" Leslie gives Penny a dirty look. \"Yeah! Its not fair that you get to sleep with him and not us!\" This seems strange, but from what you hear it seems like they're fighting over you. Thats weird considering you're just they're brother. \"Well if she gets to, then I'm sleeping with him when its my turn to keep him tonight!\" Lena announces. \"Now now girls, I know you all love your brother, and what Penny did was sneaky, but it is dangerous to have someone so small in a vulnerable place. Especially when we're asleep and could hurt him without knowing.\" Your tigress mother says. \"Come on, he was fine. Besides, he liked it, right bro?\" the panthress says. You look up at them all and nod reluctantly. You have no clue whats going on. \"Well if he wants to then I guess I'll allow it from now on.\" your mother says. The three sisters celebrate amongst themselves while you stare on. You feel like you just agreed to something without knowing. Lena brings her face down to you and stares at you with her big brown eyes. \"You hear that? We're gonna a great sleep tonight!\" The gigantic tigress then walks over and bends down. \"And tomorrow night you get to sleep your old mother!\" she says. Well it might be a strange world to wake up to, but at least they care about you. In fact they seem to love you a lot. A whole lot. Breakfast ends soon after. What next?</span></div></div>",

Penny and Lena groan, but Leslie ignores them. \"You guys were just a little too slow!\"  Everyone then goes off on their own, with Leslie carrying you to the living room. She plops down on the couch and places you on her shoulder. You sneak a couple glances downward and see her breasts. While they're not as big as those of the others, she's clearly still growing. It makes you laugh a little that your little sister is a giant to you and still growing. You feel movement as she turns the TV on and begins watching cartoons. They're pretty good, basically the same as you remember except with animal people instead of humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she's enjoying her cartoons Leslie decides to get more comfortable and stretches out on the couch.You hang on as she repositions herself and end up tumbling down her front as she lays on her side. You just lay back against her and relax. You can hear your leopard sister purring above you as you get closer to her. Soon her giant furry finger reaches down and scratches your head with her claw. When the shows end Leslie turns to lie on her back. \"Lets take a nap okay bro?\" she suggests. Before you can answer she picks you up and puts you on her chest. As she lays back she resumes scratching your head. While she dozes off you find yourself getting drowsy too. It is Saturday, so a nap couldn't hurt. You then slowly fall asleep on Leslie's chest. About thirty minutes later, one of you wakes up. Who?</span></div></div>",

She looks down at her chest and sees that you're still sleeping. \"He's so cute.\" she whispers as she strokes your tiny body. As she does this you unconsciously grab her finger in your sleep. As you grasp her fur and cuddle with it she has to stifle a giggle. She then gently moves her finger with you attached and sets you atop her breast. You lose your grip and fall onto her breast. It acts like a bed and you stretch out to get more comfortable. This motion causes Leslie to lightly shiver from the sensation. She loves you so much. She knows the rest of the family does too, but for now you're all hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for you to wake up as well. You feel the soft sensation underneath you as you sit up. You squeeze the material in your hand as you try to figure out what it is. Suddenly a gasp comes from behind you. You turn your head to see Leslie with a deep blush on her face. Looking down you see that you currently groping her boob. \"Oh my god! I'm sorry!\" you exclaim as you quickly let go. In your surprise you back up and your hand lands on something that is slightly poking up from under her shirt. When this happens she lets out another gasp and her body twitches. This causes you to tumble off her breast and land on the middle of her shirt. \"Sorry!\" you shout up at her. \"No its okay.\" she tells you. \"It wasn't your fault. I moved you there to make you more comfortable.\" You rub your head in embarrassment. \"Thanks it did feel really good.\" you say. Leslie's blush returns when you say this and she gives you a wide smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice the blush and decide to address it. \"Leslie, why do you guys act like that toward me?\" you ask. \"Because we love you.\" she says quickly. You shake your head. \"I get that, but just now it seemed like you were treating me like more than a brother.\" She looks away and sighs. \"I guess I shouldn't hide it since you noticed.\" she confesses. When we adopted you I took an instant liking to you. After a year or so I realized I was attracted to you.\" You listen in astonishment while she explains herself. \"But its not that weird! Its not like we're really related! Besides, I know the others feel the same way!\" You stare up at her face in surprise. \"Really? All of them?\" you ask. \"Well I know Lena and Penny do. We're not sure about mom though, but we have our suspicions.\" she answers. Wow.This is amazing. Just as you start to process all of this....</span></div></div>",

Then the ground begins to shift and you yell before a large hand big enough to build a city on scoops you up and holds you by the shirt. As you shake it the grip, you look the hand's owner in the face and gasp. You're looking directly at a gigantic hippopotamus woman that had to be a thousand miles high. She had rose skin with long blonde hair, As she stood up, you saw that she had a birthmark over her eye shaped like a hippo's footprint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo giantess had H-cup breasts (in scale) and a huge stomach that had to be 800 miles wide and a butt that had to be just as big. You let out a scream as you look her in her planetary eye. \"Please don't eat me!\" you yell. The hippo giantess looks at you and lets out a sigh. \"Sam,\" she says in a surprisingly high pitched voice. \"Do we seriously have to go through this every time we wake up.\" Suddenly you recognize that voice. \"Beth?\" you ask. That's when you realized that this hippo giantess was your oldest sister. You remember having three older sisters and they all towered over you, but not like this. You notice that she's wearing pajamas and realize you were sleeping on her mountainous stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" says the hippo behemoth. \"That's me. Are you feeling okay bro? I let you sleep in my room because of how sick you've been. Mom and the others were worried.\" \"B-But,\" you say. \"Beth, why are you a hippo.\" Beth just rolls her eyes. \"Because I always was a hippo?\" she asks sarcastically. Come on little bro, I better get you downstairs.\" Beth places you on the top of her snout before walking you down to breakfast. You couldn't believe it, your sister was a giant anthro. You remember being adopted, but not much else. From what little you could remember, you had three older sisters and a single mother. Before you can say another word, Beth brings you down to the kitchen. \"Good news everyone,\" she says. \"I think Sam's almost recovered.

Just one of them could destroy a big city with one toe. Your mother had become a blue skinned hippopotamus with long reddish brown hair that appeared to be graying and was just sitting down at the table where your other two sisters were waiting. You remember that one of them was older than Beth while the other was younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was the oldest of your sisters Alyssa, she still had long black hair and a pair of glasses and you remember her having a pierced lip and gothic attire but she was now a giant red skinned hippo woman. You rub your eyes as Alyssa turns to you. \"Good morning Squirt,\" she says. \"Feeling alright?\" She said that in an almost condescending tone but you knew she was messing with you like she always did. You didn't know how to respond though given how <i>much</i> bigger she was than you remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a giggle as Beth places you down on the table in front of your third sister, Gemma, who was now a green skinned hippo girl with orange red hair and a slight scar on her face. You remembered her being rather athletic though you didn't see how now given all the excess bulk she has. \"Quit teasing him Alyssa,\" says Gemma. \"It's not Sam's fault he's tiny.\" You hear a squeaking noise and see that Beth has taken two chairs. You look to see all of them are using two chairs instead of one. Guess they need it to support their weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother places pancakes on the table and all five of you dig in. As you're eating your breakfast you can't help but watch as your family is shoveling their breakfast in and being hippos, they can eat a lot in a very short time. You shiver and are somewhat unnerved. You almost think that one of them might eat you by mistake. Alyssa notices you staring as syrup drips out of her mouth. \"Hey shrimp,\" she says. \"Mom worked hard on those pancakes so I'd advise you to eat them before they get cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh sorry,\" you say as you continue eating. \"It's just... I'm kinda...\" Alyssa raises an eye. \"Are you implying that I'd eat you? I'm insulted.\" \"No!\" you yell. \"I mean...\" Gemma lets out a giggle and then taps you on cheek. \"Well, he is so sweet and cute you could just swallow him whole.\" \"Gemma!\" yells Beth. \"You're scaring him! He might have amnesia. Humans aren't used to anthro colds. You should know. You got him sick to begin with.\" Gemma blushes as you just continue eating your pancakes. You look forward to see your mother has finished and is rubbing her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen your mother looks down on you. \"Sam,\" she says. \"Sweetie. I think I have something stuck in my teeth. Would you mind taking a quick look.\" You nod your head and your mother picks you up before opening her hippo mouth wide. You see fangs as big as skyscrapers and a tongue big enough to build a city on as you're laid down on it. You couldn't believe it. You were in your own mother's mouth and she was a hippo. You walk down and see that she has a piece of pancake stuck between her back teeth. You yank out the crumb and then toss it down your mother's esophagus. You look down the hole and shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't stay in there too long honey,\" says your mother. \"I don't want to pump you out of my stomach again.\" You step back. \"Oh yeah, sorry Mom.\" \"Thanks for the assist sweetie.\" You walk down the tongue as your mother holds her mouth open wide. \"Uh mom,\" you say. \"Can I ask you a question?\" \"Go ahead Sam.\" Says your mother as you walk down her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip and then look around before you ask your question. \"Am I adopted.\" Your mother rolls her eyes. \"We've already had this talk hun.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Beth walked into the kitchen with you on your snout, you suddenly remember something. You weren\u2019t the only one adopted. You and your three sisters were all adopted because your mother was unable to have children herself. However, it couldn\u2019t be any more obvious than you and your sisters were not related by blood because NONE of them were the same species as each other or your mother. You remember that Beth was the middle child of your three sisters and the hippopotamus giantess was the closest sister to you. As it was, your sisters despite being adults, chose to stay to help your mother because her eyesight was failing her and she was in danger of going blind. More of your memories come back. Of course, there was one thing that your mothers and sisters had in common. They were all 800 mile high, they were all somewhat obese and they were all anthropomorphic mammals known for being heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of them was the oldest of your three sisters, Alexandria; Alex for short. Alex was an 800 mile high camel and somewhat of a nerd. She had bright red fur and strawberry pink hair worn in a ponytail and bun. She had two enormous humps on her back and the second biggest rear of your sisters after Beth. Although she did have the biggest belly out of the trio because she was always filled with water. She wore a pair of triangular glasses and a gray 1980s style jumpsuit that did a good deal of showing off her curves. You remember that Alex had a job as a reporter for Channel 12 News. She was the smartest of your siblings but you did have a spat with her from time and time due to her teasing you for your small size. Alex was currently making coffee for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the youngest of your three older sisters, Chase. Chase was an 800 mile high blue-skinned armadillo girl who while having a smaller belly and butt than your other two sisters (though her butt was still big enough to require two chairs), she had the biggest breasts. Chase was a goth girl who had pure dyed purple hair and was dressed in black leather with a spiked choker and ankle bracelets and a pierced navel. Despite her dark appearance, she was on good terms with you. But a lot of times she treated you more like her pet than her younger brother. Chase was a programmer for a computer company and you saw that she appeared to be texting at the breakfast table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChase,\u201d says your mother. \u201cI thought that I told you not to text at the table.\u201d Chase shrugged her shoulders and put her phone away. \u201cSorry, Mom.\u201d Your mother stomps in and reveals herslef to be a 800 mile high rhinoceros with bright green skin and long white hair. She was actually heavier than your sisters and was wearing a blue leotard with leg warmers and a jacket that made her look like she came from an 80s music video.  She also wore large crescent moon-shaped earrings and a pair of heart-shaped sunglasses. Your mother then turns her head and spots you riding on Beth\u2019s nose. \u201cSam!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThere you are, sweetie. Thank goodness that cold of yours is over and done.\u201d You mom snatches you up and then you look in slight panic as the rhinoceros giantess takes you up to her lips, big enough to build a city on and gives you a big kiss, completely covering you in lipstick and rhino drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kiss made you remember something. Your mother first found you in her flower garden when you were a baby and realized you were a human. Apparently, humans were believed to have gone extinct a thousand years ago. She adopted you and it attracted heat from the media, bothering her to display you to the world. The giant anthros that ruled the world had for the most part never seen a human and reporters nagged your mother for a long time before she forcibly made them leave you alone. She didn\u2019t like how her son was seen as an exhibit of a long lost species. As soon as the kiss is over, your mother puts you in the center of the table and then starts to wipe you off with a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChase then lets out a giggle and scratches you in the head as you grunt. \u201cChase,\u201d says Beth. \u201cBe careful. Sam\u2019s suffering mild memory loss.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said Alex as she pours herself a cup of coffee. \u201cThe squirt is a human. Anthro colds can be very dangerous to creatures the size of germs themselves.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, Alex,\u201d said Chase. \u201cHe caught it from you. Remember when you asked him to go into your mouth to get that slice of lettuce out of your teeth?\u201d \u201cWhat about you, Chase?\u201d asked Beth. \u201cYou kept him in your mouth to smuggle him into the movie theater without people going crazy about a human in the theater.\u201d That\u2019s when you remember that Chase did hide you in her mouth the other day. There was a movie you both wanted to see but there was a kook in the theater who wanted to study a human more closely, so Chase kept you in her mouth for most of the movie. You regretted that because being an omnivore unlike the rest of your family, she had bug breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, girls,\u201d said your mother. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that Sam made a recovery. By the way, Sam. Elisa will be joining us for breakfast. She was very worried about you.\u201d Elisa?! That was the name of your girlfriend. You heard stomping and you look up and see Elisa looking down on you. She was an 800 mile high and very obese and bottom-heavy ox giantess with bright yellow fur, long dark-colored hair, huge cuved horns, a rear that rivaled Beth\u2019s own planet-sized booty and an udder that was bigger than her head. The bovine giantess snatches you up as you grunt and she rubs you into the side of your face. \u201cThank goodness you\u2019re alright, Sammy,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cI missed seeing your cute little face.\u201d Then, your girlfriend licks you a few times. \u201cElisa!\u201d you yell. \u201cElisa! Stop! I just got rhino drool cleaned off of me!\u201d \u201cAw, come on, Sam,\u201d said Elisa. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that you\u2019re so cute. I could just eat YOU for breakfast.\u201d Your girlfriend playfully nashes her teeth in front of your face and you see they\u2019re as big as mountains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elisa,\" says Beth. \"Stop. You're scaring him.\" \"Come on, Beth,\" said Elisa. \"He's been in my mouth before.\" \"He may be your boyfriend,\" said Alex as she adjusted her glasses. \"But he's our brother. Leave him alone.\" \"Now, now,\" says your mother. \"Calm down. It's breakfast time.\" Elisa puts you down and takes her seat at the table with your sisters and your mother and your mother hands you a plate of human-sized pancakes as Alex and Beth help her set the table.\" As you're eating your breakfast, you look around to see your sisters, mother and girlfriend tearing into their food rather voraciously. No wonder they were so big. While 5 out of 6 of them were herbivores, their appetites slightly frightened you because it looked as though they could easily swallow you and feel like it was nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then realize something. \"What day is it?\" you ask. Your mother pauses from her meal to answer your question.</span></div></div>",

Even stranger, the ground was sapphire blue, and looked to be made of plates that were each twice the size of a football field. Suddenly, you felt the ground heave up and down! Then you heard a voice that resounded all around you: \"Morning, my little cutie.\" A moment later, you recognized the voice: though it was amplified countless times, it was clearly the voice of your girlfriend, Jenna! But where was she, and why did she sound so big? For that matter, where were you? \"Jenna, where are you?\" you yelled at the top of your voice. \"I'm right underneath you, you silly goose.

You're a g-g-g-giant d-dragon g-girl!\" you stammered. \"Silly, I've always been like this!\" she replied.

Nothing but orange stretches as far as the eye can see, and the sky is black, pure black, no stars, no moon, nothing.  You feel very lonely and afraid.  You don't know how you can see without a single light source, unless the orange ground is the light source.  You wonder if you died and went somewhere weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, your not dead,\" spoke a voice from nowhere.  You jump, but the voice seems friendly enough.  You ask, \"Who are you and why do you know what I'm thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a friendly chuckle.  \"You know who I am.  You've known me all your life, silly human.  And I know what you are thinking because you just thought it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly startled, you fall down on your knees, expecting to see the face of God, but the voice said, \"Please, there's no need for that, I'm not a god.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and ask, \"Well, who are you, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Completely in the blank, eh, human?  Here, why don't you take a gander at me and guess?  Your feet suddenly leave the orange ground and nothing seems to change at first.  The ground continues to be orange, orange, orange.  Then, after a minute, you see deep canyons in the orange.  Then, as the you rise above those canyons, even deeper canyons appear on the edges of the orange.  The orange surface starts to take on a lattice shape and starts to curve gently.  You notice slight variations in the orange colors, some are more reddish while others are more yellowish.  As you continue to rise, the orange varieties merge together to form a smoother flow of orange, and you are starting to get very sick of the color orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, more canyons appear.  You have no idea who this could be, because nobody looks like this.  All that you know is that you must be an enormous distance from where you started; an impossibly large distance not meant to be traveled by a human in a lifetime, even a million lifetimes.  As you rise continually faster, you feel like you must be traveling faster than the speed of light; a physical impossibility.  And still the orange land seems to stretch forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give it another minute or two, human, and try not to be too impressed.\"  After one minute, you look down and finally recognize what is beneath you, the palm of an impossible large hand.  Zooming out even more, you see the hand's long supple fingers ending in huge sharp black claws.  You do not believe it, but you were standing in the palm of a dragon; a dragon that could surely make galaxies look like specks in comparison.  \"You're a really big dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost right, human, but not quite.\"  You look up at the dragon's impossible large face, a face that should not exist, a face with a smile that could cheer up a million galaxies full of nothing but gloom.  \"Give up, human.  Okay, then let me introduce myself.  I am the universe.\"</span></div></div>",

You just realized that you are trying to understand the universe, but, of course, this impossible for anyone to do.  Even the universe itself just admitted that it doesn't know everything.  It's odd, that the orange dragon you are accepting as the universe, the embodiment of everything, is at the same time so ordinary, treating you like you are worth listening to, even though you are absolutely nothing in comparison<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, um, the universe, why did you bring me here, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon looks at you with its huge eyes, sparking like a billion supernovas, and said:</span></div></div>",

Time doesn't really mean anything out here, so you won't really be gone from your life from anyone else's point of view.  You should have realized that when you thought you were going faster than the speed of light earlier, because speed doesn't have any meaning here either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brain is throbbing from all of this information.

I mean, there's six and a half billion others like me, and probably many other intelligent life forms all over you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange dragon turned slightly red.  \"Well, you seemed kind of nice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the huge, huge dragon, and for the first time you do not see an all powerful being or the congregation of all matter.

I guess I should be a bit more thankful that you provided me with a place to live in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thats nice of you, human,\" replies the universe, returning a million parsec smile.

Its certainly not your alarm clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to look about... only to find that you are definitely not in your regular room anymore. Certainly the ground beneath you feels like an extremely soft version of the bed you're used to, yet as you look about it stretches for what seems to be miles in two directions, ahead and behind. On either side of you however, you look up with trepidation at two huge mountains of equal length, oddly which look to have forrests growing all over them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you think of it, they look quite like....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou momentarily panic, and try to judge your surroundings. Squinting you can make out in the sky what looks to be a brown ceiling, and as you run down the odd surface alongside the two 'mountain ranges', you see what can only be said to be the biggest cave enterance you've ever seen, that is if caves were made of quilt and fine silks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo use denying it any longer, particularly considering your recent dream. This 'cave' must actually be the edge of a vast bed cover on an equally massive bed in an enormous bed room. And if thats the case, these two 'mountains'...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to get an impression of who or what they are, but the pair of anthos are very big so its pretty tricky. The only thing you can tell down here is that one of them has white fur and the other brown. After a little more inspection you gather that the brown fured one on your left is lying on her back (or his,though if you are a king like in your dream you would certainly hope its a her) while the white one on your right is lying on her (or his side), their back exposed to you. Judging by your dream you would expect either of these two would be friendly if you were to try and contact them. One the other hand, you could be a bit more adventurous and scope the place out - besides, if this is your room you might as well take a look about your likely riches.</span></div></div>",

Everyone seemed to move with purpose here while you had none, it was a strange thought but one you quickly got over as you emerged into a continental chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts sheer size left you speechless, the towering spires were a work of art built straight into the walls. The roof flooded in a filtered blue light through the stained glass. Chairs were lined around a table which seemed to stretch off into the horizon.

You glance up at your massive mother's face, wondering which of you he was addressing.

Your hands fly to your mouth as to try to come to terms with having country-sized parents and a younger brother who could grab entire cities on a whim. Your mother carries you closer to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, you know it's rude not to answer.\" She tells you. The sheer physical authority she holds is bad enough without any condescending lectures. It's impossible for your whole family to be a mixed-species group who are all over forty miles tall, especially if they interact with you as easily as if you were all normal-size. It seems they can vary their volume depending on how close you are, they can see you from a distance that's sensible for them but insane for your scale and they don't appear to be deafened if you talk really close to their ears. \"Darling,\" Your mother now sounds less insistent and more concerned, \"Are you feeling all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you respond?</span></div></div>",

Amazingly you don't see your mother lift her paw away and depart to get the breakfast. Before long you feel slight tremors and watch your mother sail through your skyline, setting state-size plates at places for your father, brother and herself before taking a few crumbs off her plate and setting them on platters at your table. Her immense digits easily dwarfing the entire set. It soon becomes clear that you are supposed to take even smaller helpings from these and set them on your own little plate.</span></div></div>",

Swiftly you switch your gaze to your brother, and that's no picnic either. Although he isn't having bacon and eggs you can see slices of toast as big as New York being hungrily demolished in seconds.

Having to look up again at your mother you shudder as you think about what school would be like if everyone else is on her scale while you could stand on the tip of the shortest pupil's finger. She spotted the signs of your unease around this point. \"Don't worry, dear. No one's gonna put you under duress. After all, you've managed so well for the past fifteen years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mum.\" You answer. \"I still can't get over how enormous you all are.

You saw a whole multitude of behemoths looming over you but not one of them seemed affected in the slightest over the size difference, indeed they seemed to be behaving as though nothing was out of the ordinary. You now discover that you're not in your bed; you find yourself resting in some kind of forest of white bamboo or something like that. Up above the sky is dark but not cloudy, nor is it night. It looks to you as though the sky is a real blanket. Beneath you the forest floor is coloured a strange gentle pink and actually seems to be radiating heat, negating any need for you to sleep in a bed while wearing your nightie. You get to your feet and begin to explore when an earthquake knocks you back down as you hear a familiar giggle emanate from beyond this forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you say you were awake?\" You hear your younger sister's voice as a strange mass begins to advance through the thicket; you instinctively step backwards as you see just how huge it is and the fact it's coming straight for you! \"Aw, come on sis.\" Your sister remarks, every syllable accompanying a tremor under your feet. \"Mommy's not gonna be too happy if we dawdle.\" You stare agog now as everything fits together. Your dream, the forest you awoke in, the earth tremors, your sister's voice, that monster coming after you. Somehow you've awoken in a world where your sister is a massive beast and you're standing on her torso. You've been sleeping on your younger sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feelings of incest conflate with the thought that your sister's about to slam her city-sized fingertip into you. How can she determine where you are? How can she consider you a person at this scale? Before you can dwell on these things that monster of a digit sweeps right into you, causing you to yelp slightly as you're scooped right off her chest and effortlessly lifted up to her eye level. The young lady's massive pink eye could easily beat New York City in a Largest Area Competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" She says nonchalantly at a shockingly low volume for her size, \"You wanna get ready with me or do you want to be on your own today?\"</span></div></div>",

If you get ready by yourself it'll give you time to let it all sink in but then you might miss on certain elements of how life round here functions. Looking up into her island-dwarfing eye you try to gauge which your sister prefers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm,\" You respond at last, \"Could I have some time to myself?\" You ask, fearing your voice is much too feeble for her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" She answers, rising from the bed. It was a shocking sight to behold ordinary furniture on a scale that would make it visible from over two hundred thousand miles away. Your sister strolls over to a dressing table and lowers you to the base of the mirror. With great skill she manages to slip you off her finger, which must be at least a mile thick. Standing on the vast wooden surface you look up as the giantess withdraws her hand; you know see she's an anthropomorphic skunk, clad in a pair of ocean-blue night shorts. She speaks like your sister, her voice is the same as your sister, she seems to be a pre-adolescent like your sister and those shorts are definitely your sister's; and yet she's so humongous that she could've single-handedly brought about the apocalypse to humanity had this been the world you knew. There was no way humanity could fight against a girl like this. \"I'll be back in a few.\" She stated before turning and strolling out of the room. It was a sight to behold, seeing her just walk away like there was nothing important about you being the size of a microbe to her; her footfalls reverberated right up to you but you didn't fall over and, oddly enough, it was quite a nice thrill for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the gigantic table mirror you saw a door just right for you in the base. Stepping in you found a bathroom perfectly suited to your size and a set of clothes hanging on the wall. You wonder just how you could've got dressed if you went with your younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you prepared yourself you had to wonder just what kind of world this was. Were there any more people like you who'd have to hitch rides on fingers? Was that why there seemed to be no fuss over your size? What kind of society could function if there was such a drastic difference in size? If you were the only speck why were you still alive?</span></div></div>",

The bathroom was most capacious, of a standard equal to only the best 5-star hotels, and yet it resided in the base your younger sister's mirror on her dressing table. Looking around the various items on the table you could see a hairbrush with bristles rising like the Himalayas, a jewelery box that could accommodate Rhode Island and then some and a cuddly toy sat beside the mirror looming so high that it could crush all of Tokyo under one leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room was a rolling landscape that made the Grand Canyon look like a garden ornament. Without your giant sister in it there was a real sense of emptiness in having country-size furniture around. You can hear distant sounds of flowing water like Niagara Falls, which promptly stopped and, not long afterwards, a gargling sound issued forth like great mud pools dragging foolish animals to their deaths. You realise that this was your sister cleaning her teeth; you kneel on a thread of lace cloth as you think how many extinction events could be perpetrated by this one girl being careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while the Richter 5 footfalls of your sister return and you look up again. Somehow you feel relieved as she slowly but casually approaches; she makes the room complete. However you do wonder why she didn't take as long as you since girls that age didn't preen themselves as much as your age group and you had to take your time to let everything sink in. She giggles with the force of a super-cell, but you find it reassuring rather than deafening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute like that.\" She remarks as she once again proffers a finger of alpine proportions. You grab hold of a strand of fur and let yourself be effortlessly lifted off her dressing table. You then hear another familiar voice call out from a distance you can't even begin to fathom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, breakfast's ready!\" That was your mother's voice. The fact that she could call out at such a distance strongly suggested she was as big as your sister, bigger even. Without even checking on you your sister turns about and strolls to the door, her footfalls not registering except by sound as she bobs her arm in time with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COMING, MOM!\" She calls out. Oddly enough it wasn't a shout that could rip fault lines, though that would've killed you with such sheer volume, but seemed more like a cross between how you'd expect your sister to shout and a volcanic eruption.</span></div></div>",

Your twelve-year old sister was the size of India but your mother, another magnificent skunk lady, was almost as big as Australia! You try to take her in before the two titanesses could close the distance. She was wearing a puce ankle-length dress with lavender highlights and gold hoop earrings. By your reckoning she could balance any city in the world as you knew it on the tip of her finger and could walk faster than the Earth could spin even when she wasn't in a hurry. Her smile was comforting in spite of the knowledge that it covered a distance comparable to ocean trenches; people could probably go for hikes on her eyelashes. By anyone's standards both your mother and your younger sister were god-like figures beyond all reach and resistance, but they were still your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Emily.\" The continent-size matriarch greeted your sister. \"Morning, Alice.\" She addressed you as you knelt on Emily's fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M...m...morning mom.\" You stammer, receiving a rather concerned look from the mustelid colossus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why.\" She exclaims. \"What's the matter, honey?\" She strolls over with planet-shattering steps and crouches down so her eye fills your view.

After a minute or so you feel something like an obsidian cliff on your back, before you know you are sliding across a black curved surface and land softly on your mother's fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alice,\" She whispers with astonishing gentility, \"You mean you really don't remember?\" You look up into her pupil; she's holding you so close to her eye that the only thing you can see beyond her fingertip, including the claw she scooped you up with, is her pupil and her emerald-green iris. You shiver with uncertainty and fear at the power she represents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know who you two are,\" You get out in a meek tone, \"Because I recognise your voices, I know this is our house because the furniture and layout are almost the same. But everything else is alien. Either you're impossible or I'm impossible!\" You bring your knees up to your face and start sobbing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear little Alice.\" Your mother whispers. \"Please don't be frightened. No one's gonna harm you. You've always been small enough to carry around on my finger and nobody's ever caused you any grief because of it. Indeed, you've been an inspiration in developing things suited to you; the real marvel is that you're a human.\" You look up into the shiny black void in wonder. \"Okay, so your small size was amazing enough, but the fact that you're something no one's ever seen except in art.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H...Humans are fiction?\" You check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We all thought that before you were born. It was certainly something when my pregnancy didn't show through and it was another wonder when you were born; I wouldn't have known if everyone's senses didn't improve during that time.\" There was some amusement in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that I don't remember anything other than the house and your voices.\" You point out. \"It's just that I remember everything being on the same scale as me and people were humans.\" The massive skunkettes gasp with the force of a geyser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I whole world as small as you?\" Emily does a double-take. \"Wow! Think what it would be like, mom. We'd be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy now.\" Your mother moves you away from her eye, allowing you to see more of her, the room and Emily. She places her free paw on the child's shoulder. \"Don't get carried away. If such a world does exist somewhere any one of us would be more than enough to cause chaos and destruction on a level I'm thankful to be unable to conceive.\" Emily looks away in shame; you can now see that she's changed into a blue T-shirt and pink shorts, neither of the anthros are wearing anything on their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to wrap my head round that.\" You declare, peeking round your mother's claw. \"As soon as she held me up to her eye I thought 'It's bigger than New York'.\" The two giants now look back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alicey,\" Emily asks hesitantly, \"You're not scared of me, are you?\" The poor girl looked so sad at the idea of terrifying her own sister. You look up at your mother, wondering whether you should be honest or tactful. It would only take a certain kind of look from her and you'd know; all the easier since her face is bigger than Texas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother would like you to answer Emily...</span></div></div>",

As you progress your mother starts lowering a syringe of sorts onto her plate and then moving it over the dinette set before depositing microscopic (to her) crumbs of her own breakfast for you to dig in to. Emily sits down adjacent to her, the both of them looming over your tiny place on the table. As you sit down the syringe descends to your place again, you cringe as it squirts a drop of tea into a tiny mug just right for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom,\" You ask, \"You mean to say that I've been this small all my life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, honey.\" She replies. \"And I'd be quite happy to help you regain understanding of what it's like living amongst us *teehee* giants.\" Her tone was mildly cheeky, causing you to blush as you consider this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,\" Emily asks, \"Suppose Alice really is from a different world? Suppose the Alice we've known is now living her life?\" These words strike home for you. You think about an alternative version of yourself waking up somewhere that gives her more independence but also a lot more responsibility. You just have to cope with everyone being humongous, she'd have to cope with a multitude of chores and suchlike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about how more awkward it would be if you had to deal with dad at this time; you strain to imagine an anthropomorphic male skunk sitting across from your mother on an even bigger scale.

And I'm sorry I can't stay for breakfast. But I promised my boss I'd go into work early today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand honey. But aren't you at least going to stay goodbye to our daughters too?\" You mother asked, which caused you to stop eating and turn your attention towards the front of the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd once you had done this you felt your eyes widen in shock once your FAther had entered room. Or at least this world's version of him anyway. Because what entered the room was a heavily muscled male skunk who was wearing a nice light blue dress shirt with a black tie, along with black pants and black dress shoes. And when you saw him walk past you, you felt a slight rush of air zoom past you as he kissed your mother on the lips for a few seconds before he moved to Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so he then saw your father give her a kiss on the cheek while he tol dher, \"Have good day at school, Emily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Dad.\" Your little sister replied, with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this had happened though you were soon engulfed by your Father's shadow. And once you had looked past his six pack clothed abs and large chest you saw a gleam in his eyes as he slowly and then gently used the tip of his finger to rub the top of your head while he said, \"Have a good day at school, Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll try, Dad.\" You stuttered out, as he then moved his finger away from you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl.\" The giant muscled skunk replied, with a proud smile on his face. And upon doing so he then began to walk out of the dining room, and most likely head off to work. But before he did saw him stop in his tracks which gave you a view of his wide and muscled back along with butt to which ou blushed and quickly away out of embarrassment. However, this didn't last long as your attention was brought back to his large green eyes when he back from over his shoulder and continued, \"Oh, that's right I almost forgot to tell you, Alice.....</span></div></div>",

Although I guess I can't blame you since you've always been protective of Alice. But remember that Sam is a very nice and respectable young man who would force our daughter to do anything that she'd be uncomfortable with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I know darling. But no matter how old she gets. Alice will always be my little girl.\" Your Father softly told your mother, before his eyes widen. You then saw him give your mother a quick kiss on the lips before he ran off and added, \"Oh crud, I best get going or else I'll be alte. I'll see all of you later for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo this your mother just let out a light giggle and waved goodbye as the last thing you saw was his large and fluffy tail as she said, \"Have a good day, dear.\" And once you heard the front door open and close you saw her face you and your sister when she continued, \"And now you both had best get ready school since the bus will be here soon to pick you up Emily. And I'm most certain Samuel will be here soon to pick you up, Alice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom.\" Both you and your little sister say at the same time, to which Emily gently picked you up and took you upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while you both got ready you couldn't help but think of your world's version of Sam, who remember was a part of the football team in your high school. Not only that, but he was a part of the drama club when he wasn't playing football. That was how the two of you met when you were both picked for the leads of one of the plays. After that it was history so to speak as the two of you became boyfriend and girlfriend. However, since he was quite popular with the girls you did have to deal with them being quite jealous. But you made sure not to let it get to you too badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while your sister carried you downstairs once you were done geting ready remembered how protective your Dad was of you.. And how this version of him always had you sleep in between his pecs whenever you ahd a bad dream. You even somewhat remember him staying home once when you got sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these thoughts were quickly pushed to the side when you were handed over to your Mother once Emily's bus had arrived and she had left for school. Within a few seconds though you saw a car pull up into your driveway. And to your surprise you saw a well muscled male anthro walk out from the driver's seat.

WAs it because of just how huge his muscles looked now? No, since they were pretty impressive back in your world. Maybe it was due to the fact thsat with his pure white fur it just seemed to make his deep blue eyes really stand out. Although you did notice how tight his short, pants and high school jacket was on him as he walked up to your mother and looked down at you while you were still in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd upon doing this you saw his expression become very soft as he greeted you with, \"Good morning, Alice.\" You then saw him look up at your mother, wh youo noticed was a few feet shorter then he was, although that really shouldn't surprised you since your world's version of him was pretty tall too. But once he had looked at your mother you saw him get a bit nerous while he continued with, \"Um, hello, ma'am. Good morning to you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had said this though you were then placed into Sam's right hand as your mother reassured him, \"Sam dear, there's no need ot be so nervous. You know that I have no problems with you and Alice being together. And I assure you that my husband is okay with it as well. His just a tad protective of Alice is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes of course. But we better get going though.\" Sam replied, before the two of you waved goodbye to your mother and he got into his car with you still in his hand. You then saw him slowly sit down into the car seat before you were placed onto his right shoulder. You then saw him turn his key thus turning on the car before he started to drive out of your neighborhood. Upon doing this though you saw a blush form on his face as he looked down at you and added, \"Hey babe, I missed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Sammy. I missed you too.\" You replied, while you moved over to his necka nd hugged it as best you could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once you had done this you felt that body part of him move a bit when he confessed, \"But you know even though you told me not to be nervous, I'm afraid I can't it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, really? My Dad doesn't scare you that much does, he?\" You asked, tkaen aback by the giant arctic wolf's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not that. But I do know how much your Dad cares about you. So I just don't want to do something that'll make him think poorly of me and think I'm not treating you right.\" Sam told you, as he continued to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Sam, I know you've never do anything to hurt me. I trust and love you so much.\" You reassured the wolf, before you saw one of his hands move away from the steering wheel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had done this you then felt one of his huge fingers gently rub itself up against you while he replied, \"I know you do, Alice. And I love you too. Nor would I ever do anything to hurt you or put in harms way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had said this the rest of the drive was silent. The two of you then got to eh high school and spent the entire day together since you both had the same schedule. In fact your locker was just a small part of Sam's locker which was nice since he was always there to make you had everything before going off to class, or lunch, and then more classes followed by a study hall here and there until the school day was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once it was over however, you both soon realized that your Dad.....</span></div></div>",

It was a most tragic event; you had to comfort your sister and try to explain what it meant while your mother needed to tackle the extra responsibility of raising two kids and be the breadwinner. You now wonder how that would've worked in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mum.\" You state once you're through with your breakfast, her enormous eyes focus upon you. \"Can I have a talk with you, alone?\" The mighty mustelid seemed a bit taken aback under the circumstances, but her motorway-length lips curl up into a serene smile and she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Alice.\" You still can't get to grips over how you can interact with someone so massive. \"We can talk while I do the washing up.\" You wait, watching the astonishing sight of your mother and younger sister eating their breakfast, every mouthful enough to sustain a million people for a week. You shudder at the thought that you could get lost in those portions. Eventually they're finished and your mother reaches towards you, briefly casting you and your entire dinette set into shadow before a single finger rests on the giant tabletop about twenty yards away. You approach as swiftly as you can while admiring the sheer scale of her. You pull yourself up onto the tip, thankful that her fur is so effective as a climbing frame. Once you're settled down she effortlessly whisks you up towards her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know what's going on you find yourself tumbling onto a great soft trampoline, which you discover is mum's dress. You're sitting on her shoulder! It really strikes home how tiny you are in this world; to your left her neck rises up like a mountain range towards her head where she beams down at you like an Olympian goddess, to your right the expanse of soft fabric stretches off and stops as it reaches the sheer drop of her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emily, dear.\" Your mum addresses her. \"Why don't you get yourself together while I do the washing up?\" The two giants rise from their seats, prompting you to grip onto the fabric of your mum's dress as you can't be sure how she expects you to stay on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mom.\" The colossal child cries, thundering away back to her room. You look up at your mother's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna fall into the sink, am I?\" You ask apprehensively, causing her to giggle with the force of tectonic plates moving against each other. It shakes you up but your position doesn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" She answers. \"You did go diving in a few times when you were younger, but I've found how to keep my shoulders straight while doing the dishes.\" She reaches forth and gathers up the dirties that are on her scale and carries them into the kitchen. You gasp at the sight. The sink is so large you'd guess that all the water in the Great Lakes could barely fill it, the oven could recreate the Sahara to scale, the fridge was worthy of a new Ice Age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, should I have picked up my dishes?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Mother replies. \"They may be smaller than you but there's still a way of dealing with them.\" You look at her neck in bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since they're so tiny they are easy to mass produce and are disposable.\" She smiles down at you, but it now looks like she's got a joke to tell. \"I swallow them.\" You gasp at the thought that anything you leave behind vanishes down your mother's throat, which could easily take the entire US Navy in one gulp. The continental skunk-lady puts the <i>normal</i> size dishes on the side and reaches over to turn the taps on. You watch and listen as a mighty rushing sound of tepid water comes forth that would place the combined power of all the waterfalls in the world to shame. \"So, what's on your mind now?\" Mum asks as she adds some washing-up liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just wondering how we managed when dad...\" You reply. Mother's muzzle now sinks into a look of sorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did manage quite well, comforting little Emily.\" She answers. \"You even cheered her up, scurrying all over her head.\" There was a hint of a smile. \"In fact we didn't have too much to worry about after the grieving passed. We've got so much financial support from various sources, thanks to you my little speck of a girl,\" An enormous claw looms over you and drenches you with a single water-drop before you find yourself being petted with a finger that could obliterate an entire civilisation, \"I didn't need to go out to work as much as I would've done.\" You are fairly satisfied with this for now and sit watching her wash-up. The suds look like ice caps from your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow are you going to adapt to an entire world populated with anthros that could individually bring about the apocalypse due to their sheer size? If it's a school-day you may end up going in at the deep end, but if not you can ease your way in with some help from your family.</span></div></div>",

The projections you were under before were enormous breasts and your cave was actual the navel of a giant bulging belly and the grass was actually fur. Then you turned to see blue colored hair and then you realize, you're on top of a big beautiful raccoon girl the size of an entire continent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou worry of how she would react to a tiny human, but then she speaks in an unusually soft voice. \"Hi little man.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You let out a heavy sigh of relief once you had reached the top of the giant beanstalk that had grown the previous night. You were just glad that you lived alone or else you certain your parents would not be too happy to see something like that in their yard. But when you had reached the top of the plant your eyes widen shock as you jumped off of it and saw taht you were standing on solid ground. In fact it seemed to be made out of every day dirt. And upon lifting your head you saw that you could see a giant village in the distance along with a castle in the back of it. Sadly you weren't able to stare at your surrounds for that long as a very large shadow engulfed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you knew it a large hand enclosed around you. You then foundyourself being lifted upward rather quickly. ONce the montion had stopped the hand that held you opened and you saw that had been grabbed by a giant anthro tiger. And by the looks of it he looked to either a thief or a bandit or something. You quickly felt a cold chill run down your body when you a wide smirk spread across the tiger's face as he said, \"Well, this is a surprise. Here I was going to steal from the local village and palace. But instead I come across a tiny creature.\" He then got a better look at you and added, \"I'll bet you'll get me a pretty good amount of gold in the marketplace. Or maybe I'll just end your life right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please don't hurt me! I don't even know where I am! Won't you let me go?\" You begged, while you got onto both of your knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud laugh left the tiger's lips when he replied back with, \"Sorry, but I'm not letting a hcance like this spill away form me.\":<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this caused you to let out a loud scream before you closed your eyes and expected your life to end right then and there. Instead however, You heard another giant's voice as it ordered, \"Bandit, I'm not sure what you're doing. But I know that you are the one who has been stealing from the village. So come quietly and let go of whatever it is that is in your hand. If you do this then your sentence may be shortened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tch, I don't think so. And if you want what's in my hand so badly why don't you just catch it!\" The tiger shouted, before his hand enclosed around you again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully before the bandit could throw you, you felt someone tackle him to the ground. You then heard the tiger get hit by something. And before you knew it you saw the hand of tiger open. And to your surprise you saw a giant in red armor staring down at you. You proceeded to climb out of the bandit's hand and look up at the giant knight. You lowered your head and said, \"T-Thank you for saving me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the knight said nothing. After a few seconds had passed though you saw the giant remove his helmet and were shocked to see a giant anthro bear looking down at you. To your relief though he had a smile of warmth and relief as he responded back with, \"There is no need for thanks. I am just glad that you were not harmed.\" He then lowered his head to get a better look at you and continued with, \"Although I must admit I never knew that there were such small creatures like yourself. But where I are my mannered, my name is Fredrick, and I am one of the three knight captains of this fair kingdom.\" He then lowered a armored hand down to you and ended with, \"But I don't think we should be speaking like this out in public. So please won't you come back to the castle with me?\"</span></div></div>",

But what will you do? Will  you take me to meet your ruler of this kingdom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear waited until you were safely in the center oif his palm before he slowly began to stand up to his full height. Upon doing this he replied back with, \"I was thinking about doing that. But I don't think that would be a wise decision. If word got out that a tiny creature like yourself found thier way here. Then some people may try to take over your lands...whereever they may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes that's understandable. But um for the record I\"m not a small creture I'm a human, and my name is Alex.\" You said, as you were brought up to one of the bear's large brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce this had been he stared at you as he let out a light hearted chuckle and said, \"A human you say? I'm afraid that I have never heard of that before. But I will say that from the looks of it. You appear to be no different then us. Well expect for the lack of fur and the fact that you're so small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to say something in response to what the knight had said. But before you could you heard a voice and saw two other anthros running towards you and Sir Fredrick while they shouted, \"Sir Fredrick, are you alright?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems that two of my comrades have caught yp to me.\" The bear stated, before you found yourself being lowered towards the bear's right armored thigh. You then saw him puch open a small leather pouch while he added, \"So if you don't mind little one. Please hide in here until I have arrived at my house. Once I have I will you out and we will talk some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew that you did not have a choice in the matter and so you jumped into the leather pouch.Upon doint this you saw the outside light go dark as the front of the pouch was shut. You then heard the bear's deep voice when he ordered, \"About time you two showed up! Now please take this bandit to His Majesty so he can receive his punishment for his crimes. I will return to the castle after I have used the herbs I have collected to make some medicine at my home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" The two other soldiers shouted, before you felt the pouch you were in begin to sway a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did not last long though as you heard the flap to the pouch open and you saw a two red armored fingers enter the darkness. You then felt the fingers as they were gently presed against you as the bear said to you, \"Don't worry little Alex. We will be arriving to home shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd to the giant anthro's word you heard a door being opened and then closed. You then felt the two fingers that were against you gently lift you up out of the pouch. And after your eyes had adjusted you saw the bear had a very modesty home with one large room with a large table, a few chairs, and a couch. You then looked to the back right of the room and saw a small hallway which you guess led to the bear's bedroom. While you were looking around you did not realize that Fredrick had walked up the large table and had lowered his hand to it for you to get onto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing this you commented with, \"You have a nice home, Sir Fredrick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Alex. But you do not need to be formal with me. You are a guest in my home after all.\" The bear replied, before you turned and saw him begin to remove his armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since the bear had his back to you saw him remove the arm section of the red colored armor. And not to your surprise the bear had large muscles all along his arms. Next came the midsection of the armor and again not to your surprise you saw a very wide and muscled back. He then removed the chainmail that covered his back and front of his body. ANd when he turened to face you, your eyes widen in shock as you saw the giant bear had no amount of fat on him whatsoever. Instead you saw two massive and firm pectoral muscles. Below that you saw a very firm eight pack on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then found youself blushing a little as you let out, \"Um please forgive me for staring like that Fredrick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's alright. I always do this so taht I may check for damage to both my armor and body. I should have been a better host and changed in my room and not in front of you.\" The brown eyed giant replied, before he bent down and grabbed the pieces of armor and chainmail. Once all of the pieces where in his arms he added, \"So allow me to continue to finish checking my armor in my room while I change. Once I do this then you can watch me make some medicine. Besides if I were to return to the castle empty then I'm sure my men and others would get suspicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the giant anthro bear left though you....</span></div></div>",

Your skin, too, felt like you were constantly being pricked by thousands of tiny needles. Groaning loudly, you struggle to open one eye, and you manage to squint it open slightly before closing it in pain. Recollecting what little data you collected, you were in a blank, grey metal bed with a blue blanket. Focusing on the sound around you amidst the uncomfortable feelings confirmed your fears; you were in a hospital bed. As of the pain didn't make it obvious enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, will he be okay? What's...wrong with him?\" came a distant, booming voice. The pain was screwing with your head. You could almost recognize the voice. Almost. But the pain was too much of a distraction. You just had a feeling that whoever it was cared for you very much. \"It's hard to say.\" said another, equally loud voice. As the pain seemed to finally wind down, atleast, your migraine was dying down, the voice still seemed to have that strange loud, distant feeling that you just couldn't shake. \"He seems to have contracted a very...peculiar disease, of which we're still studying the sample of. Along with doing...*this* to him, it seems like he's the only person alive who's even capable of contracting it. Which is VERY unusual, as you can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you were the only person in the world to contract some disease? Was it the cause of this pain? That couldn't he right...the pain was really quieting down now. Your muscles began to relax as your body felt relief unlike anything you've ever felt as the pain seemingly vanished over the course of the last few minutes. It was an invigorating feeling, actually! Stretching your arms painlessly above your head, you opened your eyes with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile faded away into awe as you gazed at the sight before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman and a man, with animal attributes, no less, towered above you at many thousands of miles tall, you estimated. And from where your bed was perched, you were only about chest level! \"He should be waking up now.\" said the Doctor, which filled the girl's expression with glee. You couldn't help but scream as her giant eye lowered itself to your puny form, taking every microscopic inch of you in. \"Hi, babe!\"</span></div></div>",

Needless to say, all were female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, instead of your warm bed, all you could feel was an equally warm coat of fur coming into contact with your entire body. While strange, it was very inviting, and made you want to just go back to sleep again. It was probably Lily. She must have decided to sleep on the bed with you. You stretch out and open your eyes, only to be met with an entire forest of white fur, stretching in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to panic slightly, and yell out \"Hello?

Unfortunately, your eyelids are too heavy to move, so for now you've got to really on your senses that aren't sight to tell you where you are - you can't feel your duvet, so you may well have fallen off your bed during your sleep. Hopefully that wasn't the case, that always made your back hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly dragging your hand across the floor, you are startled to feel not carpet, but... metal? You can't really smell anything that might help pinpoint your location, as you were pretty certain that you weren't inside your house by now. Listening intently, you can just make out hushed whispers coming from all directions, sounding vaguely reverent. This wasn't looking good. Okay, time to open your eyes and find out where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening your eyes and rubbing them so as to allow yourself to see, you are shocked into silence by what you see. An <i>utterly... massive</i>... Grey wall, made of something you couldn't identify by sight alone, stretching off endlessly into every direction, was pressing slightly into whatever it was you were lying on. Managing to stand up without falling over, you walk over to the wall and touch it, feeling the warm and soft material, which felt somewhat similar to rubber, yield slightly when you applied pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused and... well, more confused, you sit down and lean against the warm wall, staring upwards but finding yourself unable to see an end to whatever it was. You begin to hear distant murmurs yet again, but they at much more clear this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my...\"<br>\r\n\"It worked?\"<br>\r\n\"He seems confused...\"<br>\r\n\"Should we greet him?\"<br>\r\n\"Do it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grey wall behind you suddenly shifts, rushing downwards at immeasurable speeds while drawing backwards. Your draw drops open and a breath gets caught in your throat when the grey mass draw back enough for you to discern what it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a shark. Or rather, and anthro shark. <br>\r\nThat was thousands upon thousands of miles tall. <br>\r\nAnd... Wearing robes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark, whom you know as a female due to the orbs straining the cloth of the robe she was wearing, bows to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see more anthros in the distance, each and every one of the planet-sized beings bowing to you for some unknown reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shark anthro, easily sensing your confusion and fear, gives you the most comforting smile she can when from your viewpoint she could chomp a continent in half. As she draws in a breath that pushes her massive breasts out even further, causing her robe to creak dangerously, her tail wishes behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>BEHOLD!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you can even react, you are harmlessly pinched between two shark fingers that could have ended entire civilisations on their own. After several seconds spent between the rubbery digits, you are deposited onto the shark anthro's... Nose? Muzzle? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, the shark's country sized eyes focus on you, a wide grin almost splitting her face in two. The shark - and the other anthros - begin to walk, the thundering vibrations from their footfalls surpassing any earthquake imaginable. Your attention is drawn back to the shark as she begins to talk as quietly as she can. Given the fact that she rivalled Earth in size, if not surpassing it, the quietist voice she could manage was still one that overwhelmed all of your senses and seemed to come from all directions simultaneously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b><font class=\"size5\" style=\"\">Don't worry, my Lord! We're going to bring you before your followers, then we can get you settled, and, heh, explain everything...</font></b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEars ringing, you blink and shake your head in an attempt to dispel the after effects of hearing the massive shark-woman's voice. Blushing, she begins to speak again, but significantly quieter this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Sorry about that, my Lord... My name is Mira. I'm your head priestess, and it's an... honour, to finally lay eyes upon you Lord... Such an honour...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira's eyes glaze over slightly, the anthro seemingly caught up in a moment of religious awe. You weren't sure why these utterly, utterly titanic beings viewed you as their god, or how they even bought you to this place, but you intended to find out after being introduced to your 'followers'. Hopefully you'd just be the god of a small cult or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are quickly proven wrong when the small group of anthros arrive at what appears to be a balcon of some kind, forged out of more marble than could ever be found on Earth. Mira gently takes you onto a fingertip that stretches outwards in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Ready to meet your followers, o Lord?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tiny smirk makes its way onto her face, ever so slightly amused by your stunned reaction to everything you had seen since being summoned by that machine. You still hadn't spoken a single word; your brain was still struggling to process everything that had happened in such a small amount of time. Mira moves her hand, allowing you to gaze down over the edge of the balcony. What you see would have rendered you speechless if you were not already so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn innumerable crowd of anthros, all gazing up at you with rapt attention, their eyes widening and their mouths hanging open. So much for being the god of a tiny cult - it looked like you were the god of a <i>major</i> religion! A thunderous roar rises up from the crowd, each individual having their own reaction. Here, a wolf yelling praises; there, a lioness too stunned to do anything other than stare, her hands grasping a religious icon of some sort; and there, a donkey deep in prayer, her ears twitching every so often. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mira withdraws her finger from the edge of the balcony and re-enters the building. You hadn't been paying much attention to your surroundings before, but now you realise they are almost impossibly lavish, looking like the inside of a palace; impossibly expensive furniture adorns every room Mira carries you through, the deep red carpet complementing the dark brown wood that formed the majority of the furnishings. Eventually, Mira stops. Looking around, you realise you are in a bedroom that put even the other rooms to shame in terms of sheer opulence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost every wooden surface seemed to be inlaid with gold leaf; a titanic four-poster bed dominates the far corner of the room, large paintings adorning every wall. The ceiling is made of marble; the walls and carpet the same deep, luxurious red as in the other rooms. A massive window with what appears to be silk curtains allows soft sunlight to filter in from the far end of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira chuckles 'quietly' at your reaction to the sheer extravagance of the room. \"<b>Welcome to our room, my Lord! Since it's my duty to care for you due to the difference in scale between us, you'll be staying in here with me! But don't worry, Lord; if you'd look to the bedside table...</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding on the flat plane of the table is a tiny speck. On closer inspection, you realise that it is in fact, a massive house. Despite the size of the towering dwelling, it still pales in comparison to the table, which it is barely visible against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>So, my Lord, I guess you'll want some explanations?</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMira sits down on the bed, placing you on her snout again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What happens next?</i></span></div></div>",

Vision swimming, you flail your hand, looking for something to tell you where you are. Before you can react, you feel a deep, searing heat scorching your body for a millisecond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscles aching, you fall forward, a loud clang assaulting your ears as you make contact with the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVision returning, you get to your hands and knees, ears ringing, and look around. A chamber greets your eyes. It is large yet small at the same time, the spacious room packed with rows upon rows of pods of some kind. It's too dark to discern the finer details of where you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing a lump in your throat, you begin to crawl forward on your hands and knees, joints and muscles screaming in protest. Breathing heavily, you collapse to the metal floor. Ripping off your helmet, you begin to gulp in stale, recycled air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, helmet?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the unfamiliar helm that had previously adorned your head, all the while breathing as if you were getting paid for it. It is white, you can see that through the gloom. It is sleek and rounded, similar to a semicircle, except with large plates bolted to the side and top, forming a second shell that fully covers the sides, top and back, ruining the sleek and graceful appearance in exchange for protection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProtection from what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't know. A thin antenna extends from the top of the helmet, emerging from the right of the plated blocks that sever to protect the sides of your head. Perhaps it had a radio inside? The front of the helmet, where you see out of, is made out of what seems to be a thin glass-like substance that seemed to glow slightly, the slight blue light making it impossible to see inside the helmet. You notice that a couple of torches have been integrated into the armour blocks on the sides of the helm. They'd be good in your current situation, if you could get them to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing the helmet, you put it back on, rising unsteadily to your feet. You could look at what you were wearing once you got out of this place, it was obviously abandoned - looking around reveals small amounts of debris and detritus lying on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way through the unknown environment, stumbling sound in the dark, trying to figure out how to activate your flashlights. Recalling the location of the flashlights on your helmet, you begin to think of possible switch locations. Suddenly, the flashlights switch on with an audible click, bathing the area in front of you in light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area was even more abandoned that you thought. The floor and walls were rusted slightly, wires and shards of glass haphazardly strewn across the floor; gurneys and tables upended and flipped here and there with no rhyme nor reason as to their placement. It was if a hurricane had swept through...wherever you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat... Was not encouraging. Okay, so; you're the only person in this place; you have no idea where this place is; your torches appear to be activated via thought; and you have no food or water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a brilliant situation you've found yourself in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to trudge through what you guess is an abandoned medical  facility - crash carts and gurneys are common obstacles. Coming to what looks like a door, you halt. There's no handle, button, keypad, or anything that would indicate how to open it. It's a sheet of corrugated metal, for all intents and purposes. Great. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you think of possible places for switches to be hidden around the door, and, rather unexpectedly, the thing begins to retreat upwards into the doorframe with a torturous squeal, rust falling as it ascends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. It appeared that most things here were thought operated. You could question the why's and the how's later, for now you needed to get out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to walk onwards, the corridors of the abandoned facility contributing to a slowly increasing sense of claustrophobia and paranoia. Door after door withdraws upwards into the doorframe, your mind growing more unsettled as time goes on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere is everyone else? What happened to this place? Why is everything rusted? How long were you in cryo-sleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCryo-sleep? Cryo-sleep. Freezing a person and then thawing them out so as to counteract the ageing process. But... You'd never been in cryo-sleep. That was pure science fiction. Something from movies and novels. You were just a normal person, living a normal life. Surely this was just a lucid dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come to another door, this one much larger than the others. It's a blast door.  On your prompting, powerful motors begin to whine from within the walls, and the blast door begins to ascend-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing a powerful beam of sunlight to illuminate the dilapidated room you were in. Blinking, you look out on what you could see of the landscape. Lush, green meadows, bathing in gentle, warm sunlight, as far as you can see. The occasional field of wheat, growing unrestrained. Off in the distance, mountain ranges tower over all. And against the mountains, you can make out shapes, smudges too small to see, such was the distance between you and them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of the abandoned facility, armoured boot sinking into the ground, crushing grass beneath it. Licking your cracked and dried lips underneath your helmet, you figure you might as well see if you can find someone else who can ball you understand where you are and what has happened. And maybe investigate those smudges of colour against the mountains, while you're at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling your shoulders, you begin to walk away from the rusted ruins, hopefully towards other people. </span></div></div>",

None. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion two: is this real?<br>\r\nPossible answers: no idea. Uh...

At least the landscape was pretty, with rolling green hills, a bright blue sky, and snow capped mountains in the distance. Mountains with smudges. Unsettling smudges.  Mountains shouldn't have smudges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to walk onward, finding yourself grow slightly bored with the admittedly beautiful scenery. Sure, it was breathtaking, but shouldn't you have come across some woods or something by now? Rather than meadows, meadows, and more meadows?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time goes on, the smudges become more clear and outlined, eventually allowing you to identify what they are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start off, they're huge. They look to be around a mile tall or so. Secondly, they're not smudges. Thirdly, they're utterly gigantic... Furries? Huh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever lucid dream your brain had cooked up, it was shaping up to be an extremely wierd one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can clearly identify them now, even from such a distance; it would probably take you a good half an hour to reach them, but they were just that big. There were three of them; a dragoness with blood red scales and comparatively short claws that could still shear pretty much anything in two; a black horse easily identifiable as a mare due to her body shape; and a grey wolfess, identifiable as a female for the same reason as the other two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir voices carry on the metaphorical wind, allowing you to eavesdrop a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything in this one?\"<br>\r\n\"Nope. Nothing of value.\"<br>\r\n\"Damn. Should we move on to the next site?\"<br>\r\n\"Let's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titanic trio turn, in your direction.

What puzzles you about it, however, is the small cloud of crystals floating in midair in front of the cylindral block, tiny bolts of electricity arcing between them. Suddenly, the crystals all move and shift, forming a shape in midair. There is a warm orange glow, and the shape - attached to the block - is revealed to be what seems to be a one handed rifle of some variety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow the hell was a rifle meant to do anything against those... Those <i>things?!</i> They were all at least a mile tall, minimum!

A thin cyan beam shoots out of the barrel of the rifle, becoming invisible to your eyes a few feet away. You'd missed all three of the anthros, as impossible as that sounded, instead seeming to have hit the mountain behind them. Clearly, the rifle would 't be good for much if you couldn't aim in your current state, and if it had no visible effects. Taking a deep breath, you force your finger off the trigger, returning your attention to the gigantic furries slowly moving your way, engaged in their own conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the clear sky seems just a bit clearer, the light blue a bit... Sharper. As if sensing this anomaly, the trio of anthros turn around, gazing up at the sky in confusion. The intensity of the sky's blue seems to increase steadily, before the intense blue seems to... Contract, towards a single point, and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour entire field of view is filled with a terrible flash of blue for a second that seems to last for an eternity, accompanied by a crash of thunder so loud that even the anthros seem to be uncomfortable. A single azure bolt, flung down from on high, strikes the mountain, travelling through miles and miles of rock with infinite ease. The beam vaporises anything it touches, plunging through the mountain and deep into the earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGravity very quickly starts to catch up with the situation, however, as tonne after to be of stone begins to crumble away and fall into the yawning chasm created by your accidental destruction of a land feature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three anthros stand, stunned and slack-jawed, gawping at the scene of destruction. You, however, are not so affected, and are already running as fast as you can. The rifle in your hand dissolves into the crystal cloud once again, surrounding the 'grip' as it somehow floats out of your hand even as you sprint, adding themselves to it and encasing it within themselves. The larger cube speeds along with you, floating down to and attaching to the armour on your hip, where it remains in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sprint through  the meadows, back towards the way you came. You didn't know if the anthros were hostile or not, but you didn't want to find out, especially after accidentally punching a hole through a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened, anyway?!

Your legs simply won't respond to your commands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lexi, I think I see... Tracks? Do you think you can track whatever they belong to? If they're intelligent they may be able to tell us what the hell that was.\"<br>\r\n\"You always seem to refer to the humans' old robots as if they were anthros.\"<br>\r\n\"They might as well be, they're just a bit... Small.\"<br>\r\n\"Ssh! I'm picking up a scent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh hell no! No no no no no! You begin to drag yourself away, for all the good that it does. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I know where they are. Perhaps it's one of the humans' bio-droids? I think they can feel emotion...\"<br>\r\n\"What kind of emotions are you sensing?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... Fear. And confusion. In that order. Then, panic.\"<br>\r\n\"Poor thing must be scared out of their mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground begins to quake in an unsteady rhythm as the wolfess leads the dragon and horse towards you. Panic once again sets in and your heart races, your breaths coming short and ragged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go... Hm. This doesn't look like a bio-droid.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that armour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see a massive shadow swallow your surroundings, growing darker as two huge fingers approach you. As if on instinct, a mental switch is flipped, and you are encased within a shimmering blue field, your armour glowing slightly. The two grey furred fingers gently lift you up, and you are deposited into the palm of a white furred hand, belonging to the wolfess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there little guy... Don't worry, we won't hurt you...\"<br>\r\n\"Do you think you could tell us what you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwallowing, you keep your gaze locked downwards, being deposited in the same position you were in when picked up; that is, laying on your front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human.\"</span></div></div>",

That had changed when you had started to move about on Lexi's palm. For starters, you had four fingers and a thumb on each hand. Bio-droids had two fingers and one thumb. You also had hair, which bio-droids lacked - you had taken off your helmet in order to scratch. In addition, most bio-droids had facial markings or tattoos of sorts, which you lacked. Your movements were also much more fluid than those of a bio-droid, who were apparently somewhat jerky when it came to walking and other activities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still weren't sure exactly what a bio-droid was, although from what you had learned from the three anthros it seemed to be a biological android of some sorts, or something similar to that. You also knew that bio-droids were created by humanity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour situation was an odd one, to say the least. Your memory corrupted and damaged, you exited a stasis pod and made your way to the outside world, coming across the anthros after a short trek. After accidentally reactivating an ancient planetary defense grid and vaporising several miles of mountain, you'd been found by the aforementioned three anthros. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been taking time to learn about what exactly happened to the ready of humanity. Apparently, humanity was long gone, having vanished many dozens of millenia ago, if not further back in the time abyss. Gigantic anthro animals had arisen from different worlds across the galaxy and, using technology reverse engineered from that of your species, had managed to traverse the stars, eventually all joining under the same banner. Humankind was revered as a precursor species, and finding human artifacts and technology was a lucrative business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd been on this ship for a few days now. It belonged to the three anthros, who worked together to find lost human bases and whatever was contained within them. They were taking you back to inhabited space, but the journey would take a while, even at FTL speeds. Adapting to your situation had proven to be difficult, however. The nature of your memory corruption meant that any number of words and phrases could trigger a flood of information and previously forgotten memories. Case in point, Equina had mentioned the method of FTL travel, an Alcubierre drive, and you had spent the next few minutes with a thousand-yard stare as your brain infodumped everything it could relating to the Alcubierre drive into your memory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHandling had proven to be a non-issue. Your armour had the ability to project a powerful forcefield that prevented damage to you, and even without it your body had proven resilient enough to allow for light handling, such as picking up and light stroking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthros seemed to like stroking you. You weren't sure why, but according to them it seemed to help bring you out of your almost-catatonic state when something triggered your memory. Perhaps it was the physical contact?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three anthros had been gently probing you for information in an attempt to help restore your memory. It had been moderately successful thus far. This probing brought you to your current situation:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, you can't remember your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, looking up at the forms of the three anthros. Equina seemed to be biting her lip, while Lexi and Lotus displayed dismay and uncertainty, respectively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means I can't remember. Usually, I get one of those memory infodumps, but this time there's nothing. I guess part of the memory corruption from the cryosleep means I can't remember my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquina's eyes slowly widen, the black mare seemingly realising something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means we get to name you!\"<br>\r\n Your hand, meanwhile, has quickly found its way to your forehead.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, no...\"<br>\r\nEquina, however, is not to be discouraged. <br>\r\n\"Think about it! We could give you a name that's all mysterious, because of how little we know about humans - even with you here - or maybe one that sounds royal and important, because of how advanced most anthros think your culture must have been!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the plane of a single red scale, then up into Lotus' bemused face, you sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. If you're so set on coming up with a name for me, then to ahead. Just don't go overboard... Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEquina's muzzle lights up like a Christmas tree. <br>\r\n\"Thank you so much! Don't worry, I won't go overboard! Now, where'd I put my notes...\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, Equina trots off, allowing you to see a portion of the steel-grey ceiling several miles overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up into Lexi's muzzle, you attract her attention by clicking your fingers. The senses of anthros were so sensitive that they could hear you talking, even with the size disparity. <br>\r\n\"Uh, Lexi, how long until we reach civilised space?\"<br>\r\nThe wolfess quickly checks a holographic datapad of some kind.<br>\r\n\"Just under a week. Sorry, little guy, it's gonna take a while.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I guess it is...\"</span></div></div>",

Everything was dead. The rocky ground was blackened and charred, and coated with ash; that same ash choked the air and blotted out most of the red sky. The black stumps of what had once been trees could be seen every so often, large piles of ash signifying where the limbs had been powderized. Much of the cracked and dried earth had been turned into glass, such was the heat that had scoured the landscape mere hours ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dead moon hung in the sky, the titanic gashes on its surface visible even from your location. A good portion of the celestial body had been destroyed almost completely, the interstellar debris settling in a loose orbit around the planet. It was hard to believe, given the devastation, but where you stood had once been a jungle. Now all that was left of the mighty trees and innumerable life forms was a stifling cloud of ash. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been months since you had last set foot on a fertile world. And yet, you knew that this destruction - this sacrifice of planets, solar systems, and even galaxies - was completely and utterly necessary. Perhaps if there had been more than two sapient races in the entire cosmos, then this war would never have come to pass.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt awake, limbs spasming for a few seconds before you realise where you are. You're on Equina, sleeping in her thick fur. The mare was holding you in her sleep, much like how a child would hold a teddy bear. If that teddy bear was a good thousand times smaller than the child. Despite Equina's best efforts, she had not yet been able to come up with a name that she felt was suitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition, the ship was almost out of solid fuel, so it had been parked in a mostly empty solar system in order to use solar energy to charge the backup batteries for the FTL drive. This would add a few more days onto the journey back to civilised space, but from what you had heard, the group that employed the three furries you were with had let word slip about having found an actual human. This had resulted in what could best be described as a media firestorm. This, coupled with a video of you that Lexi had taken with your consent, had whipped up the public into a frenzy. At least, that was what you gathered while surfing the Internet analogue the galaxy's society used. You had even prepared several short posts about what you remembered, to be placed on various sites; however, that would not be happening until you reached civilised space and were shown to the public. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you think about what to do, listening to the steady rhythm of Equina's breathing...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deciding that it would be much easier to go back to sleep and be woken up later rather than keep yourself awake until Equina woke up, you lay down and snuggle up to Equina's warm body. You were currently in your undersuit, which was a simple outfit composed of grey fabric designed to prevent chafing while wearing your armour. It was actually rather comfortable, and served to help lock in the heat you received from Equina's body. Shifting onto your front, you lay your head down and feel yourself slowly drift off into sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully you wouldn't have a dream like the last one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You know what this means, girl?! You're gonna be a soldier!\"<br>\r\nYou jump up, wrapping your arms around Seva's thick neck as you do so. The bio-engineered horse nickers loudly, pressing the side of her muzzle into your cheek. A few locks of her dull pink mane fall over your eyes, but you don't mind. Pressing yourself into Seva's grey pelt, you take a moment to reflect on just how lucky you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, there's the farm. Farming itself was rare except in agricultural sectors like yours. Farming had been in the family for generations. Secondly, you had Seva. The caring mare had been genetically engineered to pull farming equipment weighing a few hundred kilograms or so - something easily shown by her huge ten foot body and the rippling muscles underneath her pelt. Those living in hives or hub zones would probably consider her a monster. You had to admit, from a different point of view, Seva probably was a monster. Her massive body, coupled with her ungodly strength, extreme intelligence, and rock hard hooves would give any city dweller approaching her pause, and for good reason. You saw the power of those muscles every day, and were reminded of her size each time you looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet, to you, she was completely gentle. Given the local wildlife, which was hazardous to say the least, Seva had been built to be a protector as much as a beast of burden. You could see the intelligence behind her eyes; behind her actions. She had even saved your life on a few occasions. Those hooves of hers were remarkably effective against any marauding beast seeking to make a meal out of you and your crops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, Seva had a higher purpose in the grand scheme of things. You were due to be drafted - your letter had arrived in the mail, over the phone, over the vid-screen - but you had sent an enquiry to the local defense force, asking what would happen to your beloved Seva. In response, they had sent an inspector round to test her personality and take samples of her blood and skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, Seva was going to become an anthro. Her form would be twisted and reshaped, her whole body enlargened by an order of magnitude; she would be a living superweapon, one of thousands. And you would be her Handler, fighting the Shadow alongside her mighty form as her footfalls caused the very ground itself to shake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScience sure was beautiful.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"By the galaxy's arms! I really do wonder how you got here. Weren't you drafted?\"<br>\r\nYou grin. \"Yup! Klimen Agricultural Sector D-10, draft 3. To be honest, I'm not quite sure how I ended up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthias claps you around the back, the clanging of metal on metal resounding throughout the corridors. \"None of us are! That's the thing about the Psi-Corps; you never know how you got here, except that you were destined for it.\" You snort, giving the dark skinned soldier a condescending look. \"Destiny, Matthias? Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatthias simply smiles, showing off a set of white teeth. He looks you in the eyes with his brown pupils, the grin never leaving his face. \"Yeah, destiny! Don't tell me you think there's any other way a farm boy like yourself can end up being able to kill things with his mind, on top of having his own personal anthro! Talking about anthros, how's Seva been doing lately?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a door, you wait a few seconds to reply as the steely blue bulkhead rises into the ceiling. \"She's been doing pretty well. She's even lead a couple of charges against those Shadow bastards herself! She's shrugged off so much ordnance I'm starting to think she's invincible. I'm still backing up her personality and genetic data, though. Not like I'll ever need it, though.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Yesa's nails, I think I've been hit!\"<br>\r\nYou collapse backwards, your entire body aching. <br>\r\n\"Damnit, I've been hit hard! I think they have a Titan Killer somewhere around here!\" You hiss into your radio. <br>\r\nGranted, you were fine. Your Impervium armour meant that you were safe and sound, and that the monstrous projectile - one meant to penetrate starships and wound anthros - had ricocheted off in another direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kinetic impact of the projectile in question, however, had ruined your ability to fight. You'd probably suffered several broken ribs, at the very least. Growling, you rip your handgun from its position on your thigh. Designed to launch hundreds of tiny homing rockets, the Marus-Klein was the bane of Shadow snipers in any theatre of war. Pulling the trigger, you sweep the sights of the weapon over the orange cliffs in the distance, and are rewarded with a few tonnes of rock being blown clear off, falling into the dunes below and kicking up huge clouds of sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'm coming!\" <br>\r\nSeva's voice fills your helmet as the ground quakes. You feel yourself being delicately lifted high up into the air, Seva's face and muzzle greeting you as tiny explosions harmlessly pepper her skin. \"I'd better get you to the medic then, considering how you can't even move now. Good thing you have that armour.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeva begins walking back to your lines, and you can hear countless numbers of your own troops and vehicles thundering past to fill the space where she just was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many times have I saved your life now? I need to start a tally.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jolt awake, sweating heavily. This was momentous, you were recovering so many of your memories! And just by sleeping! Looking up, you see Equina peering down at you. \"Are you okay? I was trying to wake you up for the past minute.\" She states in a worried tone. You grin up at her. \"I'm brilliant, I... I just remembered so much! God, I think I'm beginning to unscramble my memory!\"</span></div></div>",

Tell me when I'm in focus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walk backwards from the sloping contours of the camera, its monolithic lens whirring as it slowly focused on you. You hear Lexi's voice from overhead. \"You're in focus!\" Shooting Lexi a grin, you turn back to the camera that currently occupies your field of vision. \"Uh, hey. You guys remember how no matter what, I can't remember my name? Well, Equina's been having trouble coming up with a name for me, so I thought I'd ask you guys to come up with some. Maybe if it's good enough I'll use it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at Lexi, you ask \"you guys have forums and comment sections, right?\" Receiving an affirmation from Lexi, you turn back to the camera. \"So, send in some ideas! Equina can only do so much on her own! Also, in other news, I'll be keeping a dream journal from today - I'll also be writing down what I've dreamed so far. Hopefully I'll be able to reconstruct my memory, given enough time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Seva? Can you hear me, girl?\"<br>\r\nStanding beside Seva's mountainous form, you can't help but feel intimidated by what she has become, and what she now represents. Her chest steadily rises and falls, her sleeping form breathing in a slow rhythm. In... out... in... out. ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow would be your first experience with Seva as an anthro. Gone was the protective hulk of a genemodded farm animal. In its place was a testament to humanity's ingenuity and strength. And you were to be her handler. You would be with her almost constantly, helping her to adapt to her new form, its size, her new duties, and so forth. In addition, where one of you went, the other would go. Due to this, any regiment could suddenly find itself with support of the heaviest calibre. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFidgeting, you begin to draw closer to Seva's form. Training had not been what you were expecting. Media, both relatively new and centuries old, depicted boot camps as places where raw recruits were processed and trained into killing machines through physical punishment, regular training, and copious amounts of push-ups. Boot camps were not depicted as places where raw recruits were placed into simulated reality machines with their perception of time altered to such a degree that a month of training could take only a day in real time, while their bodies were slowly modified in real time. This meant that every soldier, no matter their background or previous build, was now impressively muscled, slightly taller than average, and had been trained for several 'years'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out, you gently brush Seva's grey fur with the back of your hand. Immediately, she begins to stir, stretching her cracking limbs and groaning from the kind of exhaustion only waking up could make you feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeva turns her gargantuan head, freezing when she catches sight of you. \"Master?\" Her voice causes the white walls of the sterile chamber to vibrate slightly, so loud and deep it is. \"No, not Master, Seva. Not any more.\" Seva gently plucks you from the ground, your suit's forcefield activating as she does so. Holding you up to her muzzle, Seva stares intently at your comparitively miniscule form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... If you're not my master, then what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three things. Your handler; your teacher; and hopefully, your friend.\"<i></i></i></span></div></div>",

Your motion sensors weren't picking anything up, but that didn't necessarily mean that you were alone. In retrospect, ceramic rounds had indeed been a wise choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back on things, the Shadow had been easy compared to the threat the Siphon now posed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalting, you observe your surroundings. The tattered carpet and furniture were covered in a thin film of silver dust. Probably a bad sign, but you'd need to check to see if your suspicions were true before acting on them. <br>\r\nYou look to the temperature sensor of your HUD. It was dropping, and fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw yourself to the  floor, just in time to avoid a white-hot energy beam passing overhead. The walls warp and melt slightly from the sheer heat, but your suit protects you. Unfortunately, you're now up against an incredibly dangerous foe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaunching yourself to your feet and turning around as you do so, you get a clear look at your enemy for just under a second. Aided by cybernetics and gene therapy, it feels like hours, allowing you to pick out every single detail. A vaguely wormlike form, composed of writhing silver particles that seemed to emerge from the floor. The end of the shape that was facing you had split open, revealing a firey, molten core that rapidly cooled, its energy directed into the missed beam attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're already firing, and at full auto, no less, even as the Siphon disintegrates, its particulates whizzing in every direction. The temperature continues to drop, frost beginning to form on the warped and melted remains of the room. It reforms into a humanoid shape, the head and arms split open and glowing blue. You fire another burst and the Siphon staggers, steam pouring off its shuddering form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fire in full auto again, holding the trigger of your boxy rifle all the way down. Shards are blasted clean off of the Siphon, dissipating into dust before they hit the floor. The Siphon seems to burst into a cloud and, for a second, it seems your work may be done. The cloud quickly surges toward you in the form of an argent stream, knocking you onto your back as your rifle tumbles from your grip. A section of the Siphon - now solidified into a lump covering your torso and pinning you against the floor - rips off, seizing your rifle. The gun dissolves into thousands of minute silver particles, which incorporate themselves into the form of the second Siphon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Siphon swells larger, its mass augmented by the assimilated heavy rifle. It morphs into a long and slender wormlike form, slithering towards you while the first Siphon extends itself and pins your arms and legs, preventing you from struggling further. The second Siphon presses its end against your faceplate, allowing you to see as it splits open, revealing a tiny red core. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the temperature in the room plummets to subzero levels, the Siphon's core begins to burn brighter and brighter, becoming hard to look at even through your helmet. Though you try to struggle, you are completely immobilized. A single beam of energy lances out from the head of the Siphon, beginning the slow, slow process of drilling through your faceplate. Considering the fact that your armour had originally been designed to assist with both solar core and black hole mining, it was going to take quite a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was, you decide, the worst possible time for comms to be knocked offline. The Siphons had detonated an antimatter bomb sometime during the battle, and almost everything planetside had been knocked offline if not partially melted. Your suit had only been functioning due to multiple backup generators, several of which had either been burnt out or failed to function properly. There was one thing you could try, though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Siphons could absorb heat directly from the environment, they could still be damaged by it. As their strategy of immobilizing soldiers and then drilling through their helmets became clear, the Solar League had deemed it necessary to augment the already fearsome abilities of the Kayath power armour even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidly blink-clicking through your HUD, you arrive at what you're looking for. Clicking the icon, you look back to the temperature gauge as it instantly spikes, your suit glowing white-hot as the temperature climbs effortlessly into the hundreds of degrees. The Siphons shriek - one of the few times you've heard them make any sound at all - and although they attempt to scatter their individual particles, they quickly melt from the heat your suit is emitting. One of the few weaknesses Siphons had was rapidly changing temperatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisengaging the anti-Siphon Temperature Spiker, you clamber back to your feet, running your hands over shards of the Siphons that had fused to your suit during their death. While the Spiker was extremely effective, it was best not to get too dependent on it, lest the Siphon find a way to counter it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs indicated by your lack of a weapon, you'd be relying on your energy projectors in any upcoming fights. Boots thumping as you begin to walk through the desolated habitation complex, you once again think on just how much you hate operating without anthro support, and especially without Seva. Operating without anthro support typically meant lots of close range fighting and activation of of the Temperature Spiker. On the other hand, operating</i> with<i> anthro support typically resulted in every Siphon within a mile radius combining into a single, titanic Siphon, which any non-anthro would be hard pressed to damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs deadly as the Shadow had been, even they couldn't fuse with one another. The current war was looking to be even longer and more destructive than the last; two Kardashev civilizations butting heads again and again until one finally submitted.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Feels good to be able to relax again. Especially given how long our leave is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeva looks down at you, nestled safely in the thick grey fur of her shoulder. \"How long is this leave, exactly?\" she asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty years!\" you say, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? That seems a bit excessive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"The latest major battle is over, and it's going to take a long time before there's another one. Maybe a few decades, if we're lucky - lightspeed can only get you somewhere so fast, after all. They're swapping in most of the  ones who were off duty. They're also planning to use more bio-droids and drones in the future to decrease the risk of not having enough soldiers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeva hums as she digests the information. \"What about anthros?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthros are going to be deployed where they're most needed. League's planning on... Upgrading the next wave. Making them even bigger and stronger than the last.

Seva nervously does the same, glancing at you every few seconds. Rapping at different points on your body with your fists, you take note of the sensation caused by it. So far, the simulation seems accurate to realspace.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Ready, Seva?\"<br>\r\nThe mare shuffles her large hooves, her mouth open as if caught in the middle of taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n\"I... I guess so. Let's get this over with...\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\nHeavily padded hand safety gear materializes around both your fists and Seva's. You assume a guarded position; your right fist out in front, your left tucked into your chin, your right foot out in front. Seva responds with a more aggressive position, positioning both of her forearms facing outwards in front of her muzzle, fists clenched.  She leaves herself just enough room to see through the gap between her arms.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\nYou begin to slowly circle each other, locked into a staring match. You pause, and Seva does also, her eyes taking in your form, trying to see any muscle movements that would give away your next move. You begin to circle Seva once more, and she begins to circle you in kind.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Get down on the goddamn ground before I shove a bayonet so far up your arse that it'll be sticking through your throat! One of you, restrain this son of a bitch!<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"High Command, we've just detained a traitor. Fifth Artillery Regiment. Deliberately attempted to cause a friendly fire incident with an Earthcracker class gun.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Roger that, High Command. YOU! You're coming with me!\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n    <div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\nDucking under Seva's swing, you counter with an uppercut that lands squarely on the underside of her muzzle. Dazed, the mare stumbles backwards as you advance. However, Seva isn't out yet, and you find yourself having to move outside of the range of the punches she throws. Seva once again begins moving forward, forcing you to move backwards to avoid being hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\n\"Semi-baryonic assault units spotted.\"<br>\r\n\"Roger. Target all enemy units and fire. Full power.\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">---</div><br>\r\nTwisting, you use your outer forearm to smash Seva's punch away from your body. Your other hand is already cocked, so to speak, and the punch you throw connects solidly with Seva's torso. Two more punches slam into the mare's torso, before you step inside her failing guard, your elbow smashing into the side of her muzzle as you twist. Seva's arms pinwheel for a brief moment as she falls backwards, landing with a loud thump. As quickly as you can, you're straddling her torso, putting your full weight on her. You press down on her throat with your forearm.<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Yield to me...\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Yield to me!\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"YIELD!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What a strange dream. You felt like some kind of gigantic anthropomorphic insects were trying to convince you that you had to help them.. Crazy stuff, especially since their size were certainly not realistic in any manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way, given it was but a dream, you manage to woke up. A warm yellow light was greeting you as you try to open your rubs, still trying to unstiff your body from your slumber. After you stretch, you idly place your hands onto your 'bed'... For some reasons, you had the feeling it was actually softer than before, and yellow, and strangely furrier than you thought. Surely it was actually another dream, so you pinch your hand. Hard at that. You couldn't be helped but let a yelp of pain, getting distressed when you notice you weren't in your bedroom anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surroundings were covered in some kind of honey sockets, if you except that they were huge. A huge opening leading onto an unknown path was found onto one of the walls, but seemingly too far to reach as of yet. <br>\r\nNear the fuzzy bed was standing a large pillar, seemingly yellow and black in color, and from onto which were.. Large and black tree trunks..? Given the fact that remaining immobile wouldn't get you any answers to your problem, you decide to set off onto the large fur toward the pillar. If you could climb it, surely you'd had an easier time knowing what was going on..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked toward the large pillar, it suddenly started to move, turning itself toward you, revealing.. Two gigantic furry mounds that looked like they were the size of mountains. As you manage to peer up, you see a triangular shape, from onto which you could see the tree-trunks things.. And what was just underneath. It looked like some kind of human-bee head hybrid, and it certainly looked like it was actually living, and smart, before she..  you suppose it'd be a female, given the mounds, before she does what you think is an onimously smile. And, before you could've done anything, you suddenly felt like you were lifted up in the air, but rather than to be brutally thrown or moved, you were merely gotten nearer the head thing. Pretty gently at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you grab your head, and you wince in pain, as something was trying to enter your mind. It sounded like a feminine voice, but so loud you could've sworn it'd deafen you, so you flail, trying to escape that intrusion, before you could hear the voice more distinctly. 'Are you alright, Milady..?'. Milady? What the voice is speaking of? And where does it come from?! Out of fear, you yell, 'L-let me off at o-once you-you... T-thing..!'. Visibly, it had an impact, given the bee-human thing was starting to sob, making you wonder if she was really meaning to harm you, but not to the point of relaxing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the voice spoke up again, harmful enough to make you hold your head again, but not as painful as the previous time. 'You don't have to be afraid of me, Milady..! I am but your humble servitor'. What's wrong with that voice? She's not some kind of monarch of anything..! Out of anger, and with a stutter from your fear, you answer, 'R-reveal yourself..!'. You could hear some kind of very heavy sigh, before the voice occurs again, 'What are you speaking about, Milady. I've been standing with you since you got injured. You have nothing to fear since you are safe within our kingdom.'.  Things were still hazy in your mind, but at least, you started to understand a few things. 'A-are you the one speaking to me? Why i'm here. Where is here. And why did you called me 'Milady'..?'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beegirl had been silent for a moment before she speaks up again, 'It's worst than i thought.. They really struck your head hard. it was a good thing that we managed to retrieve you..!'. You tilt your head, lost once more. 'What do you mean by retrieved..? You kidnapped me from my house..!'. The beegirl facepalms and take a sip from one of the nearby sockets, before she, ever so carefully and surprisingly precisely, pours just enough honey to fill your mouth, before she forces the sweet in your mouth ever so gently with a finger. You muffle in rage, 'W-what are you..!', before an excruciating pain rushes through your body. Countless voices echoed in your mind. All different, yet.. Familiar? You could also sense that they were all from insect beings, and all were.. Greeting you as their Queen! And so, before you pass out from the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you woke up, something was wrong. All you could see was a thick yellow fuzzy fur, and you.. Had the feeling someone was kissing you, and pretty lovingly at that.. When it stopped, you felt like you lost something, as you notice it was the same beegirl as before you passed out. The beegirl inquires you, 'How was it..?'. You couldn't tell if she was speaking of the 'greeting' or her kiss, so you decide to say, 'Pretty painful to hear all thoses voices. And a surprisingly pleasant kiss.. But then, why are you saying i'm your queen..?'. The beegirl giggles softly at the comments, then she says, 'Because you are, and you always were since you were born. It's just that you forgot it because of amneia.. Right?'. You calmly say, 'I guess so.. But.. J-just out of my mind.. How big you are, actually, and what is your name?'.<br>\r\nThe beegirl's expression changes up, like she was shocked, just like what you said was just.. Wrong. But as you continue to look at her, she smiles weakly and says, 'S-sorry. I-i'm not used to have such attention from you. You were certainly a fair and loved queen, but it was toward all our brethren. Not.. T-toward me in particular. As such, i think i should show you something..'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beegirl had placed you onto her shoulder and was walking around the hive, after she went up into the pathway from the room you were in. As you look around, you could've seen that it was some kind of underground town, whose size would put continents at shame. And it was full of living anthro insects of all kind, and you noticed a few things about them. They were all around a size in miles, all of them were greeting you in a very friendly manner, and almost all of them were.. Smaller than the beegirl you were standing on, making you wonder who she was exactly. While you were giving some thought, you notice that you were heading some kind of castle, or so you think, given what you could gather from your sight. As your friend steps inside, you felt like a sense of honor, like the place had a special meaning to you, before she takes a turn and brings you into a large bedroom, for their size at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would've thought that the bedroom would actually be more regally furnished, until you notice the wooden desk. Then a rush of memories occured in your mind, reminding of your past life, <i>*here*</i>. You had a flashback of your childhood, playing happily with the other insect kids, while sharing a real friendship despite the size difference, and, as you dug deeper in your mind, you've been reminded of two important things: You are Cythim, the queen of this prosperous hive, and the beegirl, is your sister and her name is Tlacamela. <br>\r\nAfter that flashback, you had a single tear drop from your visage, before you eagerly hug your sister's neck. She says, 'W-what's up..?'. And, in answer, you say, 'Nothing, lil' sister. Everything's fine.. Now let's get back at work, if you want? But Together, okay?'. The beegirl nods and smiles. Standing at a size of 22 miles, she was among the tallest of the bugs because she was of a royal blood, much like you.</span></div></div>",

You slowly sit up and wipe the sleep out of your eyes as you couldn't help but feel...different somehow. As you look down at yourself, you suddenly realize what's different as your clothes and bed are made from the finest silk! Not only that, but the bed looked like it went on for miles as you could just barely make out the end of the bed. You weren't sure if this was some kind of a joke or a dream but you liked where it was going! Still, if this really was dream. Then where were the girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Sir! How did you sleep?\" A hevenly female voice said from behind you as it seemed your dream....slowly turned into a nightmare! Instead of the beautiful bikini model you were expecting, you were greeted by a giant female bunny anthro in a maid's outfit! She gives you a humble curtsy as she carefully picks you up. \"Pardon me sir but I'm afraid if we don't hurry, we'll be late for your meeting!\" She says as she gently pick you up and places you in her palm as she begins to change your clothes. With surprising speed and accuracy. As soon as one piece of garment is taken away, another takes its place as you're left standing in a sort of royal military outfit. \"Now that you're presentable sir, let's take you to the Strategy Room shall we?\" She said as she began to exit the room and carry you away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, you were to speechless to say anything as you were carried away by this giant hare. But after seeing how real everything felt....it couldn't have been a dream! As they exited the room. He couldn't believe what he was seeing as his once little apartment was now a huge castle! With more giant anthro guards, maids, and butlers, it was obvious that wherever you were now. Was nothing like the world you left behind! As you passed, some of the guards would give you a salute, while the maids couldn't help but curtsy and giggle as you walked by. You could even hear them whispering about how cute and handsome you were. Although at your size, a whisper was so loud that it was like they were saying it to your face. And hanging high above your head were Royal Flags, each flying the same proud looking symbol. A side shot of a human face, followed by a side shot of an anthro's face. As the two images are back to back along with a crown covering both of the sticthed picture's heads. \"Uh....ma'am...just...just where am I?\" You ask as it causes a chuckle from your maid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sir. Surely you must be joking with me right? And for royalty to call me ma'am...hehehe...it's just never been done before sir.\" The maid laughed as everything was starting to make sense. The fancy clothes, the maids, the guards, all of this pointed to one thing. You had become royalty over night! Still...just how could that be ? A dozen questions filled your mind as you wanted to ask the Maid a few more question.  Sadly, they would have to wait, as the bunny maid opens a door as high ranking military personal rose and stood at attention at your presence. You couldn't help but feel even smaller than you already were as you were placed on a marble table as the maid humbly left you to the meeting at hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMale and Female anthros alike were at attention and waiting for your orders as you couldn't help but smile nervously. \"Uh...at...at ease everyone! P-Please....take a seat...\" You say as they thank you and take their seats. \"Sir. We are ready to enact your orders for today! Shall we continue our advancement to the East ? Or shall we send our troops to explore the oceans of the West?\" A lion general asked as just one swipe of his hand could wipe out platoon of human soldiers. As you stand on the table, wondering what to say. A holographic map appears underneath you as you can see the position of your castle and your troops as it was time to make a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could take command and just go along with this. Learning about who serves you as you go. Besides, you're treated like a King by these people. Why question a good thing right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, if something is too good to be true....it usually is! Maybe it's best to let the Generals make the decisions while you head back into your quarters and figure out what's going on first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You awoke with a start. You sit up to get your bearings and wince as pain seeped through your body. Your entire body is sore for some reason. As you wipe the sleep from your eyes you notice that you're in a cave of sort. From a short distance away you can see light pouring in from the exit. You crawl towards it and shield your eyes from the light. When your eyes adjust to the light you are greeted by a sight most don't ever see. You find yourself standing in a forest of giant orange fuzzy stalks but that isn't the strangest thing. A pair of orange furred breasts the size of mountains rise up on either side of you. Through the miles long canyon formed by the breasts you can see the head of a humongous sized blonde haired fox woman sleeping peacefully. You turn around and see that the 'cave' was simply her hand lying upon her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and try to process what's going on. Why are you on a giant fox woman? Why does she look so pleased? Why are you naked? Why is your body so sore and why is all this pain coming from your groin area... Ok. You think you might have pieced it together... Just then you hear a loud female sigh. It didn't come from the fox woman. You have to get to a better vantage point and the only bit of high ground around is... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand atop the massive breast taking in the sight before you. It must have been over an hour's worth of climbing. Her fur made it difficult to see anything so you had to climb atop her skyscraper sized nipple. The climb did give you time to collect your thoughts on the night before. You had gotten off work after getting ANOTHER raise from your boss. One of your co-workers offered to take you to the bar. His treat. As soon as you entered the building everyone wanted to sit near you and buy you a drink. You weren't even in there for ten minutes before you were thoroughly intoxicated. This fox woman you were standing atop of must have been someone you picked up in your drunken stupor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze over the fox woman's body and can't help but feel a bit proud of herself. The vixen's body is very curvaceous and puffed out in all the right places. You place her age somewhere in her 30s. You then hear the sigh from earlier again and turn to it's source. On the left side of the bed right next to the fox is a mouse girl. You recognize her as the on of the bartenders and judging from the content look on her face she must have drank a bit of you... You can only hope that on the right side isn't another girl. You turn around and are shocked to see there isn't a girl but a guy. Upon closer inspection you see it's you co-worker and 'best friend' Todd. The black furred wolf is sleeping peacefully his member still semi erect. You get the feeling that he used it a lot last night and not on these girls...</span></div></div>",

But how about one where instead of the anthro already knows you and already know of the sheer size differences between you and them, they don't know of you or your small size? What i mean is that you got transported to their world somehow and need to get one of these living titans' attention. Now to be fair, you are indestructible, meaning that no matter what happens to you, you can't be hurt or kill. Think it's a good idea?</span></div></div>",

You continued to voyage through the darkness trying to find a source of light. \"Gosh where am I,\" you said to yourself as you continue walking until you started to hear a couple of noises and with that, you ran towards that direction but to due to your clumsiness you tripped and fell through a hole that leads to a very bright room. You began falling through the bright room as you soon realize where you at and what has happened. I didn't take you long to find out that you're the size of a speck of dust and are trapped in a world full of anthropomorphic animals.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land with a thud onto a very soft fabric glad that you didn't die from that fall but that was only one problem as now you are lost in a world of colossal anthropomorphic animals. While you are busying panicking and wondering what you are going to do, you are unaware of a massive shadow towering of you. As you looked up you notice a very colossal and very muscular anthropomorphic Gorilla wearing a shirt that looks like it can break at any moment and a pair of pants that seem to be tight on him. \"Oh god no\"  you shouted knowing what is going to happen as they turn around showing their very enormous yet fat bubble butt so you quickly began to run. Sadly due to your very miniature size, the colossal beast managed to sit on you unknowingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm at Cafe de la Sol right now having a cup of coffee while waiting for him\" responded the beast that sat on you and due to that, you realized that the person just so happens to be a male. </span></div></div>",

No gay stuff, please.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is also a kind of \"universe changing\" story, although the only universe change will be at the very beginning.  The main character will wake up one day to find himself or herself in a world that has at least one mega-sized anthro, and the anthro or anthros will have some sort of connection to the main character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther things:<br>\r\n-Do not end the story<br>\r\n-Do not create short \"list\" chapters.  A list chapter is allowed if there is a good amount of plot before it<br>\r\n-Be bold; do not be afraid to create an entire universal situation in the beginning at one chapter; just simply say \"continue this storyline\" or \"Other\" in the choices.
