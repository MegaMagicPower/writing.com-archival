He at one time was careless and he lost a friend that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's been serious about the game ever since. He has much experience in fighting and his wind powers are powerful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe received them after acquiring a certain stone in his early game days. He's been looking for the jerk that deleted his friend in his spare time and he hopes to avenge him one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonality: He's usually easy going but ever since he lost his friend, he's become more distant to other players. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prefers working alone on quests and he won't tolerate anyone who bad mouths his friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumor has it that he has another friend on the server but he hasn't talked to her in two years since his old friend was deleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Room 121. The Triet Inn got a touch up from the tales of symphonia game and it really looks like an Inn now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered with the person he tailed and he said \"You called for a delivery man?\" The figure turned and gasped as Ryu asked the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure looked at him up and down and the figure said \"This is him. He's the one I'm looking for.\" in a low tone of voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Are you the client who asked for a apple gel to be delivered?\" The figure then replies \"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu could make out that it was a woman's voice and that she sounded young. Ryu then says \"Who am I to deliver this to?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure then says \"You can deliver to an old man living in a house not far from here.\" Ryu then receives the apple gel and proceeds to the house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe delivers it and he was about to leave to get his reward but a tall man showed up and asked \"Have you seen a red fox-like user around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu simply says \"No.\" He was about to leave but the man persisted \"Oh no you don't! You're my only lead to that fox so you will tell me where she is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was getting angry because this man was holding him up. Ryu says \"Move aside.\" in a angered manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then says \"Don't make me beat you up! Tell me where she is!\" in an enraged tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu just draws his sword and the man says \"So you won't tell me eh? I'll just beat it out of you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pulls out a claymore the size of a broadsword. The man flips his hood to reveal he is a black wolf with crimson eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two engaged in a sword fight in the town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu goes for an upper cut with his sword but the wolf deflects it and goes for a power swing but Ryu was faster and dodged the attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then engages him in a fencing battle with the wolf winning. Ryu needed to change his strategy otherwise he was going to lose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then jumped back and he powered up a wind attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shoots a large gust of wind and knocks the wolf off balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was about to go for the kill but then a mysterious person blocks his sword and says \"Now now we can't have any off that Mr. Hedgehog.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then jumps back and he looks at his situation. A two versus one fight would result in a lot of injures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then decided to bypass them and get his client out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then charged at them and Ryu did a fake out and used his wind powers to kick up dust to blind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were getting sand out of their eyes, he jump pasted them and ran into the Inn. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then went to his room where his client was waiting and he says \"We need to go now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe client was about ask why he was in a hurry but decided against it and went with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed to the entrance and opened the map.

It had a lot of decorations added to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu stops at the new pokemon center that was established there. The center was also as an access point into the game. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Well that was close.\" The client simply nods.

One you're a suspicious character in a world where people don't judge on looks and second is the little bit of red I saw from your tail when we fled from Triet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe client simply said nothing because she knew he was right so she ends the charade and removes her cloak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's revealed to be a ruby red fox about the height of Shadow with yellow gloves, blue sneakers, and one tail with a heart on the tip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then says \"I guess you got me. My name is Erika and I've been a user in this game for about seven years.\" Ryu then flinched at the name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered that there was someone who had the same user name as her but he figured that it couldn't be her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also has been here for the same amount of time as the female user he knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was starting to figure it out until she brought him back to earth with \"Hey!

Ryu saw the target as it was flying over the volcano. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached it with caution because they know that a phoenix that's cornered can be very deadly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then pulled back an arrow and once again Ryu suddenly remembered that his friend used a bow too but she usually prefers laser guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika shot and the phoenix took damage and Erika says \"When I give the signal, you'll get behind it and cut it down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu nodded and hid behind something as it approached Erika. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when the phoenix was about to strike her, she did a triple flip out of its attack range and said \"Now!\" Ryu jumps behind and strikes its weak point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took severe damage and it obviously showed it because it had trouble flying. Ryu and Erika go for the kill and defeat the phoenix with a dual prong assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phoenix didn't survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu's party defeated a phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReceived 554 experience points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then realized that maybe he can afford to loosen up. Erika was jumping up and down with pure excitement from what we just accomplished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then asked \"What level are you Ryu?\" Ryu simply replies \"Level 46\" Erika jaw dropped after she heard that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe apparently has never been close to a high level party member. Ryu then asked \"What level are you Erika?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then blushed and said \"Promise not to tell anyone?\" Ryu then says \"Why? Is it embarrassing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika blushes again and says \"Just promise me okay?\" Ryu then says \"Fine. I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks around one more time before saying \"Level 10\" Now it was Ryu turn to drop his jaw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never met a female user that stared death in the face but his friend was like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was starting to see that this was no coincidence. He then said \"Did you know that phoenixes and unicorns are used as signs of death and rebirth?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then said \"Of course I knew that Ryu.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly she realized why he asked the question because there was only one person she met that asked her that question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then asked \"Is that you?\" Ryu nods and Erika simply gets into one of her \"OMG\" moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu calms her down and she says \"Ryu! How have you been? I can't believe that I was standing next to my old friend the whole time! I should tell my friends!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu simply sighed and Erika then asks \"Where's Zack? I want to see how much he has improved!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu suddenly feels down and says \"Zack isn't here anymore.\" Erika was shocked and asked \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"He was deleted three years ago. If I wasn't so careless then he'd still be here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then asks \"Can't he make a new account?\" Ryu then replies \"That's not possible.\" Erika agains asks \"Why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies again \"Ever since he was deleted, he's been in a coma. No one is sure how it happened but after he got deleted, I sent him a message to get a new account but he never returned it. I found out a few days later that he was in a coma but the doctors couldn't tell what the cause was. They're still monitoring his heart rate even now and it all because of that jerk I ran into that day.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then asked \"That jerk?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Me and Zack were on a quest that involved investigating a new area but anyone who checked it out never came back. We saw this new graveyard region and then suddenly, a user appears out of nowhere almost as if he teleported. Zack was the only one who knew scan at the time so he scan his level and afterwards, he suddenly says \"Run Ryu! He'll kill you!\" I had no idea what was going on but apparently he was in a whole different class from us. I was only level 15 at the time and Zack was 45. The guy attacked Zack after he said \"This guy is too strong for you Ryu! Get out of here and tell everyone what's going on here!\" He then clashes with him about three seconds into the match, he deletes him in one move.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryu was beginning again, Erika interrupted him and said \"One move!? What level was that guy!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"As I was saying, I ran like he told me but it wasn't long before he caught me. He was about to delete me too but then something happened and I was suddenly logged out even though I didn't ask it to log me out but then I realized that if I had stayed, I would have died and I wouldn't be standing here. I have no idea who that guy was but the next time I see him, he's going down.\" Ryu ends his story as he recalls everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was having a hard time believing what happened but if Ryu says it, then it must be true but that means that she lost a friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then says \"Have you told anyone about this?\" Ryu replies \"I told the mods and they said they're going to look into it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then asked \"Does Lily know about this?\" Ryu replies \"No.\" Erika then says \"We should tell her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"My thoughts exactly.\" They left the volcano region head to the pub Lily works at which happened to be in Luca which was near the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey enter to find that Luca hadn't change much and they saw the person they were looking for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a human with light brown skin, light blue eyes, magneto shoes, and some work clothes you'd only see employees wear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Hey!\" The human turns around and says \"Is that you Ryu? It's been so long! Please have some drinks on the house!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets up a table and they sit down and Lily said \"So how has Zack been doing these days?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu held his head down and said \"Yeah. We wanted to talk about that.\" She was a bit puzzled but listened in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne past telling later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily was shocked beyond words and if there was something worse than being shocked, then I think she just found it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then says \"I don't believe it. Zack is gone? This can't be.\" Ryu knew how much in love she was with Zack even though they're Internet buddies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily then says \"Could I have sometime to myself?\" Ryu simply says \"Sure. Come on Erika. We're leaving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey left so that Lily could be by herself. Ryu was out of the pub before saying \"Man. Wish there was a better way to say that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika response was \"It couldn't be helped. It just happened. I'm beginning to wonder about this game because I hear rumors of people going into comas and never waking up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu completes it by saying \"Truly a fate worse than death.\" They leave to the square and Ryu says \"Let's do some training.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika nods and they enter a teleporter that takes them to....                 </span></div></div>",

After I lost Zack, I never teamed up with another group ever again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then says \"But you teamed up with me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"That's because you're my only friend left.

I don't even know if Lily is a she. I figured I was better off alone but you are the reason I haven't lost to my lonely part. If I hadn't found you again, I probably wouldn't be here right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika takes his words to heart and says \"Even if you change on the outside, I'll still see you as the same carefree Ryu I know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu just then smiles and says \"Thanks.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika had rarely seen Ryu smile but the minute she notice, it was gone and Ryu was back to his cold distant self again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured that once this whole craziness was resolved, she was going to leave the gaming world and live a normal life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then says \"You know, I have seen many different kinds of users but I've never met someone like you and I believe I'm glad I met you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu just looks at her says \"Same here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked like they were in a trance and they leaned into each other and just when they were about to kiss, an explosion occurs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu goes to investigate. Erika was thinking to herself \"Did I almost kiss Ryu? What's wrong with me? We're just friends and nothing more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe follows after Ryu and it turns out to be a female dog fighting a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog look like a Labrador retriever with lavender fur, white paws, tan ears, and wore a red scarf on her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was wielding a mage's staff that look like the wizard's staff from final fantasy IX. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appeared to be having trouble with the dragon and Ryu said \"Do you need some help?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog throws a blizzara at the fire-breathing dragon and she looks Ryu's way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked like she was about to say no but she reconsidered and said \"Sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu jumped in and cut the dragon down but it got back up and Erika shot an arrow at it but it did little damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Labrador retriever throws another blizzara and the dragon tries to get up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu jumped into the sky and plunged his sword into it necks and thus ended the battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu's party slayed a dragon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReceived  3047 experience points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika went 5 levels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Labrador retriever went up 3 levels!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu went up 1 level!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asked \"What's a mage doing out here by herself?\" The mage simply said \"Simple. I was out here training.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"You could have gotten yourself deleted if we hadn't shown up.\" the mage then says \"I know. I really should be more careful.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika and says \"What's your name?\" the mage says \"My username is lightningspear but you can call me Sakura.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"All right Sakura, you seem pretty strong with that magic you had.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then says \"I made sure I could handle the more powerful magic.\" Ryu asks \"We could use a mage, would you like to join us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then says \"Wait! Ryu can I talk to you in private?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey wander off into a random part of the woods and Erika says \"Are you sure we should let this girl on our team? I mean we just met her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu replies \"Yes but she's strong when it comes to magic and besides, There are enemies that require magic to effectively defeat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika counters with \"But we don't know if this girl is a jerk or something.\" Ryu then suddenly says \"Are you jealous?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika blushes and says \"No! What would give you that idea!?\" Ryu then says \"Listen, I think we can trust her so I say we should let her on the team.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu walks away from a speechless Erika and they head back to Sakura and Ryu asks \"Well, do you want in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thinks about it and says \"Ok. I'll do it.\" Ryu then says \"Good. I guess that means we're party members now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu tries to get Erika and Saura to shake hands. Sakura held out her hand and Erika was hesitant at first, but she shook her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Well, it's getting late so we'll go on a quest tomorrow?\" Sakura shakes her head but Erika says \"I can't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu asks \"Why not?\" Erika says \"I need to take care of something but I'll be on around 6 p.m.\" Ryu then says \"Cool. See you then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu logs out and just when Sakura was about to log out, Erika then says \"Just to let you know, Ryu may trust you but I don't so don't think you can make moves on him when I'm not looking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then logs out leaving a confused Sakura in the forest.                    </span></div></div>",

Sakura was running out of magic and one of the men got past her barrage of firas and blizzaras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then thought at that moment (Damn it! To be defeated because of sheer numbers.) Suddenly, the man fell to the ground and Ryu was standing in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura felt really happy at that moment and said \"Ryu!\" Ryu then cuts down some more strange men and eventually defeats them. Ryu then asks \"Who were those guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then says \"That's what I want to know. They came out of nowhere. Aika and Fina went to the upper decks to see if there were more but then these guys showed up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"Waiting until you were alone? How low can these guys get!?\" Sakura then says \"There were too many for me to handle by myself. I'm glad you showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then sees a strange logo and asks  \"What's with this logo?\" Sakura looks at it and says \"I recognize that logo! This is Luke's emblem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then says \"So there's something strange about Luke after all. The real question is why is he doing this?\" Sakura then says \"I don't know but he will pay for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu and Sakura went to the upper decks and found Vyse with Aika and Fina. Ryu then asks \"They attacked up here too?\" Vyse replies \"Yeah. I shouldn't have let my guard down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAika then says \"But now we know that Luke most definitely has something to do with this!\" Sakura then asks \"So where is he now?\" Ryu saw Luke's ship and said \"There it is!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVyse gets to the front of the ship and steers them toward the ship. Ryu then says \"I'll check it out. You guys wait here.\" Ryu jumped onto Luke's ship and went inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura thought to herself (Please be careful.) Vyse then says \"I'll make sure the enemy doesn't get the drop on us again.\" Vyse went to another part of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu looked around the strange looking ship. He saw pictures of items and weapons. He looked at some of the cases in the room and saw some rare artifacts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu then asks himself \"Was this guy a lover of art or something?\" Ryu walked into the main room where it had pictures of Luke and pictures of girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu got to his desk and pulled out a file. He then read it and said \"This file is a record log.\" Ryu looked at it with precision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAugust 31, 198X<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am unstoppable. I've cut down so many enemies and I feel like nothing could defeat someone like me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never knew taking on pirates could be exciting. I defeated many of my enemies until I ran into a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a part of a pirate crew I defeated and we were wondering what to do with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy men suggested raping her but I'm a man of courtesy  I would never rape someone. I told my men that was out of the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't take it too well but then the woman asked if she can join my crew. Turns out, she was only on the pirate crew she was on because of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe owed the captain money but she couldn't pay it back so he had her work it off. She was actually glad we defeated him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain mistreated her in many ways. He even almost  raped her at one point. I felt like I would be doing her a favor by having her join my crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNovember 4, 198X<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've become attached to the woman named Violet. She did so much for my crew. She was a valuable asset and helped with taking care of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that's when I fell for her. She was very pretty and I couldn't keep my eyes off her. She apparently had the same feelings for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe truly connected today. I wanted to take her out on a date when my adventuring was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not sure why but my men have been more distant with me. Are they jealous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarch 18,  199X<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know why my men betrayed me but I should have seen it coming. They plotted a mutiny against me and left me to die on a barren island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI eventually escaped and went to look for those traitors. They had Violet with them so they were definitely not going to be forgiven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI found the ship but it was torn up. I checked everything and it turns out that someone attacked them a while after they left the previous town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't find Violet's body among them but then I found a letter that was amazingly not burnt. I read the letter and it was from Violet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe escaped my crew but then Valua stepped in and shot down the ship. They checked for survivors and found her. She had enough time to let me know she was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also said that I should stop Valua. They have become corrupt but I couldn't do anything about it. I decided to wait for an opportunity to get into Valua.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had no idea that something would take place there one year later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApril 25, 199X<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just heard that Valua has fallen. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Turns out that Vyse the blue rogue trashed them. A lot happened and Valua was destroyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI received a letter from Violet today saying that she somehow escaped Valua while Vyse was causing a ruckus. She was now sailing around looking for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to find her and got together a new crew. One that would help me on my search. I sailed around for a while until I received a letter again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it was from someone I didn't know. He told me to do what he says otherwise Violet dies. I couldn't believe this guy was making me do things for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI couldn't argue because he had Violet so I did whatever he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune 15, 20XX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've been in the transport business for more than ten years and yet this guy still refuses to give Violet back. I won't forgive him if he hurts her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mentioned that he had an important job for me but it was to commence 5 years from now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have no idea what it was about but I just did what I was told. It felt like an eternity since I last saw her. I don't plan to let this guy get away with this!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu turned to the next page but it was ripped out. Ryu then says \"Why is this entry ripped out?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu tried to find out more but suddenly, a voice says \"Looks like you found out too much.\" Ryu looks around and sees no one around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice then says \"Sorry. I can't let you leave so prepare for deletion!\" Ryu then saw a bomb appear in the corner and said \"Crap!\" Ryu ran out as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ryu made it to the deck, the ship exploded and Ryu wasn't sure if he was going to make the jump. He jumped with all his might as the ship behind him exploded.      </span></div></div>",

He wouldn't hit the bottom for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he survived, he would have a hard time getting back into normal skies. Ryu then saw a small piece of land and changed his trajectory to land on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu was glad that he learned some tricks from Sonic. Ryu then pondered how he was going to get out of this. He check to see if he could log out but he couldn't due to interference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu didn't see any air ships nearby so he was pretty much stuck. He wasn't sure what he was going to do but suddenly, he asked himself \"I wonder how Erika is doing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu looked up at the stormy skies as he waited in the rift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacter change<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika was waking up in a strange room. She looked around and saw some pictures of a unusual girl. Erika then said \"Who is this?\" Then a voice says \"That's Violet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika looked at the figure that just appeared and said \"You're that jerk who kidnapped me!\" Luke then walked up to her and said \"Please understand. I didn't want to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then says \"Give me one reason why I should believe what you say!\" Luke then says \"I was trying to find a friend but I ended up finding out that she was kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then said in a calmer voice \"Friend? You mean Violet?\" Luke then said \"Yeah. They threaten to kill her if I don't do what they say.\" Erika then asks \"Do you know where she is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke replies \"No. And that makes it harder on me. I don't know if they really have her but I can't take the chance if they do have her.\" Erika then says \"You don't want her to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then says \"But I promise that once Violet is in my hands again, those guys will pay!\" Erika then started to think that maybe this guy might need help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then says \"I don't know what to do! I want to stop this! This is giving me a bad name but Violet means so much to me!\" Erika could hear the desperation in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then started shedding tears and saying \" All I want to sail with Violet again! Is that so wrong?\" Erika then thought (Ryu would help him if he heard this story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then asked \"Why are you telling me this?\" Luke then says \"I just wanted to tell someone. Do you have any idea what its like to keep something like this bottled up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then said \"I'll help you.\" Luke stopped crying for a moment and said \"What?\" Erika then says \"It's starting to become weird watching my captor cry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then says \"Really? You mean you'll help me?\" Erika then says \"Rule number 5 of being a hero! Help those less fortunate than yourself!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then said in a teary tone \"Thank you!\" Erika then says \"Save the waterworks for your friend!\" Luke wipes away the tears and says \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke has joined the party!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke is a human with light brown skin, spiky brown hair, blue eyes, and had some muscle behind him. He is wearing a light blue pirate vest with matching pants and brown boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also carries a cutlass equipped with a blue moonstone giving it water and wind abilities. The blade was sharpen to boost effectiveness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then asks \"So where are we?\" Luke replies \"We're in the Dark Rift. We're pretty much near the entrance. I needed to lose a certain someone.\" Erika then asks \"Who is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then says \"I'll tell you later. Let's head to our real destination.\" Luke then turned the ship to the swirling portal of the Dark Rift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke then says \"Okay. The meeting place is Nasr. We're going to meet a man wearing a red turban.\" Erika then asks \"So what are you going to do?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke replies \"I'm going to show up and mention the code word. He'll come to the ship and see you tied up. He's suppose to take me to Violet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then says \"So in case he tries to double-cross you, you'll loosen the bonds on me.\" Luke then said \"Yeah. I just hope he doesn't notice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nErika then says \"I just hope your friend is all right.\" Luke then says \"Yeah.

She's got a bad temper and tends to stay away from groups, usually keeping to her one man space ship. She's a space pirate and a darn good one at that but she's been a bit down on her luck lately, which has made her even more irritable.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mave curled up against the delicious looking man in her dream only to have their kiss interupted by an ungodly aweful sound that began screetching through his mouth as soon as he opened it to whisper sweet somethings into her ear. She groaned in anger and frustration as she opened her eyes to find herself back in her cramped little sleeping quarters with her alarm clock going off in her ear. \"Alarm- off.\" she moaned, rolling back over in hopes of continuing where she left off in her dream. Yet for some reason instead of the alarm going back to sleep like she was wanting to do it kept buzzing in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alarm- off\" she growled much more forcefully. The little bugger still made an annoyingly cute and perky beeping sound in her ear. Had she been that stupid- to turn the alarm on that setting? What had been so important about getting up this early in the first place? \"Alarm off!\" she yelled. It didn't work. Mave felt her eyebrow twitch as she pulled out her pistol and shot the stupid clock. She opened one eye to see that she had in fact set the alarm to keep going till she'd gotten up to turn it off manually. \"I'll just buy another one.\" she told herself as she rolled back over and curled back up into her sheets. Moments later she was back to that dream again. She let out a sigh of relief as she rested her head on the big guys arm... then a bunch of cops sped past them in the park and a news ship flew overhead. \"Darn it all!\" Mave yelled as she hopped up and began running from the cops. She bolted for her ship. If she got into it she could outrun anyone. Why there were giant bubbles that were making it hard for her to run was beyond her- call it dream sense but she ended up rolling out of bed as her alarm went off yet again. \"Dog on it all.... Alarm-\" It wasn't until she opened her eyes to the red flashing light that she realized it wasn't her alarm. There wasn't anything left of that. It was the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Detecting space craft less than 12 leagues away.\" the ship kept repeating. Mave scrambled to her feet, opening her door and running to her seat, hopping into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has the ship tried to communicate yet?\" she asked as she punched in a number of commands into the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affrimative.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Currently?\" she questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open a connection.\" she ordered. A second later the screen in front of her came to life revealing a face she really didn't want to see. \"Oh... its you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mave, my sweet little blossm of sunlight...\" the captain offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get a grip...\" Mave mumbled as she rolled her eyes. \"What do you want?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I merely want to disguss something with you aboard my ship.\" he offered with a 'charming smile'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a pirate and you're a captain... the guy who's supposed to catch me. How dumb do you think I am?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smirked. \"I assure you sweet lady, i will not arrest you without giving you giving you a warning. It isn't my will to cage such a beauty as you but I do need to speak with you, if you please. Its of the ut-most importance.\" Mave started her engines as he spoke. She wasn't about to listen to this guy. \"And my dear, if you try to run I'll be forced to capture you. Right now I'm of the peaceful mind. Don't make me change that by running. I don't like it when they run. It's annoying.\"</span></div></div>",

He's currently got black hair, blue eyes, and a tan to go with his perfect build but he tends to change his looks depending on the woman he's going after.
