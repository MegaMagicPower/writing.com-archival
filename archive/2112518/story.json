Well what if we somehow took that into new heights. Well Tails was working on a growth ray that was supposed to help with food shortages as he wants to end world hunger. Then one day Amy came by while he was taking a nap from a long day's work and figures out that Sonic would really go for her if she grew herself to massive heights. Not even a speedy hedgehog would be able to outrun a gigantic Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.... a growth ray, now what could I do with it? I could grow myself to gigantic heights and try to capture Sonic, or perhaps I could go have some fun in Station Square, or perhaps stop Eggman before he even tries to harm Sonic at all.... so many options!\" Amy said, and then she took the ray outside and out into the forest. \"I am sure Tails won't mind if I used the ray to make myself big.\" She said. Amy then goes far enough and then points the growth ray at herself. She then pulls the trigger, and then a strange feeling starts to change her. She starts to grow at a very alarming rate, with the trees of various height only reaching her knees. Soon, she was 200ft tall, and her voice just boom. \"Wow, this does really work! Now what could I do now since I am now Amyzilla!!!!!?\" Amy said with a roar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeriously, what does Amyzilla do?</span></div></div>",

A place devoid of any life, any context, any meaning, any substance, anything that the mind can latch onto to try and make some sense of this landscape. There isn't even any sounds or smells or feelings. It feels as if existence itself has given way and this void is all that is left to out sit eternity. And deep within this shallow and empty existence, one mind alone; one person; one life slowly begins to regain consciousness. A life belonging to a young, pink haired anthropomorphic hedgehog formally known as Amy Rose. A relative beauty in her normal life, now the only object of interest in this dead world. Her luminous eyes drift open as her mental functions return to her. Her body provides the only ounce of colour to be seen. As she comes to realise just how big this change in scenery is, she finds herself having to squint, for even in the void it is too bright for her fragile little eyes to cope with.<br>\r\n\"W-What?...Where am I?...How did I get here?...Is this some kind of prank? <i>Helloooooo! Anyone there?</i>....oh chaos...Seriously what the hell is going on? Can someone tell me? Please? Can I have an answer?....god damn it, what is it all for?\"<br>\r\nAmy's words do not echo back to her. As soon as they leave her mouth there is no evidence that she even said anything at all. Afterall, what is the void if not the complete lack of any substance whatsoever? Amy gazes over her being, looking for any changes that might have come over her. She gazes over her gloved hands and bracelets, then over her blood red dress, then down at her red and white boots and finally at her strands of spiked, pink hair dangling before her eyes. Nothing has changed at all. Her body is still that of the perky, attractive teenage hedgehog she was before this...event. So what had changed?<br>\r\n\"Hmm...since there's nobody here I guess that nothing I say matters...that's kinda sad now that I think about it.\"<br>\r\nAmy was just about to give up and resign herself to an eternity of life in a white void, when a voice sounded out around her.<br>\r\n\"<b>Ahh...this is the new one we have been expecting. A bit of an average specimen. But then again we do seek out those of little importance.</b> \"<br>\r\nAmy frowned at this subtle demeaning of her worth.<br>\r\n\"Yeah? And who are you to decide mister high and mighty god voice?<br>\r\n\"<b>Oh ho hoooh. A real feisty one we have here. It is useless to be angry with us. We are merely here to ensure that our purposes have been fulfilled.</b>\"<br>\r\nAmy stared in confusion at this stranger's statement but before she could reply, her vision suddenly started to swirl and her head became dizzy. For a moment she thought she could see something coming out of the whiteness, but her vision quickly dulled before being replaced with...</span></div></div>",

But for some reason she feels that there is something different about this one. She can't understand why, but the internal feeling she has as a result of being in this place is slightly different than before. It feels like she has more space, more wiggle room. Not that it would make any difference since she couldn't see anything anyway. \"Okay...Will someone care to explain just what is going on here?\". Her face is plastered with a deep frown at this whole ordeal. The disembodied voice speaks once more. \"<b>Do not be hasty little one. All will be clear soon enough. We are going to show you visions from your past. If we are satisfied, you will be free to go.</b>\" Amy's expression shifts to one of confusion once more followed by suspicion. She's had to deal with mind games before and they weren't pleasant for her. \"And what if I don't prove satisfactory?\". \"<b>Then you will be sent home too. The exact outcome is of little concern to us.</b>\". \"Then what <i>is</i> of concern to you?\" \"If you meet our needs then you will find out shortly. Now observe little one.\" As soon as the voice stops talking, Amy looks forward and sees some dark wavy lines in front of her. They wiggle and contort as they combine with each other to form a solid shape. A familiar shape...one with thin legs and spiky hair. Amy's eyes widen. \"Sonic?...is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shape continues to distort and mesh itself into the form Amy knows so well. First the arms, then the hands, then the shoes, then the quills until finally the outline settles to perfectly match the object of her affections. Without even thinking, Amy runs forth towards the figure with great speed. \"SONIC!\" She runs right up to the figure and hugs it tightly in her embrace. As she does so, she suddenly thinks that she might be putting on too much pressure and thus backs off. Sonic appears to make pained breathing noises as if he was being stifled of air. \"Um...so sorry about that. I just thought I was all alone here.\" \"No...problem...So...What is this....place?\" \"I wish I knew. I was called here by some strange voice that talked about 'satisfying their needs' and then suddenly I saw you.\"  \"Well...I'm glad I at least have some company in this wasteland.\" All of a sudden a terrible thought occurs to Amy. What if this isn't the real Sonic? What if this is just an illusion? She thinks carefully about what she will say next before she places her hand on Sonic's shoulder. \"Sonic?...What is the name of your best friend?\" Sonic turned to face Amy with a raised eyebrow. \"My best friend? That's Tails obviously!\" \"No no...I mean...his real name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic's face takes on an expression of butter bewilderment. \"What are you talking about? Tails is the only name he's ever had!\" Amy frowns ever more deeply at this. \"That's not true. Sonic told me many times that Tails was just a nickname. He never told me what it was exactly. But if you were the real Sonic then you would know what it was...right?\" Sonic's eyes begin to dart around the place in worry. \"...o....OOOOh that name...um...well Tails...wouldn't exactly like other people to know his real name so that's why I refused to say it.\" Amy's expression slowly becomes more angry. \"But you didn't say you refused to tell. You said he didn't have any other name. I've known Sonic to lie to me about many things, but he would <i>never</i> lie about his best friend.\" Amy raised her fist in a movement that looked like she was going to punch Sonic. Sonic began to wave his hands about in what appeared to be anxiety. \"Amy! Please! This is all a misunderstanding! You can't-No! NO!\" Sonic covered his eyes and held out his hands to try and block the punch....but Amy never threw one. She never had any intention of doing so. She simply closed her eyes and thought to herself over and over. \"This is not real. This is not real. This is not real.\" She kept running those words through her mind over and over and over again for what seemed like ages. All the while Sonic appeared to have stopped doing anything at all. A few seconds later, Amy opened her eyes and found to her surprise that the image of Sonic in front of her had completely frozen in place. And he looked significantly more fake than when she first saw him. Like he was just a projected image of light. Amy sighed to herself in a frustrated manner. Frustrated at herself for not realising this before. \"So that's what those guys meant by visions of my past. Well...at least now I know what to expect from these trials.\" And with that, Amy sat still and tried to calm herself down in preparation for the next trial.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy did not have to wait long for her next trial to occur. Mere seconds after the Sonic illusion had been spirited away, Amy was thrown from her feet by a massive shock wave that sent her tumbling head over heels along what felt like...some kind of soft gravel. After 3 seconds of this disorientation, she managed to regain control of herself and she looked back in the direction she had just been hit from. She noticed two black blobs shooting about nearby, both nearly indistinguishable from the other. The single difference that Amy could make out was that one had traces of a sandy pink colour while the other had blue hues to it. As Amy wondered what the purpose of this trial would be, one of the blobs lunged forwards at the other in a charging motion. The attack narrowly missed and the other blob was able to hit the first one from behind. After this one of the blobs began to retreat in Amy's direction. It was at this point Amy could see that it was not a mere blob, but a humanoid creature surrounded in what appeared to be black armour from head to...toe?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other blob shortly followed and Amy only had enough time to note that it was also humanoid before the first creature shot past her with great speed. Amy just stared blankly at the two creatures as they did battle around her. She had no idea what was going on but she knew she had to do something. \"HEY! YOU GUYS! WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?\". Amy's calling did not deter the two creatures however as they continued to dash and lunge at each other with great precision. \"HEY! I'M TALKING TO YOU! I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF I-\". Amy stopped herself as she saw one creature releasing what appeared to be a laser beam at the other. It scored a direct hit. But the dark mystery man did not even appear to flinch. Amy's eyes widened ever so slightly. \"Did i just step into a war zone or something?\". Soon the other creature responded in kind and returned fire with more primitive projectile weapons. Arrows with rockets attached to them. All of them struck their target except for one which carried onwards towards where Amy was. \"EEEK!\" Amy shut her eyes and covered her face in a vain attempt to dull the impact...but nothing happened. When Amy opened her eyes, the rocket powered arrow had landed just a few inches at her feet. This was all Amy could stand. \"Alright! That's it! I'm putting a stop to this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a great haste of her own, Amy dashed forward, reaching back to pull out her Piko Piko Hammer. As one of the creatures dived across her path, She leapt into the air and swung her hammer with great force. It struck a bulls-eye and successfully slowed the creature down. Amy smirked, but soon groaned as she realised that the creature was still too fast for her to keep up. Even at it's slowed speed, it was still retreating faster than she could run. Nonetheless, Amy soon was picking up the pace again and making her way to intercept the creatures who even now appeared to be charging for a big smash at each other. Amy leapt into the air once more, using the swing of her hammer as a boost and similarly lunged forth at the two. She knew should wouldn't be able to stop them, but she knew she had to try. Somehow she just knew. And before she knew it, something happened. Amy was no longer a few doze feet away. She was sitting right in between the two charging creatures. She was confused but knew that there were more pressing matters at present. She firmly gripped her hammer in both hands and stood ready. The distance was closing fast. 17 metres. 10 Metres. 5 metres. There was only 2 metres of space left when Amy finally uplifted her hammer. \"I have-\". Her hammer swung and hit the first creature dead on the noggin. \"-had enough-\". The hammer swung below her arm and delivered a sharp uppercut to the second creature. \"Of this shit!!!\". And before any of the creatures could rise back to their feet, Amy slammed her hammer down into the ground with a most ferocious thud. The resulting shockwave reverberating through their craniums, giving them both a splitting headache...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at last there was silence. Amy stood in the middle, breathing harshly and with a look of tired frustration on her face. Both creatures appeared to have been incapacitated by the blows to the head and the shockwave. Amy snorted in triumph and promptly made her way over to one of the creatures. She grabbed the head piece of the armour and ripped it off with no effort at all. Inside the armour was an Echidna with grey hair and weary eyes. She promptly ripped the helmet off the other creature's armour too, revealing a Human being with brown hair and a face that looked like it had been carved by years of conflict. Amy then began to talk in a low, hurt voice. \"Now...if I could just have your attention please...I require some knowledge...who are you?\". Both Human and Echinda gave names and serial numbers, but at this point Amy didn't give a damn about who either of them were. \"And just what the hell are you doing fighting like this?\". \"The Echidna responded in anger. \"Fighting to protect my people young girl! From the wretches that are humans. All they do is take and take until there is nothing left!\". The human responded with similar vitriol. \"Eye for an eye you spineless coward. I lost my entire squadron to a bunch of your savage species mere moments after we had set up camp in this new land! You say we only take, yet what about the lives you took that day huh?\". \"You would destroy out way of life! Force us from our homes and slaughter us like pigs!\". \"If this is how you treat people in need then I see no difference. You'll kill anyone who doesn't belong to your tribe just because we are different!\". \"Because you will take from us what we have worked so hard to achieve. Humans! Nothing more than liars and cheats\". \"Cheating because we use our brains instead of brute force? Typical savage mindset of a typical savage Echi-\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ENOUGH!\" Amy Rose was now gritting her teeth and trying as hard as she could to keep herself from strangling the two of them. \"You two clearly have no respect for each other or life in general. You let your fear and paranoia rule your actions instead of considering anything else. You seek to protect life by eliminating other life. This kind of hypocrisy will just not do! Don't you get it? You're all horrible!\" Amy paused for a moment to catch her breath and in doing so, took a moment to look into the eyes of her companions. Both had a mixed expression of shock, anger, guilt and despair. They seemed to be losing their minds trying to process what was just said. Amy breathed deeply and continued in a more calm tone. \"I'm sorry you had to hear it like this, but It's the truth. Nothing will change if you kill each other. You'll still be angry and still want to hurt others. That is the kind of thinking that starts wars, or had you forgotten that lives besides yours are affected by your choices? Are we like common weasels? You're supposed to be better than this...we...are supposed to be better than this\". Amy trailed off and looked down sadly. \"Please...just cease this senseless fighting...try to understand what you're doing...Try to break the cycle...For everyone's sake\". Amy couldn't even see both of the creatures' faces and she didn't know if she wanted to. A few seconds of silence followed before a voice spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I've...been in error.\" Amy turned to see it was the Human who spoke. \"...I'm sorry...I should have known...I...I really should have-\". \"Save your apologies human.\" The Echidna spoke up. \"...save them until I give you mine...I'm sorry for thinking so low of you.\" Amy held her head in her hands and began to hyperventilate right then and there. Before she could do anything else though, her vision started to blur once more and the world around her felt as if it were fading away. She felt darkness overtake her mind, but it wasn't a malicious kind of darkness. It felt like a peaceful kind of darkness. It soothed and calmed her, making her feel as if nothing had ever happened. \"<b>Well well well. You have exceeded our expectations little one. I think you may be what we are looking for</b>\". Amy couldn't even respond as her mind blinked away from her for a few brief seconds. When it came back to her however, she was now in a different location. She was in...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blurring and dizziness faded away from Amy's mind once more and she found herself in yet another white void. \"Another void!?\" She exclaimed. \"How many more of these do I have to go through?\". She did not receive an answer to her question and once more all that greeted her was empty whiteness. \"Hm. Oh well. Suppose I should just walk around. Not like I can do anything else around here.\" Amy stepped forward in search of whatever she had been brought here for. She hadn't taken two steps however before she heard a dull crunching sound coming from beneath her. A feeling of dread ran down her spine in that instant. She looked down suddenly, lifting her right foot to see what could have made that noise. To her surprise, underneath where her boot was, stood a tiny flower with white petals \"Wha-?\". Surprised that plants could grow in what was essentially nothingness, Amy knelt down to get a closer look at it. Sure enough it was a flower; It's stalk had been bent slightly from Amy treading on it and one of the petals looked crumpled slightly. Amy felt a small amount of regret at having trodden on something so pretty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever she couldn't exactly feel guilty since plants couldn't talk and by all definitions lacked any form of intelligence. Thus upon realising what she had trodden on, Amy simply got back to her feet and carried on. However from that point on, Amy took great care in where she put down her feet as she walked. Sure enough there were many more flowers popping up in front of her path. They seemed to be appearing out of thin air as she walked and they were increasing in numbers the further she went. At first they appeared only separately, but soon enough they began to appear in pairs. twos, threes, fives and more greater pairs came up. Her attempts to progress without crushing the flowers were getting more difficult by the second. Each step of hers was taking nearly 5 seconds for her to make through the flower trails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought occurred to her. Why was she taking such care to avoid the flowers? Surely she could progress faster if she just started walking like normal. But something in her gut told her that this was a bad idea. The room was showing her flowers for a reason. It would probably look bad on her part if she started trampling on the only things she could see. She thought about turning back to avoid stepping on flowers altogether but when she looked back at where she had just come from, a massive bush that appeared to be two times her height was blocking her path. \"H-...How did that get there? It was clear just a few seconds ago.\" Amy tried to force her way through it, but the branches in the bush were too tightly packed and they acted like a flexible wall at her pushing. \"Seems like my only option is to walk onward\" She sighed. Slowly she lifted her left foot up and began her slow, gruelling pace again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the flowers were becoming so numerous that Amy had to stand on tip toes to avoid crushing them. \"What is it all for?\" she wondered out loud \"Why do this?\". Her only response was even more flowers in her path. The space was really getting tight now. She struggled to keep her balance as her foot wavered over a field of daisies. She could feel her body wobbling about as her off centre body weight threatened to bring her to her knees. \"Aaaahh\" she gasped when she felt her balance tip dangerously to her left. She shut her eyes and tried to put all her effort into keeping balance. Her foot twisted and quivered beneath her weight. Amy felt like she would topple at any moment....then all of a sudden the feeling stopped. She cautiously opened one eye and to her surprise she saw that she was still standing upright. Her foot had stopped wavering about and she could now move without disrupting her balance at all. She swiftly moved her leg forward and her toes hit a bullseye in a small space between some Ivies. She breathed a sigh and promptly moved off on her left foot to bring her right foot down for another step. To her surprise again, it felt in more in control than her last step had been and again it glided through the air to the blank spot no trouble. Amy continued to be amazed by how gracious and masterful her balance was and she chuckled slightly as she began to pick up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new boost of ability was soon put to a stop however when she had to halt her progress sharply. It nearly threw her right off her new found sense of balance. She had glanced ahead of her to see if anything had changed and to her shock, there was no more space to step. It was all flowers. Flowers as far as she could see. There was no way she could carry on without trampling them and this trial had clearly been focused on her not doing so. She was stuck. She stood still for a few moments, running through all the options in her head many times over. Eventually she chose the only one that would make sure she wouldn't fail. She held her arms out to the side and yelled out to whoever would listen. \"I cannot go any further! I can see this clearly! I know this game of yours! The only winning move is not to play! and so I forfeit! Now come on! Take me!\". She stood tall and proud, waiting for some kind of response to her challenge. But none appeared to happen. No voices. No dizziness or blurring. Not even returning to pure whiteness. Perhaps this was the end. She would be stuck here forever. All alone. Amy yelled once more into the void. \"I SAID TAKE ME YOU JERKS!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a response. Almost immediately a large black cloud began to fade into view in front of her. A low buzzing noise accompanied the shape shifting blob as it drifted closer like a boat on the water. Then Amy realised that it was not one massive blob, but several smaller blobs heading for her. \"Bees!\" She shouted without thinking. And sure enough the blobs began to take on a familiar black and yellow stripped colour. The buzzing was almost deafening as the swarm headed straight for Amy with the ferocity of a tsunami. Amy would have screamed right then and there if she wasn't so focused on making sure none of the bees got anywhere in her mouth. They were only feet away from her before she shut her eyes tightly and prepared for the worst. A rush of wind came over her and her hearings were filled with a horrible, ear grating buzzing sound. It pounded on her skull and made her twitch uncontrollably. She quickly thought back to how she handled the fake Sonic and set about repeating her words again. \"This is not real. This is not real. This. Is not. Real!\". It didn't seem to do anything this time however as the buzzing still was giving her a splitting headache. Amy felt like she could cry from all the pressure. The only thing holding her from it was the hope that she would come out of this relatively unscathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment however that she noticed that she wasn't feeling anything. No stinging, no crawling, Not even being bumped into my little insect heads. Cautiously, she opened one eye. The bees were ignoring her entirely. They were all crawling in the flowers, looking to suck up as much nectar from them as possible. Amy let out a harsh breath of air before letting a pained fit of hysterical laughter leave her mouth. She shook all over as her situation finally sunk in. She was trapped. There was literally nowhere else she could go. If she stepped forward, she would likely crush one of the bees and the rest would descend upon her like the armies of hell. Death by a thousand bee stings was not the most appealing way of kicking the bucket. Before Amy could have a full on breakdown however, the bees all took off together and flew away behind her. Amy continued to stand perfectly still as the sound of buzzing gradually faded from her ears. At last silence reigned once more in the void. Amy looked down at her feet, saw the flowers were gone....and collapsed right then and there. At that moment, the voice came back to her. \"<b>Thank you very much little one. You have been most accepting of our interference. It seems we were right to chose you. We will now bestow you the gift of our race. Use it well and remember what you have done here. Goodbye</b>\". The whiteness faded to darkness and the ground beneath Amy fell away, leaving her tumbling though nothing. Amy Rose couldn't summon the energy to care at this point. All she wanted was a rest...yes...a nice long rest to forget everything...rest....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just as the world around her began to disappear entirely, Amy could feel her eyes fluttering open in a reluctant manner. As her vision came back to her, she realised that she was still in darkness, but this darkness had form and substance. It wasn't just endless void. There were walls with cupboards and picture frames against them. To the left was a window that gave off a dull glow as some of the light from outside it seeped in. As the seconds ticked by, Amy's vision started to adjust to the new surroundings and with relief, Amy recognised the room as her bedroom. This was it. The ordeal was over. She didn't have to worry anymore. She was safe. She sighed with a mixture of frustration and peace as she laid her head back against her fluffy pillows and rolled onto her side under the covers of her bed. \"What the heck was that all about?\" She whispered to herself. \"A dream? But it felt so real.\" Amy tried thinking back to what had happened in that white void, but already the memories were escaping her at that moment. She kept running them through her mind repeatedly over and over to make sure they remained with her. The white void. The voices. The illusions. The pain. She tried to hold on as hard as she could to those memories. But then a small yawn reminded her that she couldn't stay awake much longer. Eventually she had to give in and let sleep take hold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she rested her head against the pillows, her eyes drifted shut, her brain slowed to a crawl, the energy disappeared from her body and within seconds Amy had been claimed by dream land, leaving her lying limply on her bed in the dead of night. Her small, attractive body was almost entirely devoid of life as she lay there. By outward appearances she appeared to be a well laid and dressed corpse. If not for her rhythmic and deep breathing, one would be mistaken for believing she was one. It would be unlikely that she would move much for the rest of the night. However as her slumber continued into the night, her gold bracelets wrapped around her wrists began to shimmer in the darkness. Then they seemed to glow brightly for a few seconds as if they were reflecting some bright and powerful light. But there were no lights on anywhere in the house. The glow continued to grow in intensity and a small tingling feeling made it's way from the rings into Amy's wrists. This feeling continued up her arms, into her hands, across her chest, up her face, down her stomach, over her hair, around her thighs, to the very tips of her ears, down past her legs until it finally reached the end point at her feet and toes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, the tingling dulled and the glow also faded from the bracelets. It was not apparent yet at this point in time what had caused the glowing or what it meant, but if one looked closely they would note that something appeared to be inscribed on both the bracelets...a message which had not been there before tonight. However since nobody else was awake or near by, nobody could read what it said and thus the night went on completely undisturbed. There was one other thing that happened in the night however. In her snoozing, Amy Rose had slowly wrapped her right arm around her and was rubbing her face against it. Then in a brief instant of time, her lips reached out and planted a kiss on her pillow. Nothing appeared to change at this, however Amy would find it more difficult after that to find a comfortable spot on her bed as she rolled and wriggled about beneath covers. She had no idea what was in store for her when she woke up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Morning broke through the dead of night as the sun pierced the inky night sky and illuminated the ground below with a flood of light that only increased in intensity as it rose higher and higher above the land. Nearly all the shadows that could be seen were quickly devoured by the blinding light of day and the world was once again filled with warmth and energy. The sun was even managing to penetrate the curtains of the house of Amy Rose. The sweet little girl herself was still fast asleep and wrapped up in her covers. She probably could feel the heat of the sun's rays upon her slowing heating her up, but nonetheless her eyes remained closed. Last night's events had taken a lot out of her it seemed. The heat was beginning to get to her however and thus she rolled over to try and get her body out of the sun's path. But she ended up rolling too far and before she knew it she was laying face down on the ground beside her bed with a throbbing pain on her forehead. \"OW!\" She exclaimed in anger. She had no excuse to lie in now. Grudgingly she lifted her body off the floor and slowly brought herself to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt like she ached all over and her forehead pain wasn't doing her any favours. She leaned back, stretching her arms out wide and groaning with the amount of effort she was putting in. \"UUUUGGHHH...Chaos this hurts so much.\" She rubbed the spot on her forehead slowly. It hurt to touch so Amy decided to wet it to sooth the pain. Sticking her fingers against her lips, she coated her finger tips in her saliva and ran them across her bump. As she rubbed it however, she failed to notice something odd. After she had dipped her fingers in drool, Her bracelets shimmered more than would be expected from this level of light almost as if they were glowing with power. Not even a second later, her head had slowly risen upward. The carpet fibres beneath her folded away as her feet took up more space on the floor. Her pyjamas had tightened against her body, giving her an almost skintight appearance in her night wear. Amy however noticed none of these things. She was too busy focusing on the pain she was feeling which thankfully had been dulled slightly by a warm, pulsating feeling that came as quickly as it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting her head back in the game, Amy walked over to the closet to get dressed. As she went to removed her pyjama top, she found that her head was struggling to get through the hole more than usual. \"Ghh. Come on!\" After much struggling, she finally managed to get it off and followed suit with her bottoms soon enough. Then once she was finished getting undressed, she got together her usual array of clothing for the day. Some white panties, a matching white bra, white gloves, a lovely red dress with white highlights, her fitting red and white walking boots with white socks and her red hair band. She at least had a bit of an easier time getting herself dressed into her day clothes but everything still felt tighter than normal. She knew she would have to investigate this later, but for now she walked over to the mirror to admire how she looked. Amy Rose smiled in a self assured manner as she looked over her rather breath taking attire before her. \"Fitting for a breathing taking girl wouldn't you say?\" she said to nobody. She liked to psych herself up in front of the mirror when no-one else was around. \"One day Sonic will see me for who I am and he'll be absolutely enchanted by me. You're a star Amy and you know it. Why thank you. Heh. I had a feeling I was.\" And as she stood there talking to herself, she blew her own reflection a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the moment that the bracelets around her arms started to glow with that familiar shine once more. Only this time Amy noticed it since she was staring at her reflection. \"What the?\" She look down at her bracelets to confirm what she was seeing with her own eyes. The bracelets glowed for one or two seconds more before returning to normal. Amy raised an eyebrow and was just about to say something along the lines of \"What the hell?\" before the warm feeling from before flooded over her body with a great force. She could soon feel her body being squeezed all over. Her chest was being smothered by the fabric of her dress and her feet felt similarly choked by her boots' inner lining. Her hands felt really tight inside her gloves too. It felt like her own clothes were trying to strangled her. \"Ughh\" she groaned at the feeling \"So...tight...\". When she look back in the mirror again, she could clearly see that her head was just one or two inches above the top edge of it. \"Did....did I just have a growth spurt?\".</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy looked over her body once more as the weight of what she had just witnessed hit her. She hadn't just had a growth spurt. She had grown beyond the height of a normal hedgehog. By her estimate, she had to be just under seven feet tall now. Her clothes were already starting to act like a straitjacket. As she turned herself around to get a look at her behind, she could feel the fabric and leather rubbing hard against her skin and fur. The creaking and stretching noises her clothing made didn't give her much confidence to move about and she let out small moans every time her clothing struggled against her. \"oooh...uuhhh...darn these clothes. Amy also noticed that because her clothes we hugging her form so tightly, it accentuated her chest size. She blushed at this as she didn't want to attract attention to herself too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to examine her unbelievably expanded figure in the mirror, she pondered how this could have happened to her. She remembered about the void world and the trials from last night but she had assumed it was just a bad dream. And besides how did those voices even make her like this to begin with? \"Wait\" she said to herself suddenly. \"My bracelets glowed just before I grew. Maybe they have something to do with it!\" Amy checked her bracelets and sure enough they were the only item of clothing on her that weren't threatening to cut off circulation in her body. Upon closer inspection, Amy also noticed that the bracelets had an inscription engraved into both of them. The one on her left was written in a language she had never seen before in her life, but the one of her right she could only just make out in English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe message read; \"This gracious power is gifted to thee, who prove themselves passionate and motherly. Let thy lips touch in passion and receive the prize, which be a change in perspective as well as size\". Amy looked at the words in utter disbelief and then back up into her reflection. \"So those voices did do something to me\". Amy looked at her gloves, then at her boots and back to her bracelets. She tried to take them off her wrists but every time she moved them up her hands, they kept catching on her hand flesh. \"Knowing my luck the rings are probably shrinking to keep themselves jammed on me. I knew I should have taken those off before bed.\" Then one of the words on the engraving caught her attention. \"'Let thy lips touch in passion'...Does that mean I'm going to grow every time I kiss?!?\" To test things out, Amy brought her hand up to her face and kissed the fabric on her glove. Sure enough the process began anew and the bracelets glowed a shimmering gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tightness in her chest and feet began to start up again as her body grew beyond a size anyone could have predicted. The pain  running through her body felt even tighter than before and Amy was sure something was going to give. As the energy pulsed along her body and her clothes were stretched to their limit, Amy could hear the groans and moans of her attire as it seemed to be on the edge of it's capacity. Then a small ripping sound could be heard. Amy looked down at her gloves and saw that they were splitting at the seams. Tufts of pink fur began to show through as more tears started cropping up. Amy let out a pained moan and looked in the mirror to find that her panties were on full display for the world to see. She had grown so much that her dress was nearly small enough to be a toddler's compared to her size. It was at this point however that Amy's growth finally lost steam and she thankfully stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was both confused as to why that would be the trigger and a bit upset that it would mean she'd be unable to kiss her friend Sonic without growing even larger. \"Why the hell did this have to be me? Why of all the people on this planet did it have to be me?!\" she almost shouted at her reflection in shock and frustration. Without thinking, she punched her hand against the wall in anger. It created a sickening thud upon impact and when Amy removed her hand, she could see small indents where her fingers had landed. She immediately regretted her action and wrapped her arms around herself in shame. When She stood upright again, her head was mere millimetres below the ceiling of her bedroom. She knew she had to find a way to counteract this growing of hers, but she had nothing to fight it. Where could she go?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Compared to her other options, it seemed like the most difficult and improbable idea at hand. Not only having to fly all the way to reach the floating island, but having to find where on the entire planet the island was located seemed like too enormous a task for a little...well relatively little girl like her to accomplish. But Knuckles did have more experiences with unknowable powers than Tails did and he was guardian of perhaps the greatest power source on the planet for Chaos knows how long. Perhaps he would be able to offer some insight into how she may keep her newfound ability under control. Deciding to go with the spiritual option, Amy stepped towards the door of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stepped across the room, a very loud and concerning groaning sound came from the floorboards beneath her. She looked down at the floor before remembering that her enhanced size also came with enhanced weight. The second floor was not designed to take the weight of someone as heavy as her. She tried to make her next step as carefully as she could so as not to weaken the house's structure. This had the unfortunate side effect of causing her to not look where she was walking and she walked face first smack into the wall above the door frame. \"OOH!\" She groaned as the pain hit her like a basketball. She then decided to keep an eye on the ground beneath and in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking her head down so that she could move through the doorway, she slowly made her way out onto the landing of her house. This would be the part where she had to take most care. Amy made very slow and gentle steps along the landing, making sure to not break through the thin wood layer keeping her on the upper level. She was almost at the staircase when she realised that in all likely hood the steps would be too small for her feet to be supported properly. This was a very tricky situation she had found herself in. Amy thought long and hard about how she could proceed downstairs while causing the least amount of damage. Then an idea came to her. She was already way bigger than any normal hedgehog. What if she lowered herself over the banister and down to the ground floor? She would be very capable of landing on her feet at her size and the ground floor was much stronger than the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy decided to risk it and ducking downward to spread her centre of gravity, she slowly brought her left foot up and over the side of the banister. She didn't dare put her whole weight on the banister for fear that it would break beneath her. She simply placed her left hand on the railing, using it as an anchor while she shuffled around so that her back was overhanging the edge. Moving her right hand to the banister as well, she gripped both hands firmly against the wood. This was it. She thought about looking down but she stopped herself at the last minute. \"Worrying about my chances won't get me anywhere....well...here goes...\" She closed her eyes tightly and then forcefully pushed off the landing with her right foot. She felt a cracking of wood as she did so. Then with no legs to keep her on the second floor, she slipped backwards off the banister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrusting her judgement, Amy held on as tightly as she could. As predicted she swung forwards until her face was just in front of the barrier, her arms outstretched above her, holding her in place. All the weight in her body was now being forced down on her hands. She looked downwards in a cold sweat as the floor beneath her seemed a lot higher than it had once been. \"No turning back now\" she mumbled to herself. Straightening her legs out, she let go of the banister. Her legs were able to catch her fall just fine, acting as pistons to cushion her fall. When she looked up, she saw that the landing was still intact. \"Yes!\" She yelled with excitement. Then she made a mistake. She knelt down and kissed the ground in her glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realised only too late what she had done. The glow started up again. Amy quickly got back to her feet and darted for the front door. But when she went to push the door open, it did not budge. \"Handle!\" Amy shouted out to herself. Already the warm feeling was reverberating throughout her body once more. Her body expanded and grew with just as much energy and power as before. It seemed like this power was never ending. But her clothes did not share this attribute and this growth spurt was the last straw. With a sickening rip and crumpling, Amy's dress split in half with the skirt section sliding down to cover her panties once more, while the top half just barely shielded her chest from the eyes of others. Her Boots also couldn't take the strain and they split apart at the sole. Her furry toes slowly poked through the leather and made more tears as they continued to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's gloves by now were almost completely torn to shreds with thin strands of wool connecting some of the bits together and only a few finger tips still attached. Amy swore under her breath as she tried to get a grip on the handle which by this stage was more like a screw head compared to her giant hands. Thankfully she didn't rip off the handle in frustration and after some fiddling, she finally was able to open it. The outside world was mere feet away. Amy Rose sighed with relief. Maybe she would be able to get through this without getting so much as a scratch on her house. She quickly crawled over to the door and forced herself through into the sunlight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy squinted her eyes as she angled her head and chest through the door, into the great outdoors. The feeling of the wind blowing against her face, the warm sun bathing her in light. She was only a few feet away from freedom. She had just managed to force her larger chest through the door and was moving to make her exit when suddenly she felt her front being yanked back. She tried again to drag herself forwards, but it seemed there was no budging her. She looked back at the door and found that her rather sizeable behind had caught in the door frame and was in danger of being wedged in. \"...rats\" she muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Amy faced a dilemma. Her butt was not going anywhere fast and the only way she'd be able to leave the house now would be if she weakened the structural integrity of the door frame. But could she afford to damage the front of her own house? If she did find a way to keep this power under control then she would need a house to sleep in when it would be over. However at this point it was unlikely that she would ever get back to normal if she didn't find Knuckles and seek out his advice. After an agonising minute of thinking, Amy decided to test her strength a tiny bit, just to see if the door could handle her buxom. She dragged, forced and squeezed her body around the door frame as hard as she could. Surprisingly enough however, the door frame did not break no matter how hard she struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I wouldn't have been able to break out anyway\" Amy muttered to herself in a stressful manner. \"What do I do?\" She held her head in her hands as she racked her brain for an answer \"What do I-\". It was at that moment that Amy had a brain wave. She had this power of growth. Why not use it to bust her way through the door frame? Amy was incredibly reluctant at first to use her ability, but as the seconds ticked by and her options seemed to dwindle away in her head, the growing option made more and more sense. Amy lifted her hand in front of her face and stared at it. Just one little kiss, and she would be free. \"Yes...it makes sense...Here goes then.\" Amy licked her lips in preparation, and then firmly planted a kiss on her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so it started up again. The bracelets glowed as they always had and before long Amy could feel her whole body growing once more with great excitement. Her back stretched further and further out of the house and her hips widened accordingly. Her buttocks also expanded with great vigour too, causing the door frame to creak and groan from all the pressure it was under. Amy could feel the warm and soothing power of her growth seeping into every inch of her body. But she knew she had to focus on getting out. Dragging herself forward with her fingers digging into the gravel, it wasn't long before Amy could hear the sound of splintering wood behind her. This only increased in intensity as she crawled further. It kept getting louder and louder until finally, CRACK! Amy found it so much easier to move forward. She did not waste any time and she quickly dragged her legs out from the door frame before any more damage could be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Amy looked behind her, she saw the door frame had split in half with both sides bent outward by her ass. Some bricks had also fallen loose too and these lay around the remains of the door frame. Amy was dissapointed at breaking her door frame, but this feeling was quickly over taken by a new found sense of freedom. She wiggled her behind freely as she lay there on the gravel path, as if doing a mini victory dance. \"Heh...that was actually kinda enjoyable\" Amy whispered to herself. She slowly lifted herself up off the ground and stood tall in the front garden in front of her house. To her surprise, her eyes were just about level with the bottom of the windows on the second floor. \"Wow. I didn't think I grew that much\". Amy looked at her hands once more. The fabric left on them was bare bones. Her cuffs and where her fingers met her palm were all that remained. Amy also noticed that her boots had been completely ripped apart by her growth with only the collar still around her ankle. Thankfully her red dress, as ripped apart as it was, still somewhat covered her more modest areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving established that she was basically okay, Amy examined her surroundings to see if anyone had noticed her. Strangely enough nobody else was around to see her. \"Maybe they're all asleep\" Amy wondered. \"Oh well. At least I won't have to deal with massive crowds.\" Amy stepped off her garden and walked out onto the main pathway outside her house. It used to take her at least 12 steps at her normal size, but now it only took 3 to reach the path. Amy was also surprised by this and had to remind herself her size meant larger strides. The dirt beneath her feet felt like sand at her size too. Amy tried not to focus on these things and instead headed off down the path in search of Knuckles.</span></div></div>",

This in and of itself was pretty much an impossibility given both her size, her rather bare bones attire and the fact that she was walking out in the open on a public foot path where anybody could see her. She tried to not let it bother her as she walked, but soon enough the possibility of being found and thought of as a monster began to plague her mind. She knew she likely wouldn't be able to stay out of the eyes of the public for long especially given how easy it would be to use her power to grow bigger even on accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut...why did she need to hide herself anyway in that case? This growth power of hers seemed to be pretty much unending. She'd had 4 growth spurts from memory so far and none of them had decreased in potency from the last. Amy wondered if this power went on for infinity. It wouldn't make sense for the voices to give her a power that would be useless after a few tries after all. She could easily just grow so big that it wouldn't matter if people saw her or not and she'd easily be able to deal with anyone who threatened her. She could make entire armies, Nay, whole countries bow to her might. She could force the entire world to serve her needs and nobody would be strong enough to stop her. She could become a goddess. Undefeatable. Unstoppable. All powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shook her head sharply. \"No. No. It's not right. I'm no goddess. I can't make thousands of people suffer just because I have this power. They shouldn't be powerless. They don't deserve to live in fear...I...I couldn't...\" Amy looked down solemnly at her feet. She imagined massive crowds running away from them in terror...being crushed effortlessly as she walked...dying as nothing more than insects...she closed her eyes, trying to take her mind off those thoughts. \"As long as I don't grow any larger, nothing bad will happen.\" She told herself as she continued to walk. \"...But maybe it would be better if I stayed out of sight. Don't want to alarm anyone unneccesarily.\" With that, Amy stepped off the path and made her way deep into the forest that surrounded the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe branches and bushes that littered the forest were very heavy and would likely be too dense for a normal mobian to get through or even a human. Even Amy with her increased size and strength had a time trying to force her way through the undergrowth. From high up however, the forest seemed rather nice and quiet. Of course Amy didn't have to focus on getting engufed by greenery so she had plenty of time to admire her surroundings. The trees stood tall above her and their leaves created a rippling green shimmer from the light above. It looked like a kind of green ocean in the sky. The soft rustling of the leaves also helped to put her mind at ease after her unpleasant thought process from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, she could hear the sound of running water. She knew that there was a river running through this forest but she had never seen it with her own eyes before. She forced her way through the trees in the direction of the noise, making sure not to knock them over with her strength. It look a lot of effort and delicacy, but soon enough Amy emerged from the trees and found herself at the water's edge. The water made this place even more beautiful than before. Amy was about to take another step, when she felt itchy in places. She look down over her body and realised that she was covered in leaves from the trees. She tried to brush the off as best she could, but the leaves still stuck to her fur. Eventually she decided to just wash them off in the river. Stepping carefully into the cool, spine tingling water felt amazing to Amy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the middle of the river after stepping in to clean herself better, the water line only came up to her waist. Amy should have expected this at this stage, but for some reason it still surprised her how much her size affected her interacting with the world around her. Amy promptly got to work cleaning the leaves and twigs off her fur, taking care to not rip her already tattered and barely functional wardrobe. However as she continued to clean herself, she suddenly felt an odd feeling in the back of her mind. Something didn't seem right. It wasn't long before Amy realised what that was. There were no animals about anywhere. It seemed odd that there would be no animals at all in the forest especially on  a hot day like today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Amy could ponder the implications of this further however, she spotted a dark shape moving in the water. It appeared to be heading in her direction. Amy quickly shifted out of the way of the shape and just as she moved, a large splash was made just beside her. Amy's eyes narrowed. Something or someone was hunting her. She looked into the water again for any sign of her attacker, but there was nothing to be seen. She quickly decided to make a run for land and tried her hardest to fight the water as she waded towards the river bank. She was feet away from it before a sharp, stabbing feeling made itself known in her right ankle. She groaned and shouted in pain as she fell forwards into the shallow water. She thought about getting back up again but almost immediately after, a large, stoney weight suddenly flopped down on her back, holding her in place. Whoever this attacker was, they sure were heavy.</span></div></div>",
