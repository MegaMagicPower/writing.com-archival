She he told me to prepare for your possible return. He clarified that  I was only to obey the one called \"Tails\", and not to obey you. In fairness, I would've struggled to tell the difference without your grandstanding, but I think my Master knew you would do that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, Fiona. I can reprogram your mind with ease.\" He frowned. \"This will take but a few minutes. THen we shall enslave all of your former friends too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to do that, you will have to remove the collar.\" Fiona smiled. Miles paused- He'd equipped each collar with a mental shield to block out any attempts to free or steal his slaves via telepathy or magic, the sources he would expect. He had not expected anyone using technology. He'd constantly looked down on his counterpart for valuing science over magic, but now that science had turned his own creations against him, and he had no way to fix that without putting himself in striking distance. \"And imagine what will happen to you when you're in striking distance and my regular mind wakes up. SHe'll probably tear off that rather nice dick of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona picked up a stun gun, and pointed it at him. \"I belong to Master Tails, and he entrusted me with making sure he was safe during the night. Now, go back to sleep. Your body needs rest, after all, and if you don't... I'll make you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You forget, I still have my powers, and I will-\" Miles began to rant, only to be zapped in the head and reduced to a twitching lump on the floor. Fiona walked over to him and picked up up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you talk too much.\" She smiled, putting him in the tank for one of Tails' machines and locking it. \"That was designed to contain people like you, according to Master. You can't use warping abilities or spells, and there's no enough room for a Warp Ring inside it.\" She walked over to the controls. \"Now, since Master will be going back to his body, I can do whatever I like with this one until you tell me what it is that you've done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, fake-Master.\" She smirked. \"So, tell me what you did to Master's body, or I'll start...\"</span></div></div>",

Each girl took her place, all of them snuggling together. Bunnie grabbed Fiona and began to massage her breast with a surprising level of experience, then vixen squealing with delight. Alicia quickly had Sally brought to her, and began to fondle her seductively.

His body was just like Sonic's but with green instead of blue. Two large scars lay on his abdomen and produce a funny sensation when Tails touched them, he never had this type of scars but they add an air of bad boy to him. He gained an exaggerated pointy tooth that make his smile look mischievous. He now wear a black leather jacket with flame designs on the arms. Now he can comprehend why Scourge always wears it, not only looks cool but also was really confortable to wear. He also had black and green boots with silver details feel strange to use since Scourge almost never wash them; \"now thats a thing i will change\" thinked Tails. Lastly were his red sunglasses that he was amazed as they actually do not interfere with his vision, they just make everything more red but not enough to affect his sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails was delighted with his new body, it feel awesome and powerfull and the idea that he was as fast as Sonic make him love it even more. He would definitely enjoy the rest of his life as a handsome hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turn around and said: \"Im no longer Tails, now call me Scourge the Hedgehog. Hail to the king baby hahaha, i always wanted to said that.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure are enjoying this, right \"\"Scourge\"\"?\"<br>\r\n\"You have no idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, now i can get back to my body?\"-said Mighty.<br>\r\n\"Sure, go on\"</span></div></div>",

He had been unnecessarily rough with her, every bit as much a brute in the bedroom as he was on the battlefield. She stood up, and limped to the bathroom, breathing shallow, and turned the shower on. Everything felt unclean, ad he had to wash it all away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is sex always like this?\" He murmured. As if in response, one of Fiona's memories flashed into his mind. He saw, through her eyes, Fiona lying down on a bed, with Sonic on top of her. He gently caressed her form, rubbing it all over, before he mounted her and began to slowly thrust his hips, sending shockwaves of pleasure up and down her spine. Immediately, the difference became obvious. Scourge had been all take, no give, whereas Sonic was more focused on making <i>her</i> feel good. Even if the knowledge that Sonic and Fiona had sex did annoy him, at least he understood the concept a little more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got out of the shower on shaky legs, and began to dry himself, glancing at his 'borrowed' face in the mirror. Something seemed a little off, and he parted the fur around her eye to expose bruised, purple skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get this?\" He mused. Fiona's memory came to his aid again, showing a flash of an enraged Scourge lashing out at everyone and everything around him. He had no idea whether the strike was deliberate or not, but he didn't seem all that sorry for her. \"Oh dear... What do you see in him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he didn't get a response.

I decided to take the time to get to know you a little.\" She smiled, as her image floated out of the screen and grew to Mobian size, floating beside her. \"My name is Nicole. I was barely a person last time we spoke but I want you to know that I understand your situation. I know what it's like to be the outcast. To be used by people that you can't fight back against. To be faced with punishment for what you've done, even if you don't necessarily deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, thanks... But I'm not sure I get what you're getting at. I heard about that whole \"Iron Nicole\" thing. You were literally brainwashed. Everything I did, I chose to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more than one way to brainwash someone. And charismatic individuals who know your weaknesses can brainwash you just by talking to you. They keep lying, and feeding you want you want to hear, and twisting the truth, until suddenly, you don't act like yourself anymore. Does that sound familiar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yes...\" SHe looked down. \"He gained my trust by pretending to be Sonic. By the time I realised the deception, it was too late... I'd already given him everything he needed to get inside my head. He's smarter than he looks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. So is Sonic.\" Nicole smiled faintly. \"But, as much as Amy might disagree, as will Sally when she's had a few, he's not perfect. And he knows that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Sally drinks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only on special occasions.\" The lynx began to grin. \"She's a very loving drunk. Be good and I might show you the pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, incentive. Anyway, what's this about Sonic not being a bottomless void of ego?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't take failure well. He gets angry and does what he can to fix it, but he's also bearing the burden of being the beacon of hope for everyone else. If he's seen to be depressed, or upset, it has a dramatic negative effect on morale. That's why he gets so enraged when one of us is hurt or endangered. Because he needs us. He needs us to help him cope.\" Nicole explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why tell me this?\" Fiona asked. \"You know I have a personal problem with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's misplaced. You, Sonic, and Mighty were all together in Prison Complex 457-A. However, Nic rescued you from Prison Complex 457-<i>B</i>, a separate building several miles away. Everyone that was recaptured was moved to a different location. And I can tell you that because one of them is a regular jail, and the other is a research facility where Robotnik built Auto-Automata.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know this... how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I have access to the FF database, and 457-B wasn't located until after the war, when the shields were down.\" Nicole replied. \"Before we move on, Fiona, I want to suggest something to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop living in the past. Stop letting yourself be controlled by what came before. Forget all of this revenge and rage and just... live your life. Revenge isn't worth fighting for. All it begets is more vengeance, as more people come after you instead, and you end up always running, alone and constantly looking over your shoulder. It consumes you, destroys you. And often, you find you make that mistake. You hurt someone who didn't deserve it, you break a family apart, and suddenly, you have nothing left to live for, nothing outside of your now fulfilled vendetta, and that family are coming after you to make you pay.\" Nicole laid her hands on Fiona's shoulders, giving her a smile, before hugging her. The lynx's hologram form felt warm and tough. \"The past doesn't define who you are. It just gives you the starting point for who you're going to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I need some time to think.\" Fiona curled up a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we have a little R&amp;R? I'll keep up your search for Nic, and we can go and have a little fun. You need a new outfit and I want to experience more things about life, and it'd be nice to just live like normal people for a few hours, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\" The vixen stood up. \"This thing does ride up in all the wrong paces. I can't imagine Tails was comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, but now I'm just imagining him in his regular body wearing that.\" She stifled a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hell, that's an image.\" The vixen smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, look!\" She waved her hand, a hologram of Tails wearing the outfit appearing beside her. The two of them began to laugh, leaning up against each other. \"Oh, oh, watch this!\" She gestured again, the hologram taking on a more coquettish pose. Fiona gave in to a full-on belly laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to get on fine.\" She said, giving her new friend a one-armed hug, as the hologram faded. \"Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

Her face was bruised, her distinctive larger fang knocked out, blood trickling down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really about reputation?\" She growled. \"Just because I happened to get some better marks than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, kinda. You're still respected.

Seizing her chance, Nic sprang forward, and rammed her foot into his knee, forcing him to crumple to the floor. The gun bucked, a shot firing into the ceiling. Fiona charged up, and kicked him hard, right between the legs. He gave a squeak, and crumpled to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiona?\" Nicole appeared beside her. \"Aren't you wearing steel-toed boots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" She winced. \"I'm not even a guy and I felt that.

They went to go and fight Scourge, and I stayed here. I made friends with Nicole, and she traced your life signal and led us both here. \" Fiona replied. \"Really glad I didn't stop to get a new outfit first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing looks pretty good on ya, to be fair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?

So I can have a clear conscience. And Nicole showed me that revenge isn't a worthwhile endeavour. Nack just proved that point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, best of luck. I'm proud of ya.\" She smiled. \"Still... I could use a doctor about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get you home.

Or they could, much to Tails' disgust, head towards Scourge. Yes, he was a womanizing jackwad with little to no chance of being sympathetic... But that would also mean Miles wasn't hard to find, and an increase in brain power was always a plus in figuring out just what was going on with the both of them.

This means that she can't fly bringing her to physical limitation #2 (In This Storyline, Tails Will Be Unable To Fly Or Use Her Tails Like Extra Arms).

She then starts to put both her finger and  tail in her vagina before taking it out. She decides to ultimately stick to the fingering and starts to rapidly move her finger in and out before finally getting that rush she felt before. With one last finger movement, she feels a humongous wave of pleasure and feels a white, steaming liquid rush out of her vagina and onto the floor. Tails then sits there silently, half due to tiredness, half due to still feeling the pleasure. After a while, she leaves the room to put the TV somewhere safe to present it to Sonic. As she goes to get the TV however, she lost her concentration and tripped over the TV, breaking it and wasting all her work.

As she checked a phone, so far things were normal, although she was getting advertisements for some kind of sight with a woman showing off a decidedly seductive look. It reminded her a lot of Rouge. But Tails still had to check the TV. She shuffled over, slowly poked her head inside... And smiled. It was still together. She pulled out and gently closed the door and sighed before considering what she would do just to wait... Would she start practicing building stuff? After all, it'd get her used to her new body... And then there was what she was doing earlier... It felt so incredible! But then again, she might be caught... But she could make an excuse of some sort given what she told Sonic the day before.</span></div></div>",

The red vixen looked about ready to throw herself into the fight, but she couldn't let her do that. Fiona in the world the twin-tailed vixen had come from was a fighter, and a good one at that. She'd probably be able to do this. But this Fiona? She didn't look like she'd been in a single fight. Ever. Her friends in this world were ordinary people. Michelle didn't even know if she had powers now, she realised...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the blonde knew how to fight. She was experienced and smart, and she would have to do this on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiona...\" She said, backing toward the door.

She looked toward the squirrel, fixing the blade with a determined glare, before stepping forward. She began to walk closer, until she reached the outer edge of the weapon's aura. Walking into it felt like trying to force her way through gale force winds, with the icy cold sting of the deadly blade thrown in for good measure. Still, she pushed onward, forcing her way through as she tried to reach Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fight this. It is for the best.\" The monotone voice spoke up over the howling winds, as a particularly strong wave shunted Michelle back a foot or two. Growling, the blonde vixen planted her foot to steady herself, refusing to stand down as she pushed back against it, even as she felt her clothing start to tear and her eyes stinging, she perservered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle swore she saw a look of shock on the mindless squirrel's face as she finally closed the gap, standing face to face with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of my friend!\" Michelle roared, as Sally's stolen arm raised the weapon to swing down at her. She moved faster than normal. Not even the trained fighter Sally in her world moved as quick as this possessed one did, and she had no room to dodge. If she relaxed her stance for even a moment, the aura would pick her up and throw her across the room again, spoiling all of her hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way to avoid the blade, she could only have faith that she could survive this the way her old self would, bringing both of her tails up over her head to shield herself, willing them to harden the way they always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain sliced through her, from the tip of her tail, all the way up her spine, as the force of the blow crumpled her to her knees... but her shield held firm. She sighed with relief internally: She still had her powers in this body. And that meant she was faster and stronger than the average Mobian...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpringing back up, her fingers closed around the surprised squirrel's arm, and her claws dig into her pressure points, as her tails braced against the flat of the blade, pushing against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>No!</b>\" Sally's voice screamed, as her arm spasmed in pain, fingers opening involuntarily, as her namesakes pushed it aside.

At first the two were uncomfortable but along the way they began to enjoy it a lot more than they expected and outright loving it by the end. \"Maybe...we could do this...again sometime.\" Raven was speaking with clear exhaustion in his breath as Pinto could only nod back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of heavy breathing Pinto was able to get up and put her new dress on so that anyone who could've heard what they said earlier and weren't old enough to know what sex was wouldn't ask too many question, at the same time Raven went to open the door, only being able to open part of it which was enough that he could stick his head out. \"Sammie we're done, can you come back online in here?\" Without a moment of waiting the door completely opened making Raven fall face first to the door in surprise. \"Sorry about that, are you alright Raven?\"  Raven only gave a thumbs up to signal so as he got up. \"Well I hope you both had a great time but unfortunately you will have to return to the male side Raven as it's now Flare's (male Blaze) time while Saffron (female Charmy) goes to the male side. Have a wonderful day!\" \"You too!\" Raven shout before winking at Pinto and walking back to his proper side, everything was now in place and all they had to do was wait...</span></div></div>",

Now normally they wouldn't be attracted to just any male because of their gender alone but the soap in the showers had nanites within them that would make the subject more aroused the more they used it.

Surely it'd be easier to enhance a girl than turn me into a woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd think that to be the case, but no.\" Miles shook his head. \"It's much harder to cram my supreme intellect into their tiny brains than it is to give you the personality quirks of your friends and give you the appropriate form... and besides, I've always been something of a narcissist.

But then again, thanks to a few minutes of thinking, even if it may have been something Miles did, but she was in the mood for women as opposed to men... And of course, she might be able to at least collect Rosy the Rascal, Fiona, and Scourge... Later, anyway. Right now, she needed to make a proper decision.</span></div></div>",

It was like she was an absolute expert in anything she was asked to do... But the rest of the time, she was an utter airhead. It was a little confusing... Would she go see her husband when he got back, or would she just let go and accept that she was this convenient for the time being? Sure, it was something he might have over looked...

A force that can protect the planet- And to be honest, I'm tired of you fighting Eggman.

Instead, she merely had to sit down as the base refitted itself into a far more... Freedom Fighter-based design. The colors were brighter, and choices in furniture were far more casual, while entire rooms, typically rooms intended for roboticization and Badnik manufacture were remade into meeting rooms, infirmaries, and even extravagant guest rooms among other things.

Asking Eggman to be roboticized at some point- After all, she had to atone for what she did, opposing the one true ruler of the world. Yet soon enough, Eggman called them inside, cackling as he had his moment, roboticizing Sonic... Only to end up with what Melissa had properly created before restoring Sonic. As Eggman finished, Melissa asked about being Roboticized. Eggman responded.</span></div></div>",

Yet soon enough, it was becoming clear that Fiona quite literally refused to listen- Her utter hatred for the rotund scientist prevented her from doing anything involving the Eggman Empire... Melissa started pondering what to do before shaking her head as she pulled Fiona towards the inside of the facility. The others were surrounding the two vixens, glaring at Fiona with black and red optics. Soon enough, she gently laid Fiona inside a chamber before jumping back as the chamber trapped Fiona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prepare Fiona for...\"</span></div></div>",

Her form seemed to be even more attractive than even the likes of Rouge the Bat- It was something that could charm just about anyone... And then there was her new body language- It utterly oozed seduction of some sort as she got up and wiped her brow, confident at what she had done as her chest gently jiggled with each breath.

His hands right on her breasts as she appeared VERY annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, would you PLEASE get off me?!\" She growled at him. Looking around, he had somehow wandered onto a side street, nobody else around at all... Tails apologized profusely, but found his hands stuck fast to the part of them that were on the skin of her breasts. He tugged and pulled as Rouge winced. \"What'd you do, get superglue on your gloves?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails shook his head, frowning and trying to pull his hands out of the gloves...  But it was as if the fabric of the gloves had passed through Rouge's skin, his fingertips now inside of her! His body began to glow the same color as the light from his dream. \"W-what's going on?!\" He exclaimed as Rouge struggled, but began to become subdued...  As Tails was drawn deeper into Rouge's breasts, his arms now elbow deep into her as his head passed into her cleavage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would have been an odd sight to anybody passing along...  Tails struggled and kicked, his body getting pulled into Rouge, but it only served to have him slip into her faster...  As Rouge passed out once his legs finished sinking in. He awoke already walking along, hearing a voice in his head. *Can't believe Tails would just grope me and run...* He felt an odd bouncing on his chest as he did so, and an annoyance at himself. He seemed to have memories of the time before he woke up...  Tails had disappeared after knocking her over and copping a feel...  *Can't believe even Tails would do something like that...*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails twitched his limbs as the voice gasped at that. *W-What was that?* It asked as he took over the walking for her, and it settled down. *OK...  What's going...?* He found himself asking himself...  When he caught his reflection in a window. There was Rouge, staring back at him. She blinked when he blinked...  Moved her hand and waved when he did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*What am I doing...?* The voice asked as Tails spoke using Rouge's voice. \"I...  I'm Rouge? What...\"  She blinked, frowning. The voice was confused by this statement. Of course she was Rouge...</span></div></div>",

Only to have Rouge's thoughts stumble a bit. *Why do I want to talk to myself? I must be going crazy...* Tails could tell she was willing her body to continue forward...  And he let her. He was silent in her mind until she got to her apartment... Where he took charge, looking into her mirror and sighing. \"Hey, Rouge...  Its Tails.\" She said to herself...  Which only made her blink at how strange saying that felt. *Now what the hell am I doing...?* She thought as he continued to speak as her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For some reason, when I fell onto you...  I fell...  INTO you... Now I am you.\" Rouge began to feel frightened at this...  Why was she saying all this? It felt like her saying it... But it didn't stop feeling weird... Tails just frowned further at that... Rouge thought she was just going crazy, pretending to be Tails in the mirror for an unexplained reason. Just then, everything seemed to go hazy... Like he was seeing two worlds at once...  In the one world, the real world, Rouge was just talking to herself in the mirror. In the second world... Tails saw himself in the mirror, and the reflection did not match the body. Not in appearance or in movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm inside of you, Rouge.\" He said firmly as Rouge growled. \"Little perv...  Get out of me!\" Tails just sighed and shook his head at that. \"I would if I could, Rouge... But I'm glad you believe me now...\" He sighed as Rouge tried to turn away, but found herself unable to. \"Let me go! What are you doing?!\" She cried out as Tails 'tsk'ed. \"Rouge... I'm you. Completely...\" He said as Rouge's mental image shifted a bit...  And she suddenly found herself staring from the other side of the mirror rather than Tails. She tried to protest, but now when Tails made a movement, her own body was forced to follow. \"I can't do anything about it, Rouge... I'm sorry. But I'll treat you well!\" He said, though her voice and his mixed in their mind...</span></div></div>",
